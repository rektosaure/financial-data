[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.\nI would now like to pass to Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. Larry, please proceed.\n\nLaurence F. McGrath\n\nSenior Vice President of Business Development & Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CVS Health Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. I'm joined this morning by David Joyner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Newman, Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of the leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year.\nDuring this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release.\nDuring this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition. And you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. David?\n\nJ. David Joyner\n\nExecutive VP & President of Pharmacy Services\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we are pleased to report another quarter of solid results, once again reflecting the power of our diversified business and progress on becoming the most trusted health care company in America. In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted operating income of $3.5 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.60. In addition, for the third consecutive quarter, we are increasing our full year 2025 adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $6.55 to $6.65, up from our previous range of $6.30 to $6.40.\nOver the past 12 months, we have been intensely focused on executing against our commitments to our customers, partners, colleagues and shareholders. We are building momentum across the enterprise and feel a growing excitement about the opportunities ahead for CVS Health. We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished so far this year. While we are encouraged by our progress, we maintain a disciplined and cautious outlook as we position our business for another year of strong performance in 2026.\nThis transformation is clearly visible within our Aetna business where, after a challenging 2024, there is renewed bigger and optimism about the future. Steve, Katrina and the broader Aetna team are well on the path to ensuring this business is best-in-class. The Aetna team continues to drive impactful and exceptional results. Aetna is once again the industry leader amongst national payers for 2026 Medicare Advantage Stars Ratings even with CMS recently announcing that cut points for stars continue to become more challenging. Based on the current membership, we expect over 81% of our Medicare Advantage members will be in plans rated 4 stars or higher, with over 63% of them in 4.5 star plans, nearly double the industry average.\nThis result is not just a point of pride but another proof point in our ability to effectively collaborate across the enterprise allows us to deliver exceptional quality and service, drive down the cost of care, and remove friction from the health care system. We are still in the early stages of the 2026 annual enrollment period, but we remain confident that our thoughtful approach to our geographic footprint, benefit design and pricing positions us well for another year of recovery.\nIn my first year as CEO, I have pushed our team to act with urgency and focus as we execute on opportunities to improve our business. This means making thoughtful and difficult decisions, such as exiting our individual exchange business or taking advantage of market opportunities like our acquisition of the Rite Aid assets. In a similar way, as we outlined last quarter, we are moving with urgency to address pressures in Health Care Delivery.\nDuring the quarter, we recorded a $5.7 billion goodwill impairment within Health Care Delivery. I want to be clear that this business' performance in the quarter was in line with our most recent expectations. However, our decision during the quarter to temper Oak Street Health Clinic growth over the next few years was the primary reason for reporting this charge. Despite this update, value-based care remains a critical component of our strategy.\nThe reasons to believe in this business have not changed, but the marketplace is evolving and we are adapting our strategy to get financial performance back in line with our expectations. We understand the challenges at Oak Street Health and have taken actions to improve performance in both the near and long term. We continue to strengthen our Health Care Delivery business through investments in technology, a new leadership team and a fair and equitable contracts with our payer clients.\nTurning to Pharmacy Services. We're incredibly proud of the meaningful impact we've had on drug cost in this country. As you've seen with our recently announced IVF initiative with the administration, we are strong supporters of President Trump's focus on lowering brand prices in America. This is important for our patients, our customers and for our business model. By tackling branded pharmas and equitable pricing strategies that have left Americans carrying the financial weight of global drug [ interpatient ], the government is helping to relieve a long-standing burden on U.S. consumers and businesses.\nWe believe that over time, the administration's actions can create a new lower ceiling price in the U.S. in which PBMs will continue to negotiate and further reduce costs for their customers and consumers. This has been our job for more than 3 decades, and we have been tremendously successful at achieving durable results. We believe these actions are good for us, for our customers and for consumers, and we are encouraged to see the impact they may create for the industry.\nAs the leading health care consumer company, we've been working diligently for years to lead with greater transparency and savings for consumers at the pharmacy counter. We were at the forefront of this transition with more than 25 million members who benefit at the pharmacy counter from our lowest net cost through point-of-sale rebates. This includes our Aetna fully insured commercial members that we transitioned in 2019 and the benefit design we offer our own colleagues.\nTwo years ago, we continued our innovation leadership when we introduced our new TrueCost model, which guarantees a net cost for each individual drug, delivering drug pricing transparency for our clients and consumers. We are encouraged by recent announcements that others are following us on this path. We know that this is the transition that consumers want and is also important for the future of our business.\nWe're incredibly encouraged by the path Caremark is on. However, we acknowledge there are near-term market dynamics from a few of our client contracts that have resulted in a revision to our guidance and will impact our near-term growth rate. While incorporating this, as Brian will discuss later, we continue to expect meaningful growth in enterprise earnings next year. We are working diligently to recontract over the next few years and resolve this issue.\nImportantly, clients, including the most sophisticated buyers of pharmacy benefit services, continue to see the tremendous value we provide, as evidenced by another strong selling season. We have achieved new client wins of nearly $6 billion and are closing out another selling season with retention in the high 90s. I am incredibly bullish about the road ahead and believe we will continue to lead this industry given our unique advantages and insights.\nTurning to PCW. Our leadership is clear in the retail pharmacy market as we work towards a more sustainable and transparent future. Our deliberate strategic decisions, intentional investments, best-in-class drug purchasing and superior customer service have meaningfully improved our differentiated position in the market. Once again this quarter, CVS Pharmacy delivered solid performance, including pharmacy share gains.\nThis is a testament to the strength and scalability of our model as well as the commitment of our engaged colleagues. We play a critical role in improving the health of millions of Americans by providing convenient health services, including vaccinations. Our 9,000 pharmacies are the front door to our enterprise. They are a differentiator for our business and a force multiplier towards improving the health of the communities that we serve.\nFor CVS Health, being the most trusted health care company in America means improving health, simplifying care and delivering a quality experience every day. We do not take this responsibility lightly and it is this team's firm belief that we must drive the evolution of health care forward in the U.S. We have unique capabilities to achieve all of those goals. The strength of our diversified businesses continue to set us apart, enabling us to deliver strong results even in this dynamic environment.\nThe progress we've made this year is fueling momentum and our disciplined execution positions us for another year of strong performance in 2026. We are working to simplify health care and we're bullish about the opportunities we see to lower the cost of care and drive innovation. Our future is bright because of the work of our more than 300,000 colleagues who take care of their friends, families and neighbors and communities across our country. We look forward to sharing more on our longer-term plans at our Investor Day on December 9.\nWith that, I'd like to hand the call over to Brian. Brian?\n\nBrian O. Newman\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, David, and good morning. I will cover four key topics in my remarks. First, an update on our third quarter results. Then I'll discuss cash flow and the balance sheet. After that, I will provide an update on our revised financial outlook for the remainder of 2025. And finally, I'll wrap up with a brief discussion on high-level headwinds and tailwinds as we look ahead to 2026.\nAs David mentioned, we are pleased to report another quarter of solid performance and to deliver a third quarter in a row where we beat and raised expectations as we continue to focus on building a track record of consistent success. We improved our full year outlook for revenue, adjusted EPS and cash flow from operations and are building positive momentum as we close out the year.\nLet me start with highlights on our enterprise results in the quarter. Third quarter revenues achieved a new record of nearly $103 billion, an increase of approximately 8% over the prior year quarter driven by revenue growth across all segments. Adjusted operating income of approximately $3.5 billion increased approximately 36% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by an improvement in our Health Care Benefits segment. We delivered adjusted EPS of $1.60, an increase of nearly 47% from the prior year quarter. Finally, we generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $7.2 billion.\nTurning now to each of our segments. In Health Care Benefits, we generated nearly $36 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of over 9% from the prior year. This increase is primarily driven by our government business, largely related to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program. We ended the quarter with medical membership of approximately 26.7 million, which was flat sequentially and decreased approximately 445,000 members from the prior year quarter. This year-over-year decrease is primarily driven by declines in our individual exchange and Medicare product lines, partially offset by growth in our commercial fee-based membership.\nAdjusted operating income in the quarter was approximately $314 million, a substantial increase from the adjusted operating loss recorded in the prior year quarter. Our medical benefit ratio was 92.8%, a decrease of 240 basis points from the prior year quarter results of 95.2%. The change was driven by the favorable year-over-year impact of premium deficiency reserves, higher favorable prior period development and improved underlying performance in our government business.\nThese increases were partially offset by changes in the seasonality of the Medicare Part D program due to the impact of the IRA and the impact of higher acuity in the individual exchange product line. Our medical benefit ratio this quarter was impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to provider liabilities for matters dating as far back as 2018 and worsening individual exchange risk adjustment expectations based on the Wakely data. Each of these two items were roughly equivalent.\nMedical cost trends in the quarter remained elevated across all products but were modestly favorable relative to our expectations, primarily driven by our individual MA book. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was approximately 42.5 days, an increase of approximately 1.6 days sequentially, primarily driven by the partial release of premium deficiency reserves established in the first half of 2025 and as well as an additional day in the third quarter compared to the second quarter. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nShifting now to our Health Services segment. During the quarter, we generated revenues of over $49 billion, an increase of over 11% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation, partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements. Adjusted operating income in the quarter of approximately $2.1 billion decreased 7% from the prior year quarter primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements, partially offset by improved purchasing economics.\nPerformance in our Health Care Delivery business during the quarter was broadly in line with our expectations. Total revenues grew approximately 25% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impact of our exit from our CVS Accountable Care business earlier this year. This increase was primarily driven by patient growth at Oak Street and increased volumes at Signify. During the quarter, we made certain strategic changes in our Health Care Delivery business, including the decision to reduce the number of new Oak Street clinics we expect to open over the next several years.\nThese changes necessitated a quantitative assessment of the carrying value of goodwill in our Health Care Delivery reporting unit, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $5.7 billion during the quarter. We are focused on improving financial performance in our Health Care Delivery business. As discussed last quarter, we have and continue to take actions at Oak Street to enhance our operations.\nDuring the quarter, we completed a comprehensive review of our Oak Street clinic footprint. As David mentioned, this is core to our approach of evaluating each of our businesses, identifying strengths and making decisions to drive improved execution and performance. Following our review, we made the difficult decision to close underperforming clinics where we do not see a reasonable path to sustainable margins. To be clear, we view value-based care as a critical component to our Medicare strategy and expect the actions we are taking to support improved financial performance beginning next year.\nOur Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment delivered another strong quarter. We generated revenues of over $36 billion, an increase of nearly 12% versus the prior year quarter primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and increased prescription volume, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Revenues in the quarter increased over 14% on a same-store basis. Our retail pharmacy script share grew to approximately 28.9% as our emphasis on operational excellence and superior customer experiences enables us to benefit from pharmacy market disruption.\nSame-store pharmacy sales in the quarter grew nearly 17% compared to the prior year, driven by pharmacy drug mix and a nearly 9% increase in same-store prescription volumes. Same-store front store sales increased 150 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased approximately 7% from the prior year to approximately $1.5 billion. This decrease was primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in colleagues and capabilities. These items were partially offset by increased prescription volume.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated cash flows from operations of approximately $7.2 billion year-to-date through the third quarter. We have distributed approximately $2.6 billion in dividends to our shareholders year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We continue to meaningfully improve our leverage ratio, supported by our strong year-to-date performance and expect to make further improvement next year as we grow enterprise earnings driven by margin recovery in our Aetna business.\nShifting now to our revised outlook for 2025. We are increasing our full year 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $6.55 to $6.65, an increase of $0.25. This update reflects our third quarter performance and our revised expectations for the remainder of the year, which continue to maintain a prudent outlook on medical cost trends and macro factors. We now expect full year total revenues of at least $397 billion, an increase of nearly $6 billion driven by increases across all segments.\nIn our Health Care Benefits segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of approximately $2.72 billion at the low end of our guidance range, an increase of approximately $300 million reflecting our performance in the third quarter and improved expectations for the remainder of the year. We continue to project our full year 2025 medical benefit ratio at the low end of our Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income guidance range to be approximately 91%. This outlook continues to maintain a thoughtful and prudent view on medical cost trends through the remainder of the year.\nIn our Health Services segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of at least $7.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $240 million from our prior guidance. This update reflects our latest expectations for performance that David highlighted in his remarks. Importantly, we continue to make progress evolving our contracting and pricing models to respond and adapt to market dynamics. We are confident we're on the path to lead the evolution with our new TrueCost model, which guarantees a net cost of each individual drug driving, drug pricing transparency for our clients and members.\nThe outlook for our Health Care Delivery business remains largely unchanged. Lastly, in our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of at least $5.95 billion, an increase of approximately $270 million from our prior guidance. This increase reflects our performance in the third quarter and our revised expectations for the remainder of the year while continuing to maintain a prudent outlook for the rest of the immunization season and potential impacts to the consumer environment.\nIn aggregate, we now expect full year enterprise adjusted operating income to be in the range of $14.14 billion to $14.31 billion. We are also increasing our expectations for full year cash flow from operations to be in a range of $7.5 billion to $8 billion. Additionally, we now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be 25.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points. You can find additional details on the components of our 2025 guidance on our Investor Relations website.\nBefore we open the call up to Q&A, I also want to provide an update on some of the key headwinds and tailwinds for 2026. Consistent with past practice, we expect to provide formal 2026 guidance at our Investor Day in December.\nBeginning with our Health Care Benefits business, we expect another year of meaningful margin improvement at Aetna. This includes another year of progress in our Medicare Advantage business, supported by our disciplined approach to plan design and footprint in individual as well as repricing opportunities in our group business. We also expect a tailwind from our exit of the individual exchange business. Although our conversations with our Medicaid state partners continue to progress and this business has performed in line with our expectations this year, we are taking a cautious outlook in light of the broader pressures across the industry.\nIn our Health Services segment, we expect improvement in our Health Care Delivery business, primarily driven by Oak Street Health. In our Caremark business, we expect modestly lower growth as we continue our work to transition our contracts towards drug level pricing over the next few years. Altogether, we expect the segment to deliver low single-digit adjusted operating income growth next year.\nAnd in our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, we are encouraged by our strong performance this year and expect this momentum to continue into next year. While challenges, including reimbursement pressure and the impact of shifting consumer dynamics remain in this business, we currently expect the trajectory to improve relative to our long-term expectation of a 5% decline.\nI would also remind everyone that consistent with past practice, the impact of prior year reserve development and other out-of-period items should be removed when considering an appropriate baseline for bridging to 2026. As of the end of the quarter, these items contributed approximately $0.45 to our year-to-date results. Altogether and, after adjusting for these items, we currently expect a reasonable starting point for our 2026 adjusted EPS guidance to reflect mid-teens growth. We will provide formal guidance at our Investor Day on December 9.\nOverall, we are encouraged by the year-to-date performance of our diversified enterprise and are confident we are taking the right steps to position us for both near- and long-term success. We recognize the importance of establishing credible commitments and expect to continue this philosophy as we establish future financial targets.\nWith that, we'll now open the call to your questions.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the end of the prepared remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to pass the call to Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. Larry, please proceed.\n\nLaurence McGrath\n\nChief Strategy Officer, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health second quarter 2025 earnings call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. I'm joined this morning by David Joyner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Newman, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of the leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties.\nIn particular, those that are described in the cautionary statements concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. David.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we are pleased to report another consecutive quarter of solid results as we execute against our ambition of becoming America's most trusted healthcare company. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted operating income of $3.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.81. We again increased our full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.30-$6.40, up from our previous range of $6-$6.20. Our strong results and updated expectations reflect the power of our diversified business. We are seeing the impact of our intense focus on the execution within our Aetna and pharmacy businesses while managing incremental pressure in healthcare delivery. We are encouraged by our enterprise performance and revised outlook, especially in this very dynamic environment.\nAt the same time, we continue to maintain a prudent and respectful outlook for the remainder of the year, with clear opportunities for outperformance. Brian will provide specifics later in the call. As we focus on delivering against our financial commitments to you, we are also taking on the largest challenges in healthcare: affordability, access, and inconsistent care coordination. The breadth of these problems means that they can't be addressed with a fragmented, piecemeal approach. Instead, it requires holistic solutions implemented by companies with the necessary reach, capabilities, and focus to execute on them. CVS holds a unique position in healthcare with our diverse and scaled businesses, our national footprint of community health destinations, and the deep connections we have with more than 185 million consumers. We have unmatched reach and powerful insights that drive our innovation and differentiated solutions.\nTackling these challenges requires that each of our businesses be best in class. I'm pleased to report that we are making meaningful progress in the Aetna business. Our recovery has been a top priority. We realign the organization and strengthen our talent with a clear focus on creating distinction in the marketplace. We enhanced our operations using technology to automate and streamline processes that improve service and reduce friction for our members and healthcare professionals. We are starting to see the results of these efforts, delivering better experiences while also allowing us to better navigate this elevated utilization environment. But our work is not done. As we look ahead, we will maintain this intense focus, continuing to diligently execute against our margin recovery plan.\nWhile we are pleased with the improvements we are seeing at Aetna, we continue to see pressure in our healthcare delivery business, driven by higher medical benefit ratios at Oak Street. This is partially offset by continued positive performance at Signify Health. Value-based care remains a critical component for our Medicare Advantage strategy, as we know that it delivers better clinical outcomes, better patient experiences, and a lower total cost of care. We are working with urgency to further strengthen this business and ensure seniors can benefit from this industry-leading model. This includes improving operations through investments in technology, enhancing leadership with talent from across CVS Health, and improving our partnerships with our payer clients. We know that Oak Street capabilities are best in class and are taking the right actions to improve performance. Let me turn now to our pharmacy businesses.\nAt Caremark, we are delivering on our commitments to clients and members by doing what PBMs do best: adapting to client needs, driving down drug costs, and helping to deliver better access and outcomes. Managing trend remains the most important focus for our customers as they try to balance the benefit of new drug innovations and their higher cost. Our PBM is saving consumers and clients billions of dollars a year on drug costs, but we must continue to innovate and drive more savings. For example, our clients needed a solution as they experienced the impact of the rapid growth in the use of GLP-1s. Spend in this category for our employer clients has nearly doubled over the last two years and now represents 15% of their pharmacy costs. On 1 July, we took a significant step to create competition among manufacturers to lower costs in this drug category.\nWe used our unique capabilities to minimize friction, resulting in over 95% of the eligible members adopting a preferred formulary weight loss product. However, we know drug therapy alone is not enough to achieve the best outcomes. To address this, we offer a powerful weight management program that empowers patients to achieve greater weight loss than drug therapy alone. Importantly, our program participants on average achieve double-digit percent weight loss at 12 months, regardless of the drug they use. Our innovation, reach, and clinical capabilities differentiate us in the PBM marketplace. We're having a strong start to the 2026 selling season, with retention expected to be in the high 90s. Our approach and commitment to lowering costs is also leading to new wins with the most sophisticated clients.\nFor example, in our new business win with CalPERS, they specifically highlighted our commitment to delivering more affordable drug benefits and our performance-based model that emphasizes managing pharmacy costs and ensuring clinical quality. In our retail pharmacy business, we are working tirelessly to be the source of stability as we ensure the communities we serve across America maintain access to their medications. PCW delivered another strong quarter despite persistent reimbursement pressures. Our performance is a direct result of our ability to anticipate market dynamics and take the right actions to lead the industry. We've made deliberate investments in technology and our colleagues to strengthen our operations, deliver best-in-class service, and ensure we are the employer of choice in the pharmacy market. Our front-store business continues to improve as we grow our customer base and gain retail share.\nWe continue to have best-in-class generic drug purchasing through Red Oak, and we share those savings with our payer partners through our CVS CostVantage model. Under this new model, we are fairly reimbursed for every script we dispense and the value we provide to our customers. We are encouraged by the transition of our commercial scripts to CVS CostVantage, which continues to be in line with our expectations. We're making good progress on the next stage of evolving the pharmacy reimbursement model as we transition our government business to cost-based pricing models for 2026. This quarter, we made a number of important announcements as we strive towards our goal of improving the healthcare experience in America. Last month, we announced our pledge with CMS to streamline, simplify, and reduce unnecessary complexities in healthcare.\nWe've taken a leading role in the industry's initiative to improve prior authorization and deliver a better experience for providers and patients. But we're not stopping there. We've taken steps to make the prior authorization process simpler for patients undergoing cancer care. We are bundling multiple requests into one upfront approval, eliminating unnecessary complexity. The response to this initiative has been encouraging, and we're working hard to expand the program to additional therapeutic areas. We also recently announced that over the next decade, we committed $20 billion to support our transformation of healthcare. We will deliver a better healthcare experience with reduced friction, greater visibility, and a stronger partnership with doctors and hospitals. By delivering on these ambitions, we'll enable providers to focus on patient care instead of administrative tasks. Members will benefit from the clearer communication and simpler healthcare journeys.\nWe will develop new ways to connect the healthcare landscape so it works better for people. We will use emerging technologies to innovate and drive the transformation of the healthcare experience of today, making it unrecognizable in 10 years. Our investments will allow us to drive change at scale and will empower consumers with the right information to engage on their terms. We look forward to sharing additional updates and innovations in the near future. We are building momentum as we navigate what continues to be a dynamic and evolving environment. We're strengthening our position as we execute against our strategic priorities and deliver solid results. We remain focused on building trust, and are setting expectations that are appropriate, and achievable, and continue to focus on areas where we can drive out performance. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Brian. Brian.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, David, and good morning. I want to start off by saying how excited I am to be part of CVS Health and this leadership team. I joined CVS Health because I truly believe in the meaningful impact we can have on improving healthcare in this country. Our scale and deep consumer touchpoints uniquely position us to deliver a differentiated experience. After my first couple of months, my belief in our enterprise mission has been consistently reaffirmed. I am looking forward to meeting many of you over the course of the next few months and sharing updates about our progress. In my prepared remarks this morning, I will cover three primary areas. First, I will provide an update on our second quarter results. Next, I'll discuss cash flow and the balance sheet. And finally, I'll wrap up with our financial outlook for the remainder of the year.\nCVS Health successfully navigated another dynamic quarter driven by the strength of our execution. Let me provide some highlights on our enterprise performance. Second quarter revenues of nearly $99 billion increased approximately 8% over the prior year quarter, driven by revenue growth across all segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $3.8 billion during the quarter, an increase of nearly 2% from the prior year quarter, driven by increases in our healthcare benefits and pharmacy and consumer wellness segments, partially offset by a decline in our health services segment. Second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.81 was relatively consistent with the prior year quarter. Finally, we generated year-to-date cash flow from operations of approximately $6.5 billion. Turning now to each of our segments.\nIn healthcare benefits, we generated over $36 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of over 11% from the prior year, primarily driven by increases in our government businesses, largely related to the impact of the Inflation Reduction Act on the Medicare Part D program. Medical membership of approximately 26.7 million as of the end of the quarter decreased by approximately 350,000 members sequentially, primarily driven by the previously discussed declines in our individual exchange product early in the second quarter. Adjusted operating income in the quarter was approximately $1.3 billion, an increase of nearly 40% from the prior year quarter, driven by the favorable year-over-year impact of changes to our individual exchange risk adjustment estimates, improved underlying performance in our government businesses, and higher favorable prior period development. These increases were partially offset by a premium deficiency reserve in our group Medicare Advantage business of approximately $470 million.\nTrends in our group MA business remained elevated during the quarter and were modestly higher than our expectations. This resulted in a revision of our estimate for trends for the remainder of the 2025 plan year, triggering a PDR. As we previously discussed, group MA contracts tend to be multi-year agreements and repriced less frequently than our individual MA business. We expect to make progress on margin recovery in our group MA book over the next few years as contracts come due for renewal, including the opportunity to reprice approximately half of our group MA revenue in 2026. Our medical benefit ratio during the quarter was 89.9%, an increase of 30 basis points from the prior year. This increase primarily reflects a 140 basis points impact from the group MA PDR, largely offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of changes in our individual exchange risk adjustment estimates.\nDuring the quarter, we received final 2024 risk adjustment data for our individual exchange business. As a result, we decreased our risk adjustment payable for the 2024 plan year by approximately $300 million. We experienced favorable development across all lines of business during the quarter, predominantly related to fourth quarter 2024 and first quarter 2025 dates of service. When the favorable prior year development is combined with the favorable risk adjustment, it largely offsets the impact of the group MA PDR within the quarter. In our Medicare business, while trends remained elevated, performance in the quarter was modestly ahead of expectations. This outperformance was again primarily in our individual Medicare Advantage business, driven by favorability within our supplemental benefit offerings and Part D. We continue to remain cautious on the outlook for Part D until we have additional experience given the substantial changes in plan liability in 2025.\nAcross our other lines of business, results were broadly in line with our expectations. There were no changes to the expectations embedded in the PDR we recorded last quarter related to our individual exchange business, although we continue to closely monitor emerging cost trends in this book. Days Claims Payable at the end of the quarter was approximately 40.9 days, down approximately two days sequentially, primarily driven by a higher mix of pharmacy costs, partially offset by the impact of the group MA premium deficiency reserve recorded in the quarter. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Shifting now to our health services segment. During the quarter, we generated revenues of over $46 billion, an increase of over 10% year-over-year. This increase was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation, partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements.\nAdjusted operating income in the quarter of approximately $1.6 billion decreased approximately 18% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the impact of a higher medical benefit ratio within our healthcare delivery business, partially offset by improved purchasing economics and pharmacy drug mix. As we discussed last quarter, results in our pharmacy services business can see material fluctuations throughout the year. In 2024, we saw strong performance in the second quarter following a slow start to the year, which impacts the prior year comparison. In our healthcare delivery business, total revenues in the quarter grew approximately 19% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impact of our exit from the ACO REACH program and the sale of our MSSP business earlier this year. This increase was primarily driven by patient growth at Oak Street and increased volumes at Signify.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to expand the number of patients served at Oak Street and ended the quarter with total at-risk membership up 31% from the same period last year. Results in our healthcare delivery business were pressured during the quarter primarily due to a higher medical benefit ratio at Oak Street Health. These pressures were partially offset by another quarter of solid performance in Signify, driven by continued strong volumes. Our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment delivered another strong quarter as our focus on operational excellence and technological enhancements continues to enable us to deliver superior experiences for our customers. During the quarter, we generated revenues of over $33 billion, an increase of over 12% versus the prior year quarter, and over 15% on a same-store basis.\nThese increases were primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and increased prescription and front-store volume, including some early impact from the acquisition of a portion of Rite Aid scripts, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Retail pharmacy script share in the quarter grew to approximately 27.8%, an increase of approximately 60 basis points from the same period last year. Same-store pharmacy sales in the quarter grew over 18% compared to the prior year, and same-store prescription volumes increased over 6%. Same-store front-store sales increased over 3% versus the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher volumes as well as the timing of the Easter holiday, which contributed roughly one percentage point. Adjusted operating income increased nearly 8% from the prior year-to-over $1.3 billion, primarily driven by increased prescription and front-store volume, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nTurning now to cash flow and the balance sheet, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $6.5 billion in the first half of the year. We have distributed approximately $1.7 billion in dividends to our shareholders year-to-date, and we ended the quarter with approximately $2.4 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. While our leverage ratio remains above our long-term targets, it has improved meaningfully since year-end 2024, and we remain pleased by our progress. We continue to expect our leverage ratio to return to more normalized levels as we maintain disciplined financial policies and make progress on margin recovery in the Aetna business. CVS Health's strong cash flow generation has been an important strength for the enterprise, which I will look to build upon by seeking opportunities to drive greater efficiency in working capital.\nAs I step into this role, I will ensure that we maintain a disciplined and balanced approach to capital deployment. This is critical as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet and make progress towards our leverage target. Shifting now to our revised outlook for 2025, we are increasing our full year 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS to a range of $6.30-$6.40. This update incorporates our second quarter performance while maintaining a prudent outlook on medical cost trends and macro factors for the remainder of the year. We now expect full year total revenues of at least $391.5 billion, an increase of approximately $9 billion, driven by increases across all segments. In our healthcare benefits segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of approximately $2.42 billion at the low end of our guidance range.\nThis reflects an increase of approximately $500 million, primarily driven by the final 2024 risk adjustment update for our individual exchange business and the favorable impact of the prior year reserve development that we experienced in the second quarter. We now project our full year 2025 medical benefit ratio at the low end of our healthcare benefits adjusted operating income guidance range to be approximately 91%. This guidance continues to reflect the deliberate actions we took to improve our operations in the Aetna business. While medical cost trends remain elevated versus historical periods, in aggregate, they are generally in line to slightly better than our expectations so far this year. Given this elevated trend environment, we are maintaining a prudent view on medical cost trends through the remainder of the year.\nThe high end of our healthcare benefits guidance reflects a 50 basis point improvement in medical cost trend over the remainder of the year, which is worth approximately $0.10 in enterprise adjusted EPS. Our medical membership guidance remains unchanged. In our health services segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of at least $7.34 billion, a decrease of approximately $200 million from our prior guidance. This update is entirely driven by our healthcare delivery business as a result of a higher medical benefit ratio at Oak Street. Our clients continue to see the tremendous value proposition of our pharmacy services businesses, including Caremark. The outlook for our pharmacy services business within our health services segment remains unchanged. Finally, in our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we now expect full year adjusted operating income of at least $5.68 billion, an increase of approximately $200 million from our prior guidance.\nThis increase reflects our strong first-half performance while continuing to maintain our prudent outlook for potential changes in vaccine market demand and the consumer environment. We are pleased with our transition to CVS Cost Vantage, which continues to track in line with our expectations. Altogether, we now expect full year enterprise adjusted operating income to be in a range of $13.77 billion-$13.94 billion. We're also revising our expectations for full year cash flow from operations to at least $7.5 billion. You can find additional details on the components of our 2025 guidance on our investor relations website. Overall, we are encouraged by our performance. For another consecutive quarter, we're delivering on our commitments and continue to demonstrate clear progress on our path to achieving the embedded earnings power of CVS Health.\nI'm confident we will continue building on our momentum as we will aspire to become America's most trusted healthcare company while simultaneously generating value for you, our shareholders. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please click on the raise hand button, which can be found on the black bar at the bottom of your screen. When it is your turn, you will receive a message on your screen, and then you will hear your name called. Please accept, unmute your audio, and ask your question. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question this morning. We will wait one moment to allow the queue to form. Our first question will come from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat.\nGood morning and congratulations on the results. Welcome, Brian. I look forward to meeting you. Obviously, due to strong performance and HCB, a 40%, $600 million beat on the core side by our numbers. Underlying assumptions and visibility, when we think about how that looks post the quarter and the guidance that you've given, there's a lot of moving parts here. Can you maybe just talk about the level of visibility you have, what some of the underlying assumptions are, your level of conviction moving into the back half of the year?\n\nLaurence McGrath\n\nChief Strategy Officer, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lisa, and I appreciate the question. Before I turn it over to Brian, let me just make a couple of high-level comments about the Aetna business. One is we know this has been one of the top priorities of the enterprise.\nIt's been an enterprise focus on the multi-year recovery, and I'm really pleased with the progress to date, and we'll share some color on the back half of the year as well. One of the things I think is equally as important is the innovation that Aetna is driving. So while they're focusing on the recovery, they're equally focused on driving innovation, simplifying healthcare. You've seen this in the work we've done with the prior authorizations, with the bundled PA process, as well as the new care path and technology that we're rolling out. So I'm really bullish on the progress that Aetna is making. So I'll turn it over to Brian to give some of the financial details, and then I'm going to have Steve provide some color more broadly on the Aetna business.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks, David. And good morning, Lisa. Thanks for the question.\nIn terms of HCB, it was the second consecutive quarter of strong results. We saw our earnings grow by $370 million year-over-year, so a good quarter. As David mentioned, encouraged by the performance across our HCB businesses. The notable exception, Lisa, is our group Medicare Advantage business, which continued to be pressured. The medical cost trends, I would say across all lines of business, remained elevated, but they were modestly favorable in aggregate. There were some impact in the quarter, though, from one-timers that I'd call out for you. One, there was a favorable risk adjustment of about $300 million related to 2024 plan year. Additionally, we had some favorable net PYD. Those two were largely offset or largely offset the impact of our group MAPDR, which came in at $470 million.\nIf you strip out those underlying items, the HCB business beat by about $0.5 billion in the quarter, which is a strong performance. The beat itself was primarily driven by Medicare, particularly from individual Medicare, and the two components were Part D and supplementals. Then I would just remind you, as we're thinking about the back end of the year, Part D continues to track modestly ahead of expectations, but we're maintaining a cautious outlook until we have more experience given the changes in the plan liability from the IRA. So, Steve, maybe I'll turn it over to you for some more color.\n\nSteve Nelson\n\nExecutive Vice President and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nSure. Thanks, Brian. And good morning, Lisa. Thanks for your question. So I'll provide maybe a few high-level comments about Aetna overall and then get into some specifics relative to the line of business, each line of business.\nOur priorities, as Brian stated, David said in his prepared remarks, remain absolutely unchanged. We're focused on returning Aetna to its target margins and, frankly, a leadership position in the industry. Really encouraged by the strong progress in the quarter and the first half of the year in totality. And while it's early, it's a multi-year journey here, and all respect to the environment that we're in, very, very encouraged how the quarter is playing out. There's many drivers of that progress, and maybe I'll highlight just a few. One is the Medicare business, which I'll come back to, as Brian mentioned. But also, we've significantly strengthened our operations and our fundamental capabilities, which allows us to have better insight into our trends and then actually be able to take action against those trends. So very happy with how we've improved the operations and just our fundamental capabilities.\nAnd then we have increased management rigor overall. We remain incredibly disciplined, whether it comes to pricing or just how we think about the business overall relative to our clear priority. We've developed a culture of relentless execution and focus. So that's all playing out nicely, and really encouraged by those results. I also am very proud of the management team and our colleagues. We've strengthened our management team, and I really appreciate how the leadership and our colleagues have come together and just really pouring everything they have into serving our members, partnering with the providers in increasingly innovative and distinctive ways, as David mentioned. Relative to Medicare specifically, there are several key points I'd like to make that have contributed to the progress of that business and the year-to-year improvement. One is we have really strong stars for payment year 2025.\nThat's a result of returning to a leadership position in Stars as our enterprise has focused on Stars and brought the unique and diverse set of capabilities to impact Stars. So that has contributed nicely to the year-over-year improvement and progress. Also, the moves that we made, not only in the bids, but during AEP, to rationalize the products and geographies. So we had an optimal mix of membership, and that is playing out again nicely as we think about the moves we made during AEP. Then lastly, I'm really pleased with the execution and the insights around trend, understanding it, and then mitigating it, honestly, to the extent that we can, where we have opportunities to do that. The PDP product, as Brian mentioned, is performing well in addition to that.\nSo the individual Medicare business has shown a lot of progress, and very encouraged by that. The group business, as Brian mentioned, we have seen pressure there. But as we approach 2026, the good news is half that business is up for renewal, and we're taking a very disciplined approach to renewing that business. And we're getting some traction there. And really, I see the entire Medicare business coming together and continuing the momentum through the back half of the year and into 2026 as we think about returning that business to target margin. In terms of Medicaid, that business is also in line with our expectations. Despite the higher trend we see, it is in line with our expectations. And then, frankly, the execution around our rate advocacy has been really strong.\nWe've seen good engagement with our state partners, and that's, again, tracking to our expectations, including the higher acuity that we've seen. IFP we've talked about took a PDR earlier in the year, elevated trends, but that's incorporated in our outlook. I just want to give you a quick update on the exit. So as we wind down that business, that's going really well. We've had very positive conversations with our states. We've notified all our members. We continue to provide coverage for them, and we'll focus on that. We're exiting that business, and that wind down is going really well. Last, I'll just finish by saying our commercial business is strong. We've seen some really nice wins in our self-insured across public and labor, national accounts, and our Meritain business. Fully insured, we do see elevated trends. We saw that early.\nWe took a disciplined pricing approach to that in 2025, which has pressured membership, but we're going to stay disciplined in our pricing approach to fully insured. Overall, commercial business is strong, and it is a platform for innovation. That's resonating really well with our very sophisticated and demanding clients. Really, really pleased with that. Overall, it's early, a lot of respect for the environment that we're in, but very encouraged about the progress, and not just for the quarter, but the foundation that we're laying as we think about the back half of 2025 and also heading into 2026 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nManaging Director & Senior Healthcare Services Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning.\nI wanted to get your early view on 2026 headwinds and tailwinds, specifically your thoughts on expectations for continued improvement in MA margins post your putting in your 2026 bids, your thoughts on the sustainability of outperformance and share gains in the pharmacy business versus your long-term expectation of mid-single-digit OI declines, and then lastly, potential for improvement in the value-based care business versus current losses.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks. Yeah, Justin, thanks for the question. I think we're early yet in terms of forecasting or giving guidance on 2026. So at this time, I think there's obviously strength in 2025. We feel good about the progress that we're making, and the plan is to, by end of year, give you more perspectives and insights in terms of how we're looking at 2026.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo.\nYou may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, thanks. Just wanted to check in on the group MA margins. I was wondering where this PDR places margins for the business in 2025, and then appreciating the commentary on repricing. Just can you remind us when you're repricing group MA, are you expecting to get all the way back to target margins for that 50% cohort in a single cycle, or does it take longer than that due to the magnitude of dislocation?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you. Well, Steve, I'll let you take that.\n\nSteve Nelson\n\nExecutive Vice President and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nOkay. Good morning, Stephen. Steve Nelson. I think that specifically in regard to your question around group MA and the renewal process and how that plays out, these contracts are typically three to five-year contracts.\nAnd so we are taking a very disciplined approach to renewing the business, also as we consider new business, and we are contemplating the elevated trends as we go through that process with them. So typically, as with any of these businesses, the absolute objective is to write the business so it achieves target margin, but sometimes it takes more than one cycle to get there. So that's how we think about it. And actually, very optimistic, I would say, about that business. It plays an important role in our enterprise, the commercial business synergy across with our Caremark business. So it's an important piece of business, and we take it serious, and it serves these really important clients in an important unique way. But it needs to perform at target margin, so we certainly take that into account as we think about it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question. George, if you would like to unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nGeorge Hill\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nCan you hear me now? I apologize. New to the format here. And Brian, welcome to the call. My question was about the outlook. Good to have you. My outlook was about the pharmacy segment outlook for the back half of the year. Maybe could you break out if there's any changes in the vaccine outlook, talk about the impact of reimbursement stabilization, and maybe the impact of the Rite Aid file buys, and are there any other moving pieces we should consider, and kind of should we think about this performance as sustainable? Thanks. So from a guidance perspective, Prem, do you want to talk about the business, and then I'll talk about the numbers?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, sure. So thanks for the question. So first off, really strong performance in our PCW business, and we continue to be focused on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day a few years ago. So if you think about what we've done, we've focused on strong service levels in our business, and we continue to be America's leading pharmacy and community destination for pharmacy because of that strong execution and the consumer trust we've been able to gain with our 200,000-plus colleagues that we have. Our results reflect our strength. If you think about our top-line growth of 12.5% and AOI increase of about 7.6% in the quarter, it's reflective of where we've been focused. On the pharmacy side of that business, we saw strong script volume growth of around 6.5%, and that's primarily driven by a few factors.\nOne is the innovation and our continuing strong service levels, but also from the market disruption we've seen from other pharmacies closing. Lastly, CVS Cost Vantage. We're proud to say, as we've said on prior calls, that we've delivered it into the commercial marketplace. All of our contracts are on Cost Vantage, and they're performing in line with our expectations. Then, as we've said before, or as we've seen in this quarter in front store, we continue to improve as we grow our customer base from market disruption as well as our retail share gain. So this is all really kind of part of our long-term strategy. Lastly, all of this is powered by our technology advancements and our strong operating model we have underlying this business to really focus on consumers and driving their needs in the 9,000-plus local community destinations we have.\nSo maybe I'll just comment on the guide as a follow-up to Prem's comments. As he mentioned, the strong volumes are impressive with the strong script growth, 6.5%, and the strong front store sales of 3.5%, albeit some of the front store sales, as we look at the modeling, 1% of that was due to the Easter holiday. But net-net, very encouraged to see it flowing through. We started the year with a guide of down 5%. We're now at about down 1.6%. Keep in mind that the business has been pressured for some time, well over a decade if you pull out the COVID. So I would say, from a guide perspective, taking a cautious stance on the consumer dynamics and spending piece, and we'll continue to watch immunizations as they remain dynamic and think about the potential for lower market demand in that business.\nMaybe just one addition over the top here. This has been a multi-year effort. So the results are not by accident. We've focused, as Prem said, on building out the technology to make the pharmacies more efficient and work better for our colleagues and work better for the members that we're serving. So I couldn't be happier with the innovation and the progress that we're making and feel really excited about welcoming the new Rite Aid customers in the back half of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore\n\nHi guys. Good morning. Welcome, Brian. Thanks so much for the question.\nMaybe following up on that a little bit, as we think about what you said in terms of moving Cost Vantage into the government business next year, and maybe there's potentially some 340B impact, how do we think about the sort of reimbursement landscape as it stands now for 2026? Do you think you can sort of see generally flat reimbursement, all else equal, or sort of other puts or takes to think about as we're at this point, which obviously is still on the early side? Hi, Prem.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nPharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks, Elizabeth, for the question. Just a little bit of background on CVS Cost Vantage, just to remind folks again, we started this process to really solve a few things.\nOne is we wanted to get a sustainable, durable pharmacy model that shifted reimbursement to align more closely with the underlying cost of the business and the underlying cost of the drug. One of the challenges this industry has faced over the last decade is the cross-subsidization that existed across scripts. So what Cost Vantage does is it brings a more stable environment, gives more predictability to payers, allows them to get greater transparency, and provides that value to them sooner in a much more transparent way. To answer your question, where are we today? In 2025, as we said, it was a transition year. We were deliberate. We worked very closely with all of the payers to transition the commercial business onto our CostVantage program.\nAs we look out to next year, we're continuing to focus on our government programs and to move them as well into these cost-based models as we go forward. We feel good about where we are as it relates to that transition. As we said prior, over time, we expect that the reimbursement erosion, which was one of the primary headwinds that we faced in the retail pharmacy business, will equal the cost of goods improvement to drive a more sustainable and durable marketplace. We continue to make progress against that.\nOver mid-year, we do these contract negotiations throughout the year for payers, and we'll update you at a later time, but we feel good about where we are with cost management, and we feel good about the value that we're delivering to the payers across the country to create a more predictable model that can lower costs for them and their clients. Yeah. Elizabeth, maybe just one other thing in terms of the innovation that we're driving around the pricing model. So this is not just being executed and delivered in the retail setting. The PBM Caremark is also driving new price models to remove the cross-subsidies and some of what I think is the inefficiencies in the pricing of the products today. So I think if you have parallel paths and the market begins to move, you'll begin to see a more rational pricing structure across the market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Andrew Mok with Barclays. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nAndrew Mok\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Can you help reconcile your favorable Medicare results in the HCB segment with the unfavorable results you're seeing at Oak Street? Is the pressure coming more from internal or external MA members, and are there any benefits or cost categories you would call out as driving the elevated pressure in Oak Street?\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThanks. Yeah, thanks, Andrew. I think the first point is that they're different books. So the acuity and/or the mix of members are very different across that, and there's a larger book versus the concentrated, more higher-risk population inside of Oak Street. So let me maybe let Brian speak a little bit to the nuances between the two, and if I could have Prem speak more broadly to the Oak Street.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nPharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks, David.\nWe're seeing elevated trends across MA broadly, and I don't think there's a direct comparison between Aetna and the Oak Street book for a few reasons. One, as David started to mention, there's different populations. Aetna is large, more diverse from a member base. Oak Street is smaller, but higher acuity. We also need to remember that Aetna members, they represent an increasing but still a minority of total patients at Oak. Not all health plans have pulled back on benefits in 2025 to the same extent that Steve and the Aetna team have done. So as David mentioned, value-based care, it remains a critical component to our strategy, providing better experiences, better outcomes, lower costs.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nI think, Prem, you can talk to Oak Street's care model being best in class.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nPharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah, absolutely.\nSo as Brian and David said, we saw some pressure inside of our healthcare delivery business. That was driven by what I'd say in Oak Street, persistent elevated medical costs, the member mix that we had, and then the more robust benefit and supplemental benefit offerings that plans provided to their members. And this was partially offset by strong performance at Signify driven by in-home assessment volumes. If you look at Oak Street specifically, we're focused on addressing the market dynamics while strengthening the business and improving the financial performance over the short and long term. And what I'd say is there's four areas that we're really focused on. One is we've put in place a strong leadership team with new leaders that have deep-rooted experience in value-based care and population health management.\nTwo, we continue to look at the technology stack and the operations to provide the leading clinical solution from a technology perspective for our business. We focus that has to drive to better medical cost management. Oak Street was one of the best large-scale clinical programs out there for value-based care. We continue to look at how we're going to leverage our tech stack to drive that even further. Then lastly, we're going to take a thoughtful approach to center expansion while prioritizing patient growth inside of those centers. So from my perspective, we remain committed to value-based care. It's an important part of our healthcare system, and we've been really intentional in our strategy to focus on assets with a proven track record like Oak Street in delivering improved quality and experience while managing costs.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\nYou may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nEric Percher\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. I'll stick with health services. And Brian, a similar visibility question as you addressed on HCB earlier. It's proven harder to draw a line in the sand on delivery HBR. Can you speak to visibility at this point of the year, and maybe how much of the $200 million headwind was H1 versus expectation for any improvement in H2? And then for the team, I know there's no change in pharmacy services, but could you speak to the customer price improvements, and are you seeing more cost to retain this high 90s retention level?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSure, Eric. Thanks very much for the question.\nAs I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing pressure in HCD, specifically Oak, and I think it's driven by the higher medical benefit ratio, and that's attributed to elevated medical cost, member mix, more robust benefit offerings. As we think about, and some of that was offset by the solid performance that Signify, as Prem had mentioned a few minutes ago, but as we think about the guidance reduction in the segment, it's all coming out of HCD. As we think about the revised expectations for the second half of the year, we think we've captured a trend. As I sit here today, I would say HSS earnings distribution, as you look at the back half versus the front half, H2 is roughly evenly split between the two quarters from a cadence perspective, probably with a slight tilt towards Q4 from a profit perspective.\nPrem, did you want to?\n\nPrem Shah\n\nPharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSo maybe Prem, if you can speak a little bit to the selling season and how the PBM is performing.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nPharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, Eric, for the question. So we're really pleased with the strong start to the 2026 PBM selling season. Caremark continues to be well-positioned as the leader in the PBM in the marketplace. And what I'd say is we're continuing to be focused on driving what our clients value the most, which is making prescriptions and pharmacy costs more affordable and lowering the cost by increasing competition. And on the kind of retention side, we're on track with where we normally are with our historical upper 90% retention rate. And the PBM industry has always been competitive. We remain to have the same discipline we've always had in our pricing and in the marketplace.\nBut what I'd say is, as we talk to our customers and as we're out in the marketplace, what's really resonating is our approach, our transparency, and the way in which we are continuing to create the competition. And some of those great examples are over the course of the last couple of years with, for example, we led the way in with Cordavis in the biosimilar marketplace, and we're leading the way this year on 7-1 with the competition we've increased in the indication and weight loss on GLP-1. So we continue to focus on what our clients need most, which is lowering the cost and making prescriptions more affordable in the country. And from our perspective, it's resonating. The selling season is resonating in our retention rates.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Erin Wright with Morgan Stanley. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nErin Wright\n\nHealthcare Services Analyst, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Great. Thanks. I'm curious at your thoughts on the Part C space and how that's playing out kind of relative to plan, how you think about kind of the demo and the CMS announcement more recently on that front, and how you're thinking about that into next year. And maybe we don't have enough visibility yet on that, but want to see how that's playing out in terms of behaviors, in terms of utilization trends, and what you're seeing across Part B. All right. Steve, would you take that, please?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSure. Thanks. Good morning, Erin. So as I mentioned earlier, our Part D plans are performing really well year to date. And that's a result of some deliberate actions and decisions we made to position the product for the long term.\nSo we deliberately wanted to de-risk this with the shifts in the IRA and some of the policy things that put more risk and more cost to the health plan. So we reduced our plan offerings, eliminated the enhanced plans, so we just have one standard plan. And that has changed sort of the mix. And then we also made some design changes. So overall, in 2025, the business is performing well. But as expected, that did have some membership implications. So we think that'll continue to play out a bit, but not as much as we lost in the first half of the year. But this is all with the eye towards returning our business to target margins and creating a sustainable product. And so as we contemplated 2026, we took that same approach, and our bids focused on ensuring a sustainable product for 2026 and beyond.\nNow, we just got the guidance from CMS earlier this week. We're still digesting that, and we really won't have more insight into that until we kind of get through our process. And obviously, the entire competitive landscape impacts how we think about it as well. So more to come there. But again, those products, Part D, are performing well for us, and we're going to continue to make sure that we make decisions and to create that and continue that sustainability.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from John Ransom with Raymond James and Associates. You may now unmute your audio and ask your question.\n\nJohn Ransom\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. I'm proud of myself for understanding this new process.\nMy question is, and I know this is a small part of the business, but yeah, the front-end part of the drug retail business has been a struggle for the industry for probably as long as I've been covering it, which is forever. I just wonder, as you kind of look through your business strategies, what are we doing differently? And I am intrigued that you're back in the business of even buying drug stores. But what's the long-term strategy to address sort of the competitive pressures and the competitive position of the front-end?\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks. Yeah, John, thanks for the question. And look, we have a very solid front-end business, and we've been focused on it with a very strong management team and been deliberate with how we're thinking about that business.\nSo as you saw in this quarter, we saw our TRX comp increase about 2.7% from LY, and we continue to see retail share gains, which is new for this part of the business if you look at it over a longer duration of period. So the strategy we have in place is, one, how do we create more value for consumers in the offerings that we have? How do we continue to work with our vendors to help reduce the cost so we can provide that value upfront? And then secondly, or I'd say thirdly, is how do we get more consumers and foot traffic into our stores and be there? And so we're benefiting from some of the, what I'd say, is adjacency to pharmacy as it relates to that, meaning that as we get more and more pharmacy patients, they utilize our front-store services.\nSecond, we've been focused on our consumer, what I'd say, marketing efforts, and other ways in which we're bringing those customers into our stores and continue to drive the value-price equation. So I'm really impressed with the progress we're making on our front store. We continue to gain traction. The leadership team has been focused about this. And you're right, John. We don't spend enough time on these calls on that, but it is an important part of our business and something we're really focused on. We've been very deliberate on how we turn that around over into the future.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Please now unmute your audio and ask your question. Brian, you may now unmute your audio and ask your question. If you can press star nine to unmute yourself. Okay.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nOperator, it looks like we're challenged with the last question. I think we're at close. As I think about before I end this call, I just want to thank the 300,000 dedicated colleagues for the work that they do every day. It's because of you, I'm confident in our future and our ability to become America's most trusted healthcare company. I also want to thank everyone for joining this call today. We're extremely excited about the progress and look forward to providing you additional updates. I also want to make an announcement that our plan is to have an investor day on 9 December 2025 and more details to follow. Thank you for the call today.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you for joining CVS Health's Q2 2025 earnings call. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."

My name is Breaker, and I will be your moderator for today. All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call, with an opportunity for questions and answers at the end. I would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. Thank you. You may proceed, Larry.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nChief Strategy Officer, CVS Health\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CVS Health Q1 2025 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. I'm joined this morning by David Joyner, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of the leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q, filed this morning with the SEC.\nToday's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties.\nIn particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings in Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and the reconciliation document posted to the investor relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. David.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. We continue to build momentum across CVS Health and are progressing on our aspiration to be America's most trusted healthcare company. This morning, we are pleased to report solid results in what continues to be a challenging and volatile environment. We delivered Q1 adjusted earnings per share of $2.25 and adjusted operating income of $4.6 billion. In addition, we increased our full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6 to $6.20, up from our previous range of $5.75 to $6. Our strong start to the year and our increased guidance reflect solid performance and execution across each of our businesses as we maintain a prudent outlook with opportunities for outperformance and deliver on our promise to you, our shareholders.\nOne of my top and most urgent priorities coming into this role was ensuring I had a leadership team with diverse experiences that can help me execute against my strategic priorities. Last month, we announced the appointments of Brian Newman as Chief Financial Officer effective 12 May and Amy Compton-Phillips as Chief Medical Officer effective 19 May. I am confident that Brian and Amy will help us continue building upon the momentum we've created over the past several months as we execute on our strategy to deliver better healthcare to those we are privileged to serve.\nI believe I now have completed my management team and that Brian and Amy's collective and individual experience and expertise are well-suited to position CVS Health for the future. Brian is succeeding Tom Cowhey, who will continue to serve as a strategic advisor to me effective 12 May to help ensure a successful transition. I want to express my personal appreciation for all Tom has done in his 11 years at Aetna and three years at CVS Health. Tom has been instrumental in advancing our talent, advocating for the finance function, and engaging with our shareholders.\nTom has also played a critical role in our efforts to stabilize the Aetna business and position us on the path to improved results. I'm grateful for my time with Tom and wish him all the best in the future. We are driving towards becoming America's most trusted healthcare company. Every day, we earn the trust of customers we serve by improving outcomes, expanding access, and improving affordability to address one of the largest problems faced by our country: rising and unsustainable healthcare costs. We hold a unique position in healthcare with our scaled assets: our 9,000 community health destinations, our more than 1,000 walk-in and primary care clinics, and the deep connections we have with more than 185 million consumers we serve.\nIt is this combination that differentiates CVS Health and provides us with a competitive advantage, allowing us to drive change and bring solutions to market at scale. Addressing the fragmented and broken healthcare system of today is not easy, but we are facing this challenge head-on. This is personal for me, my leadership team, and the more than 300,000 CVS Health colleagues that work tirelessly every day to earn the trust of the customers we serve.\nOur solutions are driven by insights from the millions of consumer touchpoints we have across CVS Health. We are purposely using these insights through our digital capabilities to improve transparency, empower our members, and drive better outcomes. In our CVS Health app, customers now have greater visibility into their healthcare journey and how to address potential barriers to care. This core digital asset is helping to drive a more trusted and integrated healthcare experience for our customers. We are also directly supporting our members with real-time AI-powered recommendations to help them better manage their health and achieve better outcomes.\nOur capabilities allow us to precisely engage with members where we can have the most impact on their health and experience. We have the best-run pharmacy businesses in the country. We have been investing in our colleagues, strengthening our technology, and we continue to build on our market-leading cost-to-goods sold. Our focus in these areas has allowed us to deliver superior experiences to our customers while driving significant operational improvements across our nationwide footprint. Between our community, specialty, and mail-order pharmacies, we process and dispense over 1.7 billion scripts each year, generating unique insights that create opportunities to improve processes and healthcare experiences at scale.\nWe have been focused on simplifying and improving the prior authorization process for many years, with the goal of getting patients their critical medications as quickly as possible. We eliminated requirements, accelerated decisions, created transparency, as well as provided proactive support to improve their experience. We took what we know matters most to our customers and applied it to what we do every day across each of our businesses. In the last several months, our team is taking meaningful steps to address points of friction, including simplifying and streamlining the prior authorization process at Aetna.\nToday, Aetna maintains one of the shortest lists of treatments and procedures that require prior authorization. Of the eligible prior authorization requests we receive, over 95% are approved within 24 hours, with some approved in as little as just a few hours. However, we know patients still feel friction in the system, and we are not satisfied with the status quo. We will continue leading the industry in driving change and improving member and provider experiences.\nWe recently announced a novel approach which bundles multiple prior authorization requests into one. We have begun to deploy this solution in some common areas of cancer care where we can have a meaningful impact supporting our members. By bundling the prior authorization for multiple high-tech imaging scans, like MRIs that are used for restaging cancer care, we are reducing the administrative load on providers, expediting treatment, and reducing uncertainty for our members.\nOur goal is to launch additional bundles later this year and to expand the program more broadly to other conditions such as musculoskeletal and select cardiology services. We are excited about rolling out this new approach, particularly after the positive response we received from plan sponsors. Another critical component of earning the trust of our customers is enhancing access and making the cost of life-changing medications more affordable. We have a proven history of leading the market with the use of preferred formularies more than a decade ago. We led the market in driving the adoption of Humira biosimilars, delivering over $1 billion in savings for our clients. A year after we revitalized the biosimilar market with our launch at Q4, our low-cost Humira biosimilar has the largest market share in the US. Today, we're leading the way forward on GLP-1s.\nThese innovative drugs, which can have a meaningful impact on people's health, were launched at prices that pressured our clients' budgets. To address this, we are pleased to announce that we are partnering with Novo Nordisk to significantly increase access to Wegovy for our members at a more affordable price. We can increase the power of GLP-1s by combining them with additional lifestyle clinical support as part of our CVS Weight Management Program offered to our clients through Caremark. This combination allows members to achieve better outcomes and even greater weight loss than the pre-program results. Additionally, we are the first retail pharmacy in the NovoCare Pharmacy Network. This will enable us to provide convenient, safe, and affordable access to Wegovy for eligible patients at our 9,000 community health locations across the country.\nTaken together, this demonstrates the value of our integrated model and what CVS Health does day in and day out. Our clients and the patients we serve continue to choose us because we innovate, create competition, increase access, and deliver savings while leveraging our leading clinical capabilities to improve health outcomes. Our industry-leading pharmacy capabilities, built across our national footprint, empowered by our efficient operations and our innovative and transparent pricing models, have allowed us greater flexibility to focus on improving health outcomes. Patient experience and trust have a meaningful impact on medication adherence. Our success in this area has enabled us to be the top-ranked national retail chain for medication adherence. In our Aetna business, Medicare Advantage members who utilize CVS Pharmacy are more adherent to the therapy.\nThis results in fewer acute medical events, such as emergency room visits, and on average, these members have 3% lower medical costs. Our unrivaled reach to consumer and our integrated business model allow us to establish deeper connections in the community and drive better outcomes. The combination of our capabilities across each of our businesses is what allows us to deliver on these promises. This is why the ongoing rhetoric and misguided actions by some aimed at integrated healthcare companies like CVS Health are so flawed. In April, the Arkansas government took unjustified action that will leave hundreds of thousands of patients without their community pharmacy, severely limiting access to critical drugs and increasing costs for employers and consumers. The actions will also affect more than 10,000 people in Arkansas who have complex conditions like cancer and multiple sclerosis.\nThese vulnerable patients require specialized care and close coordination with their specialty pharmacists. Independent pharmacies will not be able to fill the void this legislation creates in Arkansas, as they often do not stock specialty medications and lack the capabilities to manage complex conditions. We saw an overwhelming response against this proposal from patients and customers. We will now see a rise in the cost of medications and a decrease in their accessibility. We've also seen several direct letters from trade groups like the American Benefits Council and the ERISA Industry Committee. We're also concerned about the negative impact resulting from this bill. Our health plan partners have also raised issues as they will now have trouble satisfying network adequacy requirements, including for the Medicare program.\nWe will continue to serve patients in the state for as long as we can and will work to educate stakeholders on all the ramifications of this flawed legislation. We are already seeing other states rejecting the Arkansas approach. Our position remains that we believe in common sense, meaningful actions to help lower the cost of medications in the US, which is why we were pleased to see that the President's executive order on drug pricing focuses on the entire supply chain. We remain focused on building trust with you, our shareholders, by taking the right actions to strengthen our business and deliver on our commitments. As you've seen over the last six months, we actively manage our portfolio of businesses to ensure a pathway to sustainable earnings and competitive viability.\nWe took action at the end of last year with our infusion business at Q4, and we've announced earlier this year our exit from the ACO REACH program and the sale of our MSSP business. We are disappointed by the continued underperformance from our individual exchange products and have recently determined there is not a near or long-term pathway for Aetna to materially improve its position in this product. As a result, we've decided that effective 2026, we will exit the states in which Aetna independently operates ACA plans. Despite our multi-year efforts, we must recognize what is and what is not working and will focus on the areas where we have a clear right to win. This is not a decision we made lightly, as we recognize the importance of this product to millions of members.\nThis action will allow us to focus on areas where we will have the strongest capabilities, including Medicare, commercial, and Medicaid, where we continue to build on our ability to serve members and customers in a differentiated way. We are committed to supporting our individual exchange members for as long as we have the privilege to serve them, and we'll also work closely with our partners to ensure a smooth transition and that these members continue to have access to quality, affordable care. We are dedicated to transforming the healthcare experience in this country and believe we have the right set of assets, the right strategy, and the right team to deliver the most affordable and highest-quality healthcare solutions to our customers.\nWe are focused on executing against the strategic priorities I laid out when I spoke to you last quarter and delivering strong results. We continue to lead the industry in driving innovation and better experiences for our members, patients, and consumers and are working hard to ensure we deliver best-in-class performance from each of our businesses. As we continue to build trust and look to the future, we are setting expectations that are appropriate and achievable and continue to focus on areas where we can drive outperformance. With that, I'd like to hand the call over to Tom. Tom?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, David, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'll start with a few highlights on total company performance. Q1 revenues of nearly $95 billion increased 7% over the prior year quarter, driven by revenue growth across all segments. We delivered Q1 adjusted operating income of approximately $4.6 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.25, driven by strong performance across all segments, including meaningful improvement in our healthcare benefits segment. Finally, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $4.6 billion during the quarter, an excellent start to the year that allowed us to increase our full-year cash flow guidance this morning.\nTurning now to our segments, healthcare benefits generated nearly $35 billion of revenue in the quarter, an increase of 8% over the prior year, driven by increases in our Medicare business, including the impact of improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for payment year 2025. Medical membership of approximately 27.1 million was flat sequentially as declines in our individual exchange and Medicare businesses were largely offset by growth in our commercial fee-based business. Shortly after quarter end, the premium grace period for individual exchange members expired, and we obtained additional clarity on our effectuated membership. As a result of this subsequent attrition, our membership declined by approximately 300,000 members, which will be reflected in our Q2 membership.\nDuring the quarter, the segment generated adjusted operating income of approximately $2 billion, an increase of over $1.2 billion from the prior year quarter. Our medical benefit ratio of 87.3% decreased 310 basis points from the prior year. These improvements were primarily driven by the favorable year-over-year impact of prior year reserve development across all lines of business, the majority of which was related to Q4 2024 dates of service. We also benefited from better underlying performance in Medicare, including the impact of improved Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2025 payment year and seasonally strong performance in our Medicare Part D products.\nPartially offsetting this strong performance were a number of estimate changes related to prior-period revenue. Altogether, prior year reserve development, net of changes in revenue estimates, contributed approximately $400 million to adjusted operating income in the quarter. As David mentioned earlier, we plan to exit our individual exchange business in 2026. We are currently projecting that variable losses in this business will be between $350 and $400 million for the full year 2025. As a result of these losses, as well as updates to reflect the seasonality of this business, this quarter we established a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $450 million related solely to the 2025 coverage year.\nThis PDR reflects updated seasonality projections based on our current membership mix, as well as higher membership than previously anticipated. The premium deficiency reserve increased our Q1 medical benefit ratio by approximately 130 basis points. Medical cost trends during the quarter remained elevated but appeared to show early signs of stabilization and were broadly in line with our expectations for most of our businesses. While our group commercial business delivered a strong quarter, our individual exchange business did experience higher-than-expected trends as reflected in our PDR. Trends in Medicare, while elevated, were modestly better than our expectations. In Medicare broadly, we continue to see higher trends in inpatient, outpatient, and medical pharmacy, three categories which were elevated in 2024 and which we will continue to monitor closely.\nThat said, performance in Part D during the quarter was better than our projections but may simply reflect updated seasonality given program changes and our current mix of members. In particular, we are watching specialty utilization in this product. We also saw strong improvements in the performance of our supplemental benefit offerings, but remain cautious on the outlook for these products until we have more experience with the substantial changes we made for 2025. We are also closely watching trends in our group Medicare Advantage business, which remain pressured. In Medicaid, our overall rate advocacy efforts remain on track as we continue to work with our state partners to align rates with changes in acuity.\nToday's claims payable at the end of the quarter was approximately 43 days, down about one day sequentially and from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by pharmacy costs, partially offset by the impact of the premium deficiency reserves. When we compare sequential premium growth against reserve growth, those metrics were more consistent when normalized for the Part D premium changes. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment generated revenues of over $43 billion during the quarter, an increase of nearly 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty, and brand inflation, partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements. Q1 adjusted operating income of over $1.6 billion increased nearly 18% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and pharmacy drug mix, partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were over $464 million, and total pharmacy services membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately 88 million. We started the year with another strong quarter of top-line growth in our healthcare delivery business. Total revenues grew 27% compared to the same quarter last year, excluding the impact of our exit from the ACO REACH program and the sale of our MSSP business. This increase was primarily driven by strong patient growth at Oak Street and increased volumes at Signify. Total at-risk members at Oak Street increased approximately 37% in the same period last year. While very immature, we have seen some signs of pressure in Q1 medical cost trends at Oak Street Health, which we will continue to monitor closely over the next several months as they continue to develop.\nOur pharmacy and consumer wellness segment also delivered another strong quarter. We generated revenues of nearly $32 billion, an increase of over 11% versus the prior year quarter, and over 14% on a same-store basis. Adjusted Operating Income of over $1.3 billion increased over 11% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by increased prescription volume and improved drug purchasing. Q1 results also benefited from stronger seasonal factors, including the impact of increased demand for certain vaccines and the extended flu season. Partially offsetting these items were continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of softening consumer demand in the front store. Same-store pharmacy sales in the quarter grew nearly 18% versus the prior year, and same-store prescription volumes increased nearly 7%.\nSame-store front-store sales were roughly flat versus the prior year quarter, but were up nearly 1% after adjusting for the impact of leap day in the Q1 of 2024. Retail pharmacy scrip share in the quarter grew to approximately 27.6%, an increase of approximately 70 basis points from the same period last year, driven by continued strong execution, our ability to deliver superior customer experiences, and our commitment to pharmacy access across the communities we serve. Shifting now to cash flow in the balance sheet, we generated cash flows from operations of approximately $4.6 billion in the Q1. During the quarter, we returned $840 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents at our unrestricted subsidiaries. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter improved meaningfully from year-end.\nWhile our ratio remains above our long-term targets, we are pleased by the progress we made in lowering our leverage this quarter. We continue to expect our leverage ratio to return to more normalized levels as we maintain our disciplined financial policies and make progress on margin recovery in the Aetna business. Shifting now to our outlook for 2025. As David mentioned, we are increasing our full-year 2025 guidance for Adjusted EPS to a range of $6 to 6.20. This update incorporates our Q1 performance while maintaining a respectful view on medical cost trends and a prudent outlook on various macro factors for the remainder of the year. We now expect total revenue of $382.6 billion, down approximately $3.3 billion, largely due to our exit from the ACO REACH program and the sale of our MSSP business.\nIn our healthcare benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income of approximately $1.91 billion at the low end of our guidance range. This reflects an increase of approximately $400 million, primarily driven by the previously mentioned prior year reserve development, net of changes in estimates related to prior-period revenue that we experienced in the Q1. We project our full-year 2025 medical benefit ratio at the low end of our healthcare benefits adjusted operating income guidance range to be approximately 91.3%. Our guidance maintains a respectful view of medical cost trends for the remainder of the year. In particular, we continue to keep a close eye on performance of our group Medicare Advantage business. As we discussed last quarter, contracts in this book are typically multi-year and thus take longer to reprice.\nWhile we are encouraged by the favorable development of our 2024 medical cost estimates, our claims experience for 2025 remains immature, particularly in light of changing membership mix in our Medicare Advantage and Individual Exchange products. That said, our performance on the medical benefit ratio remains one of the largest potential factors that could drive us higher in our adjusted EPS guidance range. We expect to end the year with approximately 26.4 million members of approximately 600,000 members from our previous guidance, primarily driven by higher membership in our Individual Exchange and Medicare businesses. We continue to expect our Medicare Advantage membership to end the year consistent with our previously guided range of down 5% to 10% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income guidance for our health services, pharmacy, and consumer wellness segments is unchanged from our previous expectations.\nWe are encouraged by the performance of each of these segments in Q1 and are maintaining a cautious outlook for the remainder of the year. In PCW, we are closely monitoring the potential for a softening consumer environment and the implications of tariffs, as well as potential changes in consumer sentiment towards vaccines that may impact market demand. We are also closely watching the persistently elevated trends in Medicare Advantage and the potential impact they could have on our healthcare delivery business, particularly at Oak Street Health. In aggregate, we expect our consolidated adjusted operating income to be in a range of $13.31 to 13.65 billion. We continue to believe these expectations represent an appropriately achievable baseline with opportunities for outperformance. Based on these changes, we are also updating our expectation for full-year cash flow from operations to approximately $7 billion.\nAdditionally, we now expect our interest expense to be approximately $3.15 billion and our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 25.9%. As you think about the cadence of earnings for the remainder of the year, we now expect approximately 60% of full-year consolidated earnings to occur in the first half of the year. This reflects a change from our previous estimates, largely driven by strong Q1 performance. For health services, while we were pleased with the strength of the quarter and our reiteration of full-year guidance, we would remind you that results in the pharmacy services business can see material fluctuations by quarter. Specifically, as we sit here today, consensus expectations for the Q2 are notably higher than our own expectations. You can find additional details on the components of our 2025 guidance on our investor relations website.\nWe are encouraged by our performance in Q1 as our results demonstrate execution of initial steps to restore at-net-to-target margins. While we still have a significant amount of work to do, this quarter was an important first step in our multi-year journey to unlock the embedded earnings power with CVS Health. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If for any reason you would like to remove that question, please press star followed by two. We do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. We will pause here briefly. We have the first question from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Your line is open\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus on your comments around Medicare Advantage. Specifically, it sounds like you're seeing early trends better in individual and Part D, maybe some pressure incrementally in Group MA, so hoping you can give us some more color there across those three segments, and also maybe give us your early impression of trend versus that high single-digit medical trend you put in guidance for MA.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Justin, this is David. Thanks for the question. We expected there would be questions around the trend. Before I hand it off to the team to talk more specifically about the drivers and how we're thinking about the end of or the rest of this year, I want to just take a moment talking about what we've done in the last six months.\nWe've talked a lot about creating operating stability, improving the way in which we're forecasting and pricing our products, and then we had to have a good open enrollment. So I think we've executed against all three of those priorities, and I feel really good about the team, the focus, and the execution that's in front of us. And so I think that has allowed us, again, to, I think, drive the kind of performance that we've seen in this Q1.\nI will also say that we will continue to hold a respect for trend, and I think that will be the theme you'll hear today as we look at both the performance in Q1 and also the elevated trends as we expect for the rest of this year. So with that, I'll let Steve Nelson give a broader framework on Medicare and Aetna with the other businesses within that, and I'll let Tom speak to the specific trends.\n\nSteve Nelson\n\nEVP and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nGreat. Well, thanks, David. Good morning, Justin. David used the word this morning, momentum. I think that's the right word as you think about Aetna specifically. The objectives that we've laid out are clear. We have a multi-year path to return Aetna to its target margins, and while it's very early in that journey, the progress is very encouraging. So maybe I'll just highlight four or five points that I think point to some of the drivers of that progress. I'll start with Medicare Advantage in the individual business.\nThrough the AEP process, we, I think, did a really good job of rationalizing both geographies and product mix, combined with really strong execution around the total cost of care, and just the overall operational rigor and management process focus, discipline. It's really producing results. As David and Tom both said, early innings here, but the elevated trends that we've seen, we are starting to see early signs of stabilization. It's really producing results, and very pleased with the progress in that business overall. I'll just touch on the other businesses quickly to kind of round out just the overall perspective on Aetna. Our Medicaid business is continuing to perform well, and we really like the progress we're making around rate advocacy, very much tracking in line with our full-year expectations. We're very competitive in this space.\nWe had a couple of really good wins with Texas and Georgia. They're obviously pending protests. We're confident that we'll prevail there and hopeful but really strong performance in the early innings at Medicaid as well. Our commercial business has been performing slightly ahead of our expectations, mainly driven by a return to more competitiveness in our fully insured book. That's due to really nice disciplined pricing and great work on our trend, as well as better-than-expected retention. When you think about our self-insured, our meriting business, and our national public and labor accounts business, we've seen some really nice wins there in incredibly competitive markets. The Pennsylvania Employee Benefits Trust Fund, the Advocate Health System, these are examples of full replacement opportunities that we were able to achieve. Incredibly proud to be able to serve those customers.\nDavid mentioned his prepared remarks that we'll be exiting the IFP business, our exchange business, and we've now met with all of our independent markets and states, including CMS, and they are appreciative of the transparency and the thoughtful approach that we're taking here, and we are committed to serving these members through the rest of the year, and that's our focus. So we will continue to update you on that process. Then last point, we're continuing to make progress in our culture and the way that folks, our colleagues, think, and moving to an advocacy mindset, focusing on innovation around member experience and our provider experience. David made an announcement about how we're going to be streamlining the prior authorization process for certain conditions, and we're just going to build on this. This is going to be a focus of our company.\nA watch item, just to finish up here, is the Medicare Group, Medicare Advantage Group business. Justin, you asked about that specifically. That business, while we have a strong market position there and we've had success, has not been immune from the elevated trends. We've seen that definitely in the group business. Due to the multi-year contract nature of the business, there's not as many levers to pull there, but we are getting after the clinical opportunities aggressively. We're also going to be introducing some rate actions as well. We think that'll mitigate some of the pressure. Overall, again, multi-year journey, it's early, but incredibly encouraged about the progress and proud of the team for what they've done. Tom, I'll turn it over to you for more detail on the trend part.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nGreat. Good morning, Justin. So as you look at the quarter, if you strip out the premium deficiency reserve, the underlying at-net business beat by about $1 billion. So we had strong prior period reserve development off the 1,231 reserves, which, as I noted in the prepared remarks, was partially offset by some out-of-period revenue changes. And so net, those two are worth about $400 million, which was the driver of the increased guidance this morning. As you look at the current period, the upside's almost entirely driven by Medicare. So the other businesses are largely going to offset. And inside Medicare, there's a few things going on.\nFirst, there was about $100 million of expense favorability, which is primarily timing will come back over the remainder of the year. As you look at the core Medicare trends, they're running consistent with to slightly better than our outlook and as Steve said, they're showing early signs of stabilization. Q1 inpatient trends are generally consistent with the full year 2024. We've also seen some modest favorability in outpatient, but medical pharmacy trends remain stubbornly high. Outside of the core trends, as I noted, we saw strong seasonal performance out of Part D, and we also saw strong year-over-year improvements in our supplemental benefit trends, but we haven't pulled through this favorability until we've seen more data.\nAnd then turning last, just to close out your specific question on group, that is a place where we continue to watch. Specifically, inpatient trends on that block have remained quite high, and we've also seen a little bit of acceleration in outpatient. And so we're watching that very closely, but net-net, very pleased with the performance in the quarter. Obviously, pleased enough that we were able to raise the guidance this morning, and we think that the outlook that we've taken here is quite prudent and respectful of how trends may emerge over the remainder of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now have Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi. Thanks very much, and good morning. I want to shift over to the relationship that you announced today with Novo for Wegovy. David, can you help me to understand a few things? One, when we think about your preferred formulary, can you talk about the number of lives that are on there? Two, when we think about coverage, I know we've been talking the last few years around how expensive this is for employers to cover. Where are we on coverage today for weight loss, and will this increase the number of potential lives that could be covered with this program?\nAnd then just wrapping that around, you talked about clinical services, and this will come through Caremark. Can you maybe just talk about the economic value of this for both Caremark as well as the member? And then just lastly, when I think about the pricing, should I assume what you've been able to negotiate through Caremark is going to be better than the $499 that you also announced at retail?\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Lisa, thank you. And really good thoughtful questions on the new relationship. And I'm going to turn it over to Priam, but before I do, I just want to say we continue to be a leader and innovate in the areas that our customers care most about. And we've known that we've had cost pressures in this category. They've been asking for solutions, and I couldn't be happier about what we announced today. So I'll have Priam walk through the relationship and then answer specifically the questions that you asked. Priam?\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, David. And Lisa, thanks for the question. As you know, our company and Caremark has a long proven history of creating competition, driving affordability, and increasing access for all patients. With this relationship, we'll do that for our insured and covered lives as well as for uninsured lives that choose to use our 9,000 community health destinations. Our announcement today also demonstrates the value of our integrated model and what we can do every single day. And we're really excited about this example and how we're going to continue to create competition and affordability for the clients and members that we serve.\nJust as a little bit of a history lesson, if you look back over the last couple of decades, the main pain point for our customers and clients was the rising cost of specialty drugs. You saw our organization take action last year with the launch of Cordovis. It generated over $1 billion of net savings for our clients, and we led the market in terms of conversion to biosimilars and are continuing to create a competitive marketplace over there. If you kind of fast forward to today and over the course of the last year, exactly as you mentioned, our client's biggest pain point today has kind of moved from these specialty drugs that were rising and the utilization increasing to GLP-1s, and the trend on these are now rising faster than those specialty drugs.\nAs you think about GLP-1s, they're our biggest pharmacy trend driver for our clients, and we continue to, what I would say, is leverage all of the PBM cost management strategies to enable and deliver maximized savings for our customers. The facts are, to your question, because of the high cost of these medications, about 1/3 of our clients have elected not to cover GLP-1s as part of their benefits due to affordability concerns. Today, we're pleased to announce this partnership with Novo Nordisk to significantly increase the access to Wegovy for our members at a more affordable price by taking a formulary action on 1 July 2024 to prefer Wegovy. It's for our largest commercial template that has tens of millions of lives on it.\nLater today, we're going to be providing this detail to our clients and the benefit consultant community around this important formulary change and how we're continuing to, what I would say, drive the market to make medications more affordable, drive long-term value for our clients, and create competition with pharma. So as you think about that, and then you wrap that into what I would say is the enhanced value we bring as part of Caremark in our CVS Weight Management Program, this results in better outcomes and even greater weight loss than their pre-program result. It's the medication plus the wraparound support that we give to members in our channel that really delivers the results for our customers.\nAnd as you know, our pharmacy benefit manager customers rely on us and depend on us in our expertise to deliver these types of solutions to make medications more affordable, which allow our clients to expand access to their members. And then lastly, the news on what we're launching in our 9,000 community health pharmacy locations. We're excited to be part of the NovoCare Pharmacy Network. This will enable us to provide convenient, safe, and affordable access to Wegovy for eligible patients. And again, we reiterate our excitement of this partnership and the value we're going to deliver for our clients and customers as we go forward.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThanks, Prem.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have the next question from Stephen Baxter with Wells Fargo on the line.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. Thanks. Just a follow-up on the healthcare benefits guidance. It looks like you had close to $1.6 billion worth of prior period development. Understanding that it seems like the individual losses are also increasing inside the P&L. But just trying to understand better, what are these prior period sort of revenue adjustments that you're talking about? I guess what business do those actually relate to, and how do we think about there's an impact to the prior year? Is there an impact to 2025 to consider?\nAnd then as we just think about your expectations around the kind of earnings that you can generate from exiting the individual business, I know you gave us the variable loss figure for the year. Is that the right way to think about the potential for year-over-year earnings contribution from exiting the exchanges, or are there other considerations we should be keeping in mind? Thank you.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHey, Stephen. So as you think about the development, here's what I can say. The development occurred across all business lines. The majority of the development was off the Q4 dates of service. The largest single source of favorability was Medicare, which is also our largest block of business. As you look at Medicare in particular, the largest driver of favorability in the Q4 was inpatient, but we also saw some favorability in our specialist categories. As you think about the offsets there, and your $1.6 billion that you're getting out of the roll forward, that's gross. That does not incorporate all the earnings that we took into all the impact that we took into earnings. A lot of that is put back into the reserve. You can't translate the billion six into the bottom line impact.\nSo the bottom line impact net of the revenue items is specifically the $400 million that we called out, which is the increase in the guidance this morning. Most of those changes are out of period, and they relate specifically to both Medicare and to the individual business, the individual exchange business. As you think about the losses then on the individual business, that's why we gave you the 350 to 400. This is a $7.5 billion block of business at this point, and so it carries with it a fair amount of fixed costs. It's unclear whether or not we'll be able to reallocate those fixed costs or whether we'll be able to take them out for the 2026 calendar year. So you should think about the year-over-year improvement as being the elimination of the variable loss, which will be in that 350 to 400 range.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have Elizabeth Anderson with Evercore ISI.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi, guys. Thanks so much for the question. I was wondering, two questions about your sort of guidance expectations. One, are you having any change in your guidance expectation on the back of the Wegovy announcement? It doesn't look like it, but I just wanted to check on that. And two, could you comment on how you see the potential tariff impact? I know some of the pieces are still very much moving, but maybe you could at least sort of comment on the front end of the store and then maybe some of your broader thoughts on potential other impact to the business. Thank you so much.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, Elizabeth. So the first answer on the Wegovy announcement is it is not impacting our guidance, and it's not factored in. This will be obviously savings that we will deliver for our customers. The customers will get the benefit of our negotiated savings. I think as we look at it, it's unknown at this point how the migration from the compound pharmacies into other pharmacy settings are going to occur, but we do expect that there will be obviously some benefit by opening up 9,000 stores or 9,000 opportunities for patients to be able to get the medication.\nAs it relates to tariffs, it's obviously a very fluid environment, and there's many variables in play at the moment. We look at it really in three different ways. The first is the front store, in which we currently source the vast majority of our front store items in American-based companies today. We do not see a significant impact as it relates to the tariffs. Where we are looking at impacts, we're looking at alternative sourcing and/or diversifying the suppliers. As it relates to the pharma supply chain, there's a lot of, what I would say, a lot of variables that will go into how this will be impacted depending on how we're dealing with both the country of origin as well as how we're looking at brands versus generics.\nIf I look at even the Novo announcement for GLP-1s, they manufacture that product here in the US. That will obviously get the benefit of a US-based manufacturing and be able to not be impacted by the tariffs. We're obviously watching closely the announcements that will be made over the course of the next week or so as it relates to how we're going to be dealing with tariffs with the pharmaceutical supply chain. As it relates to Aetna, because we're in the midst of preparing for our 2026 Medicare bid for both Part D and the MA, we are obviously watching closely the impact both of the pharmaceutical supply chains as well as the other medical devices and supplies that will impact the broader healthcare system. We are currently monitoring it and really more planning today for our 2026 bids as Aetna is contemplating the impacts of tariffs.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We have Andrew Mok with Barclays now.\n\nAndrew Mok\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on your comments at Oak Street where you noted some early signs of pressure. Can you elaborate on the nature and timing of what you're seeing there? And relatedly, is there anything that changed from year one to year two of V28 that was either unanticipated or more challenging from an operational perspective? Thanks.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nPriam, I'll let you take this question.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health\n\nThanks. Andrew, thanks for the question. The healthcare delivery business has performed in line with our expectations. As we said, some signs of pressure in the Q1 as it relates to medical cost trends at Oak Street. That is offset by some of the favorability we're seeing in other parts of healthcare delivery. Oak Street, it's still very immature or early in the year. We see that pressure. We're watching how claims will develop over the course of the next several months, and we'll report back on that piece. On the Signify business, it's a strong start to the year with our IHE volume. Our customers are really valuing the service that we provide and the operational excellence that we have there as well. So more to come as we go, but right now, we feel good overall about healthcare delivery with a little bit of pressure in Oak Street.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now have Michael Cherney with Leerink Partners on the line.\n\nMichael Cherney\n\nSenior Managing Director, Leerink Partners\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on PCW. Obviously, this is the Q1 that you've had the cost vantage impact. Anything you can say about the market impact, how it's trended based to your expectations? And then going forward, you've talked about the potential to roll this into government. Any updated thoughts there? Thanks.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nSo maybe before I turn it over to Priam, I think this is another example where you've heard consistently today the innovation that we're driving in the business, whether it be the prior authorization work that Steve Nelson is working on at Aetna, or the biosimilars that we announced last year, or now the Novo. I think this is another example where Priam and the PCW team have led on the front in terms of reshaping how pharmacy pricing is delivered in this country. So Priam, why don't you speak more broadly to Michael's question?\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health",
    "content2": "Yeah. So Mike, thanks for the question. And from my perspective, the PCW business continues to perform really strong. In the simple statement for the best-run national pharmacy period, if you think about how we're achieving our results, one, it's extremely strong execution in our 9,000 local community health destinations that are powered by our 200-plus thousand colleagues every single day that we're enabling. We continue to make labor investments and technology investments to continue to improve the workforce environment.\nWe continue to see our MPS of our colleagues improve in our stores, and we've transformed the technology and the operating model in our stores to better serve our customers. Lastly, we've really focused on our omnichannel capabilities inside of our stores to really connect care and make those experiences better and more convenient for our customers. If you look at the quarter, there's probably three things that impacted PCW. First, front store. If you think about the challenging macro environment, we're pleased with our performance.\nWe saw a shift in seasonal illness in Q1, and we had a double peak from that seasonal double peak of that seasonal illness that contributed to our outperformance. We also grew our customer base in the front store and increased our frequency of trips. So those are both two really promising signs as we go into the back half. The second piece is in our pharmacy business. Our script comp growth was approximately 7%. Our share is now at 27.6%. So we're really excited about what we're delivering there. As it relates to CostVantage, we're still early. We're obviously in Q1 of the transformation into a much more transparent model that allows our payer customers to get the value that we receive from our industry-leading cost of goods in a much more transparent way.\nAs you recall from November 2023, when we first announced this, the goal of this is to address, one, the cross-subsidization that exists in the marketplace across brands and generics, and to create stable, more predictable margins and pass the value back to payers in a much more predictable way when we receive that. Where we are today, we've moved 100% of our commercial scripts, as we said, on 1125 into cost manage. We've moved the cash discount card space into cost manage as well. We're working very hard for 1126 to move the rest of our scripts into this model. We'll provide more updates on the outcomes of this, but we're really pleased with where we are with this, and we're really pleased with the results of PCW and the strong performance powered by the 200,000 colleagues we have in retail.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAnd Michael, just one thing to add. As we look in the back half of the year, obviously, PCW is running as well as we would expect, with the one caution to watch out is the vaccines and immunizations as we anticipate volume impacts depending on the government action for the end of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nWe now have Charles Rhyee with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking the question. David, I wanted to circle back to your comments earlier about the law passed in Arkansas. Obviously, I think it's been reported that you could end up potentially closing sort of your retail locations in the state. Obviously, some other states are considering kind of similar legislation. Certainly, maybe Arkansas is an easy state to exit from if you had to. But if we think this gets adopted more broadly, and I think back to the Blue Shield of California contract where they kind of split that contract up, and you guys ended up retaining the specialty pharmacy part of the business. I think at the time, you guys had said that was obviously the most profitable part of the business.\nIf that's the case and we see a future where sort of splitting these businesses, and I understand the argument why having a vertically integrated business makes more sense, but if you had to divest one or the other, is it fair to think that you would look to divest maybe the PBM part of the business and retain specialty pharmacy? If that's the case, is that a difficult kind of process to enact if you had to? Just a quick follow-up to Lisa's question earlier, Wegovy being on the national formulary, I assume that comes with a better rebate structure? Thanks.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAll right. Charles, thanks for the question. Let me first talk about Arkansas because I think it's important in terms of just stating how we see, at least laying out the facts as we see them. One is we believe this is really bad policy, and it's putting a lot of patients at risk. It's taking the most competitive pharmacies out of the marketplace, and so it will essentially increase the cost on the backs of the consumer. So I think when you take a step back and look at this, this is going to be impactful both in terms of cost and disruption in access. There's over 300,000 people that we currently serve with more than 4 million prescriptions.\nSo it's going to create what we know will be the headline of the day, which is pharmacy deserts and access problems. So when you look at the most vulnerable population, which is the specialty population, as I mentioned in the opening comments, there's 10,000 patients that will be disrupted and/or potentially have access to care issues. And not to mention the savings that we've delivered for biosimilars and other things that we've taken cost out of our plan sponsors' pockets and actually saved the consumer's money. So this is what I believe that most other states are looking at and saying whether or not this is going to be picked up across the country. I recognize that there are other states that are looking at this. We've had some really positive developments over the last couple of weeks with states that have rejected this notion.\nI think they've done this in large part because the plan sponsors and the payers are going to see their cost go up, and they're going to see the complexity of being able to meet the access needs of the patients. So as we look in presenting the facts, I do believe that common sense will prevail and that we won't have to make the decisions that you're asking us with what businesses we are or not going to be in. Because I do believe in the power of and the ability for us to be able to serve customers through the integrated assets that we currently operate. So as it relates to Wegovy, the obvious answer is this is what a PBM does. When there's enough supply in the marketplace, we create competition, and we ultimately lower costs for the customers in which we serve.\nThat is also now going to be delivered to the pharmacies that we run and operate. So if you go back to the Arkansas example, we are now opening up Wegovy access to 9,000 pharmacies and potentially not being they will not be an affordable retail access in their state if this continues. So I think when you look more broadly at the role that we play, I think that we clearly have, I think, the fact base and I think the proof points to be able to demonstrate the value that we're bringing. But thanks for the question, Charles. All right. One more question, operator.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have the last question from Ann Hynes with Mizuho.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nSenior Healthcare Services Equity Analyst and Managing Director, Mizuho\n\nYep. Great. Thank you. Can you just provide a little bit more commentary on your commentary on the flu in your prepared remarks? I guess what makes you a little bit more concerned? Is it just less support from the CDC? And can you remind us how many flu vaccines you do a year and what you have embedded in guidance for a potential change in behavior? And additionally, are you just worried about the flu? Or is it your entire vaccine portfolio that you might be a little bit more worried about given the Washington environment? Thanks.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Yeah. Thank you, Ann. And I'll let Priam answer this, but this is more broadly the immunization and vaccination program that we're talking about. So Priam, you want to address the question?\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health\n\nYeah. So as Tom and David said in our prepared remarks, we're monitoring a few things. One is consumer sentiment. What I would say is around vaccines and potential changes in the protocols required to deliver these, the pressure that we're contemplating is primarily around COVID vaccines and if there's some changes in terms of those requirements. So there's a committee called ACIP that meets in the middle of the year that will kind of help derive and make sure that we understand what the national standards are for delivery of this. What I'll say is our stores are prepared and ready to deliver vaccinations. We continue to create a really good consumer experience to deliver that. We continue to see really good progress in terms of our ability to gain share of the total addressable market of patients that need vaccines. So it's really around the size of the entire market as it relates to COVID.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAll right. Thank you, Priam. Before I end the call, I want to thank over 300,000 dedicated colleagues for the work you do every day. Your commitment to serving our consumers, patients, and members are important drivers of the strong results we deliver this quarter and key contributors in our journey to become America's most trusted healthcare company. Thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to providing updates as we progress throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you all for joining today's conference call with CVS Health. The time confirmed today's call has now concluded. You may now disconnect. Thank you for your participation, and please enjoy the rest of your day."

My name is Brika, and I will be your moderator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to pass the conference over to your host, Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer. Thank you. You may proceed, Larry.\n\nLaurence F. McGrath\n\nSenior Vice President of Business Development & Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Chief Strategy Officer; I'm joined this morning by David Joyner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members to the leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-K filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it be archived for 1 year.\nDuring this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are stuck to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forwarding statements and risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K, filed this morning, and on our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release.\nDuring this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition. And you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David. David?\n\nJ. David Joyner\n\nExecutive VP & President of Pharmacy Services\n\nThank you, Larry, and good morning, everyone. This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.19 and adjusted operating income of $2.7 billion. We also provided our full year 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6.\nOur initial expectations reflect meaningful recovery in our Aetna business particularly in Medicare Advantage, as well as continued growth in Health Services. Tom will provide a more detailed overview of the components of this guidance as well as a breakdown by segment.\nI'd like to spend some time taking a step back and sharing with you my observations during my first 100 days as CEO. During this time, I have connected with shareholders, customers and clients. I have met with and heard from elected officials and, importantly, I have spent a great deal of time listening to our consumers and colleagues. I've come away inspired from these conversations and with a clear and strength and understanding of what we need to do to realize the tremendous promise to CVS Health.\nWe can be America's leading and most trusted health care company. A company that measures itself by its ability to improve outcomes, increase access and lower the cost of care, while ensuring a consumer experience that we can be proud of. The combination of these measures will ultimately deliver greater shareholder value.\nWhat makes me confident that we can deliver on this promise? One, CVS Health's collection of assets, its reach, its connection with 185 million Americans, whether in our stores or in our clinics, through our health plan or by managing the pharmacy benefits, CVS Health is unlike any other company in the United States, and with that comes opportunity and a responsibility to make a difference.\nWe take this responsibility seriously and have shown that throughout our history. We did this 10 years ago when we removed tobacco from our stores. We did this with urgency when the country needed us during the pandemic. And we do this today as we fight rising drug prices as we create a viable biosimilar market, and as we innovate the pharmacy model to reduce frictions in the health system, to name a few. We will continue to deliver on this responsibility by being innovative and bold to do what's right for our consumers and customers.\nTwo, our over 300,000 colleagues reflect the backgrounds and experiences of all Americans and the communities we serve. I can say every day that our colleagues come to work dedicated to making health care in America better for those we serve. In my conversation with our colleagues, I'm proud to say that there are many thousands of inspiring stories for everyone where we could have done better.\nThree, while there are external factors that pose near-term challenges, there are also many reasons to be excited. The broader demographic trends of an aging population, advances in AI and technology, the need for personalized care and the activations of the American public to create an improved consumer experience, are opportunities where we are best positioned to lead.\nHow will we realize this over the short and long term? My leadership team and I have spent our time together developing a clear set of priorities. Collectively, we are committed to delivering on the promise of CVS Health. We believe that aligning the power of our employees and the CVS Health enterprise behind 4 specific priorities will deliver on our potential and, ultimately, the results and experiences that we can all be proud of.\nFirst, ensuring that each one of our businesses is best-in-class through strong execution. Most importantly, we need to deliver on our turnaround at Aetna and restore this business to target margins. Second, continuing to develop our integrated capabilities where it matters in order to make health care better, more affordable and more accessible.\nThird, advancing our leading digital strategy, investing in emerging technologies that drive simplicity and efficiency, while delivering better experiences for the people we serve. And finally, ensuring that we are disciplined stewards of capital as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, manage our portfolio of businesses and the capital to create value for our shareholders.\nI'm working closely with my team to ensure we have the right talent, structures and collaboration across our enterprise to execute and deliver on these important priorities.\nCVS Health operates in some of the most critical areas of care, and our connections to the people we serve across the country has never been more important because of the challenges we see throughout the U.S. health care system. Rising health care costs put pressure on consumers as they see increasing challenges with affordability. These rising health care costs also put pressure on employers and the government, who largely pay the bill for health care.\nTo be clear, health care costs are increasing because of the combination of greater utilization, rising provider costs, labor shortages and dramatic price hikes for branded pharmaceuticals.\nOur teams are focused on delivering on our mission, and we are working hard to directly address the challenges in the health care system. We are using tools across our enterprise to deliver exceptional value and differentiated experiences to our customers and clients.\nOne of the most powerful courses helping to offset rising health care costs are PBMs like Caremark. These entities remain the only part of the drug supply chain entirely focused on lowering cost, but have erroneously been subject to deceptive rhetoric and misinformation. For more than 3 decades, PBMs have been a proven, unequivocal mechanism to negotiate down the price of drugs for payers and consumers, while promoting better adherence and better health.\nIn drugs that have no rebates where PBM tools are limited, we've seen egregious price hikes with prices for those drugs increasing more than twice as fast as drugs where we can secure rebates. In the first 3 weeks of January alone, branded drug manufacturers added $21 billion of annual gross drug spend through their price items. Our work is a critical counterbalance to the monopolistic tendencies of drug manufacturers. This is why PBMs are needed and why manufacturers fight so hard to limit our capabilities.\nMultiple well-known economists have estimated that PBMs generated net value for the U.S. health care system of over $100 billion per year. No one has demonstrated more success than the PBMs that are driving down drug prices. For example, is the prior administration's negotiated maximum fair price, MFP, for the first 10 drugs as part of the Inflation Reduction Act. Not only had PBMs kept the rate of drug inflation in Medicare Part D at 1.3% per annum in the last 18 years, CVS Caremark specifically negotiated rates that contributed to a $1 billion improvement better than MFP.\nMore importantly, if we don't continue to negotiate further discounts beyond MFP, the loss savings will go directly into the pockets of broad manufactures. So when you look at all the data, not cherry-pick data points like those specifically referenced in the SEC interim reports, the conclusion is clear, PBMs deliver savings to their clients.\nCaremark has been and continues to be a critical solution to help your Americans pay less for drugs. We will continue to play our unique role in the drug supply chain, bringing the full breadth of our capabilities and market expertise to reduce drug prices for all customers.\nThroughout our history, we've led our industry in innovating to solve the issues most important to our clients and customers, whether it's cost, transparency, access to care or experiences. A recent example of how we're using our enterprise assets to solve important issues for our clients and help offset the rising health care costs is through actions we've taken in the biosimilar market.\nIn 2024, through the combination of Cordavis, Caremark and CVS Specialty, we converted more than 90% of eligible HUMIRA patients to a biosimilar at a list price that was more than 80% below the price branded HUMIRA. This enabled us to offer a $0 out-of-pocket cost for individuals consumers and generated almost $1 billion of savings for our clients. We are the only company that meaningfully drove biosimilar adoption amongst our clients and will continue to do so with a growing pipeline of additional biosimilars.\nIn our Pharmacy businesses, we delivered exceptional experiences with record high levels of NPS in our retail business and PBM retention rates consistently in the high 90s. However, we also recognize that in order to continue improving our customers' experiences, health care needs to be more transparent. So in 2023, we took a leadership role to create a pathway for increased transparency and simplicity across the pharmacy marketplace. We addressed this with the introduction of 2 important transparent price models.\nThe first is Caremark's TrueCost model. As a reminder, today, we passed through 99% rebates to our clients. When fully implemented, TrueCost enables patients to see those lower cost at the pharmacy counter, including the full pass-through of the rebates we generated from our negotiations with the manufacturers. TrueCost continued to resonate in the commercial marketplace and now have more than 75% of Caremark's commercial members, with 2 or more elements of the model in their pharmacy [indiscernible].\nThe second is CVS Pharmacy's CostVantage. Effective January 1, all of our commercial scripts dispensed through CVS Pharmacy are contracted through our innovative and transparent CVS CostVantage model. Under this new framework, we have tied reimbursement to our acquisition cost and will deliver savings to our payer partners as we continue to relentlessly drive down prices. Our team is now working to deliver our cost-based solution for Medicare and Medicaid markets.\nThese models remove the market basket approach and the unintended consequences that existed in the pharmacy reimbursement, ensuring that patients continue to have access to the most durable and frequent interaction in their health care journey. We are also focused on expanding access to high-quality care to help address some of the provider shortages facing in the U.S. with their health care delivery businesses, continuing to see full growth.\nSignify had a record volume year supported by growth in Aetna members, which nearly doubled to last year. We've also seen an accelerated patient growth at Oak Street, supported by enterprise connections. We continue to expand access to this leading care model and ratifying opportunities to utilize market-leading capabilities more broadly across the enterprise.\nWe are advancing technology to reduce frictions that partner the experience Americans have when they utilize their benefits and make it difficult to navigate the complex U.S. health care system. Our updated CVS Health App makes it easier for consumers to manage their health by giving them seamless access to appointments, copay details and perception status. We're also leveraging AI to create a more intuitive workflow and faster turnaround time to reduce frustrations for our members and provider partners.\nWhile we are working to address the issues across the U.S. health care system, we are also focused on addressing the performance challenges within our own business. At Aetna, we drove meaningful progress improving and strengthening our operations. We have significant opportunities to unlock embedded earnings that is most pronounced in our Medicare Advantage business. Our focus remains on delivering on our commitments to our Medicare Advantage members while creating a viable path to appropriate margins.\nIn line with our commentary, we expect that we will shrink the Medicare Advantage membership by high single-digit percentage from year-end 2024. Our deliberate approach to our 2025 Medicare Advantage business, combined with our improved star ratings, will improve margins this year and are part of our ongoing commitment to restore this business to target margins of 3% to 5%.\nLast month, CMS released the proposed 2026 Medicare Advantage Advance Rate Notice. This update does not address the unprecedented utilization trend experienced across the industry over the past 2 years. Our team is advocating for a more appropriate rate update, including adjustments for the industry-wide cost trends seen in 2024. We are encouraged by the constructive dialogue with the new administration to help ensure that American seniors will not continue to see significant disruption to their benefits driven by drastic changes to the Medicare Advantage plan.\nBeyond Medicare, we are also encouraged by progress in our other Aetna lines of business. We are advancing our rate efficacy efforts in Medicaid, we've seen high retention and strong welcome season in our national accounts book and have made meaningful progress in the rightsizing of our individual exchange footprint.\nEvery day, we work hard to improve the health of all the people we serve. This is always a top priority at CVS Health. While we have made progress addressing some of the frictions that exist in the U.S. health care system, including leading the industry and increasing transparency and simplicity, we know the health care system to be better. Our unique collection of assets and our deep connections with our consumers, members and patients position us to deliver a better and differentiated experience to everyone we serve.\nWe have strong momentum heading into 2025. We have the right assets, the right leadership and the right strategy in place. Our dedicated employees put our members, patients and consumers at the center of everything we do. We have worked hard to stabilize our Aetna business, and have made meaningful progress to address the issues that led to the underperformance in 2024. We are well positioned to be the leader in driving change in the health care system.\nAs I hand the call over to Tom, I want to reiterate the importance of delivering on our commitments to our shareholders. We are focused on building trust and establishing credibility as we work hard to deliver on our financial performances in 2025 and beyond. Tom?\n\nThomas Francis Cowhey\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Accounting Officer, Surgery Partners, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'll start with a few highlights on total company performance.\nFourth quarter revenues of nearly $98 billion increased more than 4% over the prior year quarter, primarily driven by growth in our Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of over $2.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.19, as we saw strong performance across multiple lines of business and favorable prior period reserve development in our Aetna business.\nFull year cash flow from operations was approximately $9.1 billion, benefiting from early receipt of cash, particularly in our Pharmacy Services business.\nTurning to our segments. In Health Care Benefits, we grew revenues to approximately $33 billion, an increase of over 23% over the prior year quarter, reflecting growth in all lines of business. Medical membership of approximately 27.1 million was roughly flat sequentially, as membership in our Individual Exchange business started to modestly decline in advance of the 2025 rate increases we took in that book.\nDuring the quarter, the segment generated an adjusted operating loss of $439 million. This result was lower than the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a higher medical benefit ratio, partially offset by the release of the premium deficiency reserve we recorded in the third quarter, higher levels of favorable prior period reserve development and increased net investment income.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 94.8% increased 630 basis points from the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher utilization, the premium impact of lower Star ratings for payment year 2024 and higher acuity in Medicaid, partially offset by a 220 basis point impact from the already mentioned premium deficiency reserves recorded in the third quarter, as well as higher levels of favorable prior period reserve development.\nWhile medical trends remain elevated, the experience we observed to date was less severe than the trends we assumed in the downside scenario we discussed last quarter. Importantly, during the quarter, we experienced positive prior period reserve development across all lines of business, primarily related to second and third quarter days of service.\nIn our Medicare book, continued [indiscernible] trend levels were attributable to the same categories we discussed last quarter, including inpatient, outpatient, supplemental benefits and pharmacy. Relative to our downside scenario discussed on the third quarter call, we did see some moderation of inpatient trends, while supplemental benefit costs remains steadily high. We are cautiously optimistic that our benefit design changes in 2025 will help alleviate some of the supplemental benefit structure.\nIn our Medicaid business, acuity remained consistent with the latter part of the third quarter. as redeterminations have largely concluded across our state footprint. We continue to work closely with our partners to align rates with the changes in acuity. During the quarter, we made additional progress on rate updates, and with over 40% of our book having repriced in early January 2025, we have a line of sight to a mid-4 percentage point rate increase. Our overall rate advocacy efforts are currently on track.\nIn our group commercial risk book, fourth quarter trends remained elevated. And similar to others in the industry, we experienced some pressure on our stop-loss business, which represents less than 3% of our 2024 premiums. We continue to take a cautious outlook on medical cost trends in this block and combined with lower membership, we expect lower contributions from this business in '25.\nFinally, in our Individual Exchange book of business, we saw continued acceleration of medical cost trends, driven by the specialist, inpatient and ambulatory categories. As we discussed on prior calls, we made meaningful price adjustments at our offerings for this product in 2025, which will lead to a significant rationalization of membership, while also shifting mix towards brand plans. Taken together, these actions should improve results in our Individual Exchange offerings in 2025.\nDays claims payable at the end of the quarter was 44 days, down 0.6 days sequentially, primarily reflective of seasonality. DCP was down 1.9 days from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by growth in our Medicare business and the impact of increased pharmacy trends. We remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nOur Health Services segment generated revenues of approximately $47 billion during the quarter, a decrease of approximately 4% year-over-year and primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partly offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from our health care delivery assets and growth in Specialty Pharmacy.\nFourth quarter adjusted operating income of nearly $1.8 billion drove a full year result of $7.24 billion, just shy of the high end of the previous guidance range we reiterated for investors last quarter. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating income increased 5% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements, the previously announced loss of a large client and the impact of higher health care costs in our health care delivery assets that are tied to Medicare, including CVS Accountable Care and Oak Street Health. The decrease were largely offset by improved purchasing economics and increased volume at Signify.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were nearly $500 million and total pharmacy services membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately $90 million.\nWe ended the year with another strong quarter of growth in our health care delivery business. As David mentioned, Signify achieved a record volume year completing over 3 million in home health evaluations. This performance contributed to revenue growth in the quarter of approximately 32% as compared to the prior year.\nWe continue to experience strong top line growth at Oak Street, supported by our enterprise connections. During the quarter, Oak Street revenue increased approximately 39% over the prior year, driven by patient growth. Total at-risk members increased approximately 35% compared to the same quarter last year. While the Medicare Advantage industry experienced elevated utilization throughout 2024, Oak Street's care model achieved a trend lower than the broader industry.\nOur Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment delivered another strong quarter. We generated revenues of over $33 billion, an increase of approximately 7% versus the prior year quarter and over 10% on a same-store basis. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.8 billion declined approximately 13% from the prior year quarter, primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower front store volumes, partially offset by improved drug purchase. Results in the fourth quarter were also lower due to [indiscernible] of immunizations into the third quarter.\nSame-store pharmacy sales in the quarter increased 13% versus the prior year. and same-store prescription volumes increased nearly 6%. Same-store front store sales were down approximately 1% versus the same quarter last year. We successfully completed our 3-year store closure plan and are progressing further footprint optimization in 2025. Despite the reduction in our store count, we continue to maintain a retail pharmacy script share position of over 27%.\nThis highlights our strong execution, robust omnichannel capabilities and our ability to deliver superior customer experiences, while maintaining a deep community presence, with 85% of Americans within 10 miles of a CVS application.\nShifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. We generated cash flows from operations of approximately $9.1 billion for the full year. This result was higher than our expectations due to early payment for Pharmacy Services business will correspondingly lower our expected cash flows in 2025. During the quarter, we returned $838 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend, bringing total shareholder dividend payments in 2024 to over $3.3 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately $3.8 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 7x, which remains above our long-term target. During the quarter, we executed a liability management transaction that included the issuance of $3 billion of subordinated debt securities and the retirement of approximately $2.6 billion of outstanding debt principal. The net result of these transactions modestly reduced our leverage ratio.\nWe are committed to prudent financial policies, including maintenance of our current dividend, as we look to maintain and improve our investment-grade rating and expect our leverage to return to more normalized levels as we continue to execute on margin recovery in the Aetna business.\nShifting now to outlook for 2025. As David mentioned, we are establishing our initial full year 2025 guidance for adjusted EPS in the range of $5.75 to $6. Consistent with past practice, this range does not assume the recurrence of prior year reserve development, which contributed approximately $0.18 to our 2024 GPS results.\nAfter excluding the favorable impact of prior year reserve development, our initial 2025 adjusted EPS guidance represents year-over-year growth of approximately 10% at the low end of the range. We believe this represents an appropriately achievable baseline with opportunities for outperformance.\nIncorporated across our guidance elements is the initial down payment on our multiyear $2 billion cost efficiency ever. Based on our work to date, we were successful in identifying actions that, at a minimum, will offset the return of certain variable expenses in 2025, as we work to drive further efficiencies across the enterprise over the coming years.\nNow let's turn to some of the segment details. I'll start with our Health Care Benefits segment. We expect aggregate membership to decline by over 1 million members, primarily driven by reductions in our Individual Exchange and Medicare products. We estimate that membership in our Individual Exchange block could contract by over 800,000 lives, and we'll have greater visibility when all effectuated members have paved their premiums by being launched.\nWe also expect our Medicare Advantage membership to end the year down a high single-digit percentage from year-end 2024. This is consistent with the guidance we have said investors since last summer and have strong execution by our team as they lead the difficult choices necessary to improve Medicare Advantage profitability in 2025. These membership declines are going to be partially offset by growth in our Commercial self-insured business.\nWe expect to generate Health Care Benefits revenue of approximately $132 billion as membership declines in Med Advantage and Individual Exchange are offset by Medicare program changes and growth in other products.\nAt the low end of our Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income guidance range, we project our medical benefit ratio will improve by 100 basis points over 2024, yielding an MBR of approximately 91.5%. Our performance on this ratio is one of the largest potential factors that could drive us higher in our adjusted EPS guidance range.\nThe largest driver of the reduction in our medical benefit ratio is projected an improvement in our government businesses, particularly in Medicare Advantage. We also project year-over-year improvement in our combined commercial lines business, driven by margin recovery in Individual Exchange, offset by pressures in group Commercial from membership declines and elevated levels of medical cost. We also expect that the contribution from net investment income will decline.\nOverall, we expect Health Care Benefits to deliver adjusted operating income of at least $1.5 billion. This projection reflects a respectful view of trends in light of the continued elevated medical cost trends that we experienced in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, every point of trend is worth approximately $800 million of Health Care Benefits adjusted operating income results.\nShifting now to our Health Services segment. We expect revenue of approximately $185 billion, primarily driven by growth at Caremark as we continue to deliver value to our clients. Adjusted operating income for this segment is expected to grow approximately 4% on to $7.54 billion. While our 2025 guidance reflects continued core Pharmacy Services, the overall Health Services segment growth rate is diluted by headwinds in our Health Care Delivery business.\nAs you know, results in our Health Care Delivery business are highly correlated to Medicare Advantage medical cost trends and regulations. And at this stage, we have taken a prudent outlook on how these will develop throughout 2025. This initial guidance is consistent with the preview we presented last quarter where we noted that our initial outlook for this segment to be below our long-term growth framework, but would prudently reflect opportunities for upside over the course of the year.\nWe expect health care delivery performance to improve starting in 2026 as the current medical cost trends experienced across the industry are more appropriately reflected in rates and planned bids and our continued investments in this business mature.\nNow for our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. We project script growth of approximately 3.5% and revenue of approximately $134 billion. We expect adjusted operating income to decline approximately 5%, in line with our long-term guidance framework to $5.48 billion. As we have discussed previously, 2025 is a transition year for CVS CostVantage, and we believe the implementation of this model positions the trajectory of the PCW business over time.\nWe expect interest expense to increase approximately $300 million as we annualize the expense associated with our debt offerings in May and December of '24. We project our tax rate to be approximately 25.5%. We also expect our share count to increase modestly to approximately 1.271 billion shares, and we are not contemplating any share repurchases in 2021.\nFinally, we expect cash flow from operations to be approximately $6.5 billion. The operating cash flow declined versus 2024 is primarily driven by late year timing items that were pulled forward into 2024 cash flow, as well as the impact of lower risk membership on health care cost payable reserves and risk-adjusted revenue accruals, partially offset by improved operating performance in our Health Care Benefits business.\nOver the '24 and 2025 calendar years, we expect that our business generated operating cash flows of $15.6 billion, which, when combined with improving operating performance, will help put us back on the path to our target leverage levels.\nAs you think about the cadence of earnings in 2025, we expect earnings to be more weighted to the first half than the second half, likely a 55-45 split. Seasonal patterns in most of our segments should remain largely unchanged compared to 2024, with the notable exception of our Health Care Benefits segment, where the Part D changes due to the inflation Reduction Act, the timing of premium deficiency reserves recorded in 2024 will significantly change the progression of earnings.\nYou can find additional details on the components of our 2025 guidance on our Investor Relations website.\nWe are encouraged by our opportunities in 2025 and are excited to demonstrate the enormous potential that we see across CVS Health to unlock embedded earnings. We are working tirelessly to restore Aetna to target margins, which, over time, should represent meaningful upside above the high end of our 2025 guidance range.\nWith that, we will now open the call to your questions.

My name is Adam and I'll be your operator today. If you'd like to ask a question at the Q&A portion of today's call, you may do so by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad.\nI will now hand the floor to\nLarry McGrath to begin, so Larry, please go ahead when you're ready.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSVP of Business Development and Investor Relations, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health second quarter 2024 earnings call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, and, along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC, today's call is also being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year.\nDuring this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed in Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to our investor relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the\ncall over to Karen.\nKaren\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you. Larry, good morning everyone.\nThanks for joining our call today. Today we reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.83 and adjusted operating income of\n$3.7 billion for the quarter. Our total revenues were more than $91 billion and we generated $8 billion of operating cash flow in the first half of the year.\nWe are also updating our full year.\n2024 Adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.40 to 6.65 based on the continued pressure in our Health Care Benefits business offset by strong performance in Health Services.\nThe Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness business.\nThe majority of our businesses are performing well, and we continue to drive the\nintegrated value of our company by executing\non our strategy to connect people to the care and the coverage they need.\nHowever, we are disappointed by the current\nperformance and outlook for the Health Care Benefits\nsegment and I have decided to make leadership changes. Effective immediately, Brian Kane is leaving the company. In the interim, I will assume direct leadership of the Health Care Benefits segment.\nAs you know, managed care has been an integral part of both my and Tom Cowhey's professional careers, and we will be overseeing the day-to-day management of this business. In addition, Katrina Guerraz, our Chief Strategy Officer, will become the Chief Operating Officer of the Health Care Benefits segment.\nKatrina is a 20-year Aetna veteran.\nWith extensive commercial and Medicare experience and has a track record of operational excellence. We are committed to returning health care benefits to its rightful place and will drive execution and address the challenges facing this business.\nLooking across the enterprise today, CVS Health.\nServes more than 186 million people and we are making continued progress in proving that our integrated model create value. When individuals engage with two or more offerings, we can deliver better health experiences and outcomes.\nOver the first half of the year.\nWe expanded the number of consumers accessing two or more CVS Health offerings to 57.7 million, an increase of nearly two and a half million consumers. We grew the number of Aetna medical members utilizing CVS pharmacies to 9 million.\nAn increase of 8% from the prior year.\nWe also now have 13.8 million Aetna Medical members who are covered by Caremark.\nAn increase of 13% compared to last year. We extended our digital reach with nearly 60 million unique digital customers utilizing.\nOur platform to schedule health services, appointments, fill prescriptions, and purchase wellness products, all contributing to the growth in our business. We are committed to transforming the industry with innovative pharmacy models that create greater transparency, reflect the true cost of drugs.\nalign incentives across stakeholders. We are driving significant progress on the.\nAdoption of CVS CostVantage and CVS Caremark TrueCost. To date, we signed CVS CostVantage agreements with eight pharmacy benefit managers including CVS Caremark, who combined make up more than 50% of our commercial script. Discussions with our large QVM partners are active and constructive as we move forward with full implementation for our commercial contracts.\nOn 1 January 2025.\nOur TrueCost offering is resonating with commercial clients as they strive to ensure pricing, simplicity, and transparency for their members. We firmly believe that TrueCost will reshape.\nThe future of pricing for every drug.\nEvery condition, and every member. Additionally, we implemented this model for CVS Health's more than 300,000 colleagues.\nBiosimilars create a meaningful opportunity to deliver additional pharmacy savings to our clients.\nThrough Cordavis, we introduced our biosimilar products at a price more than 80% lower.\nthan a reference brand, and we are the only company to move biosimilar share.\nWe have processed approximately 100,000 for Davis.\nBiosimilar prescriptions since we launched our formulary.\nChange on 1 April, which has contributed to nearly $400 million in net savings.\nFor our clients and their members. Cordavis and its success in the biosimilar market was possible because of the combined assets of CVS Health.\nWe will continue to expand our offerings.\nAnd drive greater access and savings for our customers.\nBefore I share updates on performance in each of our segments, I want to.\nProvide an update on the enterprise productivity initiatives we discussed on our last call. We identified a multiyear opportunity to deliver $2 billion in savings. These savings will be driven by further streamlining and optimizing our operations and processes, continuing to rationalize our business portfolio, and accelerating the use of artificial intelligence and.\nAutomation across the enterprise as we consolidate and integrate platform. We will be thoughtful and deliberate as.\nWe execute these actions to ensure we continue to meet consumer needs. These savings will create both capacity to invest in our businesses and opportunities for outperformance.\nNow let's look at our businesses in detail in Health Care Benefits.\nRevenues for the quarter grew to over $32 billion, and we delivered nearly $1.\nBillion in Adjusted operating income.\nMedical membership was nearly 27 million, primarily.\nReflecting growth in our Medicare and individual exchange businesses. Our Medical Benefit Ratio for the quarter was 89.6%. Utilization in our Medicare business remained at elevated levels but was largely in line with expectations. Following the close of Q2, we saw indications of potential trend acceleration.\nWhich we have contemplated in our revised guidance range.\nSimilar to others in the industry, we.\nSaw an increase in the dislocation between.\nMedicaid acuity levels and rates. We will continue working closely with our.\nState partners to advocate for rates that more closely align with changes in acuity within the quarter. Our MBR also reflected the impact of the final 2023 risk adjustment for our individual exchange business. Tom will provide additional details on utilization and the risk adjustment update. In June, we submitted our bids for the 2025 Medicare Advantage plan. Our bids went through a rigorous internal review, and we are confident in our.\nPricing for 2025, which reflects prudent assumptions for utilization trends.\nThe actions we took are expected to drive 100 to 200 basis points of margin recovery in 2025 off of our current baseline and start the multi year pathway to achieving target margins of 4% to 5. As we have previously discussed, we expect to see a decline in Medicare membership.\nIn 2025, driven by our margin recovery efforts. In our commercial business, we expect membership growth in 2025, driven by new business.\nWins and strong retention, both of which are running ahead of where we were at this time last year.\nOur retention rate is in the high.\n90s with our national accounts business.\nIn our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness business.\nWe effectively navigated a changing consumer environment.\nDelivered another strong quarter that exceeded our expectations. We grew revenues for the segment to.\nApproximately $30 billion, up nearly 4% versus the prior year, and generated $1.2 billion.\nOf Adjusted operating income in the quarter. Our growing pharmacy share, now at a.\nRecord high of approximately 27.2% was a meaningful contributor to these results.\nWe continue playing a key role in.\nDelivering important community health services as demonstrated by the approximately 2 million immunizations we administered in the quarter.\nWe are on track to achieve our.\nThree year goal of closing 900 stores.\nBy the end of this year. With 851 stores closed to date.\nWe continue to exceed our goals for both colleagues and script retention as we look at the standalone stores. We.\nHave remaining across our national footprint, substantially all are profitable. This measure highlights our leadership in this business and our ability to operate nationally while delivering unmatched levels of consumer service. Our position will only improve as we.\nContinue to optimize our footprint and implement innovations like CVS CostVantage.\nIn our Health Services segment, we generated.\nRevenues of more than $42 billion and deliver $1.9 billion in Adjusted operating income. Our pharmacy services business, the largest component.\nThe Health Services segment delivered strong results driven by the execution on core principles.\nOf this business, lowering drug costs and creating savings for our clients.\nWe have retained approximately 99% of.\nEmployer clients in the 2025 selling season. I want to take a moment to address the interim 6(b) study released by the FTC. We fundamentally disagree with the FTC position. When you look at the data, there is clear evidence that PBMs play a crucial role in reducing drug costs.\nWe have a decades-long track record.\nOf protecting American businesses, unions, and patients.\nFrom rising prices on prescription drugs. We use competition among manufacturers to help keep drug costs affordable for our members.\nThe FTC's report focuses on issues of the past.\nWe are leading the industry as we.\nInnovate our business model. With our TrueCost offering, we believe our model helps ensure greater transparency in pricing and helps consumers to be confident in their pharmacy benefit that is providing the best possible price. Additionally, our programs help patients affordably access.\nCritical drugs like insulin. Our members on average pay less than $25 for insulin.\nThrough our Reduced Rx program, we provide.\nAccess to $25 insulin to every customer, whether insured, underinsured, or uninsured. We are committed to delivering value every.\nDay to our clients and our members.\nIn our healthcare delivery business.\nWe are driving meaningful progress connecting patients to health services across all of our channels. Primary and acute care health services in.\nThe home and clinical programs. Signify exceeded expectations, delivering another quarter of record volume.\nWe also continue to grow our patient base among Medicare Advantage members with our primary care clinics.\nOak Street at-risk patients grew to 235,000, up nearly 30% over the same quarter last year.\nWe are accelerating opportunities that drive integrated.\nValue by connecting Signify and Oak Street to CVS Health assets such as Aetna.\nMinuteClinic and CVS Pharmacy.\nSince we closed our healthcare delivery acquisition, Signify now serves nearly twice as many Aetna members and to date the number of Aetna members at Oak Street Health has more than tripled. We expect this number to further expand as we introduce co-branded Aetna and Oak Street plans in the 2025 annual enrollment period.\nWe continue to use the powerful relationship.\nWe have with patients at the pharmacy counter.\nThis quarter we saw a 7x.\nIncrease in the number of pharmacy scheduled IHEs compared to last quarter.\nWe have many points of differentiation that position CVS Health to win.\nOur biggest differentiator is how we are bringing our assets together to deliver integrated solutions for our customers. We are working effectively to address the challenges we face in 2024.\nThe steps we are taking include our disciplined approach to Medicare Advantage pricing, progress on our innovative pharmacy model, and our biosimilar strategy, early wins in both Caremark and Aetna selling season, and accelerating the integration of healthcare delivery assets. These actions combined with our multi year.\nProductivity initiatives and improved operational performance in our healthcare benefits segment give us the confidence that we are building positive momentum.\nAs we look to 2025 and beyond. I will now pass it over to.\nTom for a more detailed view of our Q2 results.\nTom,\nthank you, Karen, and thanks to.\nEveryone for joining us this morning.\nI'll start with a few highlights on total company performance. Q2 revenues were approximately $91.2 billion, an increase of approximately 2.6% over the.\nPrior year quarter reflecting growth in our Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments.\nWe delivered adjusted operating income of over $3.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.83. We also generated year to date cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion, a lower result as compared to the.\nSame period last year, primarily due to timing of Medicare payments and the impact of Medicare utilization.\nLet's look at some of the performance of our segments.\nIn our Health Care Benefits segment, we delivered.\nStrong revenue growth versus the prior year.\nQ2 revenues of approximately $32.5 billion increased by over 21% year over year.\nReflecting growth across all product lines. Medical membership grew to nearly 27 million.\nMembers, an increase of 200,000 members sequentially.\nReflecting growth in Medicare and Medicaid products, including the Oklahoma Medicaid contract which went.\nLive on 1 April.\nAdjusted operating income for the quarter was.\nApproximately $938 million down year over year due to a higher Medical Benefit Ratio.\nPartially offset by an increase in net investment income. Our medical benefit ratio of 89.6% increased.\n340 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization.\nThe premium impact of lower star ratings.\nFor the payment year 2024, the impact of higher acuity in Medicaid, and a change in estimate of, to our individual exchange risk adjustment accrual for the 2023 plan year.\nThese increases were partially offset by the.\nFavorable year over year impact of prior period development.\nIn Medicare Advantage.\nStrong prior period reserve development improved our.\nQ1 medical cost trend estimates, but we continued to see elevated trends in Q2 largely in the same categories we previously discussed, including inpatient supplemental benefits such as dental, and also in pharmacy. Following the close of the quarter, we have seen some evidence of an acceleration of trends in these same categories, which informed our view of risks for the remainder of 2024.\nWe also experienced medical cost pressures in our Medicaid business.\nThis pressure is largely driven by higher acuity resulting from member redetermination. We believe this dislocation will self-correct over time as we continue to work closely with our state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in our rates, but we have not assumed material improvement in our 2024 outlook. During the quarter we received final 2023 risk adjustment data for our individual exchange business.\nAs a result, we increased our risk.\nAdjustment accrual for the 2023 plan year by approximately $225 million.\nWe were disappointed to see such a.\nLarge change in the final update.\nWe believe this change was in part driven by the significant growth and disruption.\nIn the market, particularly late in 2023 for 2024.\nOur population contains a significantly higher proportion.\nOf renewing members, and we continue to enhance our revenue integrity efforts to ensure we are appropriately capturing their acuity. As a result of this update, we now expect margins for our individual exchange.\nBusiness to be below breakeven this year. However, we are confident that our 2025.\nSubmitted rate filings, which we further enhanced.\nFollowing the 2023 risk adjustment update, will place us back on our multi-year margin trajectory.\nMedical cost trends in our commercial business.\nRemain elevated but are broadly in line with our expectations and pricing.\nDays Claims Payable at the end of the quarter were 43.1 days, down 1.4 days sequentially.\n3.8 days from the prior year quarter. The decrease versus the prior quarter was.\nPrimarily driven by elevated reserves held in Q1 2024, including the impact of the change healthcare cyber attack.\nThe year over year change in DCP.\nWas primarily driven by growth in our Medicare business and the impact of increased pharmacy trends.\nWe remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nOur Health Services segment generated revenue of.\nApproximately $42.2 billion, a decrease of approximately 9% year over year, primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large.\nClient and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy.\nDrug mix, increased contributions from our healthcare delivery assets, and growth in specialty pharmacy.\nAdjusted operating income of approximately $1.9 billion.\nIncreased over 1% from the prior year.\nQuarter, reflecting improved purchasing economics partially offset by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed in the quarter.\nWere approximately $471 million, and total membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately 90 million members.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the.\nPerformance and growth of our healthcare delivery assets. Signify completed its second consecutive quarter of record volume and generated revenue growth of 27% over the prior year.\nOak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing approximately 32% compared to.\nThe same quarter last year, reflecting strong membership and clinic growth.\nOak Street ended the quarter with 207.\nCenters, an increase of 30 centers year over year.\nDespite a challenging and dynamic operating environment.\nIn Medicare, we continue to see strong profitability of mature clinics and a consistent ramp in profitability of our newer clinics.\nWe are encouraged by Oak Street's performance, which remains in line with our prior.\nOutlook, and remain committed to growing our.\nCenter footprint and expanding access to.\nThis leading care model.\nOur Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment generated.\nRevenue of approximately $29.8 billion reflecting an increase of 3.7% versus the prior year.\n6.4% on a same store basis. The primary drivers of this revenue growth.\nWere increased prescription volume and pharmacy drug.\nMix, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement.\nPressure, the impact of recent generic introductions, and lower front store volumes.\nAdjusted Operating Income was approximately $1.2 billion. This result is lower than the prior.\nYear quarter due to continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, decreased front store volume, and the timing of certain Medicare payments related to a CMS request. These impacts were partially offset by increased prescription volume, improved drug purchasing, and pharmacy drug mix.\nThis quarter, same store pharmacy sales were up over 9% versus the prior year.\nSame store prescription volumes increased by 6.5%.\nWe continued to increase our script share during the quarter, achieving a 27.2% retail pharmacy share.\nOur results continue to demonstrate we are.\nThe best run national pharmacy chain in the country.\nSame store front store sales were down by about 4% versus the same quarter last year.\nExcluding OTC test kits, same store front.\nStore sales were down about 2%, reflective.\nOf general softening of consumer demand.\nAs a reminder, the public health emergency was active through mid-May last year.\nShifting now to liquidity in our capital position through the second quarter, we generated.\nYear to date cash flow from operations of approximately $8 billion. During the quarter, we returned $858 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend and ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted.\nSubsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade.\nRatings.\nTurning now to our full year outlook for 2024, as Karen mentioned, we are lowering our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $6.40-6.65 per share. This revision reflects our performance through Q2 and our latest expectations for the remainder of the.\nYear. Let me walk you through the.\nMajor drivers of change in our Health Care Benefits segment. We now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $2.25 to 2.55 billion. We expect HCB's full-year medical benefit ratio to be in a range of 90.6%-90.8, an increase of 80 to 100 basis points versus our prior.\nGuidance. At the midpoint, our MBR shows.\nA 150 basis points increase from the first half to the second half of.\n2024, consistent with historical patterns in our Medicare Advantage block. First half results remain largely in.\nAlign with our prior expectations, although they have developed differently than we previously projected. Medical cost trends remained elevated in Q2 at levels consistent with our restated Q1 experience, which benefited from strong prior period.\nDevelopments. However, early indicators for July suggest.\nWe may see incremental pressure, particularly in.\nInpatients. As a result, our updated guidance range now reflects that trends in the.\nSecond half of 2024 could be higher than levels seen in the first.\nHalf. It is worth noting that if.\nTrends persist at elevated levels, we may be required to take an in year 2024 Premium Deficiency Reserve in our Medicare.\nBusiness. While this Premium Deficiency Reserve should.\nNot have an impact on our revised full year expectations for the Health Care Benefits.\nSegment, it could change the cadence of.\nEarnings between the third and fourth quarters. At this time, we have no expectation that we will need a Premium Deficiency Reserve related to our Medicare Advantage block for 2025.\nOur updated guidance also reflects a continuation of the Medicaid acuity pressure we saw in the second.\nQuarter. Our teams are working closely with.\nState partners to align Medicaid rates with higher.\nAcuity. However, we are assuming no material.\nImprovement in the dislocation between rates and acuity through the second half of 2024.\nIn our individual exchange.\nBusiness. Given the magnitude of the negative.\nSurprise we experienced in our 2023 update, our outlook now reflects a provision for potential variability in our 2024 risk adjustment.\nPosition as our data matures over the.\nRemainder of the calendar.\nYear. As noted, we believe this variability has been appropriately reflected in our recently updated pricing for 2025. In our Health Services segment, we're increasing our estimate for 2024 adjusted operating.\nIncome by a range of $200-250 million or $7.2-7.25.\nBillion. This increase reflects the return to.\nStrong performance in our pharmacy services business in the second quarter as well as the continuation of this exceptional execution through the remainder of the.\nYear. There is no change to the outlook for our healthcare delivery assets as.\nThese businesses continue to perform in line with our.\nExpectations. In our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, we now project Adjusted Operating Income.\nTo increase by $100 to 150 million or to $5.7 to 5.75.\nBillion. While we recognize that there have.\nBeen macro shifts in economic and consumer.\nDynamics, our Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.\nContinues to highlight the importance of our community health locations to the consumers we serve, reflected in our growing pharmacy market.\nShare. As a result, we are pulling.\nSome of this strong first half performance into our expectations for the full year.\nFinally, we updated our expectation for cash flows from operations to approximately $9 billion in.\n2024. This decrease is primarily driven by.\nThe timing of reinsurance payments from CMS, primarily related to our standalone prescription drug.\nProducts and the impact of lower HCB.\nEarnings. The Part D receivable increase will be repaid by CMS during the Q4 of 2025. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our investor relations.\nWebpage. We plan to share more detailed.\n2025 guidance later this year, but I want to provide some updates to our previous expectations for.\n2025. In Medicare Advantage, we remain committed.\nTo driving meaningful improvements in our margins in.\n2025. As we look at the sources.\nOf the pressure we discussed in our updated 2024 guidance, not all of these sources will translate into pressure on our 2025.\nBids. Notably, within our 2025 bids, we.\nMade meaningful adjustments to our offerings, including supplemental benefits and Part D, both sources of incremental pressure in 2024. We currently.\nProject that we will improve Medicare Advantage margins between 100 and 200 basis points in 2025. This will be a significant first step to achieving our target margins of.\n4% to 5% over the next several.\nYears.\nFor our individual exchange business, we.\nHad the opportunity to refile our bids to reflect the latest risk adjustment data and prudently reflected those updates in our 2025 bids. As a result, we continue to.\nExpect profit improvement in that business in.\n2025. In Medicaid, we believe the dislocation between acuity and rates is temporary and will be largely resolved through the next pricing.\nCycle. In Karen's remarks, she highlighted the.\nWork our team has underway to deliver on a multi-year enterprise productivity initiative in 2025. We expect savings from this initiative to drive at least $500 million of adjusted operating.\nEarnings.\nWe are encouraged by our deliberate.\nEfforts to strengthen our outlook and generate meaningful positive momentum for 2025 and.\nAs is our customary practice, we.\nWill give more formal guidance later this.\nYear.\nWith that, we will now open.\nThe call to your.\nQuestions.\nOperator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank.\nIf you would like to ask.\nA question on today's call, please press star followed by one on your telephone.\nKeypad to enter the.\nQueue. If you wish to withdraw, please.\nPress star followed by.\nTwo. Participants are asked to limit themselves to one question and one follow up so we reach as many people as possible. Thank you.\nThe first question today, Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Lisa, please go ahead. Your line is.\nOpen.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThanks very much. Good morning, Karen and Tom. I just wanted to start with the Health Care Benefits business. So if I go back to last quarter and we talked about the level of visibility that you had around cost trend, and then you know I heard your comments, Karen, that as you closed Q2 the trend accelerated. There are really two questions here. One, can you talk about the level of visibility that you have when we think about the trend going into the back half of the year? And then secondly, can you talk about what was included in the 2025 bids? You talked about your level of confidence that you have that you're prudent in those bids. But if you were seeing the trend accelerate coming out of Q2, were you able to capture that in the bid for.\n2025?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Lisa, I'll start with the 2025 bids. I feel like we have a high degree of confidence that we caught the trend for 2025 bids. We took a very prudent approach. We talked about that last quarter relative to elevated trends and that we expected elevated trends for the rest of the year and into next year. So we feel very confident. I had a cross enterprise team looking at the bids throughout the entire bid cycle, and we feel good that we'll achieve the 100 to 200 basis points of margin recovery. That's what we expect. And relative to utilization in the quarter, I'll ask Tom to comment on.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThat. Hey.\nSo as you look at the.\nTrends, there's a lot of things going on inside the quarter. So the first quarter restated quite positively. You know, a lot of that we think was a function of change healthcare. We actually saw some strong restatement in inpatient and first quarter trends. But then as we looked at what happened in the second quarter, we actually the Medicare trends, quarter over quarter, they were roughly flat, but at a lower level than what we experienced or thought we had experienced in the first quarter. So inpatient trends were consistent but at an elevated level. And then we continued to see some elevated trends in outpatient. We saw some pressure in supplemental benefits such as dental,\nand also in pharmacy. We also saw some categories such. We talked a little bit about kind of the outpatient pharmacy that we had seen that pressure in the first quarter.\nWe saw some positive restatement there and actually some deceleration of trends, which was a nice offset. You know, our current outlook, we think prudently incorporates where we are for the remainder of the year. But as you think about the bids, part of the question here is where exactly does this manifest? We had a substantial amount of contingency as we look at our 2024 baseline for those bids. And remember, for 2025, we assumed that same level of trend persists for effectively a third year in 2025 at essentially a double digit rate.\nVery, very.\nHigh. Abnormal.\nTrends. And so when you step back and look at where we've seen some of the pressure this.\nQuarter. Dental, for example, has been completely.\nRestructured in our 2025 bids. So if we see pressure there throughout the remainder of the year, it's unlikely to.\nTranslate. Part D, as we all know.\nhas been completely restructured for 2025. So we don't believe that some of the pressure that we're seeing there is also going to carry over because those bids have been rebuilt from the ground up. I would also highlight, you saw some of the changes in CMS star ratings. We did actually get a nice tailwind in that one of our important HMO contracts down in Florida flipped over to four stars, which will also create an incremental tailwind. So, you know, we feel good about, you know, the range of outcomes that we've talked about, 100 to 200 basis points of margin improvement. You know, there are many scenarios where we think, you know, the high end of that range is entirely.\nAchievable.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nTom, you've talked about membership declines. I think Karen mentioned that today also. You've said in the public forum up to 10%. Should that be our assumption for 2025, that you could lose up to 10% of your membership in.\nMA?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nI think when we were out.\nEarlier last quarter, we talked about a range of 5% to 10. That's a good baseline. But I also want to just highlight why is it that we expect to lose that membership. It's because there were some county exits. That's a small portion of what we think the lost membership will be. As you think about, though, where our assumptions have made some significant dislocation is where we didn't have a product that we thought we could get back to target margins over the time period that we have. And so we pulled those products and then we refiled a new product with a different set of benefits that we would not have been able to achieve by just changing our existing benefit structure. And so we believe we've been.\nFairly prudent, given the level of disruption.\nThat is likely in the marketplace next year, assuming that those terms and resells are going, those resales are going to happen at a much lower rate than what we have historically experienced. But should we see some upside from that, it is likely going to be in terms of membership relative to that range of 5% to 10% down. It's going to be in products where we restructure the benefits so we don't necessarily feel that's a bad.\nThing. In other words, I don't know.\nThat losing membership is part of the path to profitability. We think that a lot of that has been incorporated just simply into the bid.\nPricing.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Justin Lake at Wolfe Research. Justin, please go ahead. Your line is.\nOpen.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. First question is on 2025. You previously talked about double-digit EPS growth next year. Is that still the target off your updated estimate? And what are some of the key headwinds, tailwinds there beyond the 100 to 200 basis points of MA improvement you're talking.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Justin, thanks for the question. You know, our goal obviously is double digit and we're striving to achieve that. That's the goal. We'll provide, you know, more detailed guidance later in the year. But let me have Tom walk you through the headwinds and the tailwinds as we think about.\n2025.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, and I talked a little bit about this in the prepared remarks, Justin, but I think just highlighting again, our goal is to grow double digit, but we want to see how the remainder of the year plays out, and we'll provide guidance as we normally do officially later this year. You know, I would say as you look across the businesses, I just would remind investors that, you know, we've seen strong performance in health and health services. We've seen strong performance in Pharmacy & Consumer wellness, and we are encouraged by the momentum in both of those business businesses. The real question then of course becomes Aetna. So let me break down a couple of the big pieces in there that I think, you know, we would like you to focus on first, the individual business.\nWe made significant price increases in our baseline for 2025 that is likely to yield a slightly lower membership base but with a much higher profit margin than where we are this year. Then, when we then learned about how 2023 risk adjustment had backed up on us, we actually, as part of the process, when that happens, you actually have the opportunity to reopen your bids. So we worked with our state partners and we put incremental rate into certain key states after receiving the 2023 risk adjustment update. So we feel good about our ability to make progress.\nThere. In Medicaid, there are price increases.\nThat will go into effect on nearly half of our book on 1 January 2025. And we're also, I would say, there are some isolated pockets on some very specific issues in certain states where we're seeing some isolated pressure, and we're working with those states to see what we can do to enhance some of our medical management to try to improve the trend outlook there as well. So we feel good about our ability to improve the outlook for that business. Now, I will also just note we do have a large win in Texas that will have some startup costs associated with that next.\nYear. In Medicare Advantage, I talked about.\nThis. We did make meaningful adjustments to our offerings. We feel good about our ability to get 100 to 200 basis points improved margin in 2025. Then if medical costs were to subside from our current outlook, which effectively carries this very high level of trend, and then a little more based on what we saw in early July throughout the remainder of the year, if some of that were to subside, there's obviously upside from that because we've been very explicit about what our trend assumptions are. We have line of sight to over $500 million of incremental cost savings in 2025. We believe that we have the opportunity to drive $2 billion worth of cost savings over time.\nThose efficiencies are going to allow us to drive results both for shareholders, but also invest in our products, processes, infrastructure.\nWe think these are the right things to do. A lot of them were underway, but we really accelerated our focus on delivering near term value to help improve our outlook. So when you pull all of that together again, we feel like we have a lot of positive momentum. Our goal is to grow double digits and we're going to update investors later this.\nYear.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSVP of Business Development and Investor Relations, CVS Health\n\nAnd then just a quick follow-up on the question around Medicare Advantage. You mentioned cost trends elevated. You saw more in July. Where is Medicare cost trend running, you know, coming out of July? What are you, what are you assuming for the back half of the year, and remind us what you put into your bids for next year relative to that number. Then lastly, can you share with us what percentage of members in 2025 in MA will see their products pulled? We'll have to change products.\nThanks.\nSo I'll answer the first, the last one first. So you'll have some better insights into that when we see the open enrollment period in the landscape files later this year. Obviously, how our membership is impacted is going to be highly dependent upon competitor actions. And so we'll give you a better sense on what that looks like later this year as you think about medical cost trends. Remember, there are certain things this year that are specific to some of the pressures this year. And so when you think about trends in the bid, we think about some of the core trends and then we look at some of the things like supplemental benefits separately. But we're experiencing all in including pharmacy double digit trends this year.\nWhen you look at the core trends associated with the baseline and the bids and then the baseline that we carried into 2025, it's consistent with the experience that we are seeing year to date, that we've carried through for the next 18.\nMonths.\n\nOperator\n\nNext question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Stephen, your line is open. Please go.\nAhead.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nExecutive Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hi, thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to ask about.\nThe expected MA margin improvement of the 100 to 200 basis point. Obviously expected that closer to the.\n200 basis points range on the last.\nCall. So, can you just talk about now seeing where utilization is exiting the quarter? What do you think would get you to the low end of that range, and what you think would be required to drive you towards the higher end of the range? Thank.\nYou.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSo I think there's a wide.\nRange on the.\nRemaining results for the year, and it's really a function of how much credibility you want to assign to some of the early indicators we saw in July on the Medicare business. So at the low end of that range, I think 200 basis point is pressured. At the higher end of that range, I think 200 basis point is very achievable. And really Stephen, it is a function of where some of the trends over the remainder of the year manifest. So to the extent that they occur in areas where we've restructured benefit, we clearly are going to get a reset off of that that is not going to carry forward into 2025. I just again highlight though, we believe we've been very conservative in both the baseline and the trend that we assumed in 2025.\nAnd so even at the low end of that range, depending upon how it manifests itself, we still might be able to get 200 basis points of improvement next year. We really need to see just how the baseline matures over the course of the next couple of months. To give you more firm.\nGuidance.\nOn that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ann Hynes at Mizuho. Ann, your line is open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nHi, great, thank you. So in your prepared remarks.\nYou talked about the retail cost plus.\nModel gain and traction with about 50% claims. I think you said renegotiated. Can you just give more of an update on negotiations with the last two PBMs, like maybe handicap if.\nYou think you'll be able to strike a deal.\nWith them. Just any update on negotiations, that would be.\nGreat.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Just a reminder on CostVantage, we really introduced this model to simplify and address the pharmacy reimbursement model, and Prem and the team have been working with PBMs to really contract and address those pharmacy reimbursement and have had success. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have eight PBM contracts already signed and underway. But I'll let Tom talk more specifically about those contracts and where.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nWe're headed. Yeah, I appreciate.\nThe question. And so look, we continue to have active, productive discussions with our large PBM partners and continue to make progress in transitioning all of our commercial contracts for 1 January 2025. You know, at the end of the day, if you think about the retail pharmacy reimbursement landscape and, you know, kind of how it works, what we're doing with CVS CostVantage allows pharmacies to be reasonably compensated for the care and the value that they provide in the local communities. So I would say more to come in the next couple quarters, but we remain positive about where we stand at this point with CVS CostVantage and, you know, how it's resonating in.\nThe marketplace.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line.\nIs open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nEric Percher\n\nCo-founder, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. I'd like to ask a little bit more on the Part D marketplace. Given the initial bid, direct subsidy exposure, and the demo program, can you give us an idea for your response to that program? Does the Part D demo help to de risk?\nThis marketplace?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nEric, we're really pleased that.\nCMS has offered this Part D program to really stabilize the Part D premiums. We have applied for the demonstration and are looking forward to working out the details. But we really do think that this was the right answer and we're very pleased. We were talking with CMS over the course of the last several months. We felt like we had influence over that and feel good about what we were able.\nTo accomplish.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Cherny from Leerink Partners. Michael, your line is open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nSenior Managing Director and Equity Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe to go back to Ann's question, ask it from a different direction, seeing nice traction obviously on CostVantage. The logic behind that's fairly.\nSound is your intention if you don't.\nGet full compliance from the remaining almost 50% of the plans in place that you're going to have a dual reimbursement structure on the commercial side. How exactly will that.\nWork functionally for the organization in terms.\nOf your pricing mechanisms, your.\nSourcing, etc.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSo today we have multiple reference price models in the marketplace with payers. Our intention is to move all of our commercial contracts, as I stated previously, to our CostVantage model. It benefits both payers and us, and the predictability in the way cost of goods are passed through and provides predictable, you know, what I would say is reasonable margin for the pharmacies that relates to that. So, you know, our expectation is that we will move the commercial market over to this. We will still have a dual market. Right. Because the Medicare and Medicaid contracts still exist on another platform. And as we said prior, we're going to move the commercial marketplace over on 1 January 2025 and follow that with the Medicare and Medicaid markets at some time in the future. So from my perspective, we'll be able to handle that.\nBut our expectation is that we're moving the commercial marketplace over.\nFor 11:25.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson at Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, your line.\nIs open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Maybe just to piggyback one more off of what Mike was just saying, is your expectation for those on the commercial contracts that you moved over for 1 January 2025, that those would have like flat margins.\nVersus 2024?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, we're not providing guidance at this point. So our expectation is to, as we've said, over the long term, if you think about what's happened with reimbursement pressure going all the way back to our analyst day, we've talked about how it's been a headwind for retail for a very long time in this industry. What CVS CostVantage will do is over time it will flatten that out to basically allow payers to have the benefits of our industry-leading cost of goods to get passed through in a more transparent fashion and flatten out the reimbursement pressures over time. So we haven't provided 2025 guidance yet. But you know, the expectation of CVS CostVantage is to really do that over time and provide a floor.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nIn retail.\nAnd I'm going to ask.\nDavid to talk a little bit about how that's translating on the PBM and the TrueCost and how that's flowing all the way through. So David, why don't you.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nTake it? Yeah. So Elizabeth, I think it's important that you see both sides of the equation, and there's clearly recognition that there are pain points in today's price model. So you have this average market basket pricing and what we see in cross-subsidization. So both what Prem is solving for on the retail side is exactly what we're solving for in our TrueCost model with our clients. So the fact is that we're hitting what I believe are the issues head on by trying to drive a new price model that both serves our customers in creating, eliminating the price variability and creating more simplicity and transparency at the. At the member or the consumer level. So the good news is that we've launched TrueCost for our own employees on 1 June. We launched it what we believe is very successfully.\nIt helps create one as a platform and a demonstration that the product will actually work effectively for members in a high deductible plan. We're also beginning to evolve this and roll this model out to the rest of our books. So we're looking obviously at waves or attributes of the model and we suspect that we will have close to 2/3 of our customers on at least a couple of the attributes as we try to rebalance and create more transparency at the member level. So we feel really good about the fact that we're aligning both what's happening at retail and how it then connects with how we're basically driving the model in the.\nPayer community.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line.\nIs open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nHey guys, thanks for taking my question. So I'm just thinking through.\nSome of these, some of what we.\nLearned.\nToday. Right? We have $500 million in operating savings that'll flow through.\nNext year, we're going to have 100 to 200 basis points of margin.\nIn MA.\nYou have cash flow. You also have some benefits potentially.\nFrom Hicks. All of those combined are.\nWell in excess of what would be.\n10% earnings growth off this.\nNew base. And that's not even including stars. And I'm just wondering, is.\nYour expectation for stars still the same as it?\nHad been? The star ratings benefit in 2025. Is there anything that was.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nChanged there? That's my.\nFirst question.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, nothing has changed relative to our stars. It actually improved given some of the changes that occurred earlier this quarter. And Kevin, you described what we feel is very positive momentum going into 2025. As both Tom and I talked about, we feel good about 2025 relative to that positive momentum. In addition, we have very strong retention in our Aetna book and in our Caremark book relative to client accounts. So generally speaking, we feel good about 2025. But as Tom said, we want to see how the rest of the year plays out before we give formal guidance for 2025, which is typical what we.\nDo anyway.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health",
    "content2": "Kevin, one just point of minor clarification. So the 100 to 200 basis points has always been inclusive of the stars tailwind next year. But as you think about some of the pressures that we've seen in or could see based on what we've heard in some of our early reads in July, really, as we think about what's happened in June and get more data there, one of the positive offsets to that potential trend inside that range is further momentum on stars because of that change, particularly to our Florida.\nHMO contract.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Lance, your line.\nIs open. Please.\nGo.\nAhead.\n\nLance Wilkes\n\nManaging Director, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Can you talk a little bit about the leadership changes for Aetna in particular with you taking control?\nOf that? What are the changes in?\nPriorities you're going to be establishing there.\nWhat are going to be some?\nOf the changes in management process, any sort of org changes, and how much of the $500 million of incremental cost savings that will fall to the.\nBottom line would come.\nThrough.\nAetna.\nThanks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThanks. As you asked, the financial performance of this business was not meeting my expectations, and I decided to make a change relative to the priorities there. You know, I will be establishing a very strong management process driving execution of improved financial and operational performance. And those will be my.\nKey priorities.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nLance, just one quick follow-up. We're not parsing out where some of the $500 million in synergies comes from. That's all bottom line. Reminder though, as you think about 2025, we do have some expenses that are deferred that will come back in 2025, and this will at that level help to offset that. And we're not done yet. We're still working through what other opportunities we have this year. So I think of that as a floor that will help to improve the outlook for.\nNext year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Charles, your line.\nIs open. Please.\nGo ahead.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. Karen, I want to ask, you know, you mentioned earlier about, you know, the way that Caremark helps save money and the role that PBMs play in really lowering drug prices for both employers and consumers. You know, I get all that. And obviously we can debate the issues within the FTC interim report, but what does seem clear though is that that message, though, doesn't seem to be resonating, particularly on the Hill.\nCertainly, when you look at sort of how the media kind of portrays the PBM industry, can you talk about sort of what CVS is doing maybe in conjunction with PCMA to really kind of amplify the message of the PBM industry and why has that not resonated or has that not gotten through to folks, particularly if you see, let's say, ahead of this interim report to kind of understand sort of the role that PBMs play and what can we do?\nAbout.\nThat? Thanks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I think a couple things. One, we've taken a very aggressive approach to educating Congress on the role of the PBM. We've been doing a lot relative to communications. One of the things that both David and I have spent a lot of time on the Hill, and what we realize is it is an education thing, and we've been amplifying our message, and you can see that. What I would say is that we have demonstrated and proven over time that we are saving money. And the results reflect that. I think the FTC was very.\nTargeted and they took certain data and not the holistic data to really amplify their story versus the real story. We feel confident that we continue to have discussions. As you can see, nothing has happened, Congress, because there's a lot of, you know, discussion going on around the PBMs. I do think that if anything ever does happen, it'll be on transparency. But you know, we continue to drive and educate Congress, and that's what we're doing and continue to, you know, David. I'll ask David to see if there's anything else he wants to comment.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nOn here. Maybe just to reinforce Charles. This has been an industry that continues to innovate, adapt, and evolve. I think we're listening to the critiques and, or, the concerns, and you know, just look specifically at what we're seeing in DC. The focus is, for the most part, what the out of pocket costs are for members, that is, the consumer. And when you look at 90% plus generic dispensing rates and an average out-of-pocket cost of $8, and actually that cost is actually less than what it was in years past. I think we're doing our job. And to your point, the message is not, has not resonated as effectively because everybody's focusing on the high cost of brands, which is what we're solving for specifically with our customers.\nAnd so that last 10%, and if you look specifically what we did with the biosimilars, we were the only PBM, and we've actually got a lot of credit and recognition for this in both DC and among our customers in that we save $400 million by converting a high list priced Humira brand to a low list priced product. That saved our customers money, and then the members ultimately ended up paying close to $0 out of pocket. So if you demonstrate the fact that we are evolving and continuing to create value for our customers, which results in a high retention rate and a high growth rate, then our customers will ultimately begin to create the voice for making sure that they're protecting and actually continuing to what I think is reinvest in the things that the PBM tools and the programs that we've delivered in the past.\nAnd I think the last piece I'll just say, which I mentioned earlier, is that the price models need to evolve. Prem has recognized that at retail, and I think within the Caremark on the PBM side, we recognize the need to continue to evolve the price model, which is why we believe true cost is critical for the future success. And what I believe is the.\nIt's kind of the transformation of how pricing ultimately is delivered both to the customer and ultimately down to the consumer. So I think the facts remain, you know, clear. The PBM industries and specifically CVS Caremark create significant value. I think once the actual empirical evidence is there and actually begins to get passed into those that are actually at the legislative branch and ultimately those that are actually writing about this industry, that the numbers will speak.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nFor itself. I just want to emphasize the point that David made. We are leading the industry in changing the way pricing is done, both at the retail counter and through Caremark. I think that we set the standard for future innovations. I think that's an important part to changing the dialogue and the landscape in.\nThis business.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Brian, please.\nGo ahead. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Tanquilut\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nTom, maybe just as I think about the revised guidance, obviously you've.\nAdjusted it a few.\nTimes already. So how would you get?\nInvestors confident that this is the right.\nNumber at this point that you've baked.\nIn enough trend and prudent conservatism and.\nMaybe any color you can share, what buckets of inpatient you saw the trend uptick.\nIn.\nJuly. Thanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSure, Brian, thanks for the question. So maybe just let me take a step back and just talk about the quarter, because I think as you look at the quarter, it looks stronger than I think it is. You know, we had $150 million worth of prior year reserve development. We had strong prior period reserve development off the first quarter, particularly as claims normalized after the change healthcare cyber attack. We had some revenue pickup in Medicare. We had some positive provider settlements, you know, going the other way. We had to increase the risk.\nAdjustment payable. But you know, there's more.\nPositives than negatives as you look at the quarter, which I think got us to the printed result inside the quarter, but really masked some underlying pressure. So we took the opportunity to really step back and reevaluate what we saw in the second quarter and really over the whole first half now that we have a more complete period and really tried to pull that forward into the remainder of the year. If you look at the last five years at the very highest level, you say the MBR tends to tick up in the back half. How much does it tick up? Off a printed first half, you tend to see four out of the last five years. The one exception being 2020 when COVID really masked the underlying trends.\nYou see 150 basis points of pickup in the MBR in the back half in deterioration. It goes up the MBR, and at the midpoint, that's exactly where this guidance is. Right, that's at the very highest level. I hope that that should give investors some confidence. Then as you look at the specific risks, what we've done is we've taken the risk presumption that the trends in Medicare that we've.\nSeen throughout the first half, that they.\nwill persist throughout the remainder of the year, and that they could modestly increase, you know, as we noted. Q1 did restate positively, but we continue to see elevated medical cost trends in the.\nQ2. We did have some.\nIndications of, you know, pressure in July. We don't believe, as you know, that, you know, that is an increase in two-midnight. You know, it's just we've seen broad-based inpatient pressures. And so the range of outcomes for the remainder of the year on the Aetna business is primarily driven by a very early read on an uptick in a long July. And so that's part of the reason for the range is to try to incorporate what some of that variability is of a very early indicator in our exchange business. Our outlook incorporates the potential for additional risks over the remainder of the year, particularly if we're not successful in maintaining our risk adjustment trajectory on the 2024 block.\nAnd lastly, we incorporated the risk that the dislocation between Medicaid acuity and rates that pressured us within the quarter persist throughout the remainder of the year.\nSo maybe the easiest way to think about it is at the low end of that range, the AOI range for Health Care Benefits. The risks are probably all roughly equivalent in magnitude and the primary, and they're really the primary drivers of the change in outlook. We think that we've captured it, but we're obviously watching the data very closely, but we try to incorporate as much prudence into the outlook as we thought.\nWas appropriate.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you for joining our.\nCall today. I want to take the opportunity to thank all of our colleagues for their continued contributions in working to improve all the health of the people that.\nWe serve.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect.\nYour lines."

My name is Jordan, and I'll be coordinating your call today. As a reminder, if you'd like to register any audio questions, you may do so by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I'm now going to hand over to Larry McGrath to begin.\nLarry, please go ahead.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSVP of Business Development and Investor Relations, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health 1st Quarter 2024 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-Q filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed in Form 10-K, our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nFormer President and CEO, CVS Health\n\nKaren, thank you. Larry, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. This morning, we announced first quarter results that were burdened by utilization pressures in Medicare Advantage, which materially impacted our healthcare benefits segment. We generated adjusted EPS of $1.31, which fell short of our expectation. As a result of this performance, as well as our updated expectations for the rest of 2024, we are lowering our full year 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS to at least $7. Tom will go through these results and our revised guidance in more detail. I want to start our discussion this morning by focusing on the challenges we are seeing in our Medicare Advantage business and what we are doing to address these pressures.\nWhen we last gave 2024 guidance, our outlook assumed normalized Medicare Advantage trends on top of the elevated baseline we experienced in the 4th quarter of 2023. It is now clear that the 1st quarter 2024 Medicare Advantage trends are notably above this level. Like others in the industry, our visibility in the quarter was impaired by the cyber attacks on Change Healthcare. At the close of the quarter, we established a reserve of nearly $500 million for claims that we estimated we had not received. This represents our best estimate of missing claims, with approximately half of the reserve attributed to our Medicare business. As we closed the quarter, it became apparent we were experiencing broad based utilization pressure in our Medicare Advantage business. In a few areas, outpatient services, and supplemental benefits continued to be elevated in the 1st quarter and exceeded our projections.\nWe also saw new pressures in the inpatient and pharmacy categories, some of which were seasonal or one-time in nature. April inpatient authorizations and admissions appeared to have moderated.\nIn response to these pressures, at a time when we have seen very strong enrollment growth, we implemented a series of actions to ensure our clinical operations are performing at levels consistent with our expectations. We formed multidisciplinary teams to do a retrospective review of our claims data, searching for conditions, specific geographic or facility-based outliers, as well as to uncover any selection bias in our new and existing membership base. We ensured clinical teams are staffed for current volumes by redeploying nurses from across CVS Health and increasing hiring where necessary, and we evaluated opportunities and implemented actions to optimize our pharmacy benefit spend. In addition to those efforts, we are accelerating enterprise productivity initiatives to streamline and optimize our operations, ensuring our costs are aligned to the business operations, environment, and conditions.\nWe are implementing these actions with speed and urgency, utilizing the broad resources and experience across CVS Health. We have a track record of successfully navigating complex industry pressure and will continue to demonstrate our resilience. We will provide updates throughout the year on these efforts. I also feel it is important to discuss our long-term outlook for Medicare Advantage. We recently received the final 2025 rate notice, and when combined with the Part D changes prescribed by the Inflation Reduction Act, we believe the rate is insufficient. This update will result in significant added disruption to benefit levels and choice for seniors across the country. While we strive to deliver benefit stability to seniors, we will be adjusting plan-level benefits and exiting counties as we construct our bids for 2025. We are committed to improving margins.\nDespite the recent challenges in Medicare Advantage, we firmly believe the program can remain a compelling offering for seniors and a very attractive business for Aetna and CVS Health. Over time, Medicare Advantage will continue to deliver significant value to members as well as better outcomes and patient experiences. Over the next few years, we are determined to improve our positioning in Medicare Advantage. The combination of our internal efforts and the multi-year repricing opportunity gives us confidence in our ability to return to our target margins of 4%-5% in three to four years. Our top priority in the near term is addressing the pressures faced by our Medicare Advantage business. However, I urge you not to lose sight of the power of our enterprise.\nThe strength and diversity of our business positions us for growth in 2025 as we deliver value to our patients, customers, and shareholders. We are ensuring a viable biosimilars market in the U.S. with our Cordavis business which will drive lower cost for our customers, savings for consumers, and will lead to higher retention and growth. On 1st April, we implemented our unique and meaningful formulary change related to Humira. We have already made a significant impact in the first month since the formulary change, dispensing more biosimilar Humira prescriptions than the entire US market in 2023. This accomplishment truly highlights the combined strength of our CVS Caremark, CVS Specialty, and Cordavis businesses to accelerate biosimilar adoption and our commitment to customers to lower pharmacy costs. Our pharmacy and consumer wellness business delivered strong performance this quarter highlighted by our ability to grow pharmacy share.\nDespite softening consumer demand and an uncertain macroeconomic environment, our CVS Pharmacy locations continue to serve an important, expanding role in communities across the country. Since we unveiled CVS CostVantage and TrueCost, we have seen a tremendous interest in these more simple and transparent pharmacy models. We are engaged in active discussion with PBMs to roll out CVS CostVantage for commercial contracts on 1st January 2025.\nAdditionally, we signed CVS CostVantage agreements with multiple third-party discount card administrators that were effective on 1st April and represent more than 50% of all CVS discount card volume. We continue to have constructive dialogue with our partners and look forward to updating you later this year. In our healthcare delivery business, we are seeing meaningful progress in our integration efforts this quarter. Signify had the highest volume of in-home evaluations in their history. Oak Street at-risk patients grew nearly 20% over the same quarter last year, supported by our ability to utilize touchpoints across CVS Health. In Aetna, our commercial business had several wins with large group clients with 2025 effective dates, demonstrating our ability to deliver integrated benefit solutions with our diversified portfolio of offerings in our Medicaid business.\nWe have been successful in several RFPs including Virginia, Michigan, and Texas where our CVS Health assets were highlighted as differentiators. These represent a few recent highlights from across our businesses and demonstrate the value and positive momentum across our broad-based portfolio of assets. The current environment does not diminish our opportunities, our enthusiasm, or the long-term earnings power of our company. We are confident that we have a pathway to address our near-term Medicare Advantage challenges. While recent results have been pressured, our actions will return our earnings to their appropriate levels and will result in a stronger CVS. We remain as committed as ever to our strategy and believe that we have the right assets in place to deliver value to our customers, members, patients, and our shareholders.\nTom will provide details on the results of each of our businesses and the components of our updated guidance.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nTom, thank you, Karen, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. In the 1st quarter, our revenues were approximately $88 billion, an increase of approximately 4% over the prior year quarter. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $3 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.31. We also generated cash flow from operations of $4.9 billion, a lower result compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to the timing of Medicare payments. Each of our segments and the enterprise as a whole are focused on executing against their goals and delivering on their financial targets. However, our health care benefits and enterprise results are being materially pressured by the level of Medicare Advantage utilization that we are experiencing. Clearly, this is a disappointing result for us.\nLet me walk you through some of the drivers and help you understand how we expect them to impact the remainder of the year.\nIn our healthcare benefits segment, we delivered revenues of approximately $32 billion, an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year. Medical membership was $26.8 million, up 1.1 million members, sequentially reflecting growth in Medicare, individual exchange, and commercial group products partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income for the first quarter was $732 million. This result reflects a higher medical benefit ratio partially offset by higher net investment income and the impact of favorable fixed cost leverage due to membership growth.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 90.4% increased 580 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization, the premium impact of lower STARS ratings for payment year 2024, and unfavorable prior year development as compared to the prior year. Digging into the drivers of Medicare Advantage cost trends, we saw meaningful increases in utilization. We continue to see elevated trends in the same categories we discussed at the end of 2023, including outpatient and supplemental benefits categories that appeared to be moderating earlier in the quarter but which completed at levels that in some cases exceeded expectations.\nAdding to the outpatient and supplemental benefits pressure, we saw new pressures emerge from inpatient categories, RSV vaccines, and other pharmacy benefits. Inpatient admits per thousand in the 1st quarter were up high single digits versus the 1st quarter of 2023. While a portion of this increase was anticipated because of the implementation of the Two-Midnight Rule, this result meaningfully exceeded our expectations for the quarter as inpatient seasonality returned to patterns we have not seen since the start of the pandemic.\nIn our Medicaid business, we experienced medical cost pressures largely driven by higher acuity from member redeterminations. We are working closely with our state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in our rates going forward.\nMedical cost trends in our commercial business have not shown the same pressures we are experiencing in Medicare. Inpatient bed days are favorable to expectations, although higher than prior years. Mental health and pharmacy trends remain elevated, but overall performance of the commercial block is consistent with our projections. Individual exchange medical costs are elevated but are consistent with projected membership mix and lower revenue payables in 2024. Our individual exchange business remains on target to achieve its profit goals this year. We will continue to monitor both of these blocks closely, but their performance to date is consistent with our prior projections.\nDays Claims Payable at the end of the quarter were 44.5 days, down 1.4 days sequentially. This decrease is primarily driven by the impact of membership growth and higher pharmacy trends, which tend to complete quicker and reduced DCP as well as other typical seasonal items. Premiums and reserves both grew sequentially approximately 20%. As a reminder, DCP is an output of our reserving process and overall we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn early April we saw multiple days of high paid claim activity, which is consistent with the restoration of Change Healthcare and the associated backlog from that disruption. While the final impact of the Change Healthcare disruption will not be known for several months, our most recent interim reporting suggests that our 31st March reserve balances are stable and could show modest levels of positive development which is not incorporated into our current outlook. Our health services segment generated revenue of approximately $40 billion, a decrease of nearly 10% year-over-year, primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. This decrease was partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, and the acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health.\nAdjusted Operating Income of approximately $1.4 billion declined nearly 19% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements, lower contributions from 340B, and the previously announced loss of a large client. This decrease was partially offset by improved purchasing economics. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter were nearly $463 million, and total pharmacy membership as of the end of the quarter was approximately 90 million members. We continue to drive growth in our healthcare delivery assets. Signify generated revenue growth of 24% compared to the same quarter last year. Oak Street ended the quarter with 205 centers, an increase of 33 centers year-over-year. We continue to expect to add 50 to 60 centers in 2024. At-risk members at Oak Street ended the quarter at 211,000, an increase of 34,000 year-over-year.\nOak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing over 25% compared to the same quarter last year.\nIn our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we generated revenue of approximately $29 billion, reflecting an increase of nearly 3% versus the prior year and over 5% on a same store basis. Drivers of this revenue growth in the PCW segment included increased prescription volume with increased contributions from vaccinations as well as pharmacy drug mix. These revenue increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, continued reimbursement pressure, a decrease in store count, and lower contributions from OTC test kits. Adjusted operating income was approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately 4% versus the prior year driven by increased prescription volume, improved drug purchasing, and lower operating expenses, including the impact of store closures. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nSame store pharmacy sales were up over 7% versus the prior year and same store prescription volumes increased by nearly 6%. Same store front store sales were down by about 2% versus the same quarter last year, but up 1% when excluding OTC test kits. As a reminder, the public health emergency was still active during the 1st quarter of last year.\nShifting to liquidity in our capital position, Q1 cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.9 billion of cash of the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. In Q1, we returned $840 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We also completed our $3 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, retiring approximately 40 million shares in the quarter. We do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the remainder of 2024.\nOur leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was approximately 4x. This leverage ratio was higher than we expect to maintain on a normalized basis. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings.\nTurning now to our full year outlook for 2024, as Karen mentioned, we revised our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $7 to reflect our Q1 results as well as our updated expectations for the remainder of 2024. In our health care benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income of at least $3.6 billion, down from our previous guidance of at least $5.4 billion. We now expect our 2024 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 89.8%, an increase of 210 basis points from our previous guidance.\nIn Q1, Healthcare Benefits medical costs primarily attributable to Medicare Advantage came in approximately $900 million above our expectations. If we break that down further, we estimate that roughly $500 million of that variance is specific to the quarter or seasonal, including the larger than expected impact of seasonal respiratory and RSV costs and a return to inpatient seasonality patterns that look much more like pre-pandemic periods. As Karen mentioned, early indicators for April inpatient authorization support our current seasonality projections and their return to pre-COVID patterns.\nWe have also raised our expectations for RSV related costs in the 2nd half based on our experience in the 1st quarter.\nThe remaining approximately $400 million of medical cost pressure in the 1st quarter is driven by elevated utilization trends that our guidance now assumes will persist for the remainder of 2024. The primary drivers of this projected variance include outpatient service categories such as mental health and medical pharmacy as well as supplemental benefits such as dental. Partially offsetting some of this pressure is better than expected volumes, expense management, and increased net investment income, which together are expected to contribute approximately $500 million more than we assumed in our previous full year guidance, with roughly half of this offset occurring in the 1st quarter.\nIn our health services segment, we are updating our estimate for 2024 adjusted operating income to at least $7 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million. The majority of this adjustment is attributable to Health Care delivery, predominantly in our CVS Accountable Care business, driven by Medicare utilization and some out-of-period pressure. We also saw some modest utilization pressure at Oak Street Health during the quarter and are including a provision for higher trends for the remainder of the year. In our updated guidance, the remainder of the pressure is in our other businesses in the health services segment, primarily driven by volume and mix trends, and the associated impact on our ability to deliver on network and client guarantees.\nOur expectations for the pharmacy and consumer wellness segment remain the same with adjusted operating income of at least $5.6 billion. This outlook incorporates a cautious stance on consumer activity over the remainder of the year due to slowing front store activity in the 1st quarter.\nWe now expect 2024 share count to be approximately 1.265 billion shares and our adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25.6%. Finally, we updated our expectation for cash flow from operations to at least $10.5 billion in 2024. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our investor relations webpage. We plan to share more detailed 2025 guidance later this year, but in an effort to help investors build reasonable expectations for next year, we wanted to share some preliminary thoughts on our outlook within healthcare benefits. Our Medicare Advantage business is projected to generate between $65 billion and $70 billion in revenues in 2024 but will experience significant losses. We are committed to driving meaningful improvement in our Medicare Advantage margins in 2025.\nGiven our projected baseline performance, 2025 will be the first step in a three- to four-year journey to get back to our target margins of 4%-5%. Improved star ratings in 2025 could represent a $700 million tailwind depending on membership retention levels, but also reduces our ability to adjust certain benefits. The remainder of our margin improvement in 2025 will be a function of pricing action in an environment where we are facing headwinds from an insufficient rate notice and prescription drug coverage changes that substantially increase plan liability. We will take material pricing and benefit design actions for 2025, and the impact of those changes will depend on how cost trends develop in both 2024 and 2025 and how the market responds to those trends.\nIn HealthCare benefits. Other business lines, we are building strong momentum. We are planning for another year of margin progression in our individual exchange business. We've seen success in the group commercial selling season this year and were recently awarded several key Medicaid RFPs.\nIn our health services segment, early progress of our Cordavis business is encouraging and supports our innovative approach to the biosimilar opportunity, driving differential savings for our PBM customers in our healthcare delivery business. We are committed to improving margins in CVS Accountable Care. Oak Street's margin trajectory will be supported by meaningful patient enrollment and a realignment of Medicare Advantage benefits as the market adjusts to elevated utilization. Signify continues to show impressive growth and is building momentum into 2025. We have received a strong early reception to our new pharmacy model, which creates potential for outperformance in our PCW segment.\nAs Karen mentioned, we are accelerating multi-year enterprise productivity initiatives to streamline and optimize our operations. Finally, our framework contemplates a stable share count in 2025. While many uncertainties remain that could drive a wide range of outcomes, including our 2024 baseline performance and the potential that medical cost trends subside as compared to our current outlook at this distance, our goal remains to deliver low double-digit Adjusted EPS growth in 2025. Our team remains committed to executing against opportunities to outperform this guidance. With that, we will now open the call to your questions, Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\nAs a reminder, if you'd like to register any audio questions, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad. If you change your mind, please press star followed by two. Please ensure you're unmuted when speaking.\nOur first question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Justin, please go ahead.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. A couple questions here. First on the cost trend in the 1st quarter. Would like to get some more detail on the $500 million that you said is in Q1. That's not going to reoccur, right? I think everyone would like to get comfort that, you know, this $7 is a, is a baseline that we can be comfortable with. So if that's not reoccurring, can you just walk us through what the, what the moving parts are there? For instance, you know, it looks to me like your PYD was $200 million below the last couple years. Maybe that's a big part, you know, that's clearly a big part of it. How much was RSV? Any other moving parts? Anything you could do to get us comfortable that that $500 million is, you know, seasonal would be, would be a good.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nHey Justin, it's Tom. So the largest impact within the quarter is the seasonality adjustment on inpatient. As I noted in the prepared remarks, our April authorization data supports our updated seasonality projection, as we did experience some negative prior year development in the quarter, and that is clearly part of the $500 million. But as you look at where that occurred, that was really in some of our inpatient categories where the trends restated negatively. So you saw the beginning of that uptick. You saw an uptick again. January admits were higher than our expectations. February was improved versus January. March was improved versus February. So we've seen really, we saw a spike earlier in the quarter which really started in hindsight in the 4th quarter.\nAs you look at that pattern, it very closely resembles what we would have seen in a 2018-2019 period trended forward. So that gives us a lot of comfort as we look at both what we're seeing now versus what the historic patterns pre-COVID look like, that a lot of this was actually seasonal. If you take out the prior period development, you also had some provider liabilities that were settled inside the quarter. We did have some policy liberalizations that took place inside the quarter. They've been reinstated since the quarter ends, so that should not be an ongoing impact. There were some other one-time impacts, including the initial reserve build for some of our new membership growth that would be incorporated inside that $500 million. We also, as you noted, did see some RSV in the quarter.\nWe did make a provision for some of those costs of the $500 million to recur in the back half of the year. But we're not projecting that the vast majority of those costs are going to be part of the run rate, unlike the $400 billion that we're pulling through.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Then just some color on the Medicare Advantage margin and improvement in any offset. So right now it looks like if I estimate your MA margins, I'm thinking -3% to -4% negative. Is that the right ballpark? How much of an improvement? You said material improvement, you know, that would seem, you know, if you got a couple hundred basis points there, by my estimate that's you know, $0.70-$0.80 alone. So can you talk us through how much improvement, what you think is material to get back, you know, that trajectory to the, you know, over three to four years and anything that would be an offset there, any kind of one-time benefits this year, like you know, bonuses, things like that that would work against it would be helpful, and I'll jump out of the queue.\nThanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nJustin, great question. So as you think about Medicare Advantage, you know, as I said, it's a $65 billion-$70 billion revenue portfolio today, and our goal for next year is that we would get about 200 basis points of margin improvement in that business or up to that amount. We obviously haven't finalized our bids yet. You know, you're in probably the right zip code as you think about what the, what the margin is on the, or implied margin is on the Medicare business, as you think about that business. We talked last quarter about the fact that it was going to be break even in our current projections, and we, you know, we lowered the guidance on healthcare benefits by $1.8 billion, and so the majority of that is related to Medicare.\nYou know, we've given you all the pieces to kind of understand why we think it'll lose a significant amount of money this year. But as you think about improvement there, obviously there's a lot of work that we still need to do to understand what benefits we're going to adjust, and what ones we can and can't. Our STARS is a tailwind, but also impacts our ability to adjust because it lowers our TBC availability on that national PPO contract. Maybe Brian, do you want to give a little bit of color how you're thinking about bids and margin improvement? Sure.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks, Justin. So I would talk about 2025 in terms of headwinds and tailwinds, and let me just walk through those. So obviously we have very significant high trend that we are absolutely going to incorporate into our pricing. And so the trends that Tom talked about for 2024 we will reflect again in 2025. So that's clearly a headwind, but we're not going to miss on trend. We've talked in the past about the Part D changes, which is a really important element here, and there's really two elements of that. One is that the benefit has been enriched pretty significantly by the IRA. And then secondly, the plan is on the hook for a greater liability in the catastrophic layer, and that we get less reinsurance than we used to. And so we intend to price for that and be very thoughtful around that.\nThird, as we, as you know, Karen mentioned in her remarks, the rates that we received were clearly disappointing and not sufficient to make up the trend pressures and IRA pressures that we're seeing. And then finally, as Tom mentioned around TBC, that's clearly a limitation that we need to be focused on. It's focused on the general enrollment block. It does not apply to DSNPs and it does not apply to certain supplemental benefits as well, which we'll be very focused on and make sure we right size for 2025 pricing. As we think about tailwinds, though, Tom mentioned the Stars tailwind, which is about $700 million assuming a stabilized membership. And I'll come back and talk about that a little bit. With respect to the pricing actions, we're going to be very focused on taking those pricing actions, as I mentioned, to incorporate the trends.\nBut also be mindful of how we think about TBC. Stars does impact TBC in that it reduces the amount of allowance we have under the regs. But as I mentioned, there are opportunities we have to trim benefits around TBC, and we'll be very focused on doing that on the DSNP product. Our intention is to reduce our supplemental benefits in certain areas, including some of the flex cards that we put in the market this year. And so you'll see us reduce those benefits. And that allows us to capture margin without impacting TBC. And so that's important. The other point I'd make, and Karen and Tom alluded to it, we will be taking actions around certain service areas. So to the extent that we don't believe we can credibly recapture margin in a reasonable period of time, we will exit those counties.\nWe will also be looking at areas where we believe that it makes sense to actually discontinue a specific product, then reintroduce a new product where TBC won't apply. And we'll be looking at those opportunities as well, being mindful of the member disruption and some of the churn that you might see. And so as we step back, we are very focused on margin over membership. Obviously, we're trying to create a stable book with respect to our membership. As we think about the membership impacts, I think there are several things that go into that calculation. One is we believe there will be significant disruption in the PDP market and the Med Supp market. We're going to see prices go up, we're going to see people exit certain plans, and we know prices are increasing on Med Supp.\nAnd so that'll be a tailwind to our membership projections, offset by the fact, as I mentioned, as we've all mentioned, that we're going to be taking significant pricing actions. Really it's going to depend on what our competitors do. We believe that they're rational, we believe they're seeing similar type trends, and so they're going to price as well for some of these pressures. But that's something that we'll have to calibrate as we get into pricing. And as I mentioned, there will be some service area reductions. But again, the focus is on margin over membership. If there's a membership reduction, it's relatively small impacts on margin. And we're focused on making sure we price this product appropriately for 2025 and beyond.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nFormer President and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Justin, I'm just going to reiterate what I said in my prepared remarks. We are committed to improving margin in Medicare Advantage, and we will do so by pricing for the expected trends. We will do so by adjusting benefits and exiting service counties. And we are committed to doing that.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Lisa, please go ahead.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nThanks very much. I just want to follow up on a few things that you said, Brian. I want to go back to your comment around membership and your expectation that the decline in Medicare Advantage membership could be small. Is that based on an assumption that the pressure we're feeling is for everybody in Medicare Advantage and that therefore everyone will readjust? And again, to Karen's point, you'll look at certain counties and adjusting certain plan levels so you could lose some membership, but you're not expecting a large membership decline as you think about 2025, just with the increased cost and changing benefits, et cetera. I just want to make sure that I understand that to start.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nSure. And thanks for the question, Lisa. So I would say there are two elements here. There's the what's going to happen from an industry perspective and growth, and then what we at Aetna are going to do. So on the industry side, as I mentioned, I think there are some clear tailwinds from the perspective of what's going to happen in the traditional fee for service market, i.e., PDP and Med Supp. And so as members, potential members are evaluating their choices, they're going to have to take a look at what are the price increases and some of the disruption that's going to happen in the traditional fee for service market. So that would be a tailwind. I do think, though, that the industry broadly is going to be trimming benefits in some cases significantly and exiting from certain counties that aren't profitable.\nI think that's an industry issue, and I think it's clearly an Aetna focus as well. So how that calibrates where we ultimately end up on membership is something that, again, we got to work through bids and pricing to sort of estimate what we think our competitors are going to do. It's hard to say right now that we won't have a meaningful decrease in membership. It's certainly possible. What the message we're trying to communicate is we're focused on margin over membership, and to the extent that we do have a larger than desired membership reduction, then that will occur and we'll focus on the margin side. But again, I think our competitors here are rational. I think they are facing a number of similar pressures. Obviously, we have our own unique elements that we need to address as well.\nAnd so I think that calibration, as well as what happens to the broader industry, will really dictate where membership goes next year.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nHey, Lisa, just from a very high level, as you think about what the impact of membership loss is, just, you know, think about the comments that we made about margin restoration relative to the implied, you know, losses in the book. And so losing additional members doesn't necessarily contribute to lost profit in 2025.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nAnd then Tom, if I can just understand the cadence of 2024 and you know, you obviously talked about low double digit growth in 2025. How do we think about that cadence as we're continuing throughout 2024? Anything you would specifically call out as we think about the rest of 2024?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, you know, one of the things that I think is worth talking a little bit about as you think about the Health Services segment. You know, we do have some pressures in there that we think are Medicare market related in the Health Care Delivery business. We also saw, you know, some timing and mix related impacts in our other Health Services segment businesses. We've taken a cautious stance right now on in-year recovery on those. That's because we lost a large client there. We had some insourcing activity at another large client. We've had some supply shortages in some other categories. We also delayed the initial launch of our biosimilar product to April 1st from our initial plans.\nSo accordingly, as we look at the seasonality of earnings we think we currently expect, you'll see probably more like 55%-60% of our earnings in the second half of 2024 to adjust for some of that sloping.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JP Morgan\n\nOkay, great. I'll stop there.\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Nathan Rich of Goldman Sachs. Nathan, please go ahead.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Good morning and thanks for the questions.\nI just wanted to follow up on.\nSome of the drivers for 2025, I guess, from this point in the year. I mean, can you talk about how big of a shortfall the final rate was relative to what your current view of cost trend will be for 2025? And then how are you thinking about the change in profitability for the part business and Part D business next year in light of the benefit design changes that you've talked about?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThe. I might leave it to Brian to talk about the Part D changes and their impact on profitability. You know, there is a very substantial change in plan liability there which will result in much higher premiums which we think is going to impact, you know, both overall benefits within the bids, but also as we think about those seniors that are currently, you know, in the market to purchase a bundle, that the cost of that bundle is going to rise pretty dramatically for them, which may, even with a less robust set of benefits, make Medicare Advantage a attractive option in 2025.\nThe bid itself for 2025, you know, what we received from CMS, the pricing was just disappointing. It's, you know, clearly as we look at our trends, as we look at the market trends, we don't think that the rate sufficiently reflects that. We have another year of the phase in of the risk adjustment model. There's no flexibility that's been given on TBC, despite the material changes that we are experiencing because of the Inflation Reduction Act on Part D. And so the combination of those things just makes a tough year for 2025 pricing harder when we don't see the pull through of what most of the market participants are experiencing into the bid baseline. And Brian, maybe you could talk a little bit more about that.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nSure.I mean, first, with respect to Part D, I think Tom articulated it well. There's just, you know, incremental benefits that are being offered and, you know, significant increase in plan liability. And while there'll be an increase in direct subsidy and we're expecting that it really isn't sufficient to cover that increased liability that the plans have. And so there's going to be a lot of discussion, I imagine, in the industry, certainly here at Aetna, about what product is ultimately viable for us.\nAs we think about the potential risks and volatility that could result from putting out a product and the impact of potential adverse selection in terms of who you attract, the types of members you use, brand utilizers, specialty utilizers, et cetera, creates additional uncertainty, particularly because of that enhanced liability and the fact that the benefits are so rich that typical traditional views of insurance and getting low price and those sorts of things may or may not apply in the same way as it did. And so those are the types of things we're thinking through. And obviously, as we come back on the next quarter call, we'll give you more color about our perspective on the Part D market. We do think there's going to be disruption. We do think it's going to necessitate premium increases.\nThat's why there's just some uncertainty about where the ultimate industry goes from an MA perspective in terms of membership. With respect to your first question on the trend delta, look, it's obviously very significant. We've been very clear that the trends we're seeing in 2024, which are really consistent with 2023, we expected some measure of break to a more normalized trend, as Karen and Tom said, and frankly, I think we were conservative on what a normalized trend would be. If you go back historically, even before the pandemic, for many, many years, trends were in the 3%-5% range. We saw trends in 2023 approaching 10%. We're seeing trends in 2024 mirror those levels exacerbated even more so by some of the seasonal factors that Tom mentioned in Q1. So we're going to continue those trends into 2025.\nNow we have really not seen two years, let alone three years, of those levels of elevated trend without break. But it's imperative that we include that in our pricing. And we intend to do that. And our expectation is our competitors will be thinking about it in a similar fashion. And so we need to think hard about how we're going to make up that delta between what we got in the pricing and what we got in trend. What we have in trend, and there are a number of levers we're going to pull. Benefits is one that clearly we're going to be focused on.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nGreat. If I could just think about stepping back from your question. As I just think about stepping back from your question, Nate.\nRevenue in that product per member is clearly going to go up. It's just not clear exactly what's going to happen to the overall membership base. But we're going to price for a profitable product and what's ultimately going to be a higher premium product on Part D.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, great. And sort of where I wanted to go with the follow up. You know, you talked, Tom, about the 200 basis points of margin improvement in the MA business next year. So you know that's around $1.3 billion-$1.4 billion depending on where membership shakes out. And half of that's the stars tailwind. I think if we just look at the other $700 million on a PMPM basis, it's $10-$15 PMPM. But it sounds like there may be some cost headwinds that are maybe offsetting the change in benefits. I guess I wanted to see if you could give us a rough sense of maybe the type of reduction that you're talking about in terms of the benefit design as we think about next year and then what the opportunities would be as we think three or four.\nYears down the road.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Nate, I think for competitive reasons I don't want to get into any more than we've already given relative to the improvement or any more granularity there other than to say I think we've made it clear that everything's on the table. So there are TBC benefits that will probably get adjusted. There are non TBC benefits that will get adjusted. We'll look at.\nThis is not an acceptable result where we're going to be for this year in terms of profitability on this block of business. So we're going to look at everything that we can do to try to improve profits for next year and maintain some level of stability. Inside the book, as you're doing the bridge between 2024 and 2025, there are some variable expense items that are clearly going to come back in 2025. That's part of the reason that we've talked about how we're going to accelerate some of our expense efforts to try to offset any restoration of expense that would come back in 2025. It's a little early days to, you know, to try to talk about what that will, that will yield in 2025. But we're committed to taking action to help offset any headwinds there.\nWe'll give you more updates on that as we get to next quarter.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nFormer President and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Nate, I would just add that, you know, we continually evaluate our overall cost structure with respect to operations, process productivity, and, you know, we began a comprehensive review of that last year. We took actions, they're showing up this year. And now we're going to accelerate, you know, other initiatives over the next few months. And as we continue to size those efforts, we'll update you throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Stephen Baxter of Wells Fargo. Steven, please go ahead.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Services, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah. Hey, another follow up on Medicare Advantage. Thank you. You mentioned in prepared remarks that I think you spent time looking for potential selection bias, either with new members or inside of your existing book. I'm not sure if you talked about what you actually found when you did that. So just trying to understand whether you saw greater than expected switching from your own members or if the step down in profitability across the broader book was mirrored in your new membership, or maybe that was something in excess of that to consider. Thank you.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, so we've looked at it very closely, as you can imagine, trying to understand whether the new members are creating disproportionate impact on our results. We've analyzed it every which way we can. When you look at basic results such as their admissions per thousand or their pharmacy spend or their risk score or other categories of care, we're really not seeing a material difference between the new members and the old members. What we're really seeing is a pressure on our entire book that we are having to take action against. Ultimately, you know, we looked at things, of course, and I know there's been a lot of discussion around the Fitness Benefit, for example, that was clearly something that was appealing to our members on the general enrollment block. It's just on the general enrollment block in terms of selecting that benefit.\nWhen we look at the financial impact of that, actually it's pretty modest. It's actually running in line with our pricing expectation. Some of the dental benefit enrichment that we did, we are seeing some pressures Tom mentioned on that supplemental benefit. We are seeing more members use that benefit and use more of it. And so, but that's really across the book. And so again, I don't see a selection bias between old and new members, but rather pressures throughout that we need to address for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Cherny of Leerink Partners. Michael, please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Leerink Partners\n\nGood morning and thanks for taking the question.\nMaybe I'll step to health services for a second. I'm sure others could come back with other MA questions, but as you think about the performance in the quarter and the dynamics you're seeing about prepping, both for.\nChanges in members, changes in the customer losses in terms of the large.\nCustomer roll-off, how do you think about the scaling dynamics of your purchasing capabilities and how that's ramping into Cordavis as you've launched that? And I guess you gave us an early look there. But are there any additional signs you.\nCan give us on how you think?\nAbout the financial contribution of Cordavis baked into either this year's guidance or in terms of the targets for next year?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThere is a contribution from Cordavis that's embedded in our health services guidance. We haven't disclosed to date, Michael, what that impact is other than, say, versus our initial projections because we delayed the formulary change to Q4.\n1.\nWe had hoped to do it a little earlier in the year. That did have a little bit of a timing impact inside the quarter. But the adoption there has been fabulous. The client reception has been fabulous. Maybe, David, you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing there.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nSure.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health",
    "content2": "Thanks, Tom. Before I get into the actual results for the biosimilar change, maybe I'll just spend a second talking more broadly about the question you asked around control and kind of our confidence on the ability to continue to have purchasing advantages in the market. So I go back to the strength that we have in specialty. Most of all, the success we've delivered is because of our leadership position, specifically in the specialty marketplace. We have unmatched access both across mail, retail, and in the home infusion space. We have broad set of products both in the pharmacy and the medical benefit side. We continue to be a leader in the limited distribution category, continue to be a leader in the new developing cell and gene therapy marketplace.\nSo that combined with the technology that we've invested has allowed us to be kind of a leading provider in this space. So that is the foundation allowed us to have the confidence to make the change for the formulary position on 1st April. So if you look at what was mentioned.\nIn the prepared remarks, we've actually had a change as of Q1 removing Humira from the formulary and replacing it with a low list-priced biosimilar. And as we said earlier, in just three weeks time we've actually surpassed all the biosimilar volume in all of 2023. So that's, we've been able to hit what is important in terms of control and in terms of purchasing, which is that we've been able to migrate more than 90% of the volume in the first month. And then when you look specifically inside the CVS Specialty pharmacy where we had a set of new services around technology, access to the prescribers and the members, we've been, we've actually had a 94% conversion rate. So it's a really powerful outcome and I think it speaks to obviously the strength of our business and as that translates into savings for our customers.\nWe had mentioned that we're delivering a 50% savings on the 2022 run rate for this drug. And then as you translate that into the member benefits, because we've actually moved to a low list price product and we've actually had clients adopt what we would call an intelligent benefit design. We've been able to have 80% of the members with the $0 out of pocket. So again, I think if you look at what we've done, it's a clear win for our clients, our patients, and we've also made a considerable investment in the durability of the biosimilar market. So I think all of that then contributes to the question you originally asked, which is size and scale really is generally driven, and what I would believe the strength in our purchasing economics is the ability to control and move market share.\nAnd again, this is another evidence and marker that we hope to continue down that path.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nFormer President and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Mike, I would just say on the biosimilar, you know, obviously it represents one of the biggest opportunities to reduce overall pharmacy costs for the US healthcare system. As you know, it's a $100 billion market by 2030. And as you can see in the very first few weeks of our launch, we've had incredible adoption, and we continue to evaluate the pipeline of opportunities. So we are excited about the potential in the future of the biosimilar market.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. The line is yours.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nChartered Financial Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. Here with Eric as well. So my question is, well, first just numbers question. The $400 million in Health Care services guidance reduction, how much of that is specifically Oak Street? And then on the MA, I hear still committed to 4%-5%. The journey starts in 2025. That's very, very clear. How much of your membership is in counties that you're contemplating exiting? Just, you know, sort of wholesale leaving of the market. And then also how does the repricing of MA fit into your overall enterprise strategy? As you know, obviously lots of your assets sell into that channel as well.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nLet me start with the HSS question, Josh, and then we can, we can try to get to the other ones. So as you think about HSS, so we took it down by about $400 million. The majority of that reduction is the health care delivery business. The largest driver in there is unfavorability on CVS Accountable Care. That came through in terms of the savings rate, which is driven by Medicare utilization, and that includes an out-of-period charge that was taken in Q1 that's embedded in there.\nI'd say the remainder of that piece of a piece is really Oak Street. But as we think about Q1, the performance in that business was reasonably good. And so as we think about what we've seen in the broader market, we made a provision that perhaps there could be some lag there in our forward outlook. We'll obviously have to see how that ultimately develops. As you think about 2023, the business did an excellent job of navigating some of the broader headwinds in the marketplace with some of their new clinical programs and, you know, how they played out over the course of the year. We're hopeful that we could see some, you know, some favorability to that number over time. But we have to see how that all manifests itself in the results. Mike, I don't know anything else that you would add.\n\n[Unknown Speaker]\n\nUnknown Speaker\n\nYes, Tom, I think you summed it.\nUp well from a financial perspective. And the thing I would add, when I think about healthcare delivery more broadly and specifically Oak Street, is for the rest of 2024 and really in 2025 and beyond. I think there's a huge opportunity that Brian and I are working really closely on. How do we leverage the quality of care and the ability to really bend med cost trend and drive MLR improvements? How do we leverage that more broadly across Aetna with Oak Street? And so there's a lot of things we're doing both from adding membership from Aetna to Oak Street centers, but also leveraging some of the out of center capabilities we have around Transitions programs and care in the home that we use for Oak Street today. Let's use that for Aetna members.\nSo I think there's a lot of opportunity here that we'll see play through in the coming years.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nAnd I would just add to Mike that as you said, we are working very closely together. And for example, while obviously we're not going to provide color today on specific counties and the extent which counties will exit, we wouldn't do that in an Oak Street footprint as an example. Right. So we're going to be very thoughtful about how we trim our book with the goal of over time retaining the margins and attaining the margins that Tom articulated. I'd also remind you that every hundred basis points is worth more than $500 million on a trend basis. And so if you think about where historical trends have been, think about where trends are today. We're in no way baking this into our assumptions.\nBut as you think about recovery here, this has the potential to bounce back and retain those, get back to that profitability as well, which I think is important to mention. But we're going to be very thoughtful about how we think about our membership footprint. And again, the ultimate goal is membership stability, but we're going to favor margin over membership for next year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson of Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, please go ahead.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. I was wondering, can you talk about sort of care management tools and sort of the impact that you are thinking about in terms of their impact on 2024 and then any sort of changes you're making in 2024 that you think will have an impact as we think about the 2025 results for HCB? Thank.\n\nBrian Newman\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYou. Well, clearly care management is an important tool that we use to engage our members. We spend a lot of time segmenting who our high risk members are. Who are the members who would benefit most from care management? We're actually using a lot of really advanced AI tools to identify those members. We really think we have excellent analytics to be able to pinpoint who those members are and how are we best able to engage with them? What are the types of things that will get them to engage with us and then also make it easier for our care management nurses at the point of care to be able to provide the level of advice and support that a member needs? And so it's something that we're very focused on.\nI would tell you that we continue to roll out some of these AI capabilities that makes these programs much more effective with much better ROIs. And so while there will be modest impacts in 2024 over time, we expect that to be a differentiator for us. And so. So we're very focused there.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I'd just add to that.\nThis is where the partnership between healthcare delivery and Aetna comes in. Between Signify and some of the capabilities we have at Oak Street, there's a lot of boots on the ground in market capabilities that we have to really change the health trajectory of patients, whether that be readmissions to the hospital or managing your most complex chronic patients. And so this is where I think a lot of that partnership plays out in that space of getting a deeper level of impact because we have the resources, we have the programs, we have the know-how now we can extend those over a lot more members. And so I think both Signify, Oak Street will bring a lot to the table over the coming years on how we can really bend that cost trend.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Ann, please go ahead.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nManaging Director and Senior Healthcare Services Equity Analyst, Mizuho Securities\n\nGreat, thanks. You talked about in pharmacy services there was some pressure on mix and also your inability to make pricing guarantees. Can you just elaborate on both comments? Is the pricing guarantee a diabetes issue given the GLP-1 class?\nThanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nIt's not a diabetes issue. Think of it as, you know, we have to have projections about what the mix looks like to ensure that we appropriately hit all of our client guarantees. And we, with the changing mix inside the quarter, given some of the disruptions that we saw, not only with the loss of a large client, but with the insourcing of another client's business, and some of the disruptions in the marketplace in terms of volumes, specifically GLP-1s, was part of that.\nWe missed our guarantees by a little bit. We'll see how we're able to recoup that over the remainder of the year. But at this point, what we've assumed is that that first quarter is permanent and that we can get back to our previous projections for the remainder of the year. David, anything you'd add to that?\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nNo, I think that's consistent with the way we see it. I will just add one thing. On GLP-1s, obviously there's been a lot of volatility. One, because of supply constraints that we've experienced and obviously a lot of work around managing what we would see as this unprecedented demand combined with a very challenging price point is leading to a lot of energy around how to best manage this category through whether it be formulary, more aggressive utilization management, and then the broader care management wrappers on this. But this category alone is driving obviously significant cost for our clients, and it's also driving significant expense within our organization just to support what is now one of our highest drivers of call volume around people trying to find access to the product and making sure that we get consistent supply in the market.\nSo we believe we've got a really strong set of programs and services to manage the category, and we believe once there's competition and adequate supply, we'll be able to have more consistency around how we manage this category.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nFormer President and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAs we close the call, I want to just take this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their many contributions, and we look forward to providing you updates throughout the year. Thank you for joining the call today.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.\nSa."

My name is Adam, and I'll be your operator today. If you'd like to ask a question during the Q&A portion of today's call, you may do so by pressing star followed by one on your. Telephone keypad to enter the queue. I will now hand the call to Larry McGrath to begin, so Larry, please go ahead when you are ready.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSenior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-K filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website where it will be archived for one year.\nDuring this call, we'll make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our Form 10-K we filed this morning. During this call, we'll use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to our Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nthank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. In 2023, we made strong progress on our journey, bringing together integrated health solutions that meet the needs of consumers where and when they want healthcare. We successfully navigated a challenging environment and delivered on our financial commitments, a powerful testament to the strength of our diversified company. We are building America's health platform, enabling access to high quality, convenient, and affordable care that supports individuals in building healthier lives. In Q4 2023, we delivered adjusted operating income of $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.12.\nFor the full year, our total revenues were $358 billion, an increase of 11% versus the prior year. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $8.74. We generated $13.4 billion of operating cash flow, demonstrating the power of our business model and supporting our strategy. This morning, we revised our full year 2024 guidance for adjusted EPS to at least $8.3 and cash flow from pperations to at least $12 billion. While utilization pressure in Medicare Advantage continues to be attributable to the same categories we have previously highlighted, a part of which was contemplated in our 2024 guidance. We are taking a cautious stance on our outlook for Medicare Advantage utilization until we have further clarity of these industry-wide trends.\nTom will provide additional details on the components of our guidance. While the Medicare Advantage market has been challenged recently, our view of the long-term opportunity offered by this business remains unchanged. As we discussed in December, we are committed to achieving our targeted 4% to 5 margins in Medicare Advantage over time, and we will begin that journey in 2025. At CVS Health, we have both the scale to transform how healthcare is delivered and the ability to personalize care and coverage for each individual we serve. By bringing together the powerful capabilities of our brands including Aetna, CVS Pharmacy, CVS Healthspire and Caremark, we can deliver significant value to the customers and communities we serve and unlock tremendous potential for our shareholders. When all of our assets work together, we are able to lower the total cost of care, improve health outcomes, deepen patient engagement, and increase loyalty.\nWe are able to unlock up to three to four times more enterprise value when we engage members in more than one CVS Health business. Today we have more than 55 million CVS Health customers that engage with at least two of our offerings. We see tremendous opportunities we expand engagement with customers across CVS Health through our multi-payer capabilities and vast consumer reach. We're also creating new value in healthcare with innovative models and offerings that create more transparency and choice for consumers and clients. In December, we unveiled our new CVS CostVantage model in our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness business. This model proactively addresses the persistent reimbursement pressures in the retail pharmacy industry.\nIt eliminates cross subsidization and creates a more durable and transparent pharmacy business that is fairly compensated for value delivered to customers and patients for all prescriptions dispensed. We have made notable progress since we announced the new model in December. We recently delivered initial terms and conditions to several PBMs and are actively engaged in constructive discussions. CVS CostVantage is a dramatic change to the current reimbursement model and will provide a clear pathway to greater transparency while passing along our industry-leading cost of goods improvements. We've reached preliminary agreements with multiple cash discount card administrators to begin using CVS CostVantage on 1 April. This is a foundational step that sets the stage to create more predictable pricing at the pharmacy counter for consumers.\nWe also announced our new CVS Caremark TrueCost model. This innovative client option offers pricing that reflects the true net cost of prescription drugs with continued client visibility into administrative fees. Simplified pricing will help consumers be more confident that their pharmacy benefit provides the best possible price and ensures members have stable access to our national pharmacy network. Finally, we continue to drive greater adoption of biosimilars and increase the affordability of these critical specialty drugs for our clients and their members. Beginning on 1 April, Caremark will remove Humira from its major commercial template formularies. Through Cordavis, we will offer a co-branded Humira product.\nCordavis plays an important role in reducing drug costs while helping to ensure a consistent supply of affordable, high-quality biosimilars for the patients we serve. These steps are truly innovative and will be pivotal as we look to unlock the tremendous value that new pharmacy models and offerings will deliver for our clients and their members. We are passionate about expanding access to care, lowering costs, improving health outcomes and creating more transparency and choice for consumers. Our colleagues are committed to this important purpose and will deliver on these goals. I'll now turn to the highlights from each of our businesses in the quarter. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we continue to navigate through elevated utilization trends in our Medicare Advantage business.\nIn the quarter, we grew revenues to nearly $27 billion, an increase of over 16%, and delivered adjusted operating income of $676 million. Medical membership ended the year at 25.7 million, an increase of 1.3 million members versus the prior year, reflecting growth across multiple product lines including Individual Exchange, Medicare, and commercial. Medicare Advantage is integral to the CVS Health strategy. After a very successful 2024 annual enrollment period, we expect to add at least 800,000 new members in 2024. Our success was driven by targeted investments that were strengthened by CVS Health assets and allowed us to create differentiated value for members. We are improving member experiences by focusing on simplicity, offering unique designs, and maintaining stable networks.\nLast week we received the proposed 2025 rate notice. The funding level was broadly consistent with our expectations, which we do not believe is sufficient to cover current medical cost trends. We believe that the changes to Part D as a consequence of the Inflation Reduction Act necessitate additional funding to cover the comprehensive member benefits provided and the increased risk that plans are assuming as a result of the redesign. We look forward to providing our comments to CMS in the coming weeks. In our Health Services segment, CVS Healthspire, revenues grew to more than $49 billion in the quarter, an increase of more than 12%, reflecting strong growth in our Pharmacy Services business as well as the acquisitions of Oak Street and Signify Health. Adjusted operating income grew more than 4% to nearly $1.9 billion.\nIn our Caremark business, we recently completed a highly successful welcome season. We onboarded more than 3 million new members and ensured our patients had access to their critical medications and specialty therapies. Our consistent ability to deliver exceptional customer member experience is what makes Caremark a leader in the marketplace. We continue to drive success in our Health Care Delivery business. We have tremendous momentum engaging multi-payer Medicare Advantage members with Oak Street Clinics through our extensive CVS Health touch points. Oak Street ended the year with 202,000 at-risk lives, an increase of 27% versus the prior year.\nThrough January, the number of Aetna members enrolled in Oak Street Clinic has doubled. Signify Health continues to demonstrate the value of its in-home capabilities for all of our multi-payer Medicare Advantage partners. Signify completed 649,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter and an increase of 20% versus the same period last year. Among our Aetna customers, we are broadening our addressable market utilizing Signify's strong capabilities in other products, including Individual Exchange and Medicaid. We will be expanding these capabilities with other clients and will deliver value by engaging consumers in their health across multiple channels. In our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, which serves more than 120 million customers, revenues grew to more than $31 billion, an increase of nearly 9% versus the prior year.\nWe generated $2 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, up nearly 10% versus the prior year. PCW's performance in the Q4 was driven by strong operational execution. We continue to play an important role in providing access to critical immunization in the communities we serve and delivered on Pharmacy performance measures for our health plan partners. We made progress executing on our store closure initiative, having closed 630 stores to date and are on track to close 900 by the end of the year. On a comparable basis, total same store sales were up more than 11% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Same store prescription volumes in the quarter, we're up more than 4% versus last year.\n2023 highlighted our exceptional execution and the power of our diversified business. Our financial performance and differentiated strategy create strong momentum into 2024. Our integrated health model grows in relevance and importance every day for the consumers, customers, communities, and the shareholders we serve. I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more details on our results and our guidance. Tom?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our Q4 results truly highlight our unwavering focus on execution and the power of our diversified businesses. We ended the year with strong results in key metrics such as revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow from operations. A few total company highlights: Q4 revenues of nearly $94 billion increased by nearly 12% over the prior-year quarter, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.12, representing growth of approximately 4% versus the prior year. These increases were primarily due to strong results in our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness and Pharmacy Services businesses as well as lower corporate expenses, partially offset by continued pressure in Health Care Benefits.\nOur ability to generate cash remains outstanding with full year cash flow from operations of $13.4 billion. Shifting to details for our Health Care Benefits segment, we delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth versus the prior year. Q4 revenue of $26.7 billion increased more than 16% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines, particularly in our Individual Exchange and Medicare businesses. Membership was 25.7 million, a slight decrease of 29,000 members sequentially, reflecting the impact of Medicaid redeterminations, partially offset by growth in Individual Exchange. Adjusted operating income for the Q4 was $676 million. The decline in adjusted operating income versus the prior year was primarily driven by growth in the Individual Exchange business, including the related impact of seasonality, increased utilization, and Medicare Advantage, partially offset by higher net investment income.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 88.5% increased 270 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting higher Medicare Advantage utilization and a lower contribution from positive prior period development. Utilization pressure continues to be attributable to the same categories we highlighted in the previous quarter, including outpatient and supplemental benefits such as Dental and Vision. We also saw an uptick in costs related to seasonal immunizations, including the newly launched RSV vaccine. Other categories remain largely consistent with our previous medical cost trend assumptions. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 45.9, down 4.4 days sequentially, and returning to normalized levels consistent with what we experienced in pre-COVID periods after adjusting for the impact of Medicaid pass-through payments. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nOur Health Services segment, which includes our Pharmacy Services and Health Care Delivery businesses, generated revenue of approximately $49 billion, an increase of more than 12% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation, and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion grew approximately 4% year-over-year, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter increased slightly versus the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by net new business and increased utilization.\nThe increase was largely offset by the impact of the New York Medicaid carveout. Total pharmacy membership as of 1 January 2024 is approximately 89 million members, down primarily due to the previously announced loss of a large client. We continue to be encouraged by the performance and growth of our Health Care Delivery assets. Signify generated revenue growth of 39% in the quarter compared to last year. Oak Street ended the quarter with 204 centers, an increase of 35 centers in 2023. We continue to expect to add 50 to 60 centers in 2024.\nOak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing 36% compared to the same quarter last year. Shifting to our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segments, we generated revenue of over $31 billion, up nearly 9% versus the prior year, and over 11% on a same store basis, reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescription volume, brand inflation, and increased contributions from vaccinations. These revenue increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, continued reimbursement pressure, and a decrease in store counts. Adjusted operating income was approximately $2 billion, an increase of nearly 10% versus the prior year, driven by improved drug purchasing, increased contributions from vaccinations, the increased prescription volume described above, and lower operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Same store pharmacy sales were up 15.5% versus the prior year, and same store prescription volumes increased by 4.4%.\nSame store sales in front store were down by about 3% versus the same quarter last year. Shifting to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Our ability to generate cash flow remains a core strength of our organization. For full year 2023, cash flow from operations were $13.4 billion. We ended the year with approximately $735 million of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings, while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically.\nIn the Q4, we returned $779 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividend. We also entered into a $3 billion fixed dollar accelerated share repurchase transaction, which became effective on 3 January 2024. Turning now to our full year outlook for 2024, in recognition of the marketplace uncertainty around utilization trends in Medicare Advantage, we revised our 2024 adjusted EPS guidance to at least $8.30. In the Health Care Benefits segment. We now expect our 2024 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 87.7%, an increase of 50 basis points from our previous guidance. As I already noted, we observed elevated medical cost trends in our Medicare Advantage business in the Q4, which pressured our full year 2023 medical benefit ratio by approximately 10 basis points relative to our prior guidance. The remaining pressure in the quarter was largely a function of mix and higher revenue offsets than we previously projected.\nBased on our review of our recently completed Q4 2023 medical cost trend analysis, we are prudently assuming that the elevated medical cost trends we observed in the Q4 will carry forward into 2024. Accordingly, we have increased our full year 2024 MBR guidance by approximately 40 basis points to account for this pressure. As discussed throughout 2023, we had included a provision for elevated utilization in our 2024 medical benefit ratio guidance, and will continue to hold that provision until we have more clarity on the Medicare Advantage utilization environment. Our revised outlook also reflects an expectation of at least 800,000 new Medicare Advantage members in 2024. As we have previously discussed, the profile of these new members is attractive, with nearly three quarters of these members switching from other Medicare plans, and about 1/3 of members expected in D-SNP plans. We continue to expect these new members will be neutral to earnings, but the mix impact from incremental new membership represents approximately 10 basis points of today's 2024 MBR guidance revision.\nWhen combined with the additional 40 basis points of medical cost pressure we are projecting, we have increased our 2024 MBR projection by 50 basis points to 87.7%. We anticipate a number of favorable items will partially offset the impact of the expected elevated utilization levels, including higher investment income and higher than previously projected commercial membership. Adding up all the pieces, we now expect adjusted operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment to be at least $5.4 billion, a decrease of $370 million from our prior estimates. In our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, we now expect a portion of the outperformance from the end of 2023 to persist into 2024. As a result, we now project adjusted operating income of at least $5.6 billion, an increase of approximately $90 million from our prior guidance. In our Health Services segment, we're updating 2024 adjusted operating income to at least $7.4 billion, a decrease of approximately $90 million.\nWhile our Health Care Delivery businesses were able to successfully manage through medical cost trend pressures in 2023, we think it is prudent to recognize the potential for emerging risks at our payer partners until we have further clarity on 2024 utilization trends. Finally, we've made a corresponding adjustment to cash flow from operations, which we now project will be at least $12 billion this year. As you think about the cadence of earnings in 2024, we expect to generate less than 50% of our adjusted EPS in the first half. More specifically, we expect to generate roughly 20% of full year adjusted EPS in the Q1. This pattern will look different than 2023 primarily due to the way Medicare Advantage utilization emerged over the course of 2023 and the timing and impact of prior period development. As a result, Health Care Benefits 2024 MBR will see the largest year-over-year increase in the Q1 and the smallest in the Q4.\nYou can find additional details on the components of our updated 2024 guidance on our investor relations webpage. Beyond 2024, we are committed to returning our Medicare Advantage margins to our target of 4% to 5, while also preserving the projected returns on capital for our 2023 acquisitions. Our stars recovery in 2025 will enhance our earnings trajectory, even as we work to adjust our plans to account for the preliminary 2025 Medicare Advantage rate notice, which does not adequately cover recent medical cost trends. For 2025, our goal is to deliver low double-digit adjusted EPS growth off our updated 2024 guidance. We expect to update investors later this year on our progress against this goal. To conclude, 2023 was a year where CVS Health demonstrated the power of our diversified enterprise.\nAs we begin 2024, we remain focused on operational execution and sustainable growth as we advance our goal of becoming the leading health solutions company for consumers. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions, Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question today, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now to enter the queue. Our first question today comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nThanks very much. Good morning. Tom, thanks for all of that color. I just want to go a little bit deeper and just really understand how do I think about what happened in the Q4, how that is influencing how you're thinking about 2024. What happened from your investor day in December? That's really influencing this.\nDid you see claims coming in throughout December that's influencing how you're thinking about 2024? You touched a little bit on this around the new members and the fact that they're switchers, and the impact there. Just wondering if you can give us any more color on how to think about their risk coding and the level of comfort that you have there, just it being just 10 basis points with adding so much membership. Lastly, how do I think about medical cost trend versus supplemental benefits when we think about 2024.?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nSure, maybe. Thanks, Lisa. Maybe I'll take the first part of that, and I'll ask Brian to take the back parts. As you think about what changed from our investor day, we actually saw really high levels of paid claims in the back half of December. We noted that when we appeared at your conference in January. As we dove deeper into what went on in the Q4, maybe let me just walk you through kind of what we've seen in aggregate. If you start with the Q4 of 2023 and just let's think about its impact on the full year performance.\nWe ended the year at 86.2, which was about 20 basis points higher than our guidance. Roughly half of that pressure is things that we do not believe should carry into 2024. Key drivers of that would be things like Medicaid, pass-through payments, and also higher SEP membership. As you know, once redeterminations start to end in the first half, we shouldn't see that same sort of pressure in the back half this year. We've also repositioned our portfolio across the board in individual. As you think about the other half of that 10 basis points, that's all related to the trend pressure that we saw in Medicare.\nIt's a lot of the same categories, though, that we've been talking about all year and that we've been trying to actively get ahead of in our guidance. Outpatient trend accelerated slightly in the Q4, so hips and knees. We also continue to see elevated trends in supplemental benefits, but really it was more Dental and Vision than the OTC cards that we talked about earlier this year. Finally, we saw some pressure in the quarter from vaccinations, which is really RSV related. As we look across the other categories, the cost trends themselves on a dollar basis, they're essentially in line with where it is that we thought that they would be. How does that translate then into 2024?\nWe've taken that 10 basis points of pressure and we've pulled it through into the 2024 baseline. Accordingly, we've increased our estimate for medical costs by over $400 million in our forward guidance for 2024. With the additional mix impacts from the new members, that additional 200,000+ that we've talked about since Investor Day, we think that gets you to about a 50 basis point increase, which is the totality of what we've done this morning. As I said in the prepared remarks, I'd just remind you, when we first started talking about our guidance for 2024 at the Q2 call, we talked about putting an additional provision into 2024 for enhanced utilization. We've maintained that provision in our guidance, and we hope that that will be a prudent posture. We want to see where trends are going to settle.\nI'd also just note that as you think about the Medicare business now, that book is now only projected to be marginally profitable in 2024, and that's something that we will actively be looking to address with our 2025 bids. I'll turn it over to Brian.\n\nBrian Kane\n\nEVP and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I would just add on the new members, Lisa, to your question, there's nothing that we've seen in those new members that would give us pause. The risk scores look reasonable. The fact that so many of the members are switchers is a really important component of that. The fact that we have a big portion that are D-SNPs, 1/3, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, matters because we don't have a stars issue in that book of business. Overall, we feel good about the new membership. I would just add that new membership also has a very important tailwind for 2025 as those members get coded next year and as the cost of the distribution wear off for 2025.\nWe feel very good about the new members that we received. There's nothing that we've seen that gives us pause there, and we think everything is fully reflected in our 2024 guide as Tom went through. With respect to your question on supplemental benefits, we believe we've fully reflected the cost of those benefits in our 2024 guide. We mentioned on the last quarterly call that we've effectively assumed full utilization of those flex cards that were giving us a lot of challenges this year. The dental and vision type pressure has also been fully reflected in our guide. Again, we feel good, as Tom said, that we fully reflected the 2023 baseline in our 2024 numbers.\nWe put a normalized, very reasonable trend on top of that baseline, and today we put additional dollars on top of that through the increase in the MBR. All in all, we feel good about how we're positioned for 2024.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, Lisa, I just want to reemphasize the point that Tom made about 2025. I said this in our prepared remarks that we are committed for margin recovery in Medicare Advantage for 2025, and we'll account for that in our bids.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you for the comments.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the 2025 bidding strategy, and specifically, I know you're going to get some tailwind and margin improvement from stars in 2025. I wanted to talk beyond that. I found your comments helpful on the rates, and I know that could be a pressure, and that's going to cause benefit reductions. Beyond that, do you expect to cut benefits beyond whatever the rates would suggest to start recapturing margin beyond stars for the higher cost run?\nHow should we think about that positioning for 2025, and how quickly do you think you get back to that 4% to 5 margin? Thanks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHey, Justin, it's Karen and I'll hand this over to Brian in a second, but I just want to comment on the rate notice because that's critical to how we think about 2025 bids. You know, there's kind of three things I would say here. One is, you know, we believe, you know, it's in line with our expectations relative to being flat. However, we do not believe it covers overall cost trends that have been emerging in Medicare Advantage. We also know that there's complexity around the risk model, so we'll be contemplating that as we think about our bids. Finally, there's some uncertainty around how the Inflation Reduction Act impacts Part D, and that we'll be taking that under consideration when we do our bids as well, and providing comments to CMS relative to these points.\nSo all those will factor into our bid process, but we will be driving for margin recovery. Let me have Brian specifically answer your detailed questions.\n\nBrian Kane\n\nEVP and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nSure. Thanks, Karen. I'll just reiterate again that we are committed to the 4% to 5 margin. It's top of mind, and extremely important that we get there. As we've said multiple times, it will be a multi-year journey to get there. We intend to take significant ground against that target in 2025, while also being very disciplined and reflecting the trends that we see in our business to make sure that's fully reflected in the pricing.\nYou know, Karen mentioned some of the headwinds with respect to the rate notice and that we don't believe it fully reflects medical trend. There are some issues around Part D that we need to work through as the benefit has been meaningfully enhanced as part of the IRA. And also we as an industry are taking on meaningfully more risk in the catastrophic layer that will have to be reflected in our bids. And that's something we intend to do. We are also limited, as you know, by TBC or total beneficiary change limitations that we are working through that could to some extent constrain what we're able to do. That being said, we do intend to take additional margin actions.\nOur goal is to do so in excess of our stars, you know, our stars tailwind that we have. I would also note, as I mentioned in the prior question that Lisa asked, it's really important to think about this 800,000 members that we're getting as a meaningful tailwind to 2025. Again, because these members haven't been fully documented from a coding perspective and because the distribution costs are very expensive throughout the year, that will wear off in 2025, and so you get a nice tailwind there. The last point I make, which I think is important, is that although the IRA did enhance the benefits, as we said on Part D, the result of that will likely be, notwithstanding some of the risk model changes that were made for PDP, will likely result in meaningful premium increases on the PDP side, which we believe will actually help the relative attractiveness of MA. And I think that's an important component as we think about the attractiveness of MA for 2025. The last point I make, which I think is important as an industry, not only does MA offer superior benefits, and we believe that even with some of the changes that we intend on making, it'll still be a compelling value proposition for our customers.\nBut the thing that doesn't get talked about enough is the significant benefits around care coordination around navigating the healthcare system that our members get as a result of choosing an MA plan that is far superior to a traditional Medicare fee for service plan. And that's something that we will be top of mind for us. And our intention is to continue to enhance that experience, especially with our new members, to make sure that we retain them for 2025.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking my question. I want to go maybe a little bit further on Justin's question. When you think about getting to 4% to 5 over time. I guess what we're all trying to understand or worried about or just trying, maybe it's the strategy, like your positioning. Can you still take share and enhance margin, knowing what you know? Maybe talk a little bit about how CVS is positioned in their ability to bid versus others in the marketplace.\nWhat are your advantages and disadvantages? And can you with stars coming back or not? But can you get to your margin targets and still grow in line or better than the expected market growth?\n\nBrian Kane\n\nEVP and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nWell, look, I appreciate the question. There's still some questions out there. We got to see where the final rate notice obviously shakes out in terms of overall where margins can go, and of course get a real handle around where we think trend will be for 2025. Be very disciplined about that. And so that'll be an important calculus as we think about margin recovery, as we think about relative share. Look, we believe that we have a compelling value proposition as an enterprise with all the various assets we can bring to bear for our Medicare members.\nWe do think that our stars coming back does on the margin provide an advantage there. As I will reiterate again, the significant membership growth that we got in 2024 also gives us some tailwinds going into 2025. But I will tell you, we are first and foremost focused on recovering margin, and market share gains is a secondary consideration. Obviously, we want to grow. As I said in the prior question, we believe this is a compelling space, we believe it's compelling for members, and we believe we have the assets to be able to manage those members and provide superior customer experience relative to the competition. As a consequence, I think we're very well positioned to grow our business and over time take share.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nathan Rich at Goldman Sachs. Nathan, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nVP of Global Investment Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thanks for the questions. It's obviously been challenging this year for many companies to kind of get their hands around utilization. So, I don't know if you have any kind of early comments on how January played out, maybe relative to the Q4, on both the outpatient trend as well as supplemental benefits, then, as it relates to the 2024 MBR, now, I think, being up 150 basis points. I guess at a high level, would you be able to break that increase down between utilization pressure, the impact that new members will have, the stars headwind that you face? Is there pressure also in there from the risk model, or is that something that you price for? Just as we think about the different components that contribute to the 2024 MBR.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Nate. Why don't I take the second part of your question first, and then I'll turn it back over to Brian. So as you look at the year-over-year MBR increase, almost the entirety of it is related to the Medicare Advantage business. So there are some smaller items. So we have an improvement in our Individual Exchange business, and then there's some other offsets there. But we also, as we think about our guidance, we never project prior year reserve development. And so that's, you know, those two for the most part net.\nAnd so what you were left with is the vast majority of the increases related to Medicare, and so about 65 basis points of that specifically relates to the $800 million stars headwind that we have. And then the remainder is a combination of provisions for the new member mix because we're assuming a higher MBR there, and you know that will be plus or minus breakeven. And then the rest of it is really provision for Medicare utilization pressure.\n\nBrian Kane\n\nEVP and President of Aetna, CVS Health\n\nWith respect to January trends, it's really way too early to comment on that. There's nothing that we've seen in our January data that gives us pause relative to the guidance that we've given today. Obviously, we're going to monitor it very closely, as you can imagine, and as we get more information, we will absolutely share that with you. I would comment just on the risk model. Just make a quick comment about the V28 provisions. We talked about this at our investor day.\nNot every player is impacted the same way by this. As we've said, we have a relatively low portion of duals and D-SNPs. It's obviously something that we're growing significantly this year. But we're way over, way under indexed to D-SNP relative to some of our competitors. I think that's an important element because that's a population that's been impacted more by these risk model changes. We also, and we think this is ultimately an opportunity, are underpenetrated when it comes to our full risk VBC relationships.\nThose types of relationships also result in, I would say, bigger impact on V28 relative to a non-VBC type relationship. This is something we want to expand over time, and it's a critical strategic priority for us. With respect to the risk model change, we're actually benefited by the fact that we have a much lower penetration than some of our peers.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nNate, I might just say, you know, one of the things that we spent a lot of time looking at specifically was inpatient, and there are some puts and takes there, but on the whole that category remains consistent with our expectations. We did make a provision in both our bids and, you know, therefore, which is incorporated in our guidance for the changes that would happen in January from the two midnight rule. That's fully encapsulated inside the guide, and it's something that we're obviously watching very closely because of to make sure that our estimate is consistent with what we're going to see come through the system.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ann Hynes from Mizuho. Ann, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAnn Hynes\n\nSenior Healthcare Services Equity Analyst and Managing Director, Mizuho\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe I'll shift away from MLR and focus on retail and just the new pricing model. I know you discussed in your comments, but can you just give us any more details on the initial feedback you're receiving from payers? Have your discussions changed your view on the ability to change the model or the timing? Just to clarify, this is a mandatory program so payers basically have to switch with you, and if, I guess, what's the risk of payer relationships if they don't want to? Thanks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nGood morning, Ann. Yeah, I would say that the comments and the feedback have generally been positive with the discussions initially. Obviously, there's a lot of details to go through and to work through, but we're really pleased with sort of the initial reaction, and I'll ask Prem to give you a little bit more detail here.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP, Chief Pharmacy Officer, and President of Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks for the question, Ann. You know, what I'd say is we launched a model at Analyst Day and really excited about the progress we've made. We've been able to, over the course of the last week, deliver the initial terms and conditions to several of the pharmacy benefit managers, are very engaged in constructive discussions with all of them. What really excites me is we're leading the way in providing greater transparency in drug pricing and passing through our leading cost of goods through to payers in our new model. This is not about, you know, effectively raising the prices, it's about continuing to pass through our size and scale and the acquisition costs that we receive back to payers and provide a transparent model that can benefit consumers and payers as we go forward. Remember, one of the biggest challenges as you think about the healthcare ecosystem, the problems we face is the rising cost of brand drugs.\nIf you think about, you know, what the biggest pain point for our payers is, it's the fact that these brand drugs and specialty drugs now constitute the majority of the trend that kind of get passed through the payers and plan sponsors. It's not the pharmacy reimbursement that's driving that. Just some quick data points on that. If you think about the impact of GLP-1s in 2022 to the system, it was about $14 billion. Right. That continues to grow.\nFrom my perspective, we continue to have good discussions with payers. We're driving forward on eliminating some of the key problems in the system, such as cross subsidization, and creating an easier path and a much more transparent path to allow payers and consumers to receive their pharmacy and pharmaceuticals in the US, and more to come as we make progress over the course of the next couple quarters.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nI would just remind everyone that the industry has continually talked about the importance of driving cost transparency and affordability. With this model and our true cost model, we are really kind of leading at the forefront to support those items. I think as Prem has been out in the market, there is a lot of support for this.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Josh, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nThanks. Good morning, here with Eric as well. I'm going to hopefully close the loop on the MA side. Can you speak to just your philosophy overall on MA bids, and do you consider the benefit of the enterprise from growth, or does the HDB segment have to stand on its own when you talk about that 4% to 5 margin? Can you speak to the impact of growing your Healthspire assets and how that impacts your MA bid strategy? I'm specifically thinking about, you know, growth in Oak Street probably creates a short-term headwind, but long-term enterprise value. Thanks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nJosh, the way we think about it is that 4% to 5 margin needs to be at HCB, and then we get the benefit of our growth from all the other assets that we can bring to bear for the company. That's our philosophical approach to MA bids, and then relative to how the Healthspire assets can support MA, I'll ask Mike to give you some comments on that.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nEVP and President of Health Care Delivery, CVS Health\n\nYeah, one of the key parts of the partnership we have with Aetna, but with all of our payers, is we have additional levers we can pull at HCB to positively impact patient care quality, positively impact outcomes, and then lower medical costs. Right. That can be Signify delivering in-home assessments to identify patient disease burdens. We can treat it appropriately. That can be on Oak Street Health having more levers as a PCP to further lower MLR. Our job is for all of our payer partners to provide substantially better care.\nObviously, when our payer partners are growing and taking share, a lot of that growth trickles down to us and becomes a tailwind for us. One of the advantages I think we have as a healthcare delivery organization is the more levers to pull. One quick example for the group is we bought a company at Oak Street called RubiconMD a couple years ago, and we leverage eConsults to help provide better access to specialty care and lower cost. We fully implemented the eConsult program in 2023 at Oak Street, and through that implementation we were able to lower trend 1% across our entire book. That is one reason we were able to hit our expectations at Oak Street on MLR and profitability despite the increase in a lot of utilization categories that Tom discussed that we saw as well. I think a lot of our strategy is dependent on being able to drive higher quality and lower cost through those levers.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nJosh, maybe let me wrap this up. As we think about this from the enterprise perspective, all of our businesses need to earn their cost of capital, and they need to earn their return on that capital. As you think about Medicare, it's a mid-$60 billion revenue business that, you know, we targeted a 4% to 5 margin on for 2023. We clearly didn't achieve that. As we look at our projections for 2024, as I noted, it's only marginally profitable. As you think about that business, we're putting a high-teens percentage of dollars in risk-based capital behind every dollar of premium, and so it's imperative that that business earn its margin to earn its cost of capital and returns on capital.\nThat's just how we think about it from an enterprise perspective. We've spent a lot of money over the course of 2023 to develop capabilities which we believe will be additive. We have been very specific with investors about what we expect those returns on capital to be over time, and we're committed to achieving them, which means we're committed to achieving target margins in each of those businesses that we acquired.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys, thanks so much for the question. I wanted to maybe dig into the Pharmacy services profit guidance for 2024 in a little bit more detail. Can you just go through sort of what are the key tenets that of your assumptions that change there versus the guidance that you gave at the investor day in December? Thank you.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nElizabeth, did you mean the Health Services segment? I presume so. Really, what's changed there? I'd say.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nYes.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYep. As you think about that, I noted this a little bit in the prepared remarks. As we think about what the external utilization environment looks like, we felt it was prudent to recognize that as a multi-payer business, there could be impacts outside our ecosystem that might pull through into that business. As Mike said, you know, we spent a lot of time, he spends a lot of time thinking about what the reserving practices are and what their medical cost trends are inside the Oak Street and also our ACO businesses. We try to supplement that as we can with other insights about what it is that we're seeing across our book. As we thought about what we're hearing in the marketplace, what we saw in our own book in the Q4, we thought it was prudent to pull through some of that potential utilization pressure into our outlook, primarily on our Health Care Delivery assets.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo. Stephen, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nStephen Baxter\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Services, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, thank you. I just wanted to follow up on that question precisely. You know, when we look at the guidance reduction for the services business, it does look like it's less than, I think, the kind of implied, you know, 100 basis point guide up on MA MLR that you're talking about for your own book of business. Just hoping you could expand a little more. Specifically, what's included in the increased, you know, loss ratios for the Oak Street business? Then are you potentially also carrying some of the 2023 outperformance into your 2024 outlook as an offset?\nThanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nYes, Stephen, I think that it's important as you think about the guide that you realize two things. Number one, Health Care Delivery is part of a much larger segment. Right. We believe that we've made appropriate provisions in the segmental guidance there for what the potential pressures might look like. The second thing I would just remind you is that we had a very successful 2023 in those businesses. Those businesses were able to successfully manage through the pressures that, you know, we and most of our peers saw in Medicare Advantage and still achieve the targets that we were looking for out of those businesses in 2023.\nWe were very pleased with that performance, and we took a prudent outlook and cautious, hopefully, outlook as we thought about where 2024 might land based on the external environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Allen Lutz from Bank of America. Allen, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nAllen Lutz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst of Healthcare Technology and Distribution, Bank of America",
    "content2": "Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. One for Tom or Prem. On the retail pharmacy side, pharmacy script volume was really strong. How should we think about growth there through the end of the year, ex-COVID, and then are you seeing any noticeable benefits from the bankruptcy of one of your peers? Thanks.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP, Chief Pharmacy Officer, and President of Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nThanks for the question. I'd say a few things. One, as we've entered this year and throughout Q4, we've had extremely strong service in our pharmacy businesses. As we mentioned before, pharmacy relationships are sticky, and they really are driven by the great experiences you can provide at the counter. We feel really good going to this year as it relates to our service. There's been a few market disruptions, as you mentioned, in the marketplace. From our perspective, we continue to make sure that we invest in our stores in the right way, prioritizing the experiences, as I said.\nWe'll look at certain markets for opportunistic file buys if they make sense, as we've historically done over time. We feel really good about our script performance coming into the year, and it's in line with our expectations as we look at this.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nNate, as you think about this business, one of the things that we've said that we've tried to do consistently is to grow share to help to offset reimbursement pressures. As you look at the Q4, we certainly had. I'm sorry, that was Allen. We certainly had. We had same store growth. You got to really think about what the impact of store closures might be as you think about our overall market share.\nWe had same store growth in prescriptions that was in the high 4% range versus a market that grew in kind of mid 2%. We feel like the teams really continue to execute really well in helping to drive to the results that ultimately get us onto the long term trajectory that we outlined at Investor Day.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAllen, I'd also note, and we said this in the prepared remarks, that we've been making good progress on our store closures, and we've been retaining scripts and retaining colleagues, which was critical to the success of those store closures as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Charles Rhyee from TD Cowen. Charles, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nCharles Rhyee\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOh yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to cost advantage a little bit here. You know, when we think about how you're setting up those acquisition costs, can you talk about sort of the reaction from payers a little bit more in regards to how they're seeing what costs that you're passing through? I think one of the issues or concerns that have been raised is the potential for sort of perverse incentives. Right. A pharmacy could prefer a higher acquisition cost drug because the markup is higher.\nYou know, one of the solutions that we've heard mentioned was the potential of setting up maybe global caps on reimbursement for classes of drugs, just making up numbers here, no more than, let's say, AWP minus 90 for generics or something like that. You know, is that something that you are discussing with payers, and what are the measures that you are contemplating to ensure the incentives are aligned? I imagine payers are really interested in that.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP, Chief Pharmacy Officer, and President of Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I think first and foremost, I think there's a few parts to your question. Last week we delivered our terms and conditions, so the payers now have the ability to understand how our model will work. As a reminder, our model is based on a simple, transparent formula that's built upon the underlying acquisition cost of the drugs defined by, you know, plus a defined markup and dispensing fee. To your point on, you know, there's many different ways in pharmacy pricing. My perspective on this is the way we've approached this is in very transparent ways so that payers can receive the benefits of someone like CVS Pharmacy, where we have the operating scale and the operating discipline to drive further acquisition costs down on generics through our procurement and other strategies. We will always be held accountable for reducing acquisition costs, leveraging our scale and size to do that, and also performing and delivering services at the lowest price possible.\nAt the same time, payers also need a viable pharmacy marketplace across the community that can provide, you know, provide what I would say is consistent care across all the communities that we serve. It's critical to meet both of those. You know, look, it's 7 February, so we're still early in this journey, but we're excited about the progress we've made since Analyst Day. We're going to continue these payer negotiations and payer discussions over the course of the coming weeks and months, and we'll provide an update as we go forward. All the things that you're describing are things that we're contemplating and discussing with payers in a very transparent way to eliminate some of the challenges that this industry has had over the course of the last few decades.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from John Ransom from Raymond James. John, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Ransom\n\nManaging Director and Director of Healthcare Research, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. I got a new name, John Ransom. The question I have is just RSV. It's a good guy to your retail franchise, it's a bad guy to HCB. How do we think about the net benefit or net drag to the enterprise for Q4, and what's embedded in your 2024 outlook? Just for RSV?\nThanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nHey John, I don't know that we're going to give a specific on that. As you think about RSV, I would say net because of the relative market share differ between our Pharmacy business and the Aetna business. That tends to be a net tailwind for the enterprise. We did see pressure inside the Q4, in particular in our Medicare business, but also a little bit in the commercial business inside Aetna. As you think about those vaccinations, correspondingly we saw more of a benefit in the Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment. As we think about 2024, given the newness of some of these vaccines, what we've tried to do is take a little bit more cautious outlook as we thought about what the pull through might be for that outperformance in the Q4, and that's why the beat doesn't match the raise as you think about 2024, we'd like to see a little bit more history here before we lean in on that projection.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nJohn, strategically I wouldn't just think about one type of RSV as a vaccine. I want you to think about kind of an immunization franchise that the retail business has really developed, and which is really creating strong value for that business.\n\nOperator\n\nFinal question today is from Erin Wright from Morgan Stanley. Erin, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nErin Wright\n\nHealthcare Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. On Cordavis, I'm just curious how meaningful is the contribution to segment profit or how meaningful is that embedded in your guidance, and how is that just generally playing out relative to your expectations, and then just a quick one on just PBM and transparency. Just your latest thoughts on regulatory changes potentially across the PBM, what you can, what we could potentially see this year in terms of what gets passed and ability to manage around that. Thanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nCFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks, Erin. Maybe I'll start with Cordavis. I'd say we've been very pleased with the progress to date, and we do have a projection for a positive contribution from that business inside the Health Services segment. We'll continue to give more details on that as we get through the year. We haven't disclosed that specific contribution at this point. Maybe I'll turn it over to Karen to talk a little bit more about PBM transparency.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Relative to, you know, what's going on in Washington, obviously this is, you know, continued discussions are going on there. I do think that they'll, you know, they're talking about transparency. If anything does get passed, I think it will be around transparency. I would tell you that given some of the actions that we have taken with both TrueCost and CostVantage, that is resonating, you know, with the legislators and is helpful in driving overall cost transparency. You know, I can't predict what's going on in DC, but I know that we're taking action to improve overall outcomes.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's Q&A session.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nI want to thank you for all joining our call. Thank you for all joining the call today. I want to thank our colleagues for their continued commitment to delivering on our performance. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's call. Thank you very much for your attendance. You may now disconnect your line."

My name is Adam, and I'll be your operator for today. If you'd like to ask a question at the Q&A portion of today's call, you may do so by pressing star followed by one on your telephone keypad. I will now hand the floor to Larry McGrath to begin. So, Larry, please go ahead when you are ready.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSVP of Business Development and Investor Relations, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health Q3 2023 Earnings Call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tom Cowhey, Interim Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Our press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties. In particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the most recent of which was filed this morning, and our recent filings on Form 8-K, including this morning's earnings press release. During this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's financial performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to our Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported strong third-quarter results highlighting the power of our diversified business model. We delivered Adjusted EPS of $2.21 and Adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion. Our consolidated revenues for the quarter of almost $90 billion reflect an increase of nearly 11% over the prior year. Once again, we generated outstanding operating cash flows, bringing our year-to-date total to $16.1 billion. We are reconfirming our guidance range for 2023 Adjusted EPS of $8.50 to 8.70. This reflects execution against our strategy with strong performance in our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment and continued momentum in our health services segment, offsetting incremental Medicare Advantage medical cost pressures in our healthcare benefits segment. The power of our integrated model is clear. We demonstrated this with the significant progress made in restoring our Medicare Advantage Star Ratings.\nOur 2024 ratings show that we will have 87% of our Medicare Advantage members and plans rated four stars or better. We accomplished this in a very short period of time by utilizing the full breadth of CVS Health Touchpoints with our members. We improved CAP scores by an average of two-thirds of a point by deriving powerful consumer insights to design experiences that address the unique needs of our members. We also made improvements beyond CAP. For example, to address HEDIS and patient safety measures, our Medicare Advantage team worked closely with CVS Pharmacy and Caremark to help members improve medication adherence, remove costs, and transportation barriers, and ensure members completed critical tests, screenings, and preventive services. As a result of these efforts, among many others, Aetna was the top performer in both the Part D patient safety, and HEDIS domains.\nOur 2024 Star Ratings will improve our position in the 2025 plan year and will enhance our position well into the future. Medicare Advantage is a key strategic growth area for our business. While it is still early in the 2024 annual enrollment period, we are confident that our competitive offering and attractive benefit design will meet consumer expectations. Aetna continues to be a leader in zero-dollar premium products, and approximately 84% of Medicare eligibles will have access to Aetna plans in this category in 2024. We are also expanding the breadth of our DSNP footprint and now cover more than 2/3 of Medicare eligibles, up 6% from last year. Our DSNP strategy focuses on offering the coordinated medical management these members need to live healthier lives, including introducing them to care delivery options such as Oak Street Health where appropriate.\nOur ability to offer access to convenient sites of care and the integrated benefits that seniors value most will position us to grow at or above the market in 2024. Turning now to how we are unlocking new sources of value in healthcare. This quarter, we announced the creation of Cordavis, a wholly owned subsidiary of CVS Health. We have an established history of innovating to find ways to lower drug spend and to ensure that people we serve have access to the medications they need to stay healthy. Cordavis continues that history of innovation. The biosimilar market in the US is expected to be a $100 billion opportunity by 2029. It represents one of the biggest sources of drug cost savings for consumers and the US healthcare system.\nThrough Cordavis, we are working directly with manufacturers to bring a portfolio of biosimilar products to the market, driving our growth and ensuring that our customers and clients will realize the significant savings potential available through biosimilars for years to come. Let's turn to our performance in the quarter. In our healthcare benefits segment, we grew revenues to more than $26 billion, an increase of nearly 17%, and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Medical membership in the Q3 grew to 25.7 million, an increase of 1.4 million members versus the prior year, reflecting growth across multiple product lines, including individual exchange, Medicare, and commercial. We continue to experience elevated utilization trends in our Medicare Advantage business, primarily in outpatient and supplemental benefits such as dental, behavioral health, OTC, and Flex Cards.\nGiven the elevated cost trends that have emerged this year, we are executing on plans to unlock additional revenue, clinical, and network opportunities to help alleviate these pressures. In our health services segment, revenues grew to nearly $47 billion, an increase of more than 8%. Adjusted operating income grew nearly 11% to $1.9 billion. These results once again reflect impressive performance in our pharmacy services business, where our commitment to lower drug costs and deliver innovative clinical solutions drive value for our consumers and our clients. In the 2024 selling season, our renewals are substantially complete, and our retention remains strong in the high 90s, excluding the 17 contracts. Our sales strategy for new business has been successful, capturing over 60% of national employers that moved CVM. Turning to our care delivery assets, we are scaling capabilities to accelerate growth at both Signify and Oak Street.\nWe are progressing on our initiatives to create integrated health experiences across multiple channels, including Aetna, Signify, CVS Retail Health, and CVS Pharmacy. For Oak Street Health, we are using these channels to educate Medicare-eligible adults about the health services they need and can receive in our primary care clinics. While it is still early, the results of these initiatives are encouraging, and we are excited to share more details at our Investor Day in December. For Signify Health, we are connecting more CVS Pharmacy patients to Signify for in-home evaluations and other services in the home. Our trusted relationship with 90 million patients at the pharmacy counter is a powerful connection and the most frequent engagement in healthcare.\nBy utilizing our pharmacist connection, we have been able to reach more than 50% of Aetna members that Signify was previously unable to reach, enhancing the opportunity to more effectively engage these members in their care. This initiative has surpassed our initial conversion rate goals, and we are excited by the prospect of scaling our capabilities in 2024 and beyond. Turning to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, revenues grew to nearly $29 billion, up 6% versus the prior year. We generated $1.4 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, in line with our results in the prior year. Performance in our retail pharmacy business was strong. Same-store pharmacy sales increased nearly 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Same-store prescription growth, when excluding the impact of COVID, grew by 3.5%.\nTurning to our consumer engagement strategy, our digital nearly 12% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix, and brand inflation. Same-store prescription growth, when excluding the impact of COVID, grew by 3.5%. Turning to our consumer engagement strategy, our digital platform is helping consumers navigate and simplify their health journey. Our digital reach continues to grow, with now over 55 million unique customers, an increase of nearly 20% versus last year. This strong growth has been powered by our focus on innovating and delivering on experiences that matter most for our customers. We have been removing barriers to digital adoption and making it easier for customers to access the services they seek, such as pharmacy refills and advanced scheduling for immunizations online.\nOur strong digital engagement and enhanced capabilities will strengthen our ability to drive seasonal flu, COVID, and RSV immunization awareness and connect patients to our CVS locations for these important health services. Before I turn it over to Tom to discuss our financial results, I'd like to highlight some recent changes to our leadership team. As we previously announced, I would like to welcome Brian Kane as our new president of Aetna. Brian's extensive industry experience will be critical as he and his team work to deliver consumer-centric, holistic healthcare to the more than 35 million members served by Aetna. In mid-October, we also announced that Shawn Guertin, our Chief Financial Officer and President of the Health Services business, is taking a leave of absence due to unforeseen family health reasons.\nTom Cowhey has been appointed to the role of interim CFO, and Mike Pykosz has assumed the role of interim president of health services. Both Tom and Mike are well-positioned to continue to seamlessly execute on our strategy. Finally, I would like to thank our colleagues for the commitment and dedication they show every day to support our customers, our clients, and our patients. I will now turn the call over to Tom to provide more details on our results and our guidance. Tom?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third-quarter results continue to demonstrate the power of our execution and the value of our diversified enterprise. This quarter, we saw strength across key metrics such as revenue, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow from operations. A few total company highlights: third-quarter revenues of nearly $90 billion increased by double-digit percentages over the prior year quarter, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.21, representing growth of approximately 2% versus the prior year. These increases were primarily due to continued strong execution in our pharmacy services operations, partially offset by pressure in healthcare benefits and the inclusion of Oak Street Health results. Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding, with year-to-date cash flow from operations of $16.1 billion.\nCash flows benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in Q4. Excluding this impact, our year-to-date cash flows from operations remain strong at approximately $11 billion. Shifting to the details for our healthcare benefits segment, we delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. Q3 revenue of $26.3 billion increased nearly 17% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines, but primarily attributable to Medicare and our individual exchange products. Membership grew to 25.7 million, an increase of 54,000 members sequentially, reflecting growth in our individual exchange and Medicare businesses, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion in the quarter declined approximately 6% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher medical benefit ratio, partially offset by higher net investment income.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 85.7% increased 230 basis points from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting lower prior-period development, as well as higher Medicare Advantage utilization inside the quarter. Utilization pressure was primarily attributable to the categories Karen highlighted earlier, including outpatient and supplemental benefits such as dental, behavioral health, OTC, and flex cards. Further, we also experienced individual exchange growth in the special enrollment period that exceeded our expectations. These members, particularly when added late in the year, will drive a higher MBR. As a result, our higher individual exchange growth is also contributing to our updated MBR guidance for the full year. We continue to closely watch utilization trends in our other lines of business, but at this stage, we have not observed any other trends that we would consider inconsistent with our total expectations.\nToday's claims payable at the end of the quarter was 50.3, up 3.4 days sequentially, and reserve growth exceeded premium growth sequentially. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment, which includes our pharmacy services business and our health services operations, generated revenue of approximately $47 billion, an increase of more than 8% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation, and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Adjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion grew approximately 11% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong execution and improved purchasing economics, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements. Total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter declined by less than 1% versus the prior year and were only down 40 basis points when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations.\nThis decline was primarily attributable to the New York Medicaid carve-out and lower COVID-19 vaccinations, partially offset by net new business. Total pharmacy membership remains steady at approximately 110 million members. We continue to be encouraged by the performance and growth of our health services assets. Signify completed 655,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 7% versus the same period last year, and generated revenue growth of 21%. Oak Street ended the quarter with 192 centers and 191,000 at-risk lives. We've grown by 31 centers versus the prior year quarter and are on track to open a total of 35 new centers this year, ramping to 50 to 60 centers in 2024. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing 44% compared to the same quarter last year. Oak Street's clinical model continues to demonstrate exceptional performance.\nLast week, CMS released the 2022 savings performance of all ACO REACH participants. Oak Street was among the top 5% of program participants, generating a meaningful gross savings rate of 21%. Moving to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we generated revenue of nearly $29 billion, up 6% versus the prior year, and nearly 9% on a same-store basis, reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescriptions, and brand inflation. These revenue increases were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions, a decrease in store count, and decreased COVID-19-related volume. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion was in line with the prior year, driven by continued reimbursement pressure and lower COVID contributions, largely offset by improved drug purchasing, increased prescription volumes, and lower expenses.\nSame-store pharmacy sales were up nearly 12%, driven by drug mix, a 2.7% increase in same-store prescription volumes, and brand inflation. The increase in same-store prescription volumes, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, was 3.5%. As we continue to execute on our store closure initiative, having closed 564 out of 900 planned stores, we encourage investors to focus on same-store metrics to understand underlying growth. Our front-store business continues to exhibit resiliency in the face of industry challenges, underscoring the value we offer consumers. Same-store sales for the front-store were down 2.2%, primarily due to declines in cough, cold, and flu and OTC test kits. Excluding the impact of OTC test kits, same-store front sales were in line with the prior year. Shifting to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remained excellent.\nOur ability to generate cash flow remains a core strength of our organization, and the enterprise continues to identify new opportunities to further optimize our balance sheet. Through the Q3, we generated cash flow from operations of $16.1 billion, including the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. This quarter, we returned $779 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. Turning now to our full-year outlook for 2023, we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS of $8.50 to $8.70. This primarily reflects our performance through the Q3 and the continuation of higher Medicare Advantage medical cost trend for the remainder of 2023, offset by strength in our pharmacy, consumer wellness, and health services segments.\nIn the healthcare benefits segment, we now expect our 2023 medical benefit ratio to be approximately 86%, primarily driven by the previously mentioned impact of higher Medicare Advantage utilization, as well as the impact of higher-than-expected individual exchange growth during the special enrollment period. As a result, we now expect adjusted operating income for the segment to be in a range of $5.63 to 5.76 billion. Our individual exchange business is expected to reduce adjusted operating earnings in 2023, largely a function of late-year growth. However, this business is now poised to reach an annualized run rate of more than $6 billion of revenue, and we are well-positioned to earn a positive margin in this business in 2024 based on specific actions our teams are implementing, including pricing adjustments.\nIn our health services segment, we are updating our adjusted operating income guidance to a range of $7.18 to 7.31 billion, reflecting the strong execution year-to-date in our pharmacy services business and our expectation of continued strength for the remainder of the year. In our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $5.76 to 5.86 billion, primarily driven by higher contributions from seasonal immunizations, partially offset by lower-than-expected script volume, primarily attributable to Medicaid redeterminations. Shifting to our cash flow, given our strong performance year-to-date, we now anticipate full-year 2023 cash flow from operations to be at the upper end of our range of $12.5 to 13.5 billion. Our expectation for capital expenditures is now $2.5 to 2.7 billion. We're also updating our adjusted effective tax rate to 24.9% and our share count to $1.291 billion.\nYou can find additional details on the components of our updated 2023 guidance on our investor relations webpage. Before I conclude my prepared remarks, I want to give you an update on the headwinds and tailwinds for 2024, starting with the headwinds. As we previously discussed, the decline in our Star Ratings for benefit year 2024 will pressure our Medicare Advantage margins. We now expect the impact to be closer to the low end of our previously communicated range of $800 million to 1 billion. We continue to expect the current level of elevated utilization in our Medicare Advantage book to persist and, out of an abundance of caution, are maintaining a provision for further utilization pressure in 2024. As previously discussed, contributions from Centene will decline as the contract ends on 1 January 2024.\nWe expect a lower contribution in our PCW segment related to COVID, consumer softness, and incremental labor investments, and we expect the 340B headwind from 2023 to annualize in 2024. Shifting to the tailwinds for 2024, we expect underlying growth in our core businesses. We now expect the savings from our previously announced actions and cost initiatives to come in at the higher end of our guidance. We expect a positive contribution from the pricing of our individual exchange business, as well as commercial pricing actions. We believe we have the opportunity to capture value from our newly created Cordavis business, and we expect incremental contributions from our health services businesses net of the impact from previously discussed clinic expansion.\nAt this distance, based on the sum total of these headwinds and tailwinds, including the uncertainty created by our recent utilization trends, we believe it is prudent for investors to ground their expectations for 2024 Adjusted EPS at the low end of our previously communicated preliminary guidance range of $8.50 to $8.70. At our Investor Day in December, we will provide detailed 2024 guidance and updated views on our long-term growth algorithm. To conclude, we remain focused on operational execution and sustainable growth as we advance our goal of becoming the leading health solutions company for consumers. We look forward to providing more detailed updates on our progress against our strategy in December. With that, we'll now open the call to your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question today, please press star followed by one on your telephone keypad now. When preparing to ask your question, please ensure you are unmuted locally. Participants are asked to limit themselves to one question per person so we can process the queue in good time. That's star followed by one on your telephone keypad.\nThe first question today comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. I wanted to see if we can get some more color on Medicare Advantage cost trends, specifically, you know, what did you see through the quarter? What did you assume for, you know, these Flex Cards versus what kind of was expected? Then can you talk about how you think the business is going to perform in 2024, right? It looks like you invested in benefits there. So maybe you could just tell us where you think margins are this year, where you think they're going to be next year, and then hopefully walk us through, you know, how investors should think about improvement in 2025 and beyond as you reprice this business, get your stars back, et cetera? Thanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nGood morning, Justin. Thanks for the question. Bear with me. There's a lot to go through here. So I'm going to walk you through a couple of ways that we'd like you to think about 2024, really make sure that you understand what's happened in 2023, and then I'll turn it over to Brian to talk about some of your other questions.\nSo you'll remember on our Q2 call, we discussed that we were seeing 100 to 110 basis points of Medicare pressure in the first half, and that was driven by higher-than-expected utilization in outpatient and some supplemental benefits such as dental and behavioral health. We carried forward that pressure into the second half, resulting in an increase for the total company of about 50 basis points to the total year MBR guide. We further indicated that we had captured a portion of the outpatient trend pressure in our bids in 2024 and that the remaining pressure we did not incorporate was reflected in the 2024 guide. We also put a placeholder in for additional utilization in our 2024 preliminary guidance range. So as you look then at the Q3, we're experiencing higher utilization than we anticipated.\nThe main driver of this pressure continues to be Medicare Advantage, but a less impactful, notable driver is continued strong growth in the individual exchange product through the SEP. So this SEP membership, particularly when it's added late in the year, carries a higher-than-average MBR. So if you look specifically then at Medicare, we've continued to see elevated utilization in outpatient, including additional pressure in the Q2. We've also seen incremental pressure and supplemental benefits in the Q3, particularly dental, behavioral health, and OTC and flex cards. So OTC and flex cards is a differentiator for our 2023 plan design, but it's also an important part of how we were planning to grow in 2024 and part of our bid strategy. The cards allow members a fixed amount of cash, typically on a quarterly basis, that they can use for OTC as well as food, among other purchases.\nTo date, we've seen meaningfully higher levels of utilization in the use of these cards than we had anticipated in our 2023 pricing and in our initial outlook. If you roll that forward to the full-year guide, we've raised the MBR by 75 to 80 basis points. 10 to 15 basis points is primarily related to the exchange product growth in the SEP and its impact on our MBR. The remaining 65 basis points is related to Medicare Advantage, where we've presumed that the elevated level of trend we observed in the Q3 persists into the Q4. Net of some revenue offsets, that represents about $550 million of pressure in Medicare. It's important to note, though, as you look at our full-year guidance reduction in HCC, there are about $250 million of favorable non-MBR items, which includes things like net investment income, fees, and also expenses.\nA portion of these tailwinds are expected to persist into 2024. As we think about how the MBR pressure in 2023 then impacts 2024, as I mentioned, our 2024 MA bid contemplated higher MA utilization for outpatient and supplemental benefits, although the current experience exceeds the pricing provision. As it specifically relates to OTC and flex cards, we recognized how customers value this benefit, that it would be an important part of how we were going to market in 2024 in the sale of our products, and therefore we proactively assumed higher utilization in those cards, which is much more consistent with how 2023 has actually played out. Consequently, 25 basis points of the incremental 65 basis points of the pressure this quarter was contemplated in pricing on account of the OTC and flex cards, while the remaining 40 basis points was not.\nSo as you think then about that 40 basis points of exposure, there are a couple of things that we think are offsets. First, as we've progressed our stars mitigation and contract diversification efforts, we're now projecting that 2024 stars will be at the low end of our expectations, the impact will be at the low end of our expectations or about $800 million versus the prior midpoint expectation of $900 million. Second, we've repriced our individual exchange members as we begin to move forward towards our target margins in 2024. The incremental individual exchange membership coming through SEP actually provides upside opportunity in 2024 as these members get properly documented for risk adjustment. Third, the net investment income tailwinds that we've seen will almost certainly persist in light of the current macro environment, which was not previously contemplated.\nAnd finally, we expect to achieve the high end of our enterprise cost reduction initiatives, which we previously talked about being $700 to 800 million next year. Altogether, we believe these tailwinds can offset a meaningful portion of the incremental 2024 Medicare headwind, but we're encouraging investors to focus on the lower half of our '24 guidance range until we understand where trends are going to stabilize. It's worth noting, out of an abundance of caution, we've preserved the excess 2024 Medicare utilization provision that we talked about in the Q2 inside our updated guidance range for 2024. Brian?\n\nBrian Kane\n\nPresident, Aetna\n\nThanks, Tom. Let me talk a little bit about the utilization, just to build on what Tom was saying, and then we can talk about the benefit design and, Justin, your question on margins.\nYou know, with respect to utilization, just to echo what Tom said, you know, obviously you've been through the bids in detail, really to understand all the detailed utilization assumptions. And I would just say, after all, you know, everything is fully baked in, including the utilization breakage that Tom discussed. The guide, I believe, fully reflects what's in our pricing as well as the utilization break. So, you know, I feel good about where we are for the 2024 guide that Tom laid out. Just with respect to some other categories, I think it's important to say that in none of the other service categories besides the outpatient and some of the supplemental benefits that Tom went through are showing any pressure. Inpatient is well controlled, for example, as well as other service categories.\nOn the individual side, I think it's important to mention what Tom did, which is to say we did get more members in the SEP period than we anticipated, which actually I think is a good thing for 2024. And so while it's creating some pressure in 2023 because they come in late in the year and you don't have the opportunity to document their conditions between the pricing increases that we put through as well as our risk adjustment processes that will really ramp up for 2024, it's actually a nice tailwind for 2024. Our commercial business also was doing well, our group commercial business and our Medicaid business, so there's no other pressures there. This is really a Medicare story, and as I said, I think we're fully covered with our 2024 guide.\nJustin, with respect to your benefits question, you know, it was important for us coming into 2024 to maintain benefit stability for our members in light of obviously the Star Ratings pressure that we faced. This is an important strategic priority for Medicare. It not only impacts our business on the Aetna side, but also has wide-ranging impacts across the enterprise. So this was a business that we were committed to maintaining benefits stability and being thoughtful in some of the investments that we made. So, for example, on the D-SNP side, that's clearly an area where we leaned in. Our focus was on the Flex Cards, and as Tom said, these are cards that our members can use for food, OTC, utilities, et cetera. We believe this was an attractive benefit, but importantly, the assumptions we used for 2024 effectively assumed full utilization.\nThere's just not a lot of incremental breakage that can occur in 2024 relative to the D-SNP population. I'd also remind you that our D-SNP population is largely HMO, and so they weren't impacted by the Star challenges that we've had for 2024. So as you think about marginal contribution and where our benefit design is, and our anticipation to grow that book, actually, you know, we expect marginal profit contribution on new members for D-SNP. And so actually view that as a positive. And on the general enrollment side, we were very targeted in our investments, and the investments we made tended to be in new plans as opposed to existing plans, which actually was a thoughtful way of really driving opportunities for growth without burning the entire book with incremental costs. So again, I feel good about 2024, where we're positioned.\nAnd I would say, as Karen said in her opening remarks, feel very good about our ability to achieve at or above market growth on the Medicare side. And then finally, on your margin question, clearly we're way below where we need to be on 2024 margins. We understand that. Our expectation for 2025 is that we'll take significant ground against our margin targets. Obviously, we need to see where the rate notice comes out, what the competitive dynamic is, but you should expect 2025 for us to see incremental margin improvement and hopefully material improvement in that regard.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Lisa, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. And good morning. I want to focus on the healthcare services side of the business and really had a few questions here. One, when I think about Cordavis and I think about, you know, the opportunity around biosimilars, is there a way for you to maybe frame how big that opportunity is? Secondly, when we think about things like GLP-1s, I would think of that as being a positive for this business. Can you help us to understand that? And then thirdly, you know, there is, you know, some expectation that there'll be some level of PBM, maybe a bill this year when we think about the reconciliation. Can you talk about what you're seeing right now, and is that built into any of your expectations around your business for 2024?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHi, Lisa. Let me take a couple, and then I'm going to ask Prem to talk about Cordavis, and I'll ask the team to talk about GLP-1s.\nJust generally on the PBM bill, you know, obviously there's a lot of, you know, unrest going on in the legislative body of the US. We don't, you know, we may see something at the end of the year and the end of that reconciliation bill. Our best thinking now is that is transparency, which we are fully aware of and have contemplated in, you know, in our business. But it remains to be seen what really will happen in that year-end reconciliation package. I think, you know, there's a lot going on in Washington, so it's unclear what will happen. You know, relative to Cordavis, we view that as a significant opportunity, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nYou know, this is an opportunity for us to bring a healthy biosimilar market to the US so that we can, you know, really bring lower drug costs to our customers. Prem has been doing a lot on this opportunity, and I'll ask him to talk about kind of the magnitude of it, but we are excited, and we are, you know, in a position to really have an impact. It is a $100 billion opportunity by 2029, so we have the opportunity over the next few years to really make significant improvement in the lowering drug costs and obviously in the performance of our company. And then relative to GLP-1s, what I would say is that, you know, this is an area that has demonstrated and proven that we can see significant weight loss and improvement in health, but it comes at a very hefty price tag.\nAnd it is the reason why a PBM exists. To really have the opportunity to reduce overall costs for GLP-1s, that's what we are very focused on doing by creating a competitive environment. It is; it could cost the US a trillion dollars if every American that is considered obese, and that's about 70 million Americans, were prescribed these GLP-1s. That would put significant pressure on the US healthcare system. So it is imperative for us as a PBM to really reduce the overall cost of those drugs, and we're working very closely with our customers to do that. As you can imagine, our customer's top priority is really understanding the cost of GLP-1s, and David will talk about that. But let me turn it over to Prem to talk about Cordavis.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health\n\nYeah. And just to add to what Karen said, Cordavis is an extremely exciting opportunity for us. Lisa, you've been around the PBM industry for a long time. If you think about the competition that was created in the early part of the 2010s as it relates to the generic pipeline, we view the biosimilar pipeline as the competition for the specialty drugs. If you think about the amount of pharmacy spend that's in specialty drugs, it's greater than 50% at this point. So it's really important for us to be able to create that competition in biosimilars.\nAnd, you know, as I think about what Cordavis is really intended to do, it's going to work with manufacturers to bring these products into the US pharmaceutical marketplace. One of the big, big pieces that we need to ensure is what I'd say is continuity of supply of these products in the marketplace, and that's one of the things that Cordavis will work for.\nSo our first product that we'll launch, as we mentioned earlier in the year, is going to be a contract with Sandoz to co-manufacture and commercialize Hyrimoz, and it's a biosimilar product for Humira. We'll be launching that in Q1 2024. Recall, we mentioned that we were going to launch it at a list price that's greater than 80% lower than the current list price for Humira. So, you know, again, it creates lower costs for consumers, better access, and affordability across the board. As we look out into 2024 with Cordavis, we intend to have a full portfolio of products as we see other biosimilar competition coming in the specialty marketplace to facilitate the broader access of these products in the US. I'll hand it over to Tom to talk about some of the questions around the financials on that.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, Lisa. You asked about kind of the GLP-1 impact, but I think it's important to just talk about what the enterprise impact is there. Then David can talk some more about some of the specifics on how the PBM helps here and some of the challenges that our self-insured customers are facing. You know, in pharmacy services, the GLP-1s are a class of drugs that are uniquely suited to the value of the services that a PBM provides. So we do have a positive margin contribution from the GLP-1s in that segment.\nOn the Aetna side, it's really about whether or not we captured utilization in our pricing, but most of that pricing is really capturing indications for diabetes, not for weight loss. For weight loss, that's really something that our self-insured customers make an individualized decision on, or it's a buy-up for our insured book. We believe that for 2023, we've appropriately priced that, and, you know, we're taking our latest thinking into our pricing for 2024. On the flip side, you know, branded products pressure margins in the PCW business, so the GLP-1s are generally a headwind to that business. Maybe David, you could provide a little more context on kind of the PBM impacts.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nEVP and President of Pharmacy Services, CVS Health\n\nSure. Thanks, Tom. As Karen mentioned, the GLP-1s are certainly at the top of every client's list in terms of areas that they're concerned about going into 2024 and beyond. Good news is the PBM actually plays a critically important role in managing this category of drugs. We really have three different ways in which we're trying to drive savings for our customers. The first is formulary, so we create competition.\nAnd obviously, as new entrants come into the market, it serves as an opportunity for us to continue to reduce the costs for our customers. Secondly is utilization management, so focusing on the appropriate use of the medications, including off-label utilization. And then lastly, there's a significant investment being made in our advanced care management solutions, which is looking at the holistic view of the conditions of which we're treating. And it's essentially complementing the drug therapy and giving us an opportunity to focus on the underlying causes of the conditions. So as we look at the results, at least year to date, you look at the combination of our formulary management in addition to the utilization management, we're saving nearly 70% of costs for our commercial clients.\nSo again, it's a great proof point that we've been able to take cost out of the system as we're looking, obviously, at this growing cost of medications. The area that I would say we're focused on in 2024 is there's still a sizable percentage of our customers that have included obesity or weight loss, and it's an area that's probably growing 6x what the non or the diabetic utilization is. And so there's a big focus right now on both the ROI as well as making sure as new competitors come into the market that we're using these opportunities to focus on reducing the unit pricing of the product and then more specifically focusing on the overall ROI for the services that it's delivering.\nSo maybe if I could just pivot one minute on the Cordavis because I just, and it was a three-part question, Lisa, and I know we're trying to answer it in a variety of different ways, but I think the Cordavis is a really important unique opportunity for us in the market. So as Prem said, Cordavis has brought to market a low-list price product. As the PBM, we have a formulary that looks at both clinical efficacy as well as driving low net costs for our customers. The good news is that when we have influence, we actually are moving to a product with a low-list price, as Prem mentioned, 80% below the current list price of the brand Humira. So it does require changing the market.\nSo if you look at how we're looking at the opportunity going into 2024, it's can we move enough share in order to create value for our customers? And in our models, we believe we can take 50% of the 2022 cost out for this category by moving aggressively to a low-list price product. So then we have to then look at what gives us confidence that we can actually move the share. So we've mentioned, obviously, in previous calls that we've had success with moving Lantus to Basaglar. We had 97% conversion for that product back in the, you know, many years ago. And if you look at one example, which is a client in Medicaid that has chosen to exclude the coverage of branded Humira, we've been able to move upwards of 90% of the product by within the last 30 days.\nSo I think it's become a proof point that, one, we can actually move the low-cost biosimilars. We can actually reduce the cost of the category for our customers and ultimately make sure we're preserving the experience for the members. So I think, again, we're pretty bullish on our opportunity of changing the marketplace and capitalizing on bringing new innovative therapies to market.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Thanks so much for the questions. It sounds like Oak Street is kind of, you know, scaling in line to maybe a bit better than your expectations. I guess, could you maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the incremental platform contribution next year and what you see as the kind of biggest opportunities for practices in terms of how they need to adapt, just given the tougher rate environment that we're going to be in for Medicare next year? And from a capital deployment standpoint, you know, can you talk about your appetite for additional M&A from a care delivery standpoint? Is that something that they're looking at currently, or do you need to kind of allow the existing kind of assets to mature more before you look to build further?\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nEVP and President of Health Care Delivery, CVS Health\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start on the operational priorities and then turn it over to Tom on the financials. The biggest thing for us is keep focusing on what we do best, which is keep our patients healthy and out of the hospital.\nWe know if we apply our care model, we'll do that. We have the proof points, whether it's the Medicare Shared Savings Program a couple of years ago, where we were a top 1% performer, whether it's the ACO REACH program, which has risk score caps, or whether it's an M&A, that, you know, we can create a lot of value by keeping our patients healthy and then capturing that savings. So that's the biggest focus at Oak Street, is running our care model, running a well ring every day, running it every center, and, you know, keeping that culture intact. If we do that, we'll be in great shape.\nI actually think that if you think about the medium or longer term, I think the changes in how they're doing risk adjustment will be a tailwind for us because it's going to make sure that you're doing the right things to care for patients, and that's what's driving your business. And if it's, you know, harder for others, I think that'll just further differentiate the Oak Street platform. So that's our focus.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nThanks, Nathan. As you think about the financial impact, and I think you're specifically referring to V28 on the risk model, which is something that we spent a tremendous amount of time thinking through in diligence, you know, we think that there's a lot of opportunity here over the long term as we think about the ability of Oak Street, their people, their process, their technology to really adapt to a changing regulatory environment.\nAnd so we have a lot of confidence in their model. We have a lot of confidence in their ability to execute this. The issue as you think about this is really going to be, you know, what's the timing impact of this? You know, they've eliminated a lot of more generic codes, and they've added a lot of, you know, HCC indexes to more complicated codes where they think there's a higher correlation with costs. And so we've got to both set the systems up to ensure that we're capturing the appropriate data to help not just think about what the gross impact is, but what the net impact is. And then we need to have the encounters happen to actually, you know, capture that data. And there's lots of other mitigants.\nI think as we looked at Oak Street, we're pretty comfortable that they're in better shape than a lot of other participants in the industry. But because of kind of the timing of the implementation of these changes, you know, it is only a third phase in next year, but we think it'll probably have about a 2% revenue impact. But we actually think that that gap will shrink over time, even as V28 is more fully implemented. And so, and all of that is captured within our preliminary guidance range. Overall, we actually feel really good about Oak Street's model, its ability to deliver exceptional care. You know, I think the ACO REACH results is just another great example of how their model is differentiated versus what else is out in the marketplace.\nWe feel really great about the long-term prospects, which is why we've actually doubled down and we're going to grow 50 to 60 centers next year and probably accelerate after that as we look to expand that footprint more aggressively. You asked also about capital and M&A. I think, you know, we've done a lot of acquisitions this year, and our focus in the near term is really on execution, execution and growing those businesses, which are well on track for 2023, and execution and continuing to drive synergies and growth.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I'll go on to the retail segment a little bit. The pharmacy growth still remains elevated. Love to hear the competitive dynamics driving that, if there's anything in particular. And then also exactly how much the increased vaccine is contributing to the change in retail this year and what you expect for next year. You called out a couple of the headwinds and tailwinds broadly, but specifically just for the retail segment, how should we think about any micro headwinds and tailwinds within that segment for 2024? Thanks.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health",
    "content2": "Sure. Why don't I start, and then Prem can give you a little bit more color on kind of the competitive environment. You asked specifically about some of the tailwinds in that segment. I think there's two things that I'd call out. The first is just strengthen our immunization franchise.\nAnd the second is, I think that as you think, as you look at where the consensus was for that business, I don't think that we're getting enough credit there for some of the actions that we took to restructure Coram last year and some of the benefit that that would provide, some of the store closures, which continue to ramp, and some of the benefits that you're starting to see from that, particularly as we've exceeded all of our goals on employee retention, but importantly, on script retention and also front store retention. So we've done really well, and, you know, kudos to that team on the execution there. But as you think maybe about the immunization franchise, you know, we did just under eight million vaccines in the quarter. Flu represented probably about half of that total, with COVID probably about a quarter.\nThe remainder is a variety of different vaccines, but also included the new RSV vaccine, which we saw strong growth in. Performance across that book was quite good. And a lot of that actually has to do with some of the efforts of our trade team, which helped to really drive some of the strength in the quarter. We project that vaccines are probably going to peak early in Q4 before declining in 2024. And that's primarily due to COVID softening versus, you know, part of the early part of 2023 when the public health emergency was still in effect. You know, as COVID moves into the endemic phase, our plan is that we're going to talk about the vaccine franchise more holistically. And, but we do think that there's going to be pressure there because COVID is going to wane.\nAnd I think as you think about next year, we've anticipated that the current level of performance is not going to persist, partially because of COVID, partially because of the typical dynamics of just rate and reimbursement pressure, but also, you know, a little bit of a provision for consumer softness. Prem, maybe you could talk a little bit more about kind of the script growth and underlying dynamics in the market.\n\nPrem Shah\n\nEVP and Group President, CVS Health\n\nYeah, sure. Sure. Thanks. So our retail pharmacy business continues to execute and deliver strong results across scripts, service, and our transformational initiatives. If you think about our same store scripts, we grew 2.7%. And if you exclude COVID, we grew 3.5%. So continued strong momentum on script growth. On the service front, we continue to measure NPS. Our NPS, you know, year to date is about 40 basis points higher than prior year.\nContinue to have strong service. We know that service is a primary reason to retain and grow scripts. Then lastly, I think the transformational initiatives that we're focused on, first and foremost, how do we lower our cost of goods? And then also continue to think about our engagement with consumers through our innovative omnichannel strategies. We continue to think about ways in which we can make the consumer experience easier. One of the things that we did during COVID was we did group scheduling as well as, you know, multi-vaccine scheduling this year that had very good results for our consumers in the marketplace. Lastly, we continue to look at our operating model. We have to continue to invest in our colleagues and working to really scale, scale innovative technology solutions that can make the pharmacy easier for our colleagues in our stores.\nWe continue to do that with some of the things that we're doing around sharing work across stores, as well as some of the other model changes that we're doing in 2024. Lastly, it's incredibly important for us to continue to deliver payer value in terms of our clinical and value-based programs for consumers focused on things like our Star Ratings. So we work very closely with our M&A partners, including Aetna, on that to drive adherence, patient outcomes, and be the number one national chain really across those measures. Really what's really important is also leveraging our engagement in these stores to connect into our other businesses, whether that's into our payer businesses, Oak Street, or Signify to really streamline and make those consumer experiences better.\nAs it relates to front store, we continue to grow share and help consumers, you know, what I would say is navigate the challenging market conditions through convenience, value, and health and wellness products. We've continued to see that business perform really well. If you exclude COVID OTC test kits, our front store same store sales are about flat. We continue to grow drug share about 41 basis points, even despite the softening traffic that we're seeing.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I just want to take this opportunity. Kevin, you talked about the competitive dynamics. You know, there's a lot of discussion around the labor market. What I would say is that as a company, we are committed to providing the best place to work for all of our colleagues, including our pharmacists and our pharmacy techs.\nOver the last year or so, we've made a number of investments for our labor. You know, by the end of the year, we'll have wage investments of over $1 billion. We continue to invest in our technology to support our teams in the field so that they can have streamlined workflows and, you know, smoother operations. We are committed and continue to hire. You know, it's a tight labor market, but we've been having very good success in hiring. Our attrition numbers are stable. And, you know, we are, you know, actively, you know, developing new training programs as well for the ongoing development of our colleagues. But, you know, as I said, at the top of the, you know, top here, you know, we are committed to making sure that this is a powerful and employer that we are an employer of choice.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Eric Percher from Nephron Research. Eric, your line is open. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Percher\n\nPartner of Pharma Supply Chain and Digital Health, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. I want to come back to the headwinds and tailwinds for health services in 2024. For 2023, after we've seen pretty significant outperformance after that 340B headwind early in the year. And you've attributed this to sourcing, specialty, and drug mix. And I'm reading the latter as rebate outperformance on GLP-1 and biosimilar. Question one is, were sourcing benefits outsized in 2023 versus 2022 or the outlook for 2024? And then question two is, do you expect that drug mix or rebates will be on par or better in 2024 versus 2023 given what we saw on biosimilar introduction this year? And is Cordavis really a tailwind in 2024 itself, or is it as share shifts over time?\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nA couple of things in there, Eric. So let me start, and David can add any color commentary. You know, sourcing benefits, you know, our trade teams are exceptional. They continue to execute every year. You know, some of the strength that we saw in the vaccine franchise is, you know, part of their efforts and some of applying some of their strategies to what we do more broadly. So I wouldn't say that there's anything exceptional except for the fact that that team is exceptional every day.\nYour point on drug mix and rebates, I think is spot on. You know, GLP-1s are a category that particularly with enhanced competition is going to present an excellent opportunity for us to continue to drive lowest net cost. But the way that that's developed this year has, you know, made some of our guarantees less onerous to hit. As we think about Cordavis in 2024, we absolutely believe that there will be a benefit, you know, as we drive volume through that organization.\n\nOperator\n\nFinal question we have time for today is from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore ISI. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Your line is open.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nHi guys. Thanks so much for the question. I also wanted to return to some of the headwinds and tailwinds you talked about. I think previously for the HSS segment, I think you talked about sort of the poor AOI growth being like mid-single digits for 2024 and the assumptions that you put through. So I was wondering if you still, like given all those headwinds and tailwinds that you're saying, that that would be sort of how you would still position that business. Then secondarily, I hear what you're saying about some of the labor investments. How do we think about that on more of a quantitative level in terms of 2024, like, you know, versus obviously some of the cost savings that you mentioned on the more corporate level? Thank you.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nInterim CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks, Elizabeth. So I think that as you think about core growth, I think that's probably the best way to start to think about this. So, you know, we do think that, you know, you should see mid-single digit core growth out of the business. But then you've got some very specific items that kind of are pluses and minuses against that. So the first would be the loss of the Centene contract. And, you know, that we've sized that for folks in the past or implicitly. But I think as you think about how well that business has performed this year, you know, that number has become a little bit larger.\nWe also, as we talked about, we have the annualization of 340B. And so both of those will help the pressure that, you know, and offset some of that core growth. Offsetting that, you are going to see incremental value from Cordavis. And you'll also see some of our overall cost savings that will be in the pharmacy services segment that will help to offset that. But I think you're probably looking at a low single digit growth as you think about the AOI there. And we'll provide a lot more details on that as we get to Investor Day. As we think about the labor investments, I think there are other places that we can look to try to offset those. It's clear based on the environment that this is the right thing to do, and we're committed to doing that.\nI would also note that over the last few years through next year, we'll have made over $1 billion investment in wages. And so, you know, we're committed to continuing that strength and making sure that we're a destination for employees.\n\nElizabeth Anderson\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nGot it. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's Q&A session. So I'll hand the call back to Karen Lynch for any concluding remarks.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nNo, thank you for joining the call. We'll see you in December in Boston. Thanks."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. CVS Health closed another successful quarter, delivering on our financial commitment through the power of our diversified business model and focused execution of our strategy. We have been relentless in the pursuit of our goal to deliver superior health experiences by improving outcomes, lowering costs, driving higher levels of engagement, and broadening access to high-quality care. So far in 2023, we have achieved several key accomplishments. First, we acquired Signify Health and Oak Street Health, two best-in-class value-based care assets. We are making progress integrating these multi-payer companies to create meaningful value. We are unlocking opportunities by connecting Signify and Oak Street to CVS Health assets such as Aetna, MinuteClinic, and CVS Pharmacy, and driving patient engagement and growth. As we scale our healthcare delivery assets and realize synergy opportunities, we will accelerate our long-term growth trajectory.\nSecond, we expanded our individual exchange offerings to 12 states and successfully onboarded more than 1 million new members. Strategically, this is an important marketplace that grew to approximately 15 million enrollees in 2022. Our success with this population lays the foundation for future earnings growth at Aetna and creates connections for these members across all our integrated assets. And finally, our ability to generate strong cash flows enables us to invest in our long-term strategy and return value to shareholders. Through 30 June 2023, we generated more than $13 billion of operating cash flow and returned more than $3.5 billion to our shareholders. We expect to continue to return cash to our shareholders and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value. Today, we reported Q2 adjusted EPS of $2.21 and adjusted operating income of $4.5 billion.\nOur diversified business, strengthened by our exceptional execution, positions us to navigate emerging headwinds in Medicare Advantage and a changing consumer environment. We are reaffirming our full-year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.50 to 8.70. Shawn will provide more details on our updated outlook for the year shortly. Turning to our performance highlights for the quarter, in our healthcare benefits segment, we grew revenues to $26.7 billion, an increase of nearly 18%, and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Medical membership in the Q2 was 25.6 million, an increase of 1.2 million members versus the prior year, reflecting broad-based growth, including individual exchange, Medicare, and commercial membership. For our core commercial membership, this quarter marks the eighth consecutive quarter of membership gains. This growth reflects our differentiated product offerings that address the total cost of care and the whole health of a member through our integrated solutions.\nMedical cost trends were well controlled in our commercial and Medicaid books of business. Consistent with the broader industry, elevated medical costs emerged in our Medicare Advantage business, which became apparent in the latter part of the quarter. The primary driver of these elevated medical costs was greater than expected utilization in outpatient settings. Shawn will discuss these trends in more detail. In Medicaid, the state of Oklahoma awarded us a new statewide Medicaid contract beginning in April 2024 that will add approximately 200,000 members. This win demonstrates our market-leading ability to comprehensively support Medicaid populations through our deep local relationships, investment in clinical programs, and integrated well-being solutions. This quarter, we were able to offset the pressures in our healthcare benefits segment with continued strong execution in our health services segment. Revenues grew to $46.2 billion, an increase of nearly 8%. Adjusted operating income grew 3.5% to $1.9 billion.\nThese results were driven by our pharmacy services business. We consistently demonstrate value to consumers and our clients by successfully managing drug cost trends and bringing innovative clinical solutions to the market. In Q2, branded drug revenue increased, in part driven by the GLP-1 category. This expensive and fast-growing category presents new choices for the over 70 million adults in the US who are living with obesity and the nearly 37 million people who have type 2 diabetes. We are well positioned to deliver value to customers in this category with our weight loss programs and utilization management tools that drive the lowest net cost for our clients. Every day, we create competition, drive the lowest net cost, and deliver transparency, value, and choice to our customers. This is the foundation of our continued success and our market-leading position.\nTurning to healthcare delivery, both Signify Health and Oak Street Health had strong quarters, delivering business performance consistent with our expectations. These assets bring core capabilities to our multi-payer value-based care platform that drives optimal patient engagement with health services across multiple channels. In the short time since we closed these transactions, we've launched efforts to drive high patient engagement by leveraging our CVS Health assets. Signify Health is core to our home health services strategy. Signify enables better health in the home and has an unmatched ability to build trust and connect with three million patients in their home annually. We capture valuable insights into a patient's broader care needs during in-home evaluations and are able to create engagement points across other health services for our health plan partners.\nThese engagement points ultimately drive better care, lower the total cost of care, such as reducing hospital readmissions and improving health outcomes. Survey results show that members who are highly satisfied with their Signify in-home evaluations are 26 times more likely to recommend their health plan and 74% more likely to consider additional health services. Signify's customers recognize the power of this trusted relationship and the value of these home services. Since the close of the acquisition, Signify has demonstrated exceptional retention of its health plan and health system customers. We've added new relationships, expanding the opportunity to bring Signify services to more Medicare members. CVS Health's trusted brand and our broad customer touch points further increase opportunities for Signify to engage with patients and expand the services they deliver. This quarter, there is a strong demand for both in-home evaluations and additional Signify services in the home.\nWe launched new member engagement initiatives at select CVS pharmacies to drive IHG conversion of Aetna Medicare members and CVS pharmacy customers to Signify. Early results are promising, with higher engagement across the CVS Health channels utilized. Turning to Oak Street Health, we are accelerating patient growth through our broad community presence and ability to engage consumers across multiple channels. Today, there are approximately 1 million Medicare-eligible seniors who visit CVS pharmacies each week that are located near an Oak Street clinic. We launched new member engagement initiatives focused on creating connections between Medicare-eligible CVS customers, both in-store and digitally, and Oak Street Health providers. We are also connecting Aetna Medicare members who are currently without a primary care physician with their local Oak Street provider to reengage them in their care.\nThese initiatives will drive Oak Street patient growth and accelerate the path to mature clinic profitability while broadly serving the needs of Medicare members. As Oak Street expands to additional geographies, these opportunities to drive higher patient growth will continue to increase. By the end of 2023, we expect to have Oak Street clinics in 25 states, up from 21 at the close of the transaction. We will also open new Oak Street clinics co-located with CVS pharmacies this year and have already identified additional locations for 2024. We now expect to build 50 to 60 clinics next year. Turning to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we grew revenues to $28.8 billion, an increase of nearly 8% versus the prior year. We generated $1.4 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, a decrease of 17% from the prior year, largely due to lower COVID-related volumes.\nOur pharmacy business delivered another quarter of strong performance. Same-store pharmacy sales increased by more than 14% versus the prior year, primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. Same-store prescription growth, when excluding the impact of COVID, grew by nearly 5%. This growth is fueled by our efforts to provide a differentiated omnichannel pharmacy experience that meets customers where they are. In our front store, we've grown market share, increased household penetration, and delivered historically high service levels. This positions us well to manage through economic volatility. In the quarter, our same-store sales, excluding OTC test kits, grew by more than 1%, demonstrating the resiliency of our front-store offering in a more challenging consumer environment. We also continue to make progress growing our digital numbers and sales. This quarter, we exceeded 53 million unique digital customers, up over 2 million from last quarter.\nOur digital sales increased 24% versus the prior year, including a meaningful increase of 65% in our over-the-counter health solution offerings. This offering is highly valued by our health plans members, allowing them to conveniently access their important OTC benefits. Last quarter, we discussed optimizing our cost structure. This morning, we announced the restructuring charge of nearly $500 million associated with the elimination of approximately 5,000 non-customer-facing positions, as well as the impairment of non-core assets. These efforts are expected to generate over $600 million of run rate savings beginning in 2024. Our optimization efforts have also focused on identifying additional opportunities to drive efficiency and operational excellence using technology. For example, we've been selectively using artificial intelligence for some time and are increasingly finding opportunities to improve the efficiency of our operations, enhance our customer experience, and increase our competitiveness.\nWhen combining all of our productivity initiatives, we are confident we will achieve the $700 to 800 million of cost savings that we are targeting in 2024. These actions enable us to reallocate resources and invest in critical growth areas such as health services and technology, which are the biggest enablers of our strategy. We've taken meaningful steps executing on our long-term strategy with tangible proof of the value of our unique integrated offering. We look forward to providing more details at our investor day on 5 December 2024 in Boston. I'll now turn the call over to Shawn to provide a deeper look into our results and our guidance. Shawn.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our Q2 results continue to demonstrate the strength of our execution and the power of our diversified enterprise. We delivered strong revenue growth, adjusted earnings per share, and cash flow from operations.\nA few highlights regarding total company performance. Q2 revenues of nearly $90 billion increased by more than 10% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of nearly $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.21, representing decreases of approximately 10% and 13% versus prior year, respectively. These decreases were primarily due to declines in our Health Care Benefits, in pharmacy and consumer wellness segments, partially offset by strong execution in our pharmacy services operations. Our ability to generate cash remains outstanding, with year-to-date cash flow from operations of $13.3 billion. These cash flows were impacted by the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in Q4. Excluding this impact, our cash flows from operations remain strong at $8 billion. Shifting to the details for our Health Care Benefits segment, we delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year.\nQ2 revenue of $26.7 billion increased by 17.6% year-over-year, reflecting growth across all product lines. Membership grew to 25.6 million, an increase of 121,000 members sequentially, reflecting increases in our individual, exchanged, and commercial businesses, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion in the quarter declined approximately 20% versus the prior year. This decline was driven by a higher-than-expected medical benefit ratio, partially offset by higher net investment income and strong execution on operating cost management. Our medical benefit ratio of 86.2% increased 350 basis points year-over-year, reflecting higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage utilization in Q2. These trends were primarily driven by higher utilization in the outpatient setting, as well as dental, and behavioral health. We also recognized higher utilization levels in Q1 and prior year, resulting in lower year-over-year prior period development in the quarter.\nIt is important to note that utilization in our other lines of business, including individual exchange, commercial, and Medicaid, remains generally in line with our pricing expectations. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 46.9, down 1.2 days sequentially. This decline was almost entirely driven by the impact of increased Medicaid pass-through payments in the quarter. Excluding this impact, DCP was stable, and overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. Our health services segment, which includes our pharmacy services business and our healthcare delivery operations, generated revenue of approximately $46.2 billion, an increase of 7.6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy drug mix, growth in specialty pharmacy, brand inflation, and the addition of Signify and Oak Street. These increases were partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.\nAdjusted operating income of nearly $1.9 billion grew 3.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong execution and improved purchasing economics, partially offset by ongoing client price improvements and lower MinuteClinic COVID-19 testing. Total pharmacy claims process in the quarter declined by approximately 1% versus the prior year, and down 50 basis points when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. This decline was primarily attributable to the New York Medicaid carve-out, largely offset by net new business. Total pharmacy membership was approximately 110 million members. Within our health services segment, we are very encouraged by the performance and growth of our healthcare delivery assets. Signify completed 673,000 in-home evaluations in the quarter, an increase of 16% versus the same period last year, and generated revenue growth of 19%.\nOak Street ended the quarter with 177 centers and 181,000 at-risk lives, increases over the same period last year of approximately 23% and 35%, respectively. Oak Street also significantly increased revenue in the quarter, growing 43% compared to the same quarter last year. Moving to our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we generated revenue of $28.8 billion, up nearly 8% versus the prior year and nearly 11% on the same-store basis, reflecting the impact of pharmacy drug mix, increased prescriptions, and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by the impact of recent generic introductions, decreased COVID-19-related volume, and continued reimbursement pressure. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion declined approximately 17% versus the prior year, driven by reimbursement pressure, lower COVID-19 vaccines and testing, and lower front-store volumes. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing.\nSame-store pharmacy sales were up more than 14%, driven by drug mix, a 3.6% increase in same-store prescription volumes, and brand inflation. The increase in same-store prescription volumes, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, was 4.9%. As Karen mentioned, our front-store business is not immune to trends in the broader economy, but we have shown resiliency in the face of these challenges and continue to demonstrate the value we offer consumers. Same-store sales for the front-store were down 30 basis points, primarily due to declines in cough, cold, and flu, and OTC test kits. Excluding the impact of OTC test kits, same-store front-store sales were up by more than 1%. Turning to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Our ability to generate cash flow has always been a strength of our organization, and the enterprise continues to identify new opportunities to optimize our balance sheet.\nThrough the Q2, we generated cash flow from operations of $13.3 billion, bolstered by the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier, and ended the quarter with approximately $3.3 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. During the quarter, we issued approximately $5 billion of long-term debt and repaid our outstanding $5 billion term loan that was used to fund a portion of the Oak Street transaction. Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $795 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. We recognized acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the Signify and Oak Street transactions, as well as additional office real estate optimization charges in the quarter for a total of $168 million.\nAs Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks, we also took a restructuring charge of nearly $500 million associated with our cost optimization efforts in the impairment of non-core assets. Turning now to our outlook for 2023, we are reaffirming our adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.50 to 8.70. This guidance reflects our performance through the Q2, as well as a higher-than-expected Medicare Advantage medical cost trend for the remainder of 2023, offset by strength in our pharmacy services business within our Health Services segment. In the Healthcare Benefits segment, we now expect our 2023 Medical Benefit Ratio to fall at the high end of our previous range of 84.7% ± 50 basis points, reflecting the impact of higher Medicare Advantage utilization.\nWhile there is uncertainty surrounding the duration of this utilization spike, our 2023 guidance now prudently assumes that these medical cost trends will remain elevated for the rest of 2023. This update also results in a change to our guidance for adjusted operating income, which we now expect to fall in a range of $5.99 to 6.12 billion. While we are encouraged by trends in our individual exchange business, this guidance continues to reflect a prudent and cautious stance for that business. In our health services segment, our updated Adjusted Operating Income guidance is a range of $7.11 to 7.23 billion, reflecting the strong execution year-to-date in our pharmacy services business, and our expectation of continued strength for the remainder of the year. Developments in our 340B business continue to align with the guidance we provided on our Q1 call.\nIn our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, we now expect adjusted operating income in a range of $5.63 to 5.73 billion. This updated guidance reflects strong fundamental execution year-to-date while recognizing the potential for a weakening consumer environment. Shifting to our cash flow, we continue to anticipate strong full-year 2023 cash flow from operations in a range of $12.5 to 13.5 billion. As a result of prioritization of our portfolio to optimize our cost structure, we now expect capital expenditures in a range of $2.6 to 2.8 billion. We continue to maintain our projections for interest expense and share count. And finally, we now project our adjusted effective tax rate at 25.3%. You can find additional details on the components of our updated 2023 guidance on our investor relations webpage. Before concluding my prepared remarks, I would like to address our medium-term growth projections and targets.\nAs Karen touched on in her remarks, CVS Health benefits from the diversity of our operations, and this positions us well to be resilient in the face of adversity. We take our commitment seriously, as evidenced by the announcement this morning of our cost-cutting initiative, which will meaningfully improve our positioning for 2024. However, given the emergence of multiple potential headwinds across our diverse set of assets, including uncertainty in Medicare Advantage, the potential for a weakening consumer environment, and reduced retail contributions from COVID, combined with our plan to accelerate Oak Street clinic growth, our 2024 adjusted EPS target of $9 is no longer a reasonable starting point for our guidance range.\nGiven the more challenging outlook for 2024 and our desire to set guidance that is achievable with opportunities to outperform, we now believe investors should anchor their initial expectations for our 2024 adjusted EPS to $8.50 to 8.70, essentially flat to our existing 2023 guidance range. As is our convention, this guidance does not assume any prior year reserve development. Given the level of uncertainty for 2024, we also believe investors should no longer rely on our 2025 adjusted EPS target of $10. We will provide more clarity on our longer-term earnings growth outlook at our investor day in December. While emerging headwinds have created uncertainty for our 2024 and 2025 outlook, make no mistake, we are more convinced than ever in our long-term strategy.\nThe power of our integrated model and care delivery assets will change how consumers and patients engage with the health system and how they receive care. We believe this will benefit customers, patients, payers, and ultimately, our shareholders. To conclude, our Q2 results continue to demonstrate the power of our diversified enterprise and the resiliency of our businesses. We continue to maintain our focus on growth and operational execution as we work to become the leading health solutions company for consumers. With that, we will now open the call to your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press the star, then one on your telephone keypad. That's star followed by one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause now just for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse. A.J., your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nThanks. Hi, everybody. I know Karen teed it up, and you mentioned it a couple of times, Shawn, taking into account a changing consumer backdrop and then the MA uncertainty. Just on that, it sounds like on the consumer changing, you're signaling about the cough, cold, and flu being somewhat soft, but I wouldn't necessarily think that's related to the economy. Are you specifically seeing something that's impacting your business from a consumer at this point in the retail side, or are you just anticipating that? And then on the MA, obviously, you gave guidance on the benefits in the back half of your MLR, but what is your thinking about how some of the things you're seeing might impact Oak Street? And can you comment on your 2024 bids and whether they incorporate some caution around utilization?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nA.J., a couple of things on consumer, and then I'll ask Michelle to talk a little bit. But as we saw June kind of emerge and kind of predicting sort of this economic volatility and a potential recession, we saw a little bit of pullback in consumer behavior in June. So we are reflecting that in kind of our forward-looking approach. So I can have Michelle talk a little bit about what we saw, and then I'll turn it back to Shawn to talk about the numbers.\n\nMichelle Peluso\n\nChief Customer Officer and Co-president of Retail, CVS Health\n\nYeah. And just to build on Karen's point, we had another solid quarter. It was a market share gain quarter. Again, for the front-store, we saw stronger household penetration and historically high net promoter scores.\nBut I think out of an abundance of caution, we're just looking at slightly softening consumer demand in the back part of the quarter, along with comping historically high cough, cold, and flu. I will say, though, of course, the strength is coming from the investments we're making in omni-channel, our merch mix, service, and simplifying pricing and promotion. We're right-sizing our cost structure with our store footprint, our distribution footprint, improving inventory turns. And we're really excited and convinced about the work we're doing with Oak Street Health and Signify to introduce more seniors and more Medicare-eligible customers to the great offerings that Signify and Oak Street Health have in the community.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nSo there's a lot there, A.J., in your question, so let me try to kind of cover the ground as thoroughly as I can.\nI will have both Dan and Mike actually talk about, respectively, what we saw in Aetna and HCB. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our MBR was up 350 basis points year-over-year. It's really important to look at and recall that last quarter, we said we expected Q2 MBR to be up year-over-year. One of the main drivers in that is we printed 82.7% last year in theQ2. So there's a lot to do here with the starting point. Having said that, and allowing for that, Q2 did end up coming in higher than we expected. The real driver here is Medicare Advantage. It's also important to keep in mind that Medicare is more than 50% of our premium revenue now.\nAs I stated, I want to be clear that commercial, Medicaid, and exchange all performed consistent or even slightly better than our expectations in the quarter. But as we closed the month of May and mid-June, it became apparent that the Medicare costs were higher than we had anticipated in Q1, and that pressure was continuing into theQ2. And the real driver remains the outpatient categories that we and others have been discussing. So let me have Dan talk a little bit about what we saw in Aetna, and I'll have Mike follow that up with what we saw in Oak Street. And then I'll come back and talk a little bit about how we've prepared our guidance for 2023 and 2024 in light of this.\n\nDan Finke\n\nPresident of Health Care Benefits, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Thanks, Shawn.\nSo I think it's important to note that our commercial and Medicaid lines of business were largely in line with expectations. And as reported more broadly in the industry, we did experience higher-than-anticipated outpatient utilization in Medicare. This is likely due to some of these services that have been postponed by our seniors not feeling comfortable accessing the healthcare system during the pandemic. You can think about this as outpatient orthopedic procedures, hips and knees, some cardiac procedures, a little bit of an increase in dental, and we're still seeing some continued levels of elevated mental health use. Again, specific to Medicare and outpatient services, our inpatient volumes remain lower than our normalized levels, and that's the same across all lines of business. So it's something we're closely watching.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nCEO, Oak Street Health\n\nFrom an Oak Street perspective, we've seen similar trends on medical costs with outpatients and being up across our payer partners.\nSpecifically, though, we've had a really strong start to the year on care model execution at Oak Street. And so we've been able to largely offset the increased outpatient costs through a roughly 4% reduction year-over-year and admissions per thousand. So, we're able to offset the increase in outpatient with continued strong performance and keeping our patients out of the hospital and decreasing inpatient.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nGreat. Thanks. So, turning back to 2023 first, as I mentioned, Medicare did come in probably about 220 basis points worse than expected for the quarter. Given the way costs have emerged, it's more instructive to look, I think, at the first half of the year, which is off 100, 110 basis points versus our guidance expectation.\nAs Dan mentioned, there are aspects of this that make that some of this could be from a pent-up demand bubble involving discretionary and deferable services, which, if true, would potentially run its course and lessen over time. Some preliminary July data does show some of that improvement. However, at this stage, in the absence of any compelling evidence to the contrary, we think it's appropriate to be cautious in our outlook and have assumed that the 100 basis points of pressure observed in the first half of 2023 persists through the second half of the year. The result of this is what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that the HCB MBR would be up about 50 basis points at the high end of our guidance range.\nIn terms of 2024, 2024 will come down to two things: where does the 2023 year settle out, which serves as the baseline to go into 2024. And then what level of trend do we experience off that baseline. Our 2024 MA bid did contemplate a degree of higher utilization. But if trends persist at the levels we've experienced in the first half, as contemplated in our current guidance, we will have already consumed that higher utilization assumption. If a higher level of medical cost trend, then persists again in 2024, or said differently, if we don't see an abatement in medical cost trend, we would then be pressured on our bid assumptions. In the absence of clear indicators that utilization is abating and out of an abundance of caution, our revised 2024 guidance assumes that we have an incremental headwind in 2024 over our revised 2023 guidance baseline.\nTo the extent utilization does abate and costs develop more favorably in 2023 than we project, that could serve as upside to our outlook for both 2023 and 2024.\n\nA.J. Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Lisa, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks very much. And good morning. First, Shawn, I want to say thank you for revising 2024. I think that that's a very realistic expectation, and I like the words of potential upside. So, with that said, let me move to my question. And that's really around GLP-1s. As I think about the different components of the business, I heard you and Dan both talk about the fact that commercial was in line.\nBut just given the strength of what you're seeing on your pharmacy side of your business, is there not any impact on the medical side of your business due to GLP-1s? And then secondly, as we think about both GLP-1s, biosimilars, the strength, and the Rx services component of the business, can you maybe just walk through what some of those components are? Are we starting to see more rebating activity around GLP-1s? I know Karen had made a comment around programs, around obesity and diabetes. If you can talk anything around that as to how we think about that going forward in the pharmacy services business. And then just lastly, on the pharmacy services business, any incremental comments on how to think about the 2024 selling season and how that went?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHi, Lisa. It's Karen, and I'll start and hand it over to David Joyner and the rest of the team here. But as you mentioned, we have seen, consistent with the industry, higher levels of utilization in GLP-1 drugs across each of our businesses. And in HCB, what we saw was that we have seen increased utilization, but we feel like we have priced appropriately for it. And so we feel like the risk is manageable in that business. As you look at the pharmacy services business, that is, we believe this is going to be a competitive category for us over time. And quite frankly, is the reason why, as you know, PBMs exist. We have the opportunity to create competitiveness, provide lowest net costs, and give additional programs like the programs I mentioned in my prepared remarks.\nAnd also, what we're seeing in the PCW business is it is generating very strong revenue there. But as you know, with branded drugs, there is not a lot of margin with those kinds of drugs. So, kind of overall, each of the businesses kind of have GLP-1 in them, and they are impacting them in a variety of different ways. But I would just reemphasize the importance of the PBM and how we will continue to drive lowest net costs. And this is a perfect category to do that in. And let me turn it over to David to talk about what he's seeing on growth, in the pharmacy services business, and the selling season. Yeah.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident of Pharmacy Services, CVS Health\n\nSure. So, Lisa, this is David, and thanks for the question.\nAs we look forward into 2024, we obviously have the headwinds of the partial termination of Centene, and obviously, we're working closely with the orderly transition of both the Medicare and Medicaid lines of business. As a result of Centene, our health plan business will be down year-over-year as we continue to focus on pricing discipline for both prospective customers and renewing our existing customers. As I look at 2024 net new business, the pipeline is definitely weighted more towards the employer business this year. We've had a particularly strong year in the national employer accounts as we've won close to 60% of the clients that have changed PBMs for 2024. We've seen the success with enterprise accounts as well, where we share common customers with Aetna.\nWe continue to believe we offer the best PBM operating model in both cost of goods and service levels in the industry and are confident in our long-range growth outlook as we wrap up the 2024 selling season and turn our focus towards growing in 2025 and beyond. Finally, I would just suggest we continue to focus on leveraging our full suite of CVS Health assets, including the most recent value-based care acquisitions of both Signify Health and Oak Street Health, as we continue to offer a differentiated value prop in the multi-payer marketplace.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nTalk about biosimilars. I think that was another one of our questions.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nPresident of Pharmacy Services, CVS Health\n\nSure. So it was a multifaceted question. So let me just add on the biosimilars because we obviously have not announced our position for the coming year.\nBut that said, we've had a very thoughtful and planned approach to the Humira biosimilar launch, and it's been planned for several years now. So as a result, our customers have already benefited from the competition with a much lower spend in the category. So, as we prepare for the formulary launch, we're committed to the same lowest net cost strategy that we employ across our formulary and will be using the additional competition to create even more value for our customers and members. So, I'd like to offer two additional points. The first is we have a unique track record in the biosimilar-like market. So, as you recall, several years ago, we removed Lantus from our formulary and added a lower-list price biosimilar-like product called Basaglar. We were able to convert 97% of the volume and delivered more than 21% savings to our customers.\nSo, while we haven't announced our formulary strategy yet, we took a similar approach in the hep C category by announcing last and was also able to deliver the lowest net cost and the most innovative solution for our customers. So not only will we continue to provide our clients and members optionality, we're also ensuring that we're providing the lowest net cost options and that our selective strategy helps our clients truly realize the savings. So bottom line, and this speaks to the broader biosimilar marketplace, we're committed to establishing a viable and durable biosimilar market and believe we're well-positioned to deliver innovation in the AI class. And we look forward to providing more clarity around Humira in the coming weeks.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Michael Cherny from Bank of America. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nManaging Director and Healthcare Technology and Distribution Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, and thanks for all the details so far. Maybe if I can just dive in a little bit more on Medicare Advantage and the exchange business relative to the long-term outlook. Shawn, obviously, not looking for anything beyond what you gave on the color, but the build includes clearly your work and your investments in stars, your work and your investments in the exchange business. Can you just give us a broad-based update on those two sides on where things are progressing, and especially as we head into the fall, how you think about that push-and-pull dynamic relative to positioning for stars for fiscal 2025?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Michael, let me start on stars, and Shawn can fill in the details on the numbers. But as you know, we had made significant progress efforts and had made significant investments in making progress in our stars performance.\nWe've been very focused on our remediation efforts. Our contract diversification strategy is well underway, and all of our internal indicators are positive and show progress. But having said that, having missed by such a narrow margin last year, I think we all recognize that it all comes down to the CMS cut point. So we'll know better in October, but our internal measures are positive from how we measure it.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. And Michael, on exchanges, we're another quarter in, and things are still looking positive. And as I mentioned, we continue to be cautious in our outlook in terms of what we're planning on that from this year. But both the revenue and the utilization side have been in line with our expectations. And so, I think that that really is something to think about as an opportunity for the future.\nWe have a million-member book now, probably something like $5 billion in revenue potentially this year, and it's not making a meaningful contribution. And one of the benefits of getting to scale so quickly is I think we can now turn towards at least getting some contribution of profitability from that business. And that would be our plan for 2024 and beyond, that that would begin to be a profit contributor for us. So, I do think it's one of the it's one of the growth levers that we have.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nManaging Director and Healthcare Technology and Distribution Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Justin, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst of Healthcare Services, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. So first, just on the MLR, Shawn, maybe you could give us a little more color in terms of at least relative to our estimates and consensus.\nLooks like you missed the quarter by 150 to 175 basis points, yet you're raising guidance by 50. It might have been some intra-year development. I know the quarter had some prior year in it as well. So just trying to kind of isolate what's going on there. If you can help us with some of that bridge, I'd appreciate it. And then on the guidance change, you're, by my math, $500 to 800 million of OI. Can you give us some increased clarity on where you're seeing that? For instance, how much of that is tied to MA assumption versus where you would typically be, etc.? So if you can break that apart for us as well, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Yeah. There's a few pieces going on in the quarter that are worth calling out. I did mention one.\nObviously, we had Medicaid pass-throughs that sort of has pushed on the MBR a bit in the quarter. We actually did have unfavorable PYD this quarter. So, we recognize that in the quarter; that's sort of pushing the number. But the biggest thing that's driving our guidance increase for the year is the change in outlook on our Medicare MBR. And that, like I said, for the quarter, is probably off a little more than 200 basis points. And I think it's more instructive, as I mentioned, to look at that for the first half. And that's largely what we've assumed. So, if you look at HCB going down about $400 million of adjusted operating income, obviously, there's other moving parts under the surface. But most of that's the 50 basis points on the overall HCB MBR.\nAgain, the other lines of business are largely in line, if not even a little better, than our expectations on HCB. Offsetting that, obviously, was our increase in the health services segment driven by pharmacy services. That is about $500 million better. Again, that is driven by sound fundamental performance that Karen and David discussed. You'll recall that we did talk about the underlying pharmacy services performance in Q1 was strong, and we've now carried that strong first-half performance for the full year. As was mentioned earlier, in response to the question, we have decreased our outlook on PCW by about $100 million, considering the impacts we observed towards the end of theQ2, softening consumer demand in particular, we talked about. So those are the moving pieces inside.\nOverall, AOI is pretty much flat to where we were, but those are the moving pieces under the covers.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Kevin Caliendo from UBS. Kevin, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThanks. Well, Shawn, I think you mentioned that you planned on opening more Oak Street clinics than originally planned, but I got a sense that that was also an incremental headwind. Does that mean that you'll be using less off-balance sheet? Or you had talked about potentially, if you increase using off-balance sheet metrics to do so. Is that still the case, or has that changed?\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. So I do want to talk about that. You're correct in your assessment.\nObviously, this is a very important and strategic investment in our future that we're making, and we continue to believe that there's high demand for more access to the differentiated Oak Street care model. Our analysis has consistently shown that accelerated clinic growth is the right thing to do in terms of optimizing the long-term returns on this investment and expanding access for at-risk populations. As Karen mentioned, we're going to do so in 2024, targeting 50 to 60 clinics. Oak Street will, and already is, working closely with their payer partners and identifying the key geographies. As you mentioned, our updated outlook for 2024 includes the full impact of this accelerated expansion without the benefit of any structured transaction. We are still evaluating the details and the merits of such a transaction, and we'll update you if anything definitive and material develops on that front.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHey, Kevin, I just want to make a couple of comments on Oak Street. We've made significant progress already, having closed not that long ago on driving patient growth and really leveraging the overall assets of the entire enterprise. We're using Signify to recommend if people don't have a primary care to Oak Street. We're helping Aetna Medicare members that don't have a primary care and recommending them to Oak Street. We're using connections in our pharmacies as well. So I'm really encouraged by the opportunity and the growth and really excited about what we've seen. And we have more conviction now that the meaningful value that we thought we could unlock will surface over the course of the next couple of years.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Nathan Rich from Goldman Sachs. Nathan, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\n\nNathan Rich\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Shawn, on the restructuring program, could you maybe talk about how much of the savings are in the 2023 guidance, and do you see the full run rate for 2024? And then on the new 2024 guidance, you mentioned a number of buckets that drove the guidance revision, the higher utilization, reduced outlook for retail given the macro environment. I think COVID and Oak Street were the other two. Could you maybe just help us think about the magnitude across each of those major buckets in terms of what drove the guidance revision?\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health",
    "content2": "Yeah, sure. So on the restructuring charge, there's the timing of all of this. It will have minimal impact the actions we take on 2023 to the extent there is any impact. We've thought that through in our reaffirmation of guidance.\nBut really, this was a major step forward in delivering the $700 to 800 million of G&A savings that we talked about in May. And the job OMs alone, as we mentioned, contribute probably close to $600 million of that benefit. But there's other things we've done in terms of shutting down projects. Obviously, there's been open positions we're not going to hire for as well. And so, we have a high degree of visibility into getting the effect that we committed to for 2024. On 2024 guidance, you're correct. There are really, I would say, three kind of performance items, some of which have a lot to do with the external environment, and then obviously the one decision. The positive item, obviously, is we do expect some of the outperformance in pharmacy services that we're experiencing in 2023 will pull through favorably into our 2024 performance.\nI would note that not all this favorability will pull through as it will naturally work its way into client pricing as contracts reset in 2024. So you can see the magnitude of our increase for this year. It's obviously not that much because we're not going to pull all that through, but it's a meaningful positive item for next year. Similarly, I think on the headwind side, the largest provision we've made in our guidance has to do with the Medicare Advantage performance. We've sort of sized the impact of that for this year and sort of have made provision for potential headwind on that. So I think you can kind of get in the neighborhood there. That would be the biggest other one. And then the other one is the PCW.\nWe've made some provision for the softening consumer demand to persist into next year, as well as potentially more decline in COVID for next year. We have factored that into our guidance. And as I was mentioning on the previous question, we've built in the full effect of the Oak Street acceleration as well. Obviously, that's a choice we're making and an investment in the future.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nAnd Nathan, just to comment, I want to be very clear that we took a very thoughtful and careful approach to this restructuring. We were very deliberate in making sure that we had non-customer-facing roles and that we weren't taking any action that would risk the execution of our long-term strategy.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYep. And just one kind of housekeeping thing in that, again, as always, we've removed the PYD. That's close to a nickel probably where we are on a year-to-date basis.\nSo we've taken that out as well for 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Josh Raskin from Nephron Research. Josh, your line is now open. Please proceed.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for squeezing me in here. And good morning. How are you thinking about the operating income contributions from Oak Street and Signify? I assume those are different directions in 2024. And specifically in light of the risk model changes, I would assume there could be some benefit in Signify, some headwind for Oak Street. And if you could also maybe size the impact for the risk model changes on the MA segment in the Aetna business on reimbursement, that'd be helpful too.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. I can talk a little bit about the segment, and then I can have Mike talk a little bit and Dan talk a little bit about the changes for 2024.\nIt's an important question because, as part of our strategy that we've talked about, the growth in the earnings from these two assets is an important part of sort of increasing our long-term earnings growth rate. We do expect to have a meaningful contribution of earnings improvement from these two assets from their base in 2023 into 2024. Everything we've seen in our Q1 of ownership, I think, has been consistent with that. I think we're even more have stronger conviction about sort of the value that we can bring. So they will be a positive contributor in our estimation of earnings growth in 2024. I'll turn it to Mike and Dan to talk a little bit about sort of the risk model and the changes for 2024.\n\nDan Finke\n\nPresident of Health Care Benefits, CVS Health\n\nYeah. On the HCB side, I would think about it in this way.\nFirst of all, the model's being phased in over time. We are pleased with that decision. Our modeling overall was very similar in the aggregate to the modeling of CMS. And frankly, with our size of book, it allows us to really manage the impact over time. So minimal impact to HCB.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nCEO, Oak Street Health\n\nYeah. From Oak Street's perspective, I think the thing to remember is a lot of the changes in the risk score model changes were driven by less specific codes being replaced by more specific codes. So you'll have less documentation codes with a lower coefficient on a high number of patients, and higher coefficient codes on a lower number of patients. And so the impact is going to be net of those changes, right? Not the gross impact of that.\nOne of the advantages of Oak Street is we have the same operating model and the same technology in all of our centers. So it allows us to react faster to those types of changes. We are already implementing new protocols, new clinical guidelines, etc., to be aware of that. I'd really like to point out Oak Street has been very successful across programs with different risk-adjusted methodologies. We were part of the Medicare Shared Savings Program, and we were a top 1% performer in that. We are the top performer in the ACO Reach program. Those have different risk-adjusted methodologies, CAP, etc., etc. So, I think it just goes to the fact that if you're doing a great job taking care of people and keeping them out of the hospital and lower medical costs, that will be durable across any risk-adjusted methodology.\nSo, we're pretty confident in our ability to keep generating great results going forward.\n\nDan Finke\n\nPresident of Health Care Benefits, CVS Health\n\nYeah. Just from a Signify standpoint, it's absolutely been a tailwind for us. Our clients and partners team up with us because we help manage this industry change for them. We stay ahead of the risk model changes. We help build new things into the Signify in-home business. We've seen a surge in demand for additional diagnostic and preventative testing work. It's an opportunity for us to expand into more follow-on care. So we're actually very excited about it. It's also been a nice touchpoint for us as we've integrated into the retail and pharmacy businesses at CVS. Managing medications inside the home is a huge unlock for us. We've been bringing in a deeper consumer engagement model with our partners inside the retail space and in pharmacy.\nWe've seen really great results with the kickoff there with the Aetna membership.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. I would just quickly reemphasize one thing Mike said in his the ability to have a common care model on a common technology platform and the ability to operationalize this should not be underestimated. And in our view, that was a differentiating characteristic about their model. But that is a very important point that, in my opinion, that Mike made there.\n\nJosh Raskin\n\nResearch Analyst, Nephron Research\n\nMakes sense. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from Elizabeth Anderson from Evercore. Elizabeth, your line is now open. Please proceed. Elizabeth, your line is now open. Please proceed. You might want to check if your microphone is muted.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nBruno, she might have dropped.\nSo let me just wrap it up here by thanking our colleagues for their commitment and dedication that they show every single day supporting our customers, our clients, and our patients. As we demonstrated today, we continue to execute on our bold goals and deliver outstanding performance despite the challenging environment that we're in. And I really believe, and I know the team believes, that this is a testament to our consistently strong execution and our resilient business model and gives us the confidence that we can continue our momentum throughout 2023 and 2024. Thanks for joining the call today.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you. Call today. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A Q&A session will follow the prepared remarks, at which point we will review instructions on how to ask your questions. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. Please go ahead.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nEvp, Chief Strategy Officer, and Chief Strategic Advisor to the CEO, CVS Health\n\nGood morning and welcome to the CVS Health Q1 2023 Earnings Call and webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we'll host a question and answer session that will include additional members of our leadership team. Daniel Finke, President of our Healthcare Benefits segment, Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer and Co-President of our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer and Co-President of our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, David Joyner, President of the Pharmacy Services Business within our Health Services segment, Kyle Armbrester, Chief Executive Officer of Signify Health, and Mike Pykosz, Chief Executive Officer of Oak Street Health.\nOur press release and slide presentation has been posted to our website along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for one year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry, and market conditions, including impacts related to COVID-19, as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections and the benefits of the Signify Health and Oak Street Health acquisitions and the associated integration plans, expected synergies, and revenue opportunities.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results, including with respect to COVID-19 and the integration of both the Signify Health and Oak Street Health acquisitions.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and risk factors in our most recent annual report filed on Form 10-K. Our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed this morning and our recent filings on Form 8-K included in this morning's earnings press release.\nDuring this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and in the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nKaren, thank you. Larry, good morning everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. This morning we reported strong Q1 results that demonstrate excellent performance across CVS Health. We successfully closed the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health and are updating our projections to include the financial impact of both transactions.\nWe are revising our full year 2023 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.50 to 8.70, reflecting the positive contribution of our strong underlying results and the impact of the Signify Health transaction, which enable us to partially offset the dilution from the early close of Oak Street and the financing costs for both transactions. Shawn will discuss the details of our updated outlook for the year shortly. We are purposely executing on our strategy as we continue to expand our health platform of capabilities to serve a broader customer and consumer base.\nWe are addressing the total cost of care, improving health, and expanding access to affordable quality care. Today we are announcing changes to our operating model and financial reporting that more accurately reflect how our businesses are managed. These changes allow us to be more nimble in our execution and more innovative when expanding our products and services. We are excited about accelerating our momentum by unlocking long-term value across our businesses and the broader healthcare marketplace.\nBeginning this quarter, we will report our results as follows. First, our new health services segment unifies most of the former operations of our pharmacy services segment as well as our healthcare delivery operations including primary care, retail health clinics, home-based care services, and provider enablement capabilities. This structure will simplify access to our multi-payer capabilities, better align the way we serve clients, and create superior health experiences for consumers.\nTogether, these businesses are positioned to more effectively address the total cost of care, implement new care models, and deliver connected solutions that build sustainable health communities. These combined businesses serve more than 110 million people, have more than 20,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported combined revenues of nearly $170 billion. We also created a new pharmacy and consumer wellness segment that integrates all of our omnichannel pharmacy capabilities, traditional retail pharmacy, specialty and mail order pharmacy, fulfillment, and infusion services, along with our front door offerings.\nWe are making the pharmacy experience as easy for consumers as possible while ensuring that we are creating better outcomes, lowering costs, and increasing convenience. These combined businesses serve more than 120 million people, deliver more than 1.6 billion scripts annually, have more than 220,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported combined revenues of nearly $109 billion.\nThe Healthcare Benefits segment remains largely unchanged and will continue to offer a full range of insured and self-insured medical, pharmacy, dental, and behavioral health products and services. This business serves more than 25 million medical members, has more than 40,000 colleagues, and in 2022 reported revenues of more than $91 billion.\nTurning to our performance in the quarter, we grew total revenue to more than $85 billion, an increase of 11% versus the prior year, and delivered Adjusted Operating Income of $4.4 billion. Adjusted EPS was $2.2. We had another quarter of robust cash flow from operations generating $7.4 billion. Each of our businesses delivered strong performance in the quarter. Starting with the Healthcare Benefits segment, we grew revenues to nearly $26 billion, an increase of more than 12%, and delivered Adjusted Operating Income of $1.8 billion. Overall medical costs were well controlled and in line with expectations.\nMembership in the Q1 increased by 1 million members versus the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the significant increase in our individual exchange business. Our Medicare business remains one of our strongest growth segments. We recently announced that the City of New York awarded us its Group Medicare Advantage Plan contract that begins in September 2023. The City of New York is one of the largest client wins in Aetna's history.\nWe look forward to providing access to high-quality, affordable, and convenient health care to the city's more than 200,000 retirees and their eligible dependents. We now expect approximately 12% membership growth in our Medicare Advantage business for the full year 2023 and are diligently working to improve our competitive position in individual MA to return to market growth in 2024. The recent award of two additional marquee group Medicare Advantage contracts serving approximately 45,000 retirees and their eligible dependents will supplement that growth beginning in January of 2024.\nTurning to our commercial business, we ended the quarter with approximately 18 million members, a nearly 6% increase sequentially. In addition to the significant growth in our individual exchange members, this increase was also driven by growth in key account, public and labor, and small group membership. These results reflect our strong value proposition: innovative solutions, service excellence\nIn our Medicare business. We increased membership in the quarter but expect declines for the rest of the year following expiration of the public health emergency. As Medicare members face potential disruptions in their health benefits, we are using the full breadth of our portfolio of assets to help them avoid coverage losses and maintain positive health outcomes.\nIn our health services segment, revenues grew to nearly $45 billion, an increase of more than 12%. Adjusted operating income increased more than 14% to $1.7 billion. Our total pharmacy claims processed in the quarter grew 3.7% versus the prior year and 4.8% excluding COVID vaccinations. We continue to deliver strong results in our specialty business with revenue growth of more than 10%.\nOur pharmacy and consumer wellness segment delivered a strong quarter, successfully navigating challenging market conditions and normalizing COVID trends. Revenue grew to approximately $28 billion, an increase of nearly 8% versus the prior year. We generated $1.1 billion of adjusted operating income in the quarter, a decrease of approximately 28% from the prior year, largely due to lower COVID-related contributions. Performance was strong in both the pharmacy and the front store.\nPharmacy revenue increased by 10% versus the prior year driven by product mix and prescription growth of 2.5%. Our growth in the retail pharmacy is notable and has resulted in significant market share gains over time. This is a testament to the value we provide our pharmacy patients and the investments we have made to improve their experiences.\nFront store revenues grew by 5% or nearly 8% on a same store basis driven by the strength across a variety of categories including beauty and personal care, as well as consumer health products. We continue to successfully execute on our retail footprint optimization strategy, closing more than 100 locations year to date while exceeding our retention goals for colleagues and scripts. We remain on track to close 300 stores in 2023 and a cumulative total of 900 stores by 2024.\nTurning to our progress on our strategy, nearly 18 months ago we outlined the bold shift in our strategy and shared our vision to become the leading health solutions company for consumers. Our goal is to redefine healthcare by creating a model that is convenient, affordable, connects care, and puts the patient at the center. Achieving this vision requires the right set of capabilities to serve a broader patient, customer, and community base. At the center of our vision is a value-based platform that is multi-payer, multichannel, and successful at driving consumer engagement, all leading to improved health outcomes.\nImportantly, as I highlighted earlier, we have completed the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. These acquisitions significantly advance our value-based strategy by adding primary care, home-based care, and provider enablement capabilities to our platform.\nThey also bring cutting-edge technology and talent that will accelerate innovation in areas such as automation, analytics, and technology-enabled data-driven product development. These premier growth businesses strongly enhance our ability to execute our care delivery strategy. Signify Health has a proven track record of identifying gaps in care and returning patients to care.\nIn close collaboration with their payer partners, they have demonstrated their ability to continuously innovate and evolve, further enhancing their value to their payer partners. Signify has a substantial pipeline of opportunities to enhance their position. This includes updating their in-home evaluations to continue to accurately document conditions and diseases while adapting to CMS risk model changes. We will also introduce a STARS enablement offering that will provide meaningful benefits for all payers.\nOak Street Health has a powerful combination of strong patient engagement, high quality care, and integrated technology that connects care experiences. These capabilities make Oak Street Health the premier clinic-based provider in the ecosystem today and uniquely positions them to manage the risk adjustment changes recently implemented by CMS.\nThe early close of the acquisition will be a short-term headwind to our 2023 adjusted EPS but will enable us to unlock synergies earlier and evaluate all options to accelerate growth at Oak Street and CVS Health. More importantly, the combination of Signify, Oak Street, and CVS Health creates a value-based person-centered care platform propelled by the powerful connections between our unique capabilities and assets. This will enable us to drive better patient experience and health outcomes while delivering on our long-term financial goals.\nWe are also making progress on driving integrated value across our foundational businesses. We serve 2.9 million members who are enrolled in our integrated medical and pharmacy plans. For members that utilize our integrated offerings, we are driving higher rates of medication adherence up to 15%, lower hospital admission and readmission rates, up to 19% reductions in ER visits, and 25% greater utilization of critical mental health care.\nOverall, these integrated plans offer members access to quality, better coordinated care, and improved health outcomes, and as we continue to extend our capabilities, we will develop more powerful connections that drive superior patient experiences, better outcomes, and lower costs.\nWe remain critically focused on digital engagement and achieved a significant milestone this quarter, exceeding 50 million unique digital customers. These customers are driving meaningful results, with digital sales in the quarter up more than 30% versus the prior year. Engagement levels are strong as these customers spend 2.4 times more than our non-digitally engaged customers and at higher margins. We continue to drive innovation and expand our digital offerings to meet customers' needs.\nLast month, we released our 2022 ESG report, highlighting the progress we are making towards our ambitious goals. We continue to build on our achievements, including signing two additional renewable energy purchases that meaningfully advance our transition to 50% renewable energy by 2040.\nBefore I turn the call over to Shawn, I'd like to talk about recent regulatory actions and how our businesses are positioned to successfully navigate through the impact in the months and years to come. We have a long history of successfully working within Medicare Advantage funding levels to support program stability for our members. We're building on that experience to drive more care to value-based arrangements and to clinical care programs that deliver better outcomes and improve member experiences.\nOur strong capabilities enable us to navigate the current environment and deliver offerings that our customers value. We appreciate CMS's approach to provide a three-year phase-in for the risk adjustment model changes. This will allow the industry to work within the guidelines and to reduce disruptions faced by members.\nWe support CMS goal to increase the value of risk coding and believe coding should capture the true picture of a patient's health, including risk factors, identifying care gaps in patient needs, and ultimately driving better outcomes. Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street are the right combination of assets to successfully manage through these changes. Each have robust processes and infrastructure to handle the increasing complexities in patient care and reimbursement. They also bring an incredible expertise that allows us to quickly evaluate the impacts from these changes and rapidly implement the necessary operational updates to excel in this dynamic environment.\nI also want to address the recent regulatory focus on the PBM industry. PBMs have consistently been found to operate in a highly efficient market and drive real savings to health care customers and members. Every day we deliver product choices for our clients and their members that help make care more affordable, accessible, and simple. Our business is centered on transparency, innovation, and simplicity, which strengthen our ability to meet customers and health plan client needs and, most importantly, drive towards the lowest net cost.\nFinally, I want to thank our dedicated CVS Health colleagues for their commitment and extraordinary work driving our vision forward. I'll now turn the call over to Shawn for a deeper look into our financial results and outlook for the year.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nThank you Karen and good morning everyone. Our Q1 results reflect the continuation of outstanding performance from each of our business segments as we delivered strong revenue growth, cash flow from operations, and adjusted earnings per share. These results are driven by our steadfast focus on growth, operational execution, and supporting the communities we serve. A few highlights regarding Total Company Performance.\nQ1 revenues of $85.3 billion increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting strong growth across each of our businesses. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.4 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.20, representing decreases of 5.1% and 4.3% versus prior year, respectively, primarily due to lower COVID-19 contributions in the current year.\nOur ability to generate cash remains outstanding with cash flow from operations in the quarter of $7.4 billion. Cash flows in the quarter benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize by the end of the year.\nAs Karen mentioned in her prepared remarks, beginning this quarter, we have resegmented our businesses and our financial reporting to more closely aligned with how they are managed. I will discuss our Q1 2023 results and provide comparisons against the prior year based on our new structure. After reviewing the results, I will update our 2023 guidance under the new segmentation.\nStarting with health care benefits, we delivered strong revenue growth versus the prior year. Q1 revenue of $25.9 billion increased by 12.1% year-over-year. Membership grew over 4% on a sequential basis reflecting significant growth in individual exchange members as well as increases across all other product lines.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.8 billion in the quarter declined slightly versus the prior year. This was driven by the expected return to more normalized utilization as the effect of COVID waned, and by the lower impact from prior year reserve development. These decreases were largely offset by higher net investment income and membership growth across all product lines during the quarter.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 84.6% increased 120 basis points year-over-year, reflecting more normalized utilization, including the impact of higher flu as compared to last year, and modestly lower impact from favorable prior year development.\nOur assumption was always that our 2023 medical cost seasonality by business would look more like pre-pandemic patterns. We believe that the consensus estimates for quarterly MBR may have relied too heavily on recent experience that was impacted by COVID-19. Overall utilization trends remain in line with expectations.\nConsolidated Days Claims Payable at the end of the quarter was 48.1, down 3.2 days sequentially. This is more in line with historical levels of Days Claims Payable for the Q1 and pre-pandemic periods. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nOur health services business, which includes most of the operations of our legacy pharmacy services segment as well as our healthcare delivery operations, generated revenue of approximately $45 billion, an increase of 12.6% year-over-year. This increase was driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy, and brand inflation partially offset by continued client price improvements. While results from both Signify, which closed in March, and Oak Street, which closed yesterday, will be included in this segment going forward. The timing of the close of Signify resulted in an immaterial impact to Q1 2023 results.\nAdjusted Operating Income of nearly $1.7 billion grew over 14% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics and increased pharmacy claims volume. This was partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements and lower COVID-19 testing.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed in the quarter increased by 3.7% above the prior year and 4.8% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations. This increase was primarily attributable to net new business in 2023, increased utilization, and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season. Total pharmacy membership remained steady, exceeding 110 million members.\nIn our pharmacy and consumer wellness segment. We delivered strong revenue growth despite continued economic uncertainty and lower COVID-19 contributions. During Q1, revenue of $27.9 billion grew nearly 8%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, pharmacy drug mix, and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued reimbursement pressure, decreased COVID-19 vaccinations in diagnostic testing, and the impact of recent generic introductions.\nAdjusted Operating Income of $1.1 billion declined 27.9% versus the prior year, driven by reimbursement pressure and decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, as well as increased investments in operations and capabilities. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and an improved generic drug purchasing.\nPharmacy prescription volume grew 2.5% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization, and elevated cough, cold, and flu volume compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, prescription volume increased by 4.5%.\nTurning to the balance sheet, our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Through Q1, we generated cash flow from operations of $7.4 billion, bolstered by the CMS prepayment I discussed earlier, and ended the quarter with approximately $2.7 billion of cash at the parent in unrestricted subsidiaries. During the quarter, we issued approximately $6 billion of long-term debt for general corporate purposes, including funding the Signify transaction. The Oak Street transaction was funded with available resources, including proceeds of $5 billion from a term loan that closed earlier this week.\nWe repurchased approximately 22.8 million shares in the quarter, and through our quarterly dividend we returned $779 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade ratings while preserving flexibility to deploy capital strategically.\nA few other items worth highlighting for investors first, as previously noted, beginning this year, the impact of net realized capital gains or losses will be excluded from Adjusted Operating Income. Net realized capital losses in the three months ended 31 March 2023 and 2022 were $105 million and $75 million, respectively. Second, we recorded an additional loss on assets held for sale associated with our Omnicare long-term care business of $349 million. We also recognized acquisition-related transaction and integration costs associated with the Signify and Oak Street transactions, as well as additional office real estate optimization charges in the quarter, for a total of $68 million.\nFinally, effective 1 January 2023, we adopted a new standard related to the accounting for long duration insurance contracts. Our results will reflect this change going forward. The retrospective adoption of the new accounting standard also required us to revise our net income for 2022. This change positively impacted our Q1 2022 results by $42 million and our full year 2022 results by $162 million.\nBefore we provide our updated expectations for 2023, I want to discuss the impact of our business resegmentation had on our financials. The primary impact of resegmentation that I want to highlight is the revised treatment of our Maintenance Choice product. Previously, the economics of Maintenance Choice were reflected in both our pharmacy services product and retail segments regardless of where the drugs were dispensed and drove a large intersegment elimination.\nAfter resegmentation, the economics of Maintenance Choice will only be reflected in our Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness segment, which now includes all pharmacy mail and specialty fulfillment operations. This change correspondingly results in the discontinuation of Adjusted Operating Income eliminations and provides greater simplicity for investors.\nIn addition to the changes related to our treatment of Maintenance Choice, we shifted our legacy care delivery operations, including MinuteClinic, from retail into our health services segment. This is also where our recently acquired Signify and Oak Street businesses will be reported.\nTurning now to updated guidance based on our new segments. Beginning with the health services segment, our new adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $6.61 to 6.73 billion. This estimate reflects the resegmentation changes previously described, the impact of emerging risks to the 340B program, and the inclusion of Signify Health and Oak Street Health acquisitions partially offset by underlying strength in our pharmacy services business.\nFor the health care benefits segment, we now expect adjusted operating income of $6.39 to 6.52 billion benefiting from higher net investment income in Q1 2023, and prior period development. We continue to take a prudent and cautious stance with respect to our individual exchange business inside our full year outlook.\nIn the pharmacy and consumer wellness segment, our new adjusted operating income guidance is a range of $5.73 to 5.83 billion, reflecting lower than expected COVID volumes as well as the impact of resegmentation. We are also updating our guidance for additional net investment income generated in our corporate segment due to higher yields and higher average parent cash balances in Q1 2023. We do not expect these higher corporate cash balances to persist in 2023 following the recent closure of both the Signify and Oak Street acquisitions.\nFinally, our new projection for interest expense is $2.7 billion, reflecting the incremental financing costs for Signify Health and Oak Street Health. We are also updating our share count guidance to approximately 1.293 billion shares as our previously announced accelerated share repurchase transaction yielded more shares than initially projected.\nIn aggregate, the headwind of approximately $0.35 resulting from the impact of the Signify and Oak Street acquisitions and their associated financing, partially offset by underlying strength across the enterprise, result in a net headwind of $0.20. This brings our 2023 Adjusted EPS guidance range to $8.50 to 8.70.\nShifting to our cash flow, we continue to anticipate strong cash flow from operations in 2023 and are maintaining our guidance range of $12.5 to 13.5 billion. Capital expenditures are unchanged at a range of $2.8 to 3 billion and we continue to project an adjusted effective tax rate of 25.5%.\nI also want to provide an update on the progression of earnings for the year. Due to the strength of our results in the Q1, the incorporation of Signify, Oak Street, and the 340B headwind, we now expect second half 2023 earnings to be slightly more than 50% of the full year results, with the Q3 modestly higher than the Q4. We also want to highlight our expectations for quarterly MBRs. We continue to expect the year-on-year increases in MBR to be higher in the first half than the second half. This dynamic is due to COVID-driven lower utilization trends in the first half of 2022. We expect the MBR progression in Q2 of this year to look similar to the trend in Q1.\nShifting now to our multi year outlook, we remain committed to achieving the $9 and $10 targets for 2024 and 2025 that we shared during our earnings call in February. We take these commitments seriously and have aligned the organization and our operations to achieve these goals.\nAs with any multi-year plan, new headwinds and tailwinds can emerge. Recently, there have been significant developments in the 340B program that create challenges for our pharmacy benefits business, and based on our most recent experience, COVID contributions may dissipate more rapidly than previously anticipated.\nThe early close of the Signify and Oak Street transactions improve our ability to accelerate synergy realization. In addition, our business resegmentation presents the opportunity to reduce duplicative efforts and enhance focus on rationalizing our core operations. We believe these opportunities, combined with the underlying strength of our business and our commitment to evaluate all alternatives to accelerate growth and synergies from our new acquisitions, will enable us to mitigate the new headwinds I just discussed.\nTo conclude, our Q1 results reflect continued strength from all of our core business segments. We are excited to begin the work of integrating Signify and Oak Street into our operations and are pleased with the positive contribution of our foundational businesses on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. We will maintain our focus on growth and operational execution and look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to progress on our long-term strategy. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you wish to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one quick follow up. We'll take our first question from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse Group AG\n\nHello, everybody. Thanks for all the details. Maybe just on the focus on MA for 2024, Karen, your remarks, you mentioned that you feel like Oak Street is particularly well positioned to absorb the pending changes around the risk adjustment. And so for I wonder if I can get you to flesh that out a little more of what you all see in Oak Street relative to some of the other things perhaps you've looked at or whatever that makes you confident of their ability to make the adjustments or if they've already got things in place to do that.\nAnd then maybe the follow-up. I'll ask now too, Shawn, you guys have laid out the mitigation steps that you were taking to offset the star rating headwind for next year. I wonder if you've got any update on what you're doing with respect to the one plan that got hit, with respect to some of the cost reduction programs that you talked about implementing, and other things. Any update on that would be great.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHi, A.J. Yeah, let me take a couple of those things. First of all, as I said in my prepared remarks, you know, we do plan to get back to market growth in our individual MA product for a number of reasons. So I'll start with the work that we've been doing on our, you know, kind of in our Medicare product, you know, making sure that we have strong benefits and strong service capabilities. We believe that Oak Street and Signify also give us, you know, credibility in the Medicare Advantage space.\nYou know, we took a long hard look at Oak Street and their ability to adapt to the Medicare Advantage. The one thing that we were most impressed by was the level of commitment that they have relative to their patient care, and secondly the technology platform that they have.\nI'm going to ask Mike to actually talk a little bit more about that. But I would say that they're a very strong performing business. We are excited about what their capabilities will bring to our Medicare and also other payers Medicare because, as you know, it's a payer agnostic business. So a lot of the work that they're doing not only benefits us, it benefits their broader customer base as well. Mike.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nCEO, Oak Street Health\n\nThank you, Karen. To build on that. I think most importantly, the results we're driving on the economic front with our patients is really driven by the strength of our care model. We've been incredibly successful across programs, across different risk adjustment methodologies. For example, we were in the top 1% of the Medicare Shared Savings Program. We were in that program. We were the top performing direct contracting, now ACO REACH entity. We've obviously achieved phenomenal results in Medicare Advantage.\nWhat underlies that is a robustness in the clinical model, an incredible medical leadership team, as Karen noted, a really strong technology platform. When there are changes, we can adapt to those and implement them. The consistency of our approach, the fact that we operate our centers and extension model across the country really enables us to rapidly change as we need to. But most importantly, fundamentally, what is driving the economic value. Strategy is great patient care and keeping people healthy and out of the hospital. And that's going to be durable regardless of how risk adjustment is done.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nLet me ask Dan to talk a little bit about our recontracting efforts and what we're doing on STARS.\n\nDaniel Finke\n\nPresident of Health Care Benefits Segment, CVS Health\n\nSo a couple of updates on the Star Ratings program. First of all, in the contract diversification process that is ongoing and as expected, we're beginning the operationalization of that as we speak. And then Shawn has talked in the past about the investments that we've made from an enterprise perspective with the enterprise focus to improve the clinical experience and member experience for our members.\nWe continue to believe we have the right actions and the team in place. We have some positive momentum there. As you know, we're between two important times in the rating cycle. The CAHPS survey is currently underway. The investments we've made in customer satisfaction are showing some internal measurement improvement in the member experience measurements. We're also wrapping up the HEDIS season and the team has been very focused on chart collection and we're seeing some year-over-year improvement there. All of these actions are added to our robust STARS program, and we look forward to this being reflected in our STARS outcomes going forward.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nA.J, on that point, I would just say I'm encouraged by what we're seeing on the internal metrics relative to our STARS performance.\n\nAJ Rice\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Credit Suisse Group AG\n\nOkay, great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with J.P. Morgan.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThanks very much and good morning. Karen, I just want to shift gears a little bit and go back to your PBM comments around transparency, lowest net price. Now we continue to see a lot of chatter in DC around potential PBM legislation around both changes to rebates, changes to spread pricing. Shawn called out changes to 340B and having a headwind, there's the net to growth bubble popping. When we think about insulin, think about these new drugs, GLP-1 coming to the market.\nWhen we put all of this together, can you, or welcome back to David Joyner. Talk about, you know, your outlook for the PBM, how you're thinking about this and you know, any potential changes that you think will come about on the PBM side and what are you hearing more importantly from your clients as we think about these areas.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nHi Lisa, first of all, I thought your report on the PBM industry was fantastic. And let me, I'll just make a few comments on the PBM industry at large and I'll ask David to answer your specific questions. I think it's really important that, you know, we all recognize that the PBMs play an essential role in lowering drug costs. And you know, I think we all would agree that in fact, the PBM is the only player in the supply chain whose specific role it is to lower drug costs for our customers. And you know, I think, you know, we've had a number of investigations, you know, they've consistently concluded that the PBMs operate in a highly efficient and effective manner to really deliver real savings.\nI think, you know, you mentioned the customers. Our clients hire us to manage their pharmacy benefit, which includes both the administration and the management of overall drug costs. In almost every case, they bring in sophisticated consultants to help them look at that broader service offering, which includes looking at rebates, looking at spread pricing.\nOur clients have a choice and decide how they want to contract for rebates and spread pricing. In fact, today we're passing through over 98% of rebates on behalf of our clients, which obviously have full audit rights. Our scorecard is really how we're effectively and successfully managing the client spend, which we have consistently demonstrated, and low to mid single-digit growth in overall pharmacy spend. So I think that we've seen a high level of member and client satisfaction.\nYou know, I think that the government, you know, we've answered the government's questions on transparency and innovation and our clients are making those choices. You know, I think that we have consistently demonstrated that the PBMs play a critical role in the healthcare ecosystem. Now, your specific questions. Let me ask David to talk about the customers.\n\nDavid Joyner\n\nEVP and President of Pharmacy Services, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks, Karen and Lisa, thanks for the question. So, as you know, I've been in this industry for a long time and maybe have become too accustomed to the scrutiny in the marketplace, but it also has allowed us, I think, to validate the value that we bring to our customers. So as I kind of answer more broadly, kind of the customer question and kind of where the focus is, as you know, nine out of every 10 prescriptions are generic drugs today. So if you look at it from a member affordability, this is a very affordable benefit. And I think the value that the PBM has been able to accelerate and deliver to our customers.\nSo the focus now is really on that last 10% and the 10%, both in terms of the high list prices, and areas in which we have been able to deliver competition and actually create discounts for our customers. So I would say there's a couple different areas that we're focusing on. One is to make sure that we preserve and protect the transparency that we're delivering to our customers today, as Karen said; we pass through obviously 98%+ of the rebates, and the customers choose how they want to contract with us with full auto. Right.\nSo I think our customers feel very strongly about the value that we're delivering. But there is obviously an area around the member affordability. So we're focusing specifically in the area of insulin. We have today 65% of all of our plan sponsors actually offer a $35 or less copay for the members that have insulin. So when you look at it from a member affordability and areas where we want to protect the preventative drug classes, our customers are actually moving down this path of making sure that they're both focusing on transparency for themselves and also making sure that they're focusing on transparency for the members.\nAnd the last piece, I'll say just in terms of kind of the client reaction and or kind of where they're positioned today. We did have a large client forum upon my return, and there's a big focus on kind of the advocacy both in the states and at the federal level. They're very focused on making sure that they both educate and preserve the tools that we have available to us to manage the spend. So whether you mentioned biosimilars or the high cost of GLP-1s is making sure that we continue to actually have the tools in place to drive competition that allows us to reduce costs for our customers. I say it has been somewhat of a wake-up call, and I would expect that you'll see more kind of advocacy not just within the PBM, but obviously the payers that actually have to fund the other benefit.\n\nLisa Gill\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks. Good morning. Appreciate the reiteration of 2024 and 2025 EPS targets given you've updated 2023 and there's a ton of moving parts for 2024. Wanted to focus here and ask a question for an update on areas like the Star Ratings Centene loss headwind next year. I know that number's moved obviously. How should we think about the deals year-over-year versus the $0.35 dilution that you've offered for this year, and any other areas of potential offset or growth beyond typical core growth and capital deployment as we think about kind of the moving parts to kind of bridge us to that $9? Would be really helpful.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYep, I will start on that, and you know, Karen or anybody else can come in on this. So I think in terms of thinking about the existing headwinds that you mentioned, Stars and Centene, I think we look at those as largely the same, and as I mentioned in my remarks, we're driving the organization to achieve the $9 per share for 2023 and approximately $10 for 2024 on an adjusted EPS basis.\nBut as you mentioned over the quarter, there has been a couple of things I think that have sort of popped up. Having said that, we do believe we have two very impactful levers, one of which you mentioned that can help us mitigate these potential headwinds. The first is to explore all the alternatives to accelerate growth and synergy realization in Signify and Oak Street. For Signify that will be driven by continued strong multi payer growth and using our combined assets to expand product and capabilities for all payers.\nFor Oak Street, the early closing will allow us to explore alternative growth vehicles that allow us to accelerate clinic growth and mitigate dilution, and very importantly, begin this work well in advance of 2024. The second item is that the closing of these two strategic transactions and the resegmenting of our operation provides us with a timely opportunity to both improve focus and reduce administrative and operational costs by streamlining, eliminating duplicative efforts, and achieving greater organizational operational efficiency.\nWe believe both areas represent sizable opportunities that have the potential to serve as mitigating tailwinds for 2024 and 2025. So I'd say in summary, while there's still a lot to play out here on both the headwinds and tailwind side, we still believe these are goals that are within an attainable range of outcomes.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nShawn, when do you think you'll be able to share with us or put some numbers around? The benefits you'll see to those deals versus kind of what consensus numbers may be assumed for 2024 and this efficiency cost cutting that you think you might be able to achieve for next year? Any idea in terms of magnitude or timing?\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I think this is really at the top of the priority list for the next really quarter or two. And I think we'll have greater clarity on both headwinds and tailwinds sort of over that time period. And I just want to be clear, I might have said $9 and $10 for 2023 and 2024. That's for 2024 and 2025, just to be clear. But Justin, this is really at sort of the top of the performance agenda for the next couple of quarters for us.\n\nJustin Lake\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America.\n\nMichael Cherny\n\nManaging Director of Healthcare Technology and Distribution Analyst, Bank of America Corporation\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking the question. I think this is a quasi-two-parter, one technical and one more tied to the numbers. But just first on the segmentation change, I just want to confirm, especially based on the press release, that the specialty mail revenue and EBIT moved from Health Services, the former Pharmacy Services, to Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness, just because I'm trying to make sure I understand a full footing of where the guidance changed.\nAnd I guess the real question along those lines is, can we dive a little bit more into what goes into 340B in terms of the changes that you've seen and you called it out specifically for Health Services? Is there any impact that you can bridge in terms of total number both for Health Services as well as if there is any that impact Pharmacy and Consumer Wellness? Thanks so much,\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nMichael. I'll jump in on this one. So I want to be clear that the economic benefit really of specialty and mail is still in HSS. What we've done here is consolidate the fulfillment functions in the PCW organization, and there's, you know, there's no meaningful sort of transfer of profit around sort of the fulfillment angle of that. So when you look at the guidance change on HSS, it looks like a big number.\nThe biggest component of that is really the elimination of the dual credit of Maintenance Choice being in both. When you take that out, you will see the guidance has come down about $300 million for HSS. That's basically two main pieces. One you saw in our earnings slides. There's about a $0.7 decrement or about $130 million.\nThat's sort of the core performance of the pharmacy business, which I'll come back to vis-à-vis 340B. The other is we're now including the adjusted operating income for Oak and Signify in there. And that is the other piece that would get you to about a $300 or 300 million change in the guidance. But the thing to keep in mind is the elimination and then also the elimination then of the elimination entry that we had around Maintenance Choice. That's going to look a lot bigger.\nThe 340B impact, as I mentioned, it's a very fluid situation. We're reacting to sort of what the actions that various manufacturers are taking. What I'd say is, as I mentioned, there's about a $0.07 decrease in our guidance related to pharmacy performance. That actually is an underlying positive strength in the non-340B elements of our pharmacy business.\nThen we put in sort of a best estimate at this point. That 340B impact is a little bigger than the $0.07. You know, I think there are various. There's been a note or two published about this, and I'd say those aren't unreasonable proxies for sort of what we've incorporated into our guidance on this topic. But again, I can't stress enough. It's still sort of a dynamic process that's moving around.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Nephron Research.\n\nEric Percher\n\nPartner of Pharma Supply Chain and Digital Health, Nephron Research\n\nThank you. Appreciate the incremental detail on Signify and Oaks impact on the guidance. My question would be how are you prioritizing the development of Oak? Are you focusing on getting existing membership? Into existing clinics near term? It sounds like there is new clinic build that may be accelerated by the early close. What can you tell us there?\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I'll turn it to Mike, but it's really both. Right. We're considering obviously the key financial levers, getting membership into the clinics. That's always been. It's one of the synergy values we discussed when we announced the deal. And then as I mentioned, one of the opportunities we've had once we've closed is to explore solutions to accelerate that growth. But I'll let Mike comment as well.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nCEO, Oak Street Health\n\nYeah. From the Oak Street perspective, we couldn't be more excited getting to work with CVS. The breadth and the number of older adults that CVS is interacting with across all the different business units is really unprecedented in the US, and that creates an incredible opportunity for us to meet more people introduced into what we do at Oak Street Health, which we think is highly differentiated from a care model perspective and a patient experience perspective that can allow us to bring more and more patients in, which can really move up the profitability timing in our J-curve.\nSo that is an incredible excitement point. I think even thinking more broadly than just the kind of traditional CVS's, we're really excited to work with Signify. We think there's a huge opportunity there as well. That's just on the filling the clinics perspective. Obviously we are always excited. We think there's a huge market opportunity to put more clinics up. And so that combination, I think, is really powerful.\n\nKyle Armbrester\n\nCEO, Signify Health",
    "content2": "Yeah, this is. Kyle just went in briefly, too. And we go into the almost 3 million homes we go into this year. So many of them don't have a primary care physician or are completely isolated from a care team. And so we're very excited to have an option for those folks and to be able to drive them back to a model that we know is going to drive better outcomes and to connect them into Oak Street.\nSo there's a tremendous amount of synergies. I think, bringing all of these three assets together, CVS with the brand and the reach, Oak with their differentiated model, and now our presence in the home. When we pull all three of those together, I think we're going to have a really unique experience that drives better patient outcomes across the country.\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah. And Eric, I wouldn't lose sight of the fact that there are a lot of other assets that we can connect the dots for these members, including kind of our retail health clinics, including our pharmacy. You can think about Medicare, pharmacy adherence, and pharmacy reconciliation. So there's lots of touch points that will create additional value for us across the entire enterprise as we connect all these assets together.\n\nEric Percher\n\nPartner of Pharma Supply Chain and Digital Health, Nephron Research\n\nKaren, do you believe you have all the assets you need now, or could we see more inorganic addition to healthcare services?\n\nKaren Lynch\n\nPresident and CEO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, I think over time, you know, we'll look at, you know, what other assets. But right now we need to focus on execution of the assets that we just acquired. And then, as you think longer term around the corner, there might be additional opportunities in the home or health services, tech kinds of things. But right now for the near term, it is important for us to execute on these important assets and bring our products and services to bear for our customers.\n\nEric Percher\n\nPartner of Pharma Supply Chain and Digital Health, Nephron Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Caliendo with UBS.Kevin, your line is open. Please unmute.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nSorry about that. Just looking at the MBR guide, I just want to make sure I got this right. So you're Shawn, you said second quarter MBR would be flat, right, with Q1 MBR and that utilization expectations were in line with your expectations. I guess just can you remind us what the utilization expectations were or are in any way to segment out what you're seeing? You mentioned higher flu, but maybe across the different business lines just to get a better understanding of sort of what the assumption is for Q2 as well in terms of utilization and how to think about that going forward.\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYes, I'll have Dan talk a little bit more about the specifics on utilization, but specific to the MBR discussion. Just to be clear, it may mathematically work out to be what you said, but we expect a similar kind of year-over-year increase in Q2 MBR, and then sort of a leveling out for kind of Q3, Q4. I think this has more to do, I think, with how 2022 manifested itself in terms of how COVID was playing out. I think that's why that's going to sort of drive that pattern.\nYou know, we have been pricing. All along for a return to normal utilization across the product portfolio. I think we're getting closer and closer to that all the time, certainly with some of what we've seen in the first quarter. I can have Dan comment a little bit more. As you mentioned, overall we thought it was in line with our expectations and our pricing.\n\nDaniel Finke\n\nPresident of Health Care Benefits Segment, CVS Health\n\nYeah, thanks Shawn. As Shawn said, we've been expecting the quarter-over-quarter increases towards a normalized level of utilization, and we certainly continued to see that in the Q1. Inpatient volume has continued to be slightly below normalized levels. We also saw some transitions of care to some alternative sites of care, outpatient, ambulatory, and obviously we think that's a good thing, offering alternative sites of care which lower overall costs. We see that trend continue.\nMental health remains above pre-pandemic levels. We also think that's a good thing because demand is being met. You know, general services like physician services, ambulatory ER, and specialists are all generally at normalized levels. All of that, like Shawn said, is priced within expectations. When you think about the lines of business, the way I think about it is commercial and Medicare in line with expectations, generally at normalized levels. Medicare is still being somewhat favorable.\n\nKevin Caliendo\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.\n\nBrian Tanquilut\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nMorning, guys. As I think about the Oak Street acquisition and the guidance you had given at the time of the deal being announced, $2 billion EBITDA target for 2026. I think I heard Shawn talk about driving accelerated growth there. How do we reconcile, you know, first, visa, believe that that's the goal, and then how do you reconcile the J-curve with the increase or the acceleration in growth in units that you're contemplating?\n\nShawn Guertin\n\nEVP and CFO, CVS Health\n\nYeah, just to be clear, I think. I'm not sure, but the EBITDA number you're referencing was sort of the embedded EBITDA kind of concept. I think that's, you know, again, when we talk a lot about sort of accretion dilution, we're in the GAAP world. What that does is it leaves out sort of the embedded EBITDA that that's building.\nAs I mentioned, there's significant long-term value because of that embedded EBITDA in accelerating clinic growth. As we've discussed, though, there are vehicles and models where we could see kind of both accelerating the clinic growth and better managing the dilutive impact of that clinic growth. Now that we're closed, and we're closed well in advance of 2024, I think one of the opportunities we have is to explore and potentially execute on those in time to have an impact on 2024. I'll let Mike, as the expert here, talk more about this.\n\nMike Pykosz\n\nCEO, Oak Street Health\n\nWhat I would add to that is if you look at the economics of an Oak Street J-curve, which we've shared a lot publicly on the Oak Street level, the biggest driver of that is both the quality of care for patients and how fast you can fill up centers. We think there's still opportunity to continue to improve the quality of care of patients as we have year-over year. There's a lot of capabilities within CVS that can accelerate that. Even more importantly, if we can just pull up the time it takes to fill up the center, we will pull up those extremely profitable years of the back end J-curve, which right now are taking six, seven years to get to if you can pull that up faster.\nObviously, now that number that Shawn referenced, that embedded EBITDA number becomes a reality much faster. I think that's the biggest opportunity from an economic perspective. While we are so excited to be part of CVS, as we're doing that, we can reinvest even more into more centers, more capabilities, and create an incredibly powerful flywheel. Obviously, interacting with the broader CVS ecosystem will both help Oak Street. I think we can actually do a lot to help different parts within CVS as well.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Thomas Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. Please go ahead.\n\nThomas F. Cowhey\n\nSVP of Capital Markets, CVS Health Corporation\n\nGood morning. And welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer of CVS; Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CVS; and Mike Pykosz, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Oak Street Health.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include additional members of the CVS management team: Daniel Finke, President, Healthcare Benefits; Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer and Retail Co-President; Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer and Retail Co-President; David Joyner, New President, Pharmacy Services; and Dr. Alan Lotvin, outgoing President Pharmacy Services.\nOur earnings and Oak Street acquisition press releases and slide presentations have been posted to our website along with our Form 10-K and our Form 8-K that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is also being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year.\nDuring this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, including impacts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections and the benefits of the pending acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, and the associated integration plans, expected synergies and revenue opportunities. All forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results, including with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the pending acquisition and integration of Signify Health. We strongly encourage you to review the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and the Risk Factors section in this morning's earnings press release, Oak Street Health acquisition press release and included in our Form 10-K and the Form 8-K we filed this morning.\nDuring this call, we will use non-GAAP measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition, and you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures in this morning's press release and the reconciliation document posted to the Investor Relations portion of our website.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Karen. Karen?\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. This morning, we are going to discuss our 2022 results, our 2023 guidance and our announcement that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oak Street Health. Mike Pykosz, Chairman, CEO and Co-Founder of Oak Street Health, will join Shawn and me during the call to discuss this important transaction.\nBut first, 2022 was a year of progress for CVS Health. We delivered strong financial results, we made meaningful progress on our strategy and we brought a greater value to the people that we serve. This morning, we announced that we exceeded our adjusted EPS expectations for the fourth quarter in a row, delivering fourth quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of $1.99 and full year 2022 adjusted EPS of $8.69. This result represents nearly 10% growth over our 2021 baseline. For 2023, we continue to expect adjusted EPS in the range of $8.70 to $8.90, which at the midpoint, represents high single-digit growth off of our 2022 baseline of approximately $8.25.\nIn 2022, CVS Health surpassed the $300 billion mark in total revenue, growing full year revenues by more than 10% to $322 billion. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.5 billion and generated adjusted EPS of $8.69. Our ability to generate cash flow from operations was robust at nearly $16.2 billion for the full year.\nEach of our foundational businesses generated excellent results. Starting with the Health Care Benefits segment. We grew revenues by more than 11% for the year and delivered adjusted operating income of $6 billion. Our medical benefit ratio of 84% improved by 100 basis points versus the prior year and was consistent with our full year expectations after adjusting for the impact of elevated flu in the fourth quarter.\nI want to highlight a few areas within the HCB segment. Although our individual Medicare Advantage growth was below our expectations, Medicare Advantage remains a key strategic growth area for CVS Health. We remain focused on delivering superior service to our Medicare Advantage members while advancing our efforts to improve our Star ratings. We are executing on the actions we identified to address our CAHPS survey scores and are making the necessary investments to drive our Stars Improvement initiative.\nWe also made progress in the last 90 days in advancing our efforts to diversify our national PPO contract and have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals to move forward. This will enable us to more effectively manage our Medicare business in the future. As we will discuss shortly, adding both Signify Health and Oak Street Health to our value-based care delivery platform will deepen our focus on this important business.\nIn our individual exchange business, we now expect to end 2023 with between 900,000 and 1 million individual members. This significant growth in membership is driven by our provider network, market growth, marketplace disruptions and our co-branded integrated benefit offerings. We anticipate a positive, sustainable contribution from this membership in future years.\nOur Pharmacy Services segment grew full year revenues by 11% with adjusted operating income of $7.4 billion. Performance in our specialty pharmacy was again outstanding. Revenue grew more than 19% year-over-year, driven by our industry-leading digital and specialty pharmacy capabilities.\nAs we enter 2023, the first wave of new biosimilars will be coming to market, starting with competitors for HUMIRA. We recently announced that AMJEVITA will be added to coverage within our commercial formularies alongside HUMIRA and other branded products. Our approach to biosimilars reflects our commitment to drive the lowest net cost for our clients while providing members coverage of clinically safe, effective medications and ensuring continuity of care.\nRetail delivered another strong year, outperforming our initial guidance and long-term targets. Revenues for the year grew by more than 6% versus the prior year, and we generated $6.7 billion of adjusted operating income. We finished 2022 with another quarter of strong performance in both the pharmacy and the front store. Pharmacy revenue increased by nearly 8% versus the prior year and delivered another quarter of year-over-year market share gains. Front store revenues grew by nearly 7%, driven by demand for consumer health and cough, cold and flu products.\nWe are making significant progress advancing our strategy, which includes expanding our care delivery and health services capabilities in primary care, home health and provider enablement. Last year, we announced the pending acquisition of Signify Health, which represented an important step forward in our value-based care strategy. Signify will strengthen our presence in the home and enhance our provider enablement capabilities. We now project that this transaction will close in the second quarter of 2023.\nAt our Investor Day in 2021, we shared our vision to deliver a superior health experience for consumers. Central to our strategy is advancing our value-based care platform of capabilities that drive consumer engagement. This morning, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Oak Street Health's outstanding shares for $39 per share in cash, representing a total transaction value of approximately $10.6 billion. The acquisition of Oak Street Health will broaden our value-based care platform into primary care and accelerate our long-term growth.\nPrimary care drives patient engagement and positive clinical outcomes. Although it is a very small proportion of total health spend, just about 10% nationally, it wields significant influence over health care utilization. Individuals who seek routine primary care services report fewer serious medical diagnoses, lower mortality rates and a 33% lower annual health care expense.\nOak Street Health has a proven senior-focused primary care model that is scalable at a national level. Their innovative care model goes beyond typical primary care to provide patients with comprehensive preventative care to support overall health and well-being. With 169 medical centers across 21 states today, we see a significant opportunity to expand in the next few years and provide superior care to many more patients.\nOak Street has a committed and experienced leadership team with extensive care delivery expertise and a best-in-class fully integrated technology solution.\nOak Street's model focuses on providing more coordinated, holistic and connected care. Oak Street physicians spend 3x longer on average with their 159,000 at-risk patients and drive markedly better outcomes. Their approximately 600 providers and 6,000 team members have a proven ability to improve patient outcomes and experiences.\nAt a time when consumers are increasingly frustrated with their experience in the health care system, Oak Street's approach delivers a truly specialized care experience that drives a Net Promoter Score of 90. The quality of this experience is evidenced by the fact that Oak Street was selected to be the trusted primary care partner of AARP and is the only primary care provider to carry the AARP name across all their sites.\nAs part of CVS Health, we believe Oak Street's value-based care model will have a far greater impact on patients. Our unparalleled consumer touch points will expand Oak Street's reach and will allow them to engage with more consumers more frequently and more conveniently. The combination of CVS Health's foundational businesses with Oak Street and Signify Health creates one of the premier multi-payer Medicare value-based care platforms in the marketplace today.\nBut our ambition does not stop there. These Medicare-focused assets complement our established care delivery assets, including our over 1,100 retail health MinuteClinics in a number of ways: Creating convenient access and additional clinical capacity for Oak Street with preventive care and chronic care services for seniors; enhancing access to our broad nurse practitioner workforce; and providing wraparound services tailored to seniors and those with complex conditions, such as medication reconciliation and post-discharge follow-ups. The potential across CVS Health's base of assets is powerful. Together, we will transform the experience for consumers across the country.\nThe Oak Street transaction is financially attractive and enhances our ability to accelerate our sustainable long-term growth. Shawn will provide more details on the financials of the transaction and will discuss the growth and profitability prospects of the Oak Street assets.\nAt the close of the transaction, Mike Pykosz will continue to lead Oak Street within CVS Health. Mike, we're so excited to welcome you and your team to CVS Health at the close of this transaction.\nMike, would you like to say a few words?\n\nMichael T. Pykosz\n\nCEO & Chairman, Oak Street Health, Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our mission at Oak Street Health is to rebuild health care as it should be. When we started Oak Street, we set out to address the root causes of high-cost, low-quality care and poor experiences for Medicare patients. 10 years into that journey, as we continue to drive our national expansion and look to impact more patients and communities, we could not have found a partner more aligned to our mission than CVS Health.\nAt Oak Street Health, we operated a network of primary care centers who specialized in care for older adults. We focus on areas with large concentrations of medical-eligible patients with incomes below 300% of the federal poverty line, areas where we can make the biggest impact.\nWe created our innovative models from the ground up and focus on ensuring our patients receive the right care upfront, improving their experiences and keeping them healthy and out of the hospital. This proven and naturally scalable model benefits patients, providers and payers while improving health outcomes, lowering medical costs and delivering a better patient experience.\nThis focus has generated meaningful results for our patients, including reducing hospital admissions by over 50% and lowering 30-day readmissions by 42%. By providing coordinated holistic care, we can close care gaps and address social determinants of health, delivering 5-star HEDIS performance.\nOur track record shows that we've been able to deliver consistent performance across different populations and geographies. And while our primary focus is Medicare managed at-risk patients, we've also demonstrated our care model can work outside MA.\nFor example, in 2021, we participated in the Medicare direct contracting program, where we took on full risk on traditional Medicare patients. Among all the participants in the program, we generated savings that were 2x higher than any other multistage direct contract center, and we were ranked #1 in net dollars saved. These results show that, even amongst the most innovative groups of this new program, our capabilities and results stood out.\nBy joining CVS Health's ecosystem, we will accelerate our journey to improve patient outcomes and experiences while largely continuing to invest in both our innovative care model and invest in what we believe is the best team in health care. The expansive consumer touch points of CVS Health virtually and in the community, including the trusted CVS pharmacists, will broaden and deepen our connections with the patients under our care.\nAt Oak Street, we have talked about the massive market opportunity for companies that can address the huge challenges in health care. CVS Health is in a unique position to deliver market-leading health solutions. The breadth of their offerings and proven the ability to scale assets will significantly enhance our ability to tackle these challenges. We believe this transaction is a great outcome for all of our stakeholders, including our patients, all of our payer partners, our team of Oakies and our shareholders.\nWith that, let me turn it back to Karen.\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Mike. CVS Health delivered strong financial results in 2022, and we are entering 2023 with tremendous momentum. We continue to make progress on our strategy and will enhance the capabilities of our value-based care platform through the Oak Street Health and Signify Health acquisitions. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us.\nI'll now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our results, our 2023 outlook and the Oak Street transaction. Shawn?\n\nShawn Michael Guertin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. I will first take some time to detail our results and 2023 guidance before discussing this morning's announcement of the Oak Street transaction.\nOur fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of our excellent performance from each of our core business segments as we exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share.\nA few highlights regarding total company performance. Total fourth quarter revenues of $83.8 billion increased by 9.5% year-over-year, reflecting growth at or above internal expectations for each of our foundational businesses. We reported fourth quarter adjusted operating income of $4 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.99.\nFor full year 2022, we reported total revenue of $322.5 billion, an increase of 10.4%, with solid growth across each of our foundational businesses. This led to a full year adjusted EPS of $8.69, representing an increase of 9.7% off our 2021 adjusted EPS baseline of $7.92. And importantly, CVS Health's ability to generate cash remains strong. For full year 2022, we generated $16.2 billion in cash flow from operations.\nLooking at performance by business segment. Health Care Benefits delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus the prior year. Fourth quarter revenue of $23 billion increased by 11.3% year-over-year. We grew membership by 548,000 lives in 2022, driven by strong growth in our commercial and Medicare businesses, offsetting the divestiture of a portion of our Aetna International business earlier this year and a decline in Medicaid membership due to a previously disclosed contract loss.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 86% improved 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating income of $858 million grew 68.2% year-over-year. Both of these measures were driven by the net favorable impact of COVID-19 compared to the prior year and strong underlying performance, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the flu. Outside of an elevated flu season, medical costs remain in line with expectations, as has been the case throughout 2022. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 52.5, up 3.4 days versus the prior year. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities and excellent customer service levels continue to drive growth. During the fourth quarter, revenue of $43.7 billion increased by 11.2% year-over-year, driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by continued client price improvements.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.1% above the prior year and 4.6% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to net new business; increased utilization; and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season. Adjusted operating income of $2 billion grew 9% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of the company's group purchasing organization, partially offset by continued client price improvements.\nIn our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue growth despite mixed COVID-related trends and continued economic uncertainty. Specifically, during the fourth quarter, revenue of $28.2 billion grew 4%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume; including the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season; pharmacy drug mix; and brand inflation. These items were partially offset by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, the impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.8 billion declined 25.1% versus prior year, but was largely in line with internal expectations, driven by decreased COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities, including the vast majority of a discretionary bonus payment to frontline colleagues. These decreases were partially offset by increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing.\nPharmacy prescription volume grew 0.8% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization and the impact of an elevated cough, cold and flu season, partially offset by decreases in COVID-19 vaccinations. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 4% year-over-year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. We ended the year with approximately $5.4 billion of cash at the parent or unrestricted subsidiaries and an adjusted net debt to EBITDA of about 2.9x. Excluding the adjustment for cash at the parent or unrestricted subsidiaries, our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA is approximately 3.1x.\nThrough our quarterly dividend, we returned $719 million to shareholders and repurchased $1.5 billion of our common stock in the fourth quarter. We also entered into a $2 billion fixed-dollar accelerated share repurchase transaction which became effective on January 3, 2023.\nA few other items worth highlighting for investors. We continue to experience the impact of market volatility on our investment portfolio and recorded net realized capital losses of approximately $37 million in the quarter. We recorded $117 million of office real estate optimization charges in the quarter related to the reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to our new flexible work arrangement. We also recognized a $250 million gain related to the sale of our bswift business in November. And we recorded $99 million of incremental charges related to opioid litigation to address the final terms and other implications of the global settlement executed in December.\nShifting to our outlook for 2023. We expect revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and we are reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.70 to $8.90. We believe this range is prudent at this stage in the year and reflects approximately 5% to 8% growth versus our 2022 adjusted EPS baseline of $8.25. We detailed the adjustments reflected in our 2022 baseline in the earnings materials posted on our IR website.\nI want to point out 3 things on our 2023 adjusted EPS guidance. First, consistent with past practice, our projections do not assume the recurrence of prior year reserve development. Second, these projections do not include a specific provision for our pending Signify transaction, which is expected to close in the second quarter of this year, but which we project will have a small impact on 2023 adjusted EPS. And third, I want to remind everyone that, beginning this year, we are shifting to a reporting convention that excludes net realized capital gains and losses from adjusted operating income.\nNow let's turn to some of the segment details. In our Health Care Benefits segment, we expect to see membership growth of 2% to 4% with increased membership in both Medicare and Commercial, partially offset by declines in Medicaid due to the impact of redeterminations in 2023. Overall, we expect to generate revenue growth of 11% to 13%. Our projected medical benefit ratio for 2023 is 84.7%, plus or minus 50 basis points. As I just noted, we do not assume prior year reserve development in our projections. We are providing a cautious outlook for HCB adjusted operating income, expecting growth in a range of about 2% to 4% and reflecting a prudent assumption regarding the performance of our individual exchange business, lower individual MA enrollment and investments in our Stars Improvement initiatives.\nMoving to our Pharmacy Services segment. We expect revenue in a range from 1% to 2% growth, driven by a successful 2023 selling season and strong retention, partially offset by lower Medicaid volume. For the full year 2023, we expect pharmacy claims to range from flat to growth of 1%. Overall, we expect these results to generate adjusted operating income growth of 4% to 5%.\nFinally, shifting to our Retail/LTC segment. As we discussed previously, this segment will be burdened by the lower contribution from COVID as we transition into the endemic stage as well as continued reimbursement pressure in the pharmacy. We expect revenue growth of 1% to 3% and prescription growth of 2% to 4% despite continuing decreases of COVID-19 vaccines. Overall, for the Retail/LTC segment, we expect 2023 adjusted operating income to decline from 2022 to between $5.95 billion and $6.05 billion.\nFor items below adjusted operating income, we expect our interest expense for 2023 to be approximately $2.23 billion. Our tax rate is expected to be approximately 25.5%.\nI want to make a few comments as you think about the cadence of our earnings throughout the year as Retail returns to earnings seasonality more aligned to pre-pandemic patterns. We are currently projecting the lowest contribution to earnings in the first quarter of the year. The remaining 3 quarters will be relatively consistent with slightly more than half of our earnings coming in the second half of the year.\nShifting to shares. We expect our diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 1.298 billion, reflecting the impact of both our fourth quarter 2022 repurchase activity as well as the accelerated share repurchase that is currently underway.\nWe anticipate another strong year of cash generation. We expect cash flow from operations of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion.\nTurning to the Oak Street transaction. We committed to investors that we would be diligent when deploying our capital, seeking assets with the best technology, capabilities and cultural alignment to our vision. After a thorough and robust review of the market, Oak Street was the primary care asset that proved to be the most strategically and financially compelling. Oak Street will operate as a payer-agnostic business within CVS Health, focused on improving outcomes and experiences for the Medicare populations it serves. CVS Health has a strong and proven track record of helping its payer clients succeed, and we will continue to prioritize that success after this transaction.\nWhat we saw when we looked into Oak Street's portfolio of clinics was a remarkably consistent path to clinic profitability. This trend was true across diverse geographies, populations and payers. As Oak Street drives strong patient experiences and engagement, their patient panels grow. And as Oak Street's providers engage with those patients, they improve outcomes and increase patient contributions over time. These 2 factors combine to drive clinics to maturity, achieving profitability within the first 3 years and unlocking annual adjusted EBITDA potential of approximately $7 million per clinic using Oak Street's definition of adjusted EBITDA. Within the 169 clinics Oak Street has today, we have high visibility into embedded adjusted EBITDA of over $1 billion.\nWe also recognize the tremendous opportunity to scale Oak Street's clinics to reach more seniors across the nation. At their current rate of expansion, we expect Oak Street to have over 300 clinics by 2026, at which point, we project they will have more than $2 billion of embedded Oak Street adjusted EBITDA.\nShifting to synergies. We envisioned 5 main opportunities to realize more than $500 million of value over time: One, accelerating Oak Street patient growth through CVS Health channels; two, improving Oak Street's economics through integration with our broad portfolio of assets; three, improving the retention of our Aetna MA members through the improved outcomes and experience provided at Oak Street clinics; four, driving greater utilization of CVS Pharmacy and Caremark capabilities; and five, capturing modest savings from external public company and lease costs.\nWe project that our investment in Oak Street will drive double-digit returns on invested capital over time as clinics mature and synergies are realized. We are committed to exploring additional avenues to further accelerate growth, synergy realization and returns from this transaction while balancing further near-term dilution to our EPS trajectory.\nAs stated in our press release, this transaction will be funded with available resources and existing financing capacity, and we remain committed to maintaining our current investment-grade rating. The transaction is subject to approval by Oak Street's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. We expect this transaction to close in 2023.\nWe are now targeting 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9, growing to approximately $10 in 2025 with the potential for upside in 2025 based on the successful resolution of our Medicare Star ratings mitigation efforts. The 2024 and 2025 adjusted EPS trajectories reflect the impact of the previously disclosed 2024 Medicare Star ratings headwind and Centene contract loss, closing of the Oak Street Health transaction in 2023, as well as projected contributions from the Signify Health transaction in 2024 and beyond. Consistent with past practice, CVS Health expects to exclude integration and transaction costs from its adjusted EPS presentation.\nWith the close of these transactions, we expect that our adjusted debt-to-EBITDA will peak in the mid-3x level in 2024, well within leverage ranges aligned to our current investment-grade rating. Our current projections assume modest discretionary repurchase activity in 2024. This is consistent with our 2021 Investor Day projections, which contemplated 1% to 2% adjusted EPS growth from repurchases in addition to offsetting dilution. As leverage begins to subside in 2025, we will have potential for additional repurchases.\nIn summary, we are excited to announce the acquisition of Oak Street and to incorporate them into our expanding portfolio of capabilities. Oak Street's best-in-class clinics will serve as the focal point of high-quality care for seniors across America. The strategic rationale for this combination is sound and the growth opportunity is vast.\nTogether, CVS Health's foundational businesses, Signify's home assessment and provider enablement capabilities and Oak Street's clinics and care model, create the premier multipayer Medicare value-based care platform. We could not be more pleased to join with Oak Street as we take the next step in our journey to build a differentiated health services organization and transform how care is delivered.\nTo conclude, we delivered excellent performance in 2022, creating strong momentum as we continue to execute our strategy in 2023. We are building on our achievements, expanding our portfolio of capabilities and continuing on our path to become the leading health care solution company.\nWith that, we will now open the line for your questions.

I would now like to turn the call over to Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. Please go ahead.\n\nLarry McGrath\n\nSVP of Business Development & IR, CVS Health Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CVS Health Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Larry McGrath, Senior Vice President of Business Development and Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nFollowing our prepared remarks, we'll host a question-and-answer session that will include Dr. Alan Lotvin, President, Pharmacy Services; Daniel Finke, President Healthcare Benefits; Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer and Retail Co-President; and Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer and Retail Co-President.\nOur press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC. Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, reflecting current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions, including impacts related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections and the benefits of the proposed acquisition of Signify Health, Inc. and the associated integration plan, expected synergies and revenue opportunities.\nOur forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from currently projected results, including, with respect to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and the proposed acquisition and the integration of Signify Health.

Karen?\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. CVS Health delivered another outstanding quarter. Based on our strategic progress and confidence in our execution, we are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance for the third consecutive time this year to a range of $8.55 to $8.65.\nDuring the third quarter, we grew revenue by 10% versus the prior year to over $81 billion and grew adjusted operating income by nearly 4% over the prior year to $4.2 billion. Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter was $2.09, an increase of over 6% from the prior year.\nOur cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion in the third quarter and $18.1 billion, year-to-date. Throughout 2022, we've consistently executed on our strategy, centered around expanding our capabilities in health care delivery. We are increasingly delivering broader access to quality care, simpler journeys and better outcomes at lower costs across our channels.\nWith the announced acquisition of Signify Health, we will strengthen our engagement with consumers. We will add best-in-class capabilities that enable in-home services and care coordination as well as a platform to accelerate value-based physician enablement. Together, we will have a strong foundation for developing new product offerings, consistent with our payer-agnostic approach. We project that this transaction will close in the first half of 2023.\nWe continually evaluate our portfolio of assets for nonstrategic areas that do not fit our long-term priorities. In October, we reached an agreement to sell bswift, and are actively exploring strategic alternatives for Omnicare. As we divest assets, we will continue to invest in areas aligned with our strategy with a disciplined approach to capital allocation.\nThis morning, we made an important announcement on our ongoing opioid legal matter. In late October, we began a mediation to resolve substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against CVS Health by state, political subdivisions and tribe. We reached an, agreement in principle, to pay approximately $5 billion over 10 years beginning in 2023, an outcome that is in the best interest of all parties and one that will help put a decades old issue behind us, as we continue to focus on delivering a superior health experience for the millions of consumers who rely on us.\nLet's turn to each of our foundational businesses and discuss their strong results. The Health Care Benefits segment had another strong quarter. Revenues for this segment grew nearly 10% year-over-year with adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion. Our medical benefit ratio of 83.5% improved by 230 basis points versus the prior year, driven by a lower impact from COVID and medical cost trends that remained favorable.\nEnrollment in our Medicare and Commercial businesses was strong this quarter with our individual Medicare Advantage and PDP portfolio, exceeding market growth once again. The 2023 Medicare annual enrollment period is underway and we are well positioned for another year of growth in our individual Medicare and dual-eligible products. We remain a leader in offering $0 premium plans with more than 73% of our plans in that category.\nWe also continued our geographic expansion in the D-SNP market and now offer plans to 61% of D-SNP eligible population of more than 8%, year-over-year. We were disappointed that the star rating on our national PPO contracts fell to 3.5 star after nearly a decade-long track record of performing at 4 stars or better. We have a strong history of delivering affordable, high-quality plan benefits and a commitment to continuous improvement.\nImproving our star performance continues to be a top priority for the company. We have the right actions in place to improve our star ratings with our ongoing quality and experience efforts as we address the specific measures scored on the member surveys that contribute to star ratings.\nWe will continue to focus on our members and invest in programs and processes, specifically designed to simplify and improve their health care experience. This is an important priority for the company.\nIn our commercial business, our growth is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs and services that utilize CVS Health platforms and capabilities. We achieved a key milestone this quarter with more than 2 million members enrolled in our integrated Aetna and Caremark product. This important goal demonstrates the value we provide our customers through our combined CVS Health offerings, a strong proof point of our strategy.\nTurning to our ACA individual exchange platform. We expanded our footprint and will be available in a total of 12 states, beginning in January of 2023, covering 5.5 million lives or nearly 40% of the individual exchange population. Our co-branded product offerings include instant access to providers with 24/7 virtual care and face-to-face access in our MinuteClinic locations.\nWe are committed to helping provide access to affordable care for all Americans. Finally, our Medicaid platform continues to be an important area for growth. We grew our Ohio-RISE program after a successful implementation and have been chosen by the State of Louisiana to serve a portion of their Medicaid-eligible children due to the deep expertise we've built to engage and support children, their caregivers and their families.\nWe've expanded our capabilities with a focus on quality and member engagement through our CVS Health community channels, as we enter a robust bid period. In Pharmacy Services, our revenue grew nearly 11% with adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion. Specialty Pharmacy revenue grew 22% year-over-year, driven by our industry-leading cost management and service excellence that continue to differentiate us in the marketplace. We closed out another successful selling season, driving $3.5 billion of gross new business for 2023 and a client retention rate of nearly 98%, evidence of the strength of our portfolio of capabilities.\nEfforts are underway to support a successful welcome season for our members. Last week, we learned that Centene decided to move their business to a competitor in 2024. While we hope to continue our relationship with Centene and bid to do so, we also maintained our pricing discipline. For the remainder of the contract, we will work with Centene to facilitate a seamless transition for members.\nEven after moving this contract, our purchasing power and our ability to drive value for our customers will not be diminished. Our demonstrated success in growing lives under management and revenue is a testament to our high-quality service, compliance capabilities and specialty pharmacy excellence.\nOur Pharmacy Services segment will remain an important driver of growth within CDSL in the years to come. Our Retail/Long-Term Care segment also continues to outperform expectations. Revenues in the quarter grew nearly 7% versus the prior year with $1.4 billion in adjusted operating income. Performance in both the front store and pharmacy was strong. Front store sales were up approximately 4%, driven by growth across the majority of our categories. Demand for COVID vaccines and over-the-counter test as well as cough, cold and flu products remain high.\nIn pharmacy, scripts grew 1.8% year-over-year in the third quarter or 3.6%, excluding COVID vaccines. This growth helped propel our retail pharmacy business to another quarter of year-over-year market share gains, extending a trend that started in the first quarter of 2020. Our community retail health destinations play a strengthening role in the overall well-being of the consumers we serve. As demand for health products and services continues to be elevated, we are implementing new digital capabilities that provide a seamless and convenient consumer experience.\nNow, most of our pharmacists are empowered to prescribe tax -- COVID antiviral treatment. Our investments in omnichannel health are enhancing transparency and helping consumers better manage their overall health. While there is growing economic uncertainty and recession expectations in 2023, we are well positioned across our foundational businesses to manage through these potential headwinds. We are increasingly delivering connected experiences and health solutions that improve overall well-being.\nMore and more, we are there for every meaningful moment of our consumers' health. Throughout 2022, we made significant progress advancing our strategy. building a strong foundation for health care delivery and expanding our health service offerings and developing new products.\nIn October, we announced that Dr. Amar Desai has joined CVS Health to lead our health care delivery strategy. Dr. Desai's experience in transforming the health care system and driving value-based care will accelerate our vision of becoming the leading health solutions company and our efforts to improve health care for consumers.\n2022 has also been an important year for growing our digital presence and capabilities. This quarter, we added another approximately 1 million digital customers. CVS Health now serves more than 46 million unique digital customers, an impressive 11 million more, since this time last year. Our digitally-led omnichannel health approach prioritizes experience that matter most for consumers. This includes advancing our digital tools for a seamless and convenient experience, leading to higher engagement and satisfaction.\nFor example, we recently launched a new functionality that drives more choice and convenience for patients filling prescriptions. Patients can expedite urgent prescriptions have visibility into out-of-pocket costs and track their order status, all before even coming in to our pharmacy. We continue to make strong progress on ESG. For example, we are working to decrease disparities with our focus on women's health, as it relates to accessing quality and convenient health care.\nAs part of our Here for Her initiative, we are launching a variety of new MinuteClinic virtual care services to support women's health that will be available 24/7.\nAnd finally, I want to take this opportunity to, again, thank our CVS Health colleagues, especially those in Florida and Puerto Rico, who faced natural disasters. Our teams pulled together to ensure care continuity for our customers and the communities that we serve.\nI will now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational and financial results and outlook.\n\nShawn Michael Guertin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance observed in the first half of 2022 as we exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share. This momentum allows us to again raise our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.55 to $8.65 per share.\nA few highlights regarding overall company performance. Third quarter revenues of over $81 billion increased by 10% year-over-year, reflecting robust growth across each of our operating segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.2 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.09, representing increases of 3.9% and 6.1% versus prior year, respectively.\nOur ability to generate cash remains strong. Our cash flow from operations was $9.1 billion in the third quarter and $18.1 billion year-to-date. Cash flows in the quarter benefited from the timing of CMS payments that are expected to normalize in the fourth quarter. Looking at performance by business segment. In Health Care Benefits, we delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus the prior year. Third quarter revenue of $22.5 billion, increased by nearly 10% over the prior year quarter. Membership grew 2.5% year-over-year despite the divestiture of 283,000 lives from Aetna International earlier this year.\nOur Medicare franchise remains a strong growth opportunity for us, adding 75,000 members sequentially across our portfolio of solutions for individuals and employers. Underlying growth in our commercial business also remains strong.\nWe are excited about the prospects of our individual exchange business, which now includes 12 states as of January 1, 2023. The sequential decline in Medicaid membership is driven by a previously disclosed contract loss, partially offset by the ongoing suspension of redeterminations.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.5 billion increased 39.6% year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher COVID costs in third quarter 2021. COVID pricing actions we took this year and strong underlying performance, partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business and net realized investment portfolio losses. Our medical benefit ratio of 83.5% improved 230 basis points year-over-year, reflecting lower impact from COVID and medical cost trends that remain modestly favorable to our pricing assumptions.\nConsistent with last quarter, medical cost trends in our commercial business remain generally in line with pre-pandemic-trended baselines and government remains slightly lower than the pre-pandemic-trended baselines. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 54.9, up 0.6 days sequentially as reserves grew at a modestly higher rate than premiums. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities and outstanding customer service levels continue to drive growth. During the third quarter, revenue of over $43 billion increased by nearly 11% year-over-year, driven by pharmacy claims growth, specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.\nTotal pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.6%, above prior year, and 4.5% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to new business in 2022 and increased utilization. Total pharmacy membership remains steady, exceeding 110 million members as growth in commercial and government lives helped to offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.9 billion grew nearly 6% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, including increased contributions from the products and services of our group purchasing organization. This was partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements. Quarterly contribution from our 340B product lines improved in the third quarter, in line with our estimates, as covered entities addressed manufacturer conditions for program participation.\nIn our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue growth and adjusted operating income above our expectations despite mixed COVID-related trends and continued economic uncertainty. Specifically, during the third quarter, revenue of $26.7 billion grew nearly 7%, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including the sale of COVID-19 over-the-counter test kits as well as pharmacy drug mix and brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in COVID-19 diagnostic testing and vaccinations.\nThe impact of recent generic introductions and continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. Adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion declined 18.9% versus prior year, driven by decreased COVID-19 diagnostic testing in vaccinations, continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure as well as increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities. These decreases were partially offset by the increased prescription and front store volume, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives.\nPharmacy prescription volume grew 1.8% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization. Excluding the impact of COVID, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 3.6% year-over-year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained excellent. Year-to-date, we generated cash flow from operations of $18.1 billion, and ended the quarter with $7.9 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. Cash flows during the quarter were positively impacted by the early receipt of $3.2 billion of CMS payments which will normalize in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we repaid $2.6 billion of long-term debt. Through our quarterly dividend, we returned $726 million to shareholders.\nWe remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A. A few other items worth highlighting for investors. We continue to experience the impact of market volatility on our investment portfolio and recorded net realized capital losses of approximately $110 million in the quarter. These losses emerged predominantly in the HCB segment.\nWe were not immune to the impacts of Hurricane Ian and recorded losses of approximately $40 million related to damages from the storm. We recorded a pretax loss on assets held for sale of $2.5 billion related to the write-down of our long-term care business, Omnicare, where we are in the process of exploring strategic alternatives.\nWe also recorded pretax charges of $5.2 billion for legal settlements related to agreements in principle with certain states and governmental entities to resolve opioid claims. Consistent with past practice, these GAAP impacts have been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics.\nTurning to our 2022 outlook. We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.10 to a range of $8.55 to $8.65. This increase reflects favorable underlying third quarter performance in retail and HCB, an improved Q4 outlook for the retail LTC segment and slight improvement in the full year outlook for tax rate and share count, partially offset by the anticipated impact of market volatility on net investment income for the HCB business.\nWe are narrowing our full year adjusted operating income guidance in health care benefits to a range of $5.96 billion to $6.02 billion. This reflects the previously discussed strong underlying fundamental performance, offset by continued caution on our outlook for investment income given the volatile rate environment.\nOur outlook also contemplates the extension of the public health emergency into the early part of the first quarter of 2023. For the retail LTC segment, we are raising and narrowing full year guidance as follows: revenue increases to a range of $102.7 billion to $104.0 billion; adjusted operating income guidance increases by $105 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.66 billion to $6.72 billion. We now forecast that we will administer 28 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022 with approximately 70% already administered through the third quarter of 2022. We expect full year diagnostic testing volumes of approximately 17 million, which is down from our prior outlook.\nHowever, we now expect higher sales of over-the-counter test kits, exceeding 65 million units or nearly triple the number of kits sold last year. In aggregate, we expect these 3 categories of COVID-driven items to continue to produce over $3 billion of revenue in 2022, a decline of approximately 29% versus 2021, but reflective of the endemic tail of COVID on our retail business.\nOur updated outlook also contemplates higher levels of investment spending in the fourth quarter as we continue to invest in our workforce and enhance our customer experience. In Pharmacy Services, we are narrowing our outlook range and now project full year adjusted operating income guidance to be between $7.31 billion to $7.40 billion.\nLooking at the enterprise as a whole, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022 and have raised our guidance accordingly to a range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, with capital expenditures unchanged at a range of $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion. We are also updating our guidance on share count to a range of 1.325 billion to 1.33 billion shares and on our effective tax rate to 25.5%.\nAs Karen noted earlier, we have reached an agreement, in principle, to resolve substantially all opioid lawsuits and claims against CVS Health, providing increased clarity regarding this long-standing issue. The agreement amount to be paid is approximately $5 billion and will be paid over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The timing of cash settlement payments spread over multiple years results in an annual impact to our cash flows that enables us to continue to invest in our strategic priorities.\nWhile we will offer detailed 2023 guidance on our fourth quarter call in early February, I wanted to offer some high-level commentary as investors think through our potential financial performance in 2023. We need to consider several factors as we determine the 2022 baseline.\nFirst, prior year reserve development improved our year-to-date 2022 adjusted operating income by over $217 million or approximately $0.12 of adjusted earnings per share, and we do not forecast prior year reserve development to recur in future periods. Second, due to the turbulent rate environment, we have experienced unanticipated headwinds in our net investment income in 2022.\nAs we look at the full year, these headwinds could exceed $350 million or over $0.20 in adjusted EPS. In 2023, we plan to use a reporting convention that excludes capital gains and losses from adjusted operating income, consistent with how Aetna, which bears the vast majority of these impacts, reported these items prior to the acquisition.\nThird, in the second quarter of 2022, we strengthened reserves in our legacy Aetna Long Term Care insurance business, which reduced adjusted operating income by $108 million or approximately $0.06 per share. This adjustment was the first time we significantly adjusted this reserve since the Aetna acquisition, and we do not currently project we will need to make additional adjustments to this reserve in 2023.\nFourth, we have made great progress this year in rationalizing our portfolio to focus on those businesses that will drive the highest growth for our enterprise over the long term. While none of these divestitures, which include Payflex, bswift and portions of our Aetna International business are material on their own. Collectively, they present a 2023 headwind of approximately $0.04 in adjusted EPS.\nIn addition to those specific adjustments, we are projecting that our Retail LTC segment will have over $3 billion of revenues in 2022 from COVID, which have a robust margin profile. It is not prudent to anticipate a similar level of COVID-based revenues going forward. And we expect that the economics on vaccines and diagnostic testing will change, following expiration of the public health emergency which we project will happen in the early part of the first quarter of 2023.\nAs detailed in our third quarter slide presentation, starting with the midpoint of our updated adjusted EPS guidance range of $8.60 and adjusting for these items creates a 2022 baseline of approximately $8.20. Shifting to our view on 2023, there are a number of headwinds and tailwinds that we are contemplating, as we develop our outlook. In our retail business, we plan to continue to offset reimbursement pressure and wage improvements with continued script growth and purchasing improvements as well as front store growth and benefits from our store footprint optimization efforts.\nWe remain committed to generating at least $6 billion of adjusted operating income in this segment in 2023, consistent with the targets we outlined at our Investor Day in December of 2021.\nIn PSS, we are targeting mid-single-digit growth over our baseline. New sales wins and growth in specialty generic and biosimilar launches will help drive this result, combined with stabilization of 340B dynamic and a continued focus on efficiencies. In Health Care Benefits, we will continue to target mid- to high single-digit growth.\nThe strength of our Medicare Advantage offering in 2023 and continued membership growth, including in individual and group Medicare will help to offset losses from Medicaid redeterminations and our divested assets to drive topline growth. Continued disciplined pricing and efficiencies will help to drive adjusted operating income growth.\nCapital deployment remains an important part of our growth equation, and we expect to repurchase shares in 2023 opportunistically to ensure we achieve our targets and to offset dilution. Our preliminary outlook does not include any impact from the announced acquisition of Signify Health, which we continued to project, will close in the first half of 2023 and be accretive to adjusted EPS.\nTaking all these factors into consideration, our initial goal in 2023 is to grow our adjusted EPS to a range of $8.70 to $8.90. At the midpoint, this range is consistent with the high single-digit outlook we provided at our Investor Day last December. Before we conclude, I want to discuss the recent 2024 Medicare STARs updates. We are very disappointed with our Medicare STARs results for 2024, but remain dedicated to providing our Medicare Advantage members with the high quality and service that they have come to expect. We also remain committed to maintaining a competitive product and benefits offering in 2024 and to continue to grow Medicare Advantage membership throughout this period.\nThe change in star ratings is not projected to impact our 2022 guidance, and we expect to be able to manage the impacts to 2023, including cost to improve our 2024 star ratings. Our intent is to mitigate some of the financial impact of lower STARs ratings in 2024 through our ongoing contract diversification efforts combined with a variety of operational initiatives as we work to find additional efficiencies.\nEven if successful, given the magnitude of this headwind, it is appropriate to assume that these efforts alone, while potentially significant, will not close the entire GAAP. The recently announced loss of the Centene contract places further pressure on our 2024 outlook. Importantly, and to be absolutely clear, the powerful capital generation capabilities of our enterprise provide us with financial capacity to increase share repurchase in excess of the $8 billion of our remaining authorization and produce adjusted EPS, consistent with our 2021 Investor Day outlook, which had implied adjusted EPS in the range of $9.75 to $9.95 in 2024.\nWhile this would achieve a 2024 EPS objective, repurchasing shares alone will not advance the strategic positioning of the company. Alternatively, strategic capital deployment may not yield the same adjusted EPS accretion in 2024 as share repurchases, but could further advance our care delivery strategy and help sustainably accelerate the adjusted EPS growth rate of CVS Health.\nAbsent deploying capital towards further strategic acquisitions Investors should expect that we will deploy capital towards share repurchases to address our 2024 earnings headwinds. We remain committed to using our liquidity to help achieve both our long-term and near-term goals.\nTo conclude, our third quarter results reflect continued strength from all our core business segments, and we are pleased to raise our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance. Our focus on growth and operational execution persists and we continue to progress on our long-term strategy. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator?",

Karen?\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Larry, and welcome to the team. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. CVS Health delivered another outstanding quarter. We grew revenue by 11% versus the prior year to over $80 billion with strong results across all business segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.8 billion and generated adjusted earnings per share of $2.40.\nThis morning, we raised our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance range to $8.40 to $8.60, an increase of $0.20. We are also increasing our full year outlook for cash flow from operations to $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion. These guidance increases reflect the continued positive momentum across all of our businesses.\nWe remain well positioned and confident in our ability to achieve our near-term and longer-term growth goals. Our increasingly integrated foundational businesses delivered exceptional results for the quarter. The Health Care Benefits segment had a strong quarter with revenue growth of nearly 11% year-over-year. We achieved adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 82.9% improved by 120 basis points versus the prior year as medical cost trends remained favorable. We generated membership growth across all product lines versus the prior year. These results reflect the end-to-end value of our assets, increasingly working together 1 customer at a time at national scale.\nOur Medicare business remains one of our strongest growth segments, and we increased membership year-over-year across all Medicare products. Our individual Medicare Advantage membership continues to grow at a double-digit pace and faster than the overall market.\nThis quarter, we achieved a major milestone with more than 2 million individual Medicare Advantage members, including dual eligibles. Our PDP portfolio also maintains its momentum with healthy growth that is well ahead of industry trends, providing us future conversion and upsell opportunities.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we're maintaining a nearly 98% client retention rate in national accounts. Additionally, we are having a successful group Medicare Advantage selling season and expect to show positive membership growth next year. As we continue to build our individual exchange business, we're on track to expand coverage where we currently have individual exchange offerings, and are obtaining final approval to add 4 new states to our portfolio, bringing our total to 12 states.\nIn Pharmacy Services, revenue grew nearly 12% compared to the prior year and delivered adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion. Specialty pharmacy revenue is up nearly 21% year-over-year. We are a leader in specialty pharmacy with programs that drive value in the marketplace, provide substantive savings to customers and differentiate us as we pair programs with digital assets.\nLooking ahead, we're maintaining a 98% client retention rate for the 2023 selling season with more than 75% of renewals complete. We drove $3.1 billion of growth new business, providing evidence of our market-leading trend management, transparency and integrated offerings.\nTurning to our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we continued our momentum from the first quarter. Our deep customer relationships, high-quality patient interactions, resilient supply chain and agile operating model all contributed to the strong quarterly performance.\nNearly 4.8 million customers engage with us every day at CVS locations, making us a powerful community health destination. In the quarter, we delivered over 6% revenue growth versus the prior year and $1.9 billion in adjusted operating income. Our front store sales grew more than 9%, driven by strength in consumer health sales, including strong COVID over-the-counter tests and sales of cough, cold and flu products.\nOur pharmacy grew prescriptions 1.6% or 4.6% excluding the impact of the COVID-19 vaccination, which declined versus the prior year. Our retail script growth trend is remarkable as we have consistently increased market share year-over-year since the first quarter of 2020. As COVID-19 continues to move towards an endemic phase, we will continue to play a critical role in communities across the country. Millions of Americans depend on us for COVID-19 testing, vaccine administration and dispensing antiviral medications for treatment.\nWe administered more than 4 million COVID-19 tests and approximately 6 million COVID-19 vaccinations nationwide in the second quarter. The demand for antiviral medications to treat COVID-19 continues to increase as the national positivity rate remains in the double digits.\nOverall, we continue to successfully navigate a challenging retail environment while expanding services and increasing share of wallet by bringing new customers to CVS Health. Of the approximately 43 million new customers who have chosen CVS Health for COVID-19 health services, nearly 15% have engaged us for additional services.\nOur omnichannel approach connects consumer health experiences, driving high satisfaction levels and continuously enabling CVS Health to attract and retain customers. Our leadership on this omnichannel experience is a competitive advantage, and one we are committed to investing in enhancing over time.\nTurning to our strategic imperatives. Let me give you a few updates. We are a leading provider of retail health services nationally, and we continue to advance our care delivery capabilities. Our CVS Health care teams in our MinuteClinics have supported more than 2.8 million patient visits year-to-date, representing a 12% increase from the prior year. We are further enhancing our services and making them more relevant for our customers. We are working closely with the administration offering the test to treat program in our MinuteClinics and pharmacies and will be implementing pharmacists prescribing under certain conditions to even more seamlessly serve customers with COVID-19.\nThis furthers our strategy to expand access to health services and helps consumers to navigate to the best site of care. As we evaluate complementary health services and care delivery capabilities to enhance our overall portfolio, we continue to take a disciplined approach. Inorganic growth is part of our strategy, and we look forward to updating you on our progress.\nRelative to store optimization, we've closed 198 stores to date and remain on track to close 300 stores this year. We are successfully minimizing disruption to our customers and maintaining high levels of satisfaction as we maintain our store and pharmacy hours across our locations to meet consumer health needs. We are retaining over 70% of prescription volume within our network and have redeployed over 90% of impacted colleagues to our other CVS locations.\nOur technology forward digital-first approach is reducing complexity for our customers and creating new digital health solutions that are convenient. CVS Health now serves more than 45 million unique digital customers, up $1.5 million since last quarter. This increase is driven by our omnichannel pharmacy strategy focused on simplifying how consumers fill and receive prescriptions.\nOver 60% of our newly acquired digital users are customers of our specialty, mail order and retail pharmacies. We are expanding our digital health services and deepening engagement through personalization to drive convenience for customers.\nWe launched our individualized health dashboard earlier this year and already have 6 million active users, up 20% from the prior quarter. As we successfully execute our strategy, our unified health model grows in relevance and importance every day for the consumers, customers and the communities we serve. And you can see this in our results.\nAnd finally, as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability, we entered into an agreement to purchase renewable energy with one of the nation's largest producers of carbon-free energy. This is the latest step on our path to sourcing 50% renewable energy by 2040.\nWe are positioned to continue our momentum through the second half of this year. None of this would be possible without our talented colleagues who serve America's health needs every day. We recently added 2 proven leaders to the executive team. Tilak Mandadi has joined CVS Health as our first Chief Data, Digital and Technology Officer; and Violetta Ostafin has joined CVS Health as our Chief Strategy Officer. Both bring deep unique expertise to our diverse leadership team.\nI will now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational and financial results and our outlook.\n\nShawn Michael Guertin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results reflect the continuation of outstanding performance from each of our core business segments as we exceeded our expectations for revenue, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share. These results are driven by our steadfast focus on growth, operational execution and supporting the communities we serve. This momentum positions us to raise our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.40 to $8.60 per share.\nA few highlights regarding total company performance. Second quarter revenues of $80.6 billion increased by 11% year-over-year, reflecting robust growth across each of our operating segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of $4.8 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.40.\nImportantly, these superb results were produced despite the impact of about $100 million of net realized capital losses inside the quarter, which lowered adjusted EPS performance by $0.06. These net realized capital losses are reported primarily in the HCB segment, but also impact the Retail and Corporate segment results in the second quarter.\nLooking at performance by business segment. In Health Care Benefits, we delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus the prior year. Second quarter revenue of $22.8 billion increased by 10.9% year-over-year. Membership grew 4% year-over-year despite the loss of 266,000 lives from the completed divestiture of Aetna International's business in Thailand. Excluding the divested business, we delivered sequential membership growth of 176,000 members, reflecting growth across all product lines.\nOur Medicare franchise remains a key growth opportunity for us, adding approximately 70,000 members sequentially across our portfolio of solutions for individuals and employers. Excluding the divestiture of our international business in Thailand, we continue to deliver sequential membership growth in our commercial business. We also continue to build out our individual exchange business, which will include 12 states as of January 1, 2023, pending regulatory approval.\nSequential growth in Medicaid membership is largely driven by the ongoing suspension of redeterminations. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 13.4% year-over-year, reflecting improved underlying performance and membership growth, partially offset by incremental investments to support growth in the business and net realized capital losses of $67 million. Our medical benefit ratio of 82.9% improved 120 basis points year-over-year, reflecting medical cost trends that remain modestly favorable to our pricing assumptions.\nConsistent with last quarter, medical cost trends in our commercial business remained generally in line with pre-pandemic trended baselines with government remaining slightly lower than pre-pandemic baselines. Consolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 54.3, up 2.6 days sequentially as reserves grew at a modestly higher rate than premium growth displaying a pattern similar to what we experienced in the second quarter of 2021.\nOverall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. In the Pharmacy Services business, our ability to deliver industry-leading drug trend for our clients, our specialty management capabilities and outstanding customer service levels continue to drive growth.\nDuring the second quarter, revenue of $42.8 billion increased by 11.7% year-over-year, driven by pharmacy claims growth, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements.\nRevenue in Specialty Pharmacy grew nearly 21% versus prior year, reflecting new business wins and pharmacy claims growth. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 3.9% above prior year and 5.7% when excluding COVID-19 vaccinations, primarily attributable to new business in 2022, increased utilization and the impact of an extended cough cold and flu season.\nTotal pharmacy membership grew sequentially, exceeding 110 million members as growth in commercial and government lives more than offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year. Adjusted operating income of $1.9 billion grew 5.7% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics reflecting increased contribution from the products and services of our group purchasing organization and membership growth. These favorable items were partially tempered by ongoing client price improvements as well as $55 million of restructuring and integration costs.\nYear-over-year contributions from our 340B product lines declined inside the quarter, as covered entities were slower to agree to manufacturer conditions than we had previously estimated. In our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, higher-than-projected COVID-related volume combined with strength in pharmacy and front store sales helped to drive strong results.\nSpecifically, during the second quarter, revenue of $26.3 billion grew 6.3% year-over-year, reflecting increased prescription and front store volume, including increased sales of COVID over-the-counter test kits and cough, cold and flu products.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.9 billion declined 9.1% versus prior year, partially due to a $125 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement recognized in the second quarter of 2021, as well as lower COVID-19 vaccine volumes. Additional drivers include strength in pharmacy and front store sales, improved generic drug purchasing and the favorable impact of business initiatives during the quarter. These positive factors were offset by ongoing, but stable reimbursement pressure and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.\nPharmacy prescription volume grew 1.6% year-over-year, reflecting increased utilization in cough, cold and flu volume extending later into the spring. Excluding the impact of COVID, pharmacy prescription volume increased by 4.6% year-over-year.\nTurning to the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remain excellent. Year-to-date, we generated cash flow from operations of $9 billion and ended the quarter with $5.8 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries.\nDuring the quarter, we repaid $1.5 billion of long-term debt. Further, in July, we announced that we will be executing a par call redemption on $1 billion of November 2022 notes. Yesterday, we also announced the par call on all of our notes due in December of 2022 for a combined total amount of $1.65 billion of debt, representing the last of our outstanding maturities for this calendar year.\nThrough our quarterly dividend, we returned $740 million to shareholders. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.\nA few other items worth highlighting for investors. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter was impacted by reserve strengthening of $108 million in our legacy Long-Term Care insurance business. This adjustment, which represented the first time we have significantly adjusted this reserve since the Aetna acquisition, is included in adjusted operating income for our Corporate/Other segment and lowers total company adjusted EPS by $0.06 in the quarter.\nFrom a GAAP reporting perspective, in June, we also completed the previously announced sale of PayFlex, which resulted in a pretax gain of $225 million in our second quarter financials. Consistent with past practice, this gain has been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics.\nTurning to our 2022 outlook. We are raising our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.20 to a range of $8.40 to $8.60. This increase reflects both the second quarter performance and an improved outlook for the retail LTC segment, as well as strong second quarter underwriting results in the HCB segment, tempered by $140 million to $180 million of lower net investment income contributions over the remainder of 2022, given the uncertainty and volatility of the current capital markets. As such, we are maintaining our full year adjusted operating income guidance in health care benefits of $5.94 billion to $6.04 billion. This reflects the aforementioned strong underlying fundamental performance, offset by $110 million to $145 million of lower net investment income contributions over the remainder of 2022 as the vast majority of our net investment income is generated in our Health Care Benefits segment.\nOur updated outlook also contemplates the extension of the public health emergency through the end of 2022. We are raising full year retail LTC guidance as follows: revenue increases to a range of $101 billion to $102.7 billion, adjusted operating income guidance increases by $575 million at the midpoint to a range of $6.54 billion to $6.64 billion. We now forecast that we will administer nearly 20 million COVID-19 vaccinations in 2022, with approximately 75% already administered in the first half of 2022. We expect full year diagnostic testing volumes of approximately 19 million and sales of over-the-counter test kits to more than double compared to prior year, exceeding 50 million units.\nIn aggregate, we expect these 3 categories of COVID-driven items to now produce nearly $3 billion of revenue in 2022, a decline of approximately 33% versus 2021, but indicative of the endemic tail of COVID on our retail business.\nOur updated outlook also includes a provision for higher levels of investment spending in the back half of the year as we prepare for a potential late year increase in COVID cases and includes continued investments in our workforce and to enhance our customer experience.\nIn Pharmacy Services, we now expect to be at the low end of our full year adjusted operating income guidance range of $7.31 billion to $7.45 billion based on the following factors. The continued strength from our core capabilities, including purchasing economics and strong network volumes where we have increased the midpoint of our range by 50 million scripts; being pressured by the restructuring and integration costs I previously mentioned; and a reduced outlook for our 340B business, resulting in a contribution that will be down compared to prior year.\nLooking at the enterprise as a whole, due to our sustained operating momentum, we anticipate continued strong cash from operations in 2022 and have raised our guidance to a range of $12.5 billion to $13.5 billion, with capital expenditures unchanged at a range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion. We are raising our full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance from 25.6% to 25.7%, primarily a result of the discussed changes to our investment income outlook.\nAnd finally, as we evaluate the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we continue to remind investors that we project that earnings per share will be fairly evenly split between the third and the fourth quarters. All other guidance shared during our first quarter earnings call remains unchanged. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance and the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.\nTo conclude, our second quarter results reflect continued strength from all of our core business segments, and we are pleased to raise our full year 2022 adjusted EPS guidance. Our focus on growth and operational execution continues, and we continue to progress on our long-term strategy. We remain committed to the EPS targets implicit in our long-term model, including as we look to 2023.\nWe will now open the call to your questions. Operator?",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Cowhey\n\nSVP of Capital Markets, CVS Health Corporation\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the CVS Health First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call and Webcast. I'm Tom Cowhey, Senior Vice President of Capital Markets for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include Jon Roberts, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Dr. Alan Lotvin, President, Pharmacy Services; Dan Finke, President, Healthcare Benefits; and Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer, and Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer, both Co-Presidents of the Retail segment.\nOur press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC.

Karen?\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Tom. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. We entered 2022 with significant momentum and delivered strong first quarter results across our business. We grew revenue by over 11% to $76.8 billion, and increased adjusted operating income by nearly 7% to approximately $4.5 billion. Adjusted EPS was $2.22, up over 8.5% over the prior year. In the quarter, we generated $3.6 billion of operating cash flow, representing growth of over 20% as compared to the prior year quarter.\nOur foundational businesses performed well in the quarter. In Health Care Benefits, revenue increased by 12.8% year-over-year. We achieved adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion. We grew membership sequentially and year-over-year. Overall medical costs remain consistent with projected baseline trends. These results reflect our strong product portfolio, our deep understanding of consumers' health needs and service excellence.\nIn Pharmacy Services, revenue increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income grew 8.6% despite a flat year-over-year contribution from our 340B product line. Our results demonstrate the consistent value and savings that we deliver to our customers.\nIn retail, we strengthened our position as a leading community health destination for millions of Americans. We grew revenues by approximately 9% with approximately 15% adjusted operating earnings growth over the prior year. We grew same-store retail scripts by approximately 6%, approaching twice the growth in the marketplace.\nStore visits increased over prior year as more Americans see CVS Health as central to their health needs. We administered more than 6 million COVID-19 tests and more than 8 million COVID-19 vaccines nationwide in the first quarter of 2022.\nGiven these results, we are raising our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.20 to $8.40. Our cash flow guidance for the year remains strong in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion. We are well positioned to achieve near-term and longer-term growth goals.\nWe are doing this across 5 strategic value-creating imperatives, which we outlined at our Investor Day. Let me just share a few examples of the strong progress we are making in each. First, we are advancing our all-payer primary care delivery capabilities. Our community health destinations are engaging more consumers with 6.5 million in-person and virtual visits in 2021, approximately 1.5 million visits in the first quarter, up nearly 35% from the prior year. Our virtual care solution represents one of many care delivery channels and lower cost sites of high quality of care. We will be broadening our virtual care services in the next 30 days.\nMore people are accessing health care using digitally-enabled solutions. Pre-pandemic back in 2019, we supported 10,000 virtual mental health visits. Last year, we supported 10 million virtual visits just for mental health. This dramatic increase demonstrates the power of our ability to drive innovation at scale.\nSecond, we are optimizing our retail portfolio that will be comprised of 3 models: advanced primary care clinics, enhanced health hub locations and our traditional CVS pharmacy locations. As of today, we have closed approximately 100 stores out of the 300 planned for this year and the 900 planned by the end of 2024. Our early experience suggests we are retaining nearly 70% of the prescription volume within our network, demonstrating strong evidence of our value to consumers. Additionally, we retained more than 95% of colleagues and redeployed them to other CVS locations.\nThird, we are diversifying our growth portfolio with new health services. We are expanding our capabilities in home health as we prepare for the 2023 launch of a post-acute transitions pilot for our Aetna membership in select geographies. Partnering in technology and home-based care will allow us to reduce readmissions and improve care for our customers at this critical juncture on their path to recovery.\nAs we broaden our capabilities to create new sources of value, we continually evaluate our portfolio for nonstrategic assets. Our recently announced sale of PayFlex and selected assets from our international businesses are 2 recent examples of our actions. These transactions are in line with our commitment to invest in areas that are aligned with our strategy.\nFourth, we are focused on our digital-first technology-forward approach. We serve nearly 44 million unique digital customers as of the end of the first quarter, up by over 7 million customers since our Investor Day, a testament to the value and ease of our digital offering.\nDigital customers are omnichannel, and on average visit CVS Health 2x more often than traditional customers. We also continue to expand our digital first health dashboard offering. This dashboard makes managing your family's health more seamless, convenient and personalized. It does so by putting critical health information into one place, health records, pharmacy medications and next best actions. We have 5 million active health dashboard users, up over 25% in the past quarter, and we will continue to enhance connectivity to more services later this year.\nFinally, we are making progress serving our consumers wherever and whenever they receive health care. In the first quarter, we launched a new fulfillment option for consumers as part of our omnichannel health experience. Consumers can purchase health and wellness products online with an option for free same-day pickup that will be available in approximately 6,000 CVS community health destinations later this year. We are partnering with Google and Microsoft in ways that deliver real benefits to consumers. For example, MinuteClinic scheduling is now integrated into Google Search, driving new and more convenient appointment bookings.\nIn our specialty pharmacy, we are using Microsoft text analytics and robotics to automate the 40% of prescriptions that are still paper or fax-based, making it easier and faster for us to fill the patient's prescription.\nWe are increasingly using technology to improve our business process and reduce costs. Here are just 2 examples. Our specialty intelligent medication monitoring and adherence engine uses machine learning to help our most at-risk patients by predicting the likelihood of individual patients becoming nonadherent to their medication. This approach then prompts ways in which we can coach and help them maintain their overall health. Also, using machine learning and robotics, we can now resolve a wide range of prescription drug claims, which previously require the attention of our pharmacists, freeing them up to spend time with patients. This advanced approach reduces overall cost and improve the patient experience.\nThese 5 strategic imperatives taken together place the consumer at the center of everything we do. Consumer value is behind the integration of our businesses and we are making steady and real progress. Ultimately, it's the hard work and commitment of our dedicated colleagues that makes our strategy and results achievable. At CVS Health, we are committed to fostering a culture of values. We have made increasing workforce representation, promoting the inclusion and belonging and equitable access to growth and development our priority.\nOur commitment to shareholders, customers and communities remains steadfast. In our 2021 environmental social governance report released last month, we highlighted our sharpened focus on sustainable business practices and our priority to advance health equity in America. You can find our report on our website. Our work to fundamentally reshape the delivery of health care in our country is well underway.\nBefore I turn it over to Sean, I am pleased to announce we have named a new Chief Medical Officer. Dr. Sree Chaguturu. Also, I'd like to acknowledge Jon Roberts, who will be retiring at the end of June, and thank him for his many contributions to CVS Health over his 42-year career at our company. I am grateful to our dedicated colleagues who continue to deliver every day, helping millions of Americans and bringing their heart to every moment of our customers' health.\nLet me now turn it over to Shawn for a deeper look into our operational results and outlook for the remainder of the year.\n\nShawn Michael Guertin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results reflect strong performance from all our core business segments with continued momentum in revenue growth, cash flow generation and adjusted earnings per share growth, positioning us to increase our 2022 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $8.20 to $8.40 per share. As we continue making progress towards our financial targets, we remain focused on growth, operational execution and supporting the communities we serve.\nA few highlights of total company performance. First quarter revenues of $76.8 billion increased by 11.2% year-over-year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments. We delivered adjusted operating income of approximately $4.5 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.22, representing an increase of 6.6% and 8.8% versus prior year, respectively. Our first quarter adjusted EPS performance reflects both a higher adjusted operating income contribution and lower interest expense versus prior year due to our proactive deleveraging campaign in 2021. Importantly, our first quarter 2022 adjusted EPS was impacted by $75 million of net realized capital losses, which lowered adjusted EPS performance by $0.04. Of the losses noted, approximately $40 million or $0.02 per share related to write-downs of sovereign bonds in Ukraine and Belarus.\nTurning to the Health Care Benefits segment. First quarter revenue of $23.1 billion increased by 12.8% year-over-year, driven by membership growth across all product lines. We delivered sequential membership growth of over 670,000, reflecting growth across all product lines. We continue to be pleased with the performance of our Medicare franchise, which has been a key growth engine over the years. Medicare Advantage grew about 200,000 members sequentially, up 6.7%. Our momentum in dual eligible plans enrollment also continued into the first quarter, growing 28% sequentially.\nIn our commercial business, a strong national account selling season contributed to membership growth, along with growth in commercial risk membership, driven by group commercial and our reentry into the individual exchange marketplace. Adjusted operating income of $1.8 billion was down slightly as compared to the prior year, as the previously mentioned net realized capital losses impacted growth, along with the continued progression towards normalized medical cost trends.\nOur medical benefit ratio of 83.5% increased approximately 30 basis points year-over-year, reflective of the same continued progression towards normalized total medical costs. In total, medical cost trends in our commercial business remain in line with prepandemic trended baselines, with government remaining slightly lower than prepandemic baselines.\nConsolidated days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 51.7, up 2.6 days sequentially as we brought on new government and other membership in the first quarter. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn Pharmacy Services, we continue to achieve strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth. This is a natural outcome from our execution, delivering industry-leading drug trend on behalf of our clients, providing leading specialty management capabilities and outstanding customer service.\nDuring the first quarter, revenue of $39.5 billion increased by 8.6% year-over-year, driven by pharmacy claims growth, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy membership was roughly flat from year-end at 110 million members as underlying growth in commercial and other government lives helped to offset significant membership losses from the California Medicaid carve-out that started this year. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 5.8% above prior year, primarily attributable to new business in 2022. Currently, we are approximately 60% through renewals for the 2023 selling season with over 98% core client retention.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.6 billion grew 8.6% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting increased contribution from the products and services of our group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued client price improvements and increased expenses to onboard new business at the beginning of the year. As Karen mentioned, our 340B product lines did not grow inside the quarter.\nIn our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered strong revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year. First quarter revenue of $25.4 billion grew 9.2% year-over-year, largely due to increased prescription and front store volume, including the sale of COVID-19 OTC test kits. Adjusted operating income of $1.6 billion grew 15.1% versus prior year, driven by a few key components: strength in pharmacy and front-store sales, the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and demand for over-the-counter test kits and related treatment categories, particularly at the beginning of the quarter when Omicron incidence was high. These positive factors were partially offset by the impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements, and investments in store labor as we were consciously slow to draw down staffing in response to declining Omicron case levels to ensure we had sufficient capacity to meet consumer health needs.\nOur liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the first quarter, generating cash flow from operations of $3.6 billion and ending the quarter with $3 billion of cash at the parent and unrestricted subsidiaries. We remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A. The announced sales of our PayFlex and Aetna international business in Thailand are expected to provide us with additional deployable capital later this year.\nWe repurchased approximately 19.1 million shares of common stock during the 3 months ended March 31, 2022, marking the first time the company has repurchased shares of its common stock since 2017. We also increased the quarterly shareholder dividend by 10% effective with the February 1, 2022 dividend distribution, which resulted in the return of $722 million to shareholders through dividends during the 3 months ended March 31, 2022.\nIn March, we also announced we had entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims dating back more than a decade related to opioid medications. Under the agreement, we will settle all opioid claims by Florida for $484 million to be paid over a period of 18 years. As a result, upon satisfaction of the settlement terms by the state, CVS will be released from the pending litigation in Florida. Associated with this settlement, we have taken a charge of approximately $370 million after tax in our first quarter 2022 financials, which has been excluded from our adjusted operating metrics.\nAs a result of our first quarter performance, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $8.20 to $8.40, which represents 3.5% to 6% growth versus our 2021 adjusted earnings per share baseline. The increase reflects the favorable impact of prior year's development net of realized capital losses experienced in our Health Care Benefits business, both of which we do not forecast.\nAs such, we are raising full year Health Care Benefits guidance as follows: membership increases to a range of 24 million to 24.3 million members; revenue increases to a range of $89.3 million to $90.8 billion; adjusted operating income guidance increases by $180 million at the midpoint to $5.94 billion to $6.04 billion.\nSimilarly, MBR guidance is updated to 83.5% to 84.5% to reflect our first quarter experience. We are maintaining all other guidance shared during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nOur updated guidance now reflects the assumption that a fourth COVID-19 booster will be administered to adults aged 50 and older and to certain immunocompromised individuals as per the guidelines set forth by the CDC. Administration of a fourth booster is expected to have a net neutral impact to our enterprise, representing an incremental cost to our health benefits segment, but helping to maintain our full year outlook for our retail segment by offsetting first quarter 2022 expense pressures previously mentioned.\nAs we evaluate the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we would remind investors of our prior statements that we expect 2022 earnings to be modestly higher in the first half of the year. Similar to 2021 earnings progression, we currently project that 47% to 49% of adjusted EPS will occur in the back half of 2022, which we project will be fairly evenly split between the third and fourth quarters. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.\nWe continue to anticipate strong cash from operations in 2022 between $12 billion and $13 billion, and capital expenditures in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience as well as our community locations. Full year deployable free cash will benefit from our recent divestiture activity while any earnings impact from these divestitures are incorporated into our updated guidance ranges.\nTo conclude, we are encouraged by our strong first quarter results and improved 2022 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year as we continue to sharpen our focus and execute our strategy. As a leader and trusted partner in health care, we strive to deliver a superior health care experience for our consumers through lowering the cost of care, improving access and building engagement and convenience to our consumers and their communities. We will now open the call to your questions. Operator?",

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. .\nI would now like to turn the call over to Susan Lisa, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. Please go ahead.\n\nSusan V. Lisa\n\nSVP of IR, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the CVS Health Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Susie Lisa, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for CVS Health. I'm joined this morning by Karen Lynch, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Shawn Guertin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Following our prepared remarks, we will host a question-and-answer session that will include Alan Lotvin, President Pharmacy Services; Dan Finke, President, Healthcare Benefits; Michelle Peluso, Chief Customer Officer; and Prem Shah, Chief Pharmacy Officer, both Co-Presidents of the Retail segment; and John Roberts, Chief Operating Officer.\nOur press release and slide presentation have been posted to our website, along with our Form 10-K that we filed with the SEC this morning. During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements reflecting our current views related to our future financial performance, future events, industry and market conditions as well as the expected consumer benefits of our products and services and our financial projections. Our forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what may be indicated in them.\nWe strongly encourage you to review the information in the reports we file with the SEC regarding these risks and uncertainties, in particular, those that are described in the cautionary statement concerning forward-looking statements and Risk Factors section in this morning's earnings press release and included in our Form 10-K.\nDuring this call, we will use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about the company's performance and financial condition. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP measures in this morning's earnings press release and the reconciliation document posted on the Investor Relations portion of our website. Today's call is being broadcast on our website, where it will be archived for 1 year.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Karen.\n\nKaren Sue Lynch\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Susie. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. 2021 was an important year for CVS Health. We exceeded our financial goals, we advanced our strategy and we brought greater value to the people we serve playing a critical role in the nation's pandemic response.\nWe ended a strong 2021 with another strong quarter. We exceeded our adjusted EPS expectations for the fourth quarter in a row delivering $1.98 adjusted EPS in the final quarter of 2021 and $8.40 adjusted EPS for the full year. We are entering 2022 with powerful momentum. We are delivering health care solutions that are personalized, connected and increasingly digital. We are engaging millions of consumers across our businesses and in our community health destinations across America. CVS Health is becoming a bigger part of their everyday health.\nTurning now to our performance. For the full year 2021, CVS Health grew adjusted revenue by 8.8% to $292 billion. We delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion, up 8.1% year-over-year, and we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12%. We generated strong cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion for the full year, exceeding our most recent guidance of at least $13.5 billion.\nThis strong performance positions us well for 2022. At this early stage of the year, we are maintaining our full year 2022 adjusted earnings per share guidance of $8.10 to $8.30. Our forecast reflects increased volume from COVID testing and front store sales in our retail business relative to our forecast at Investor Day, offset by the accelerated timing of vaccine boosters pulled into the fourth quarter of 2021. Shawn will provide more details on our results and guidance shortly.\nOur 2021 performance demonstrates our ability to anticipate, deliver and exceed consumers' expectations for health care. Consumers are a major force driving change in health care and we continue to engage successfully with individuals in more places and on their terms, virtually in the home and in their local community. Customers and clients continue to realize the superior value we are providing with our integrated health solutions, particularly those that address the most prevalent, costly and complex health conditions, such as diabetes, cancer and chronic kidney disease.\nTurning to the segment highlights. In Health Care Benefits, we delivered 9.4% adjusted revenue growth for the full year 2021, driven by our performance in Government Services. We had another strong year of Medicare growth with increases across all product lines. Total Medicare Advantage membership grew at 9.8% on a year-over-year basis, as we added over 265,000 new members in 2021 and exceeded our initial growth expectations. As a result of our strategic focus on dual-eligible special needs plans, enrollment nearly doubled in 2021.\nOur full year medical benefit ratio of 85% was in line with our guidance expectations. For the full year 2021, the utilization of total health care services in aggregate was in line with normalized historical baseline levels.\nTurning to 2022, we had an impressive annual enrollment period in our Medicare business. For the second consecutive year, we grew all Medicare product lines, and our growth rates this year exceed the industry averages in all categories. We grew total Medicare Advantage membership by 11.6% versus the prior year, reflecting increases in individual and group Medicare Advantage of over 15% and 6%, respectively, year-over-year. We also led the industry in absolute Medicare PDP net membership growth. This added nearly 295,000 net new members, while the overall PDP market continues to decline.\nWe had a solid 2022 selling season in our national accounts Commercial business. We expect to grow membership in the low single digits for the full year and maintained strong client retention of 96%. Our success is driven by the combination of our competitive cost structure, our integrated benefit designs, including medical and pharmacy, and products and services that utilize CVS Health capabilities such as Transform Care Diabetes and Virtual Primary Care programs.\nMembership enrollment was lower than expected in the 8 ACA individual exchanges we entered this year. We continue to build this business gradually with select geographic expansion, a focused price discipline and the appeal of co-branded Aetna CVS Health offerings. Consistent with our prior guidance, we do not expect this offering to contribute materially to our financial results in 2022.\nOverall, our deep understanding of consumer needs, innovative product portfolio and our service excellence will drive growth in our Health Care Benefits segment. Our comprehensive range of products and benefit design that address consumers' whole health needs remains a key differentiator and fueled a strong selling season. For 2022, we forecast 7% to 9% revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted operating income growth.\nTurning to Pharmacy Services, we delivered 7.8% revenue and 20.6% adjusted operating income growth in 2021. We continue to be a consultative partner to our clients and members. We're delivering industry-leading cost trends and savings, service excellence and a broad product portfolio and a commitment to transparency. We consistently create value for our customers and clients with our better-than-market drug trend. We continue to enhance our utilization programs to ensure access to the therapeutics that are the most clinically appropriate.\nFor 2022, we achieved a client retention rate of over 98% and drove $8.8 billion of net new business revenue. We are a leader in specialty pharmacy, delivering revenue growth of 12.3% for the fourth quarter and 9.3% for the full year versus prior period. Our specialty pharmacy programs drive value in the marketplace and they differentiate us as we pair programs with digital capabilities to deliver a convenient and connected experience.\nFor Pharmacy Services in 2022, we expect 6% to 8% revenue growth and 7% to 9% adjusted operating income growth as we create long-term value for our clients, and our members. Our Retail segment plays a critical role as a community health destination for millions of Americans. This segment outperformed the industry and our expectations in 2021. We grew revenue 9.8% year-over-year to just over $100 billion, marking an important milestone in the history of this CVS Health business. We delivered an exceptional 24% adjusted operating income growth in 2021.\nPharmacy sales and prescriptions filled both increased by nearly 9% year-over-year. This was notably driven by consumers who came to CVS Health for COVID-19 vaccine administration. For the full year 2021, CVS Health administered more than 32 million COVID-19 tests and more than 59 million vaccines. Over 35% of COVID-19 vaccines in 2021 were administered during the fourth quarter. Our work to test and vaccinate America for COVID is a powerful example of the relationships we are building with consumers, which leads to new customers seeking a range of other health services at CVS Health.\nFront store sales growth was strong throughout 2021, up 8.4% versus the prior year. They were led by consumer demand for the over-the-counter COVID-19 tests as well as cough and cold, beauty and personal care products. We sold over 22 million OTC COVID-19 tests, with approximately 70% of sales in the fourth quarter.\nWe are progressing on optimizing our retail portfolio and pivoting our stores into 3 formats: primary care clinics, enhanced health hubs and traditional CVS pharmacy locations. We are executing our plan to dedensify stores based on consumer health and buying needs, omnichannel preferences and shifts in the U.S. population.\nFor 2022, as I mentioned, given the earnings outperformance and pull forward of vaccine boosters in 2021, we are maintaining our 2022 guidance. This now implies retail revenue to be plus or minus 1% versus prior year, and a low 20% decline in adjusted operating income growth. Shawn will provide more details.\nOur digital approach is focused on delivering a superior experience for consumers by creating a more connected and seamless health journey. We are making progress towards setting a new standard for digital health care for consumers. cvs.com is one of the top health websites with over 2 billion visits in 2021, up nearly 55% over the prior year. Our digital capabilities for health interactions such as COVID testing and vaccines, prescription services and sales of health and wellness products have dramatically increased consumer engagement across all CVS Health businesses. We now serve 40 million customers digitally, up approximately 10% in the last 6 months alone.\nIn 2021, we launched several new digital health services powered by advanced analytics to personalize the experience. We made it easier to join our CarePass program reaching 5.6 million subscribers in the quarter, up more than 40% year-over-year. We integrated CarePass for our Aetna Commercial members and are excited about the adoption we are seeing. We also simplified the CarePass enrollment for all consumers, which is driving more growth in subscribers.\nFor our HealthHUB and MinuteClinic patients, we simplified and digitized the check-in process for patients. Our self-service digital tool enables individuals to complete traditional paperwork in advance of their appointment. Almost 80% of patients are already utilizing this capability.\nAt our Investor Day, we promised a superior health care experience for consumers that will improve health outcomes, lower cost and provide broader access to care. We are making several moves to realize our vision for health care. We're advancing our care delivery capabilities, optimizing our retail portfolio and further diversifying the health products and services that we offer.\nWe're driving this evolution both through internal initiatives and by seeking to execute capability-focused M&A for complementary health services. We will connect consumers in more places, in more ways and on their terms, with our digital-first technology-forward approach as well as an enhanced omnichannel health experience. These strategic moves will accelerate the growth of our foundational businesses. In all this work, we will place the consumer at the center of all that we do.\nWe remain focused on delivering on our commitment to sustainability for our shareholders, our customers and our communities. We recently launched CVS Health Zone aim to advance health equity and to address social determinants of health in high-risk communities. We are collaborating with trusted national and local organizations to confront the 6 key social determinants of health through local investments. Our goal is to equip communities with the resources needed to close gaps in care for specific health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. Health Zone is now active in 5 geographies with additional markets planned in 2022.\nWe remain committed to the environment and have pledged to reduce our overall impact, cutting greenhouse gas emissions across our operations and supply chain and decreasing resource consumption, especially paper and plastic. In December, CVS Health was named to the 2021 S&P Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the 9th consecutive year and the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the 3rd consecutive year.\nOur financial performance, execution, portfolio of assets and differentiated strategy all create strong momentum into 2022 and a clear pathway to achieve low double-digit adjusted EPS growth over time. I would also like to take a moment to recognize the continued contribution of our colleagues who have played a vital role in helping our nation prevail over the pandemic. I am proud of what we have done and are doing every day to make a difference.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Shawn.\n\nShawn Michael Guertin\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CVS Health Corporation\n\nThank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter results reflect the continuation of the strong performance delivered in the first 3 quarters of the year as we once again exceeded our expectations for revenue cash flow and adjusted earnings per share. We maintained our focus on growth, operational execution and supporting the communities we serve as the effects of the pandemic persists.\nStarting with the enterprise as a whole. Total fourth quarter adjusted revenues of $76.6 billion increased by 10.6% year-over-year. We reported adjusted operating income of $4.1 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.98, representing an increase of 40.8% and 52.3% versus prior year, respectively. For full year 2021, we reported total adjusted revenues of $292.1 billion, an increase of 8.8% versus prior year, reflecting robust growth across all business segments.\nWe delivered adjusted operating income of $17.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $8.40, up approximately 8.1% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. And we generated significant cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion. This marks a record year of cash flow from operations for CVS Health and reflects the strength of our financial results, accelerated collections and focused improvements and our working capital position.\nTurning to the Health Care Benefits segment. Fourth quarter adjusted revenue of $20.7 billion increased by 10.1% year-over-year, driven by membership growth in our Government Services business and lower COVID-19-related investments, slightly offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. Adjusted operating income of $510 million grew by over 230% year-over-year driven by lower COVID-19 related investments and improved underlying performance, partially offset by higher COVID-related medical costs compared to prior year.\nOur adjusted medical benefit ratio of 87% improved 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower COVID-19 related investments, partially offset by the repeal of the health insurer fee. As a result of the Omicron variant, we experienced higher COVID testing and treatment costs in the fourth quarter, but this was largely offset by lower non-COVID costs, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid. Days claims payable at the end of the quarter was 49 and was, as expected, lower than the third quarter and consistent with normal seasonal trends and historic levels. Overall, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves.\nIn the Pharmacy Services segment, fourth quarter revenues of $39.3 billion increased by 8.2% year-over-year driven by increased pharmacy claims volume, growth in specialty pharmacy and brand inflation, partially offset by the impact of continued client price improvements. Total pharmacy membership increased by approximately 400,000 lives sequentially, reflecting sustained growth in government programs. Total pharmacy claims processed increased by 8.2% above prior year. Approximately half of this growth was attributable to net new business in '21, with COVID-19 vaccine administration and new therapy prescriptions also contributing to the year-over-year growth.\nAdjusted operating income of $1.8 billion grew 16.8% year-over-year, driven by improved purchasing economics, reflecting the products and services of our group purchasing organization, and growth in specialty pharmacy. The quarter also reflected additional investments to support a successful welcome season.\nIn our Retail/Long-Term Care segment, we delivered exceptional revenue and adjusted operating income growth versus prior year and once again exceeded our expectations. Fourth quarter revenue of $27.1 billion was up by 12.7% year-over-year, representing an increase of $3 billion. There are 2 main components to this increase: one, approximately 60% was driven by the administration of COVID-19 vaccines and testing, front store sales, including demand for over-the-counter COVID test kits and related treatment categories as well as strong COVID-related prescription volume.\nThe remaining 40% was attributable to a combination of underlying sustained pharmacy growth and broad strength in front store sales trends, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure. This strong revenue growth helped produce adjusted operating income of $2.5 billion. This quarterly result was 38% above prior year and significantly exceeded our forecasts.\nThe increase in adjusted operating income was driven by a few key components: the administration of COVID-19 vaccines; underlying strength in pharmacy and front store sales; and a $106 million gain from an antitrust legal settlement, which were partially offset by the combined impacts of ongoing but stable reimbursement pressure, and business investments, including the minimum wage increase and store improvements.\nIn terms of the improved performance in the quarter versus our expectations, there are 2 primary components. Approximately 75% was driven by vaccines, largely third dose boosters, which we previously expected to impact the first quarter of 2022. And the remaining 25% was driven by the nationwide surge in demand for over-the-counter and diagnostic COVID-19 testing, combined with stronger underlying front store sales performance.\nLooking at cash flow and the balance sheet. Our liquidity and capital position remained strong at the end of the fourth quarter, with full year cash flow from operations of nearly $18.3 billion and nonrestricted cash of over $3.8 billion. Through our proactive liability management transaction in December, we paid down $2.3 billion in long-term debt in the quarter, bringing the total long-term debt we have repaid since the close of the Aetna transaction to a net total of $21 billion. In addition, we returned over $2.6 billion to shareholders through our quarterly dividends in 2021.\nOur consistent outperformance during 2021 provides solid momentum as we head into this year, setting the stage for our continued strong outlook in 2022 despite multiple COVID unknowns that remain challenging to predict, such as additional variants, vaccine and testing protocols, and government testing initiatives. As Karen noted earlier, we are maintaining our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $8.10 to $8.30. We feel this is an appropriate stance at this early point in the year, especially given the earnings outperformance of Retail in Q4 was due largely to the pull forward of third dose vaccine administration from 2022 into 2021. This represents 2% to 5% growth versus our revised 2021 adjusted earnings per share baseline of $7.92.\nAs you think about the adjusted earnings per share baseline and year-over-year growth, I'd like to encourage you to keep a few things in mind. First, recall that our 2021 baseline of $7.92 removes items we do not forecast, prior year's development, net of profits returned to customers and net realized capital gains. It also includes the annualized impact of our investment in our colleagues through an increase in minimum wage. Second, it is also important to note that the baseline now includes a net favorable component attributable to COVID-19 driven by vaccines and testing of approximately $0.30 per share.\nCVS Health continues to help lead the nation's COVID-19 pandemic response, clearly demonstrating the power of our integrated business model, consumer engagement and local community health destinations. While there is no change to our Retail segment guidance, I would like to provide more detail on our COVID-19 retail volume assumptions for 2022.\nWe expect that COVID-19 testing both in-store diagnostic and over-the-counter will continue at higher volumes than anticipated at Investor Day, offset by a reduced outlook on vaccines. In 2022, we expect vaccine volumes to decline approximately 70% to 80% and in-store diagnostic testing volumes to decline 40% to 50% compared to 2021. For over-the-counter test kits, we expect modest full year volume growth versus 2021.\nRelative to vaccines, our outlook does not assume any impact from the administration of a fourth COVID-19 booster. As such, we expect the contribution of COVID-19 vaccines to be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year. As I mentioned, the impact of COVID-19 remains one of the most challenging aspects of developing our guidance due to many factors, including the risk of additional surges, potential new testing or vaccine protocols, legislative changes, and OTC test kit dynamics such as supply challenges, coverage mandates and government initiatives. You will find additional details regarding our updated guidance in the slide presentation we posted to our website this morning.\nTurning to items that are below adjusted operating income on our income statement, we expect our interest expense for 2022 to be approximately $2.3 billion. We are purchasing shares to offset dilution. And as a result, we expect that diluted share count to be approximately flat versus 2021. Our expectation for the effective income tax rate is approximately 25.6%, consistent with 2021.\nIn terms of cash flow and capital deployment, we anticipate continued strong cash flow from operations in 2022, and we are updating our guidance range to $12 billion to $13 billion, reflecting the improved cash flow results for 2021. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $2.8 billion to $3 billion as we invest in technology and digital enhancements to improve the consumer experience as well as our community locations. As we detailed in December, we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings, while also having the flexibility to deploy capital strategically for capability-focused M&A.\nTo conclude, the strong 2021 performance of CVS Health is expected to carry into 2022 as we continue to execute our strategy. We have solidified our leadership role in health care delivery as a trusted partner to our consumers and their communities. As we build upon this trust, we will continue to drive meaningful improvements that lower the cost of care, improve access and build engagement and convenience, ultimately enabling people to live healthier lives.\nWe will now open the call to your questions.

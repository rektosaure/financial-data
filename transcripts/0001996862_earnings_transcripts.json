[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Haden, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Haden\n\nVP of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Drew, and thank you for joining us this morning for our third quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found at the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind me that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view in respect to future events financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into the quarter, I want to thank our team for their continued focus, discipline and execution in what remains a highly complex operating environment. Across the company, our people are working together, navigating uncertainty, capturing opportunities and delivering value for all stakeholders. With the Vitera transaction closing behind us, this was our first quarter operating as a combined company and I'm very pleased with the way our teams have embraced integration and the One Bunge culture.\nWe are already seeing tangible benefits from bringing these 2 highly complementary businesses together, benefits that go well beyond cost savings. We have aligned the combined company along our proven end-to-end value chain operating model. This structure enables us to run with greater agility, transparency and collaboration across origination, merchandising, processing and refining. What's different and powerful about our combined company is the increased granularity and information we have at both origin and destination. We've connected more local and regional networks into our global platform, giving us insights and optionality we didn't have before.\nThese competitive advantages are allowing us to respond faster to market signals and execute more efficiently across the value chain, identifying opportunities to optimize our footprint, better coordinate flows between origination and destination and capture margin through improved logistics. These efficiencies are lasting and will benefit the entire value chain over time from farmer to end consumer. They're being unlocked because our teams not only have the same information at the same time, but are also working toward a single set of objectives for our global company.\nThis knowledge sharing, along with collaborative planning is happening throughout the organization, from the elevator operator to the commercial desk to the end customer, and it's already driving better outcomes. Shifting to our operating performance. Our third quarter results reflected strong performance in our soybean and softseed processing and refining segments, where we saw the benefits of a more balanced global footprint and the initial impact of our team's work to capture commercial synergies. John will go into more detail in a moment.\nAs we shared on our business update call last month, we've recast our full year 2025 outlook to include Viterra. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, farmers and end consumers remain largely spot, reflecting continued macro trade and biofuel policy uncertainty. Based on what we can see today, we continue to expect full year 2025 adjusted EPS and in the range of $7.30 to $7.60. This reflects an expected second half adjusted EPS in the range of $4 to $4.25.\nSo with that, I'll turn it over to John for a deeper look at our financials and outlook. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. On our October 15 business update call, we announced that starting with this quarter, we will change our reportable segment structure, agri business, [indiscernible] specialty oils and milling to 4 reportable segments. Soybean processing and refining, softseed processing and refining, other oilseeds processing and refining, and grain merchandising and milling. The changes in segment reporting reflect the realignment of oilseeds operations into processing and refining by commodity type and combining grain merchandising and milling operations into one reportable segment. .\nThese changes reflect a tight interconnection of our upstream and downstream operations and aligns our segment reporting with our end-to-end value chain operating structure. Now let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. As Greg mentioned, the newly combined team executed well, delivering a strong third quarter. Our reported third quarter earnings per share was $0.86 compared to $1.56 in the third quarter of 2024. Our reported results included unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.87 per share and an unfavorable impact of $0.54 per share from notable items related to Viterra transaction and integration costs.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.27 in the third quarter versus $2.29 in the prior year. Adjusted segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $924 million in the quarter versus $559 million last year. Soybean processing and refining results improved in all regions, reflecting a combination of higher margins, strong execution and the addition of Viterra South American assets.\n[Audio Gap] the merchandising activities were higher reflecting strong execution. Higher soft seed processed volumes primarily reflected the combined company's increased production capacity in Argentina, Canada and Europe. Higher merchandise volumes reflected the combined company expanded global softseeds origination footprint. For other oilseeds processing and refining, higher results in North America specialty oils were more than offset by lower results in Asia and Europe. The addition of Viterra has minimal impact on this segment, which primarily consists of our tropical specialty oils and soy protein concentrate businesses.\nIn grain merchandising and milling, higher results in wheat milling and ocean freight, plus the addition of the sugar business were partially offset by lower results in global wheat and corn merchandising. Higher volumes reflected the combined company's larger green handling footprint and capabilities. Prior year results included corn milling, which we divested earlier this year. The increase in corporate expenses was primarily driven by the addition of Vitera and performance-based compensation accruals.\nPrior year other results included income of $6 million from the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture that we divested in the fourth quarter of last year. Net interest expense of $145 million was up in the quarter compared to last year, reflecting the addition of Viterra, partially offset by a lower average net interest rates and higher interest income from investments in interest-bearing instruments. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. Over this period, our team has excelled in managing a variety of different market environments while also executing on numerous internal initiatives, most notably Viterra integration planning and now execution.\nThe recent performance trend reflects less volatility due to a more balanced global supply and demand environment and the impact of ongoing trade and biofuel uncertainty that has created a very spot transactional market environment. Slide 7 details our capital allocation. Year-to-date, we have generated approximately $1.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $282 million of sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance environmental health and safety. We have approximately $900 million of discretionary cash flow available. We paid $324 million in dividends and invested $903 million in growth in productivity related CapEx.\nWe received approximately $1.3 billion of cash proceeds from divestments, including U.S. corn milling, an interest in our soy processing footprint in [indiscernible] final payment for our interest in the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture that closed in 2024 and the Hungary and Poland assets as required for receiving regulatory approval in Europe. We also repurchased 6.7 million Bunge shares for $545 million. This resulted in $386 million of retained cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 8. At quarter end, net debt exceeded readily marketable inventories, or RMI, by approximately $900 million. This change versus recent history reflects the impact of acquisition debt assumed and issued related to Viterra. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, was 2.2x at the end of the third quarter.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $9.7 billion, of which all was unused and available, providing ample liquidity to manage the ongoing capital needs of our larger combined company.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 8.5% and ROIC was 7.2%. Adjusting for construction and progress on our large multiyear projects not yet operating and the excess cash on our balance sheet, our adjusted ROIC would increase to 10% and ROIC to 8%. Note that we decreased [indiscernible] effectively reflecting the recent upgrade in our credit rating, change in capital structure of the combined company and the lower interest rate environment.\nImportantly, we are not lowering our long-term investment return expectations. We also updated our return calculations to align with the change in our combined company profile. The change includes an expansion of merchandising RMI reflecting our greater volume of soft seeds and grains and removing the cumulative translation loss adjustment, no longer consider material as a result of our more geographically balanced footprint.\nMoving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, and a cash flow yield or cash return on equity of 9.7% compared to our cost of equity of 7.2%. For this calculation, we also removed the cumulative translation losses adjustment due to our expanded footprint and are converting to a 4-quarter average to calculate adjusted book equity that better reflects the average capital base employed to generate cash over the period.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 and our 2025 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account third quarter results, the current margin and macro environment of [indiscernible]. We continue to forecast full year 2025 adjusted EPS in the range of $7.30 to $7.60. This estimate reflects an expected second half adjusted EPS in the range of $4 to $4.25. The difference in EPS ranges of $0.30 for the full year and $0.25 for the second half is due to different weighted average share count used in the respective calculations.\nAdditionally, we expect the following for 2025, an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%, no interest expense in the range of $380 million to $400 million, capital expenditures in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and depreciation and amortization of approximately $710 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. We had a strong third quarter. We are capturing value from the combined platform, operating as one company and demonstrating the benefits of our expanded global network. Externally, we continue to navigate a high degree of complexity in the marketplace. And as mentioned, farmers and in consumers remain largely spot. Total grain stocks-to-use ratios are elevated, dampening volatility and putting pressure on certain margins. And policy decisions, including biofuels and trade remain in flux as we look ahead to 2026. .\nOur platform was built to perform and to win regardless of the environment. We have the flexibility to adapt to shifting trade flows and keep products moving. That's the power of our combined company. The scale, scope and resilience of a global network backed by the discipline to manage risk and deliver solutions that create value for all our customers, farmers and end consumers. So in short, we have the people, assets and processes to manage through uncertainty and the rigor to stay focused on what we can control, running efficiently, serving customers and creating value for farmers and consumers food, feed and fuel.\nSo with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I just wanted to mention, you may have noticed Mark is now leading IR. And I wanted to give a quick thank you to Rofin for her years of service IR and she'll now be leading our government affairs team globally. So they'll still be working closely together.\nSo welcome. This is a pivotal quarter for Bunge, and I want to begin by thanking the team, continued focus and execution. We successfully navigated a highly complex period, both internally and externally and delivered better-than-expected results for the quarter, especially given the market conditions. The team continues to demonstrate agility in ever-changing environment while also making significant progress against our strategic priorities.\nVery pleased to have completed our combination with Viterra earlier this month, creating the premier agribusiness solutions company positioned to address some of the most pressing needs of the 21st century for farmers and consumers across food, feed and fuel. This has been a long time in the making and we use that time well. We're finding our integration plans and preparing for execution.\nAs [indiscernible] combination is complete, teams are moving quickly to identify and capture cost savings along with commercial opportunities we couldn't pursue before closing. We are already moving to implement logistical and transportation efficiencies with potential to reduce expenses between origin and destination. These are durable synergies that will benefit everyone across the value chain. Our teams have hit the ground running. I've been impressed by the seamless collaboration partnership unified sense of purpose across the company.\nWe remain as excited as ever about our path ahead. Viterra brings a very talented team, robust network of strategically positioned assets. We move into integration phase. We are leveraging core aspects of the playbook that has served Bunge so well over the past several years. We'll move quickly to apply many of the same proven standardized approaches to reach the full potential for a combined company.\nThis includes utilizing the value chain operating model, our global functional centers of excellence and structuring our reward system to ensure our teams are working together toward the common goals of our global company while always staying aligned with our shareholders.\nWe are applying a global approach to risk management that aligns with the earnings power of our combined company in today's environment, positioning us to better capture value from our expanded global asset base while prudently allocating risk to the best opportunities. As we integrate these 2 highly complementary businesses, we're opportunistic about the value we will generate. The rigorous integration planning has been done, we have a clear path to bringing our companies together, capturing meaningful efficiencies and operational synergies. But I'm especially excited about the potential commercial synergies.\nWe are already identifying opportunities to run a more efficient processing and logistics network, use our combined information to better manage risk for Bunge and our customers. It's been great to see the teams working quickly to identify, tackle these areas together. Beyond Viterra, continue to focus on our broader strategic priorities, including ongoing portfolio optimization.\nEarlier this month, we announced the completion of the sale of U.S. corn milling further simplifies our business along our global value chains. Shifting to our operating performance. Our second quarter results were largely driven by better-than-expected processing results in South America, higher margins in Brazil and Argentina. Fine & Specialty oils was negatively impacted by uncertainty related to U.S. biofuel policy. Don will go into more detail about the second quarter financials in a moment. Looking ahead, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS outlook of approximately $7.75 with a legacy standalone Bunge which no longer includes the second half earnings from our corn milling business due to its sale, which closed on June 30.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John for a deeper look at our financials and outlook. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Now let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. As Greg mentioned, the second quarter exceeded our expectations, primarily by processing. Team's execution allowed us to benefit from late quarter market volatility. Our quarter second quarter earnings per share was $2.61 compared to $0.48 in the second quarter '24.\nOur reported results were a favorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.69 per share, that favorable impact of $0.61 per share from notable items, consisting of an $0.87 gain sale of our U.S. corn milling business, offset in part by $0.26 transaction and integration-related costs related to Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $1.31 in the second quarter versus $1.73 in the prior year. Adjusted segment earnings before interest and taxes, EBIT was $376 million in the quarter, which is $519 million last year.\nIn processing, our results in South America, both Brazil and Argentina benefited from large soybean crops, reformer selling, high results in Asia more than offset by lower results in Europe and North America merchandising improved performance in global grains and oils was then offset by lower results in our financial services and ocean freight businesses. While largely driven by North America and Europe, results in refined specialty oils were down in all regions, reflecting a more balanced global supply and demand environment and uncertainty in U.S. biofuel policy.\nDoing higher results in North America and offset by lower results in South America. The Corporate and Other decrease in corporate expenses was primarily driven by performance-based compensation. Prior year other results include a loss of $21 million from the Sugar and bioenergy joint venture that we divested in the fourth quarter of last year. Net interest expense of $60 million was down in the quarter, compared to last year due to lower average net interest rates, increased capitalized interest on capital projects and higher interest income from investments in interest-bearing decrease in income tax expense for the quarter was primarily due to lower pretax income by 25%.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years alone to trailing 12 months. For this period, our team has excelled in managing a variety of different market environments while also executing on numerous internal initiatives, notably Viterra integration planning. Recent performance trend reflects a more balanced global supply and demand environment and the impact of ongoing trade and biofuel uncertainty that has created a very spot market environment.\n[indiscernible] to have the details of our capital allocation. Year-to-date, we have generated $693 million of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $133 million to sustaining CapEx which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety. We had $560 million of discretionary cash flow available. The $185 million in dividends invested $583 million in growth in productivity related CapEx. We also received $776 million of cash proceeds related to the sale of our U.S. core milling business the sale of an interest in our soy crush footprint in Spain to Repsol and final payment for the sale of our interest in the Sugar and bioenergy joint venture that closed in 2024. This resulted in approximately $570 million of retained cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 8. At year-end, really marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.2 billion. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 1.1x in the second [indiscernible] . Slide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, of which approximately $7.6 billion were unused by the ample liquidity and manage the ongoing capital needs of our larger combined company.\nIn addition, we had a cash balance of approximately $6.8 billion in anticipation of our merger with Viterra. I would also like to point out that following our closing of Viterra, S&P upgraded our credit rating to A- reflecting our improved business risk profile in a step change in our scale and diversification.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. Trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 8.4% and ROIC was 7.4%. Adjusting for construction in progress, or large multiyear projects not yet operating in the excess cash on our balance sheet Viterra closing. Adjusted ROIC increased by 1.6 percentage points and ROIC by approximately 1 percentage point.\nMoving to Slide 11. Trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion, a cash flow yield of 9.8% and compared to our cost of equity of 8.2%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 and our 2025 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account second quarter results to larger macro environment and forward codes. We continue to forecast full year 2025 EPS of approximately $7.75. This forecast no longer includes second half earnings corn milling business due to the sale on June 30 and also excludes the impact of Viterra closed on July 2.\nAgribusiness full year results are forecasted to be higher than previous outlook driven by processing but remained down from last year. Fine specialty portfolio results are expected to be down from our previous outlook, reflecting the softer second quarter performance down from the last year. Milling full year results are expected to be down from our previous outlook, reflecting the sale of corn milling, but still in line with last year. Corporate and other full year results are expected to be in line with our previous outlook, but favorable to last year.\nAdditionally, the company expects a following for 2025. Adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%, net interest expense at the lower end of the range of $220 million to $250 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. Depreciation amortization of approximately $490 million. Prior to reporting third quarter earnings, we anticipate providing a forecast for the buying company with the historical bung information reported in a new segment reporting structure that will be used going forward for the combined company.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before we go into Q&A, I just want to offer a few closing thoughts. So when we first announced our combination with Viterra 2 years ago, we saw opportunities with the combined company to accelerate our strategy. Hence, our diversification across crops and geographies and increase the impact of our investments. Those same benefits hold true today and are especially relevant as we navigate the current macro environment. With a greater diversification across assets, geographies and crops, [indiscernible] to provide us insight, supply and demand dynamics we're even better positioned to serve our customers at both into the value chain, regardless of the market environment. And with the increased scale of our platform, we will get a better return on investments to further improve our business. including technology in areas such as data analytics to enhance supply chain transparency, logistics planning, processing efficiency, risk management and decision-making support. I'm confident that we have the right people, platform and strategies in place to deliver value for our stakeholders, farmers to consumers across feed, food and fuel markets.\nWe will have a stronger, better positioned company with even greater flexibility and resources to address global food security and renewable energy needs.\nWith that, we'll turn to Q&A."

I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking our team for their hard work and adaptability in what has already been a highly dynamic 2025. Their continued focus and great execution delivered a strong start to the year. It demonstrated once again that we can navigate market environments, agility and speed, harnessing a truly global platform and strength in our core markets.\nWe continue to believe in the strategic merits of our planned combination with Viterra and expect to close the transaction in the near term.\nWhile the timing of regulatory approvals has not been what we anticipated, we've engaged in constructive conversations with the relevant authorities prepared to close in very short order once received.\nWe recently chose to execute our rights to terminate the definitive share purchase agreement with CJ Selecta pursuant to its terms. However, the protein concentrate for feed remains an attractive market with promising growth prospects that nicely complements our soy origination crushing capabilities in Brazil.\nAt the same time, we made great progress in other key areas, further sharpening our portfolio, strengthening our business and positioning Bunge for the future.\nWe recently announced the sale of our European margarines business and our North American corn milling business. Both of these transactions allow us to further align around our global value chains.\nWe also closed our previously announced partnership with Repsol and announced a key milestone with the incorporation of intermediate novel crops in the production of renewable fuels in Europe. This aligns -- furthers our long-term strategy to create alternative path towards meeting our customers' demand to lower carbon agricultural and oil supply chains.\nShifting to operating results. First quarter exceeded our expectations, driven in part by some pull forward of activity from Q2 into Q1. Later in the quarter, shifts in trade dynamics, including growth in regulatory uncertainty, opted some farmers and consumers to act ahead of potential changes.\nLooking ahead, we're reaffirming our full year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance, approximately $7.75 and remain confident in our ability to continue to execute despite the current market environment. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to provide an outlook for the combined company once we've closed the Viterra transaction.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to John for a deeper look at our financials and outlook. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. I'll turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. As Greg mentioned, the first quarter exceeded our expectations. This tariff and regulatory uncertainty increased during the quarter, some farmers and customers moved ahead of potential changes [indiscernible] earnings from Q2 into Q1.\nOur reported first quarter earnings per share was $1.48 compared to $1.68 in the first quarter of 2024. The reported results included an unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.08 per share to a negative impact of $0.25 per share, notable items related to the transaction integration costs associated with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $1.81 in the first quarter versus $3.04 in the prior year. Adjusted segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $406 million in the quarter versus $719 million last year.\nIn processing, higher results in the Brazil, Europe and Asia story crush value chains more than offset by lower results in North America, Argentina and European softseeds.\nMerchandising improved performance in global grains, financial services business more than offset by lower results in [indiscernible].\nWith the exception of Asia, Refined and Specialty Oils results were down in all regions, reflecting a more balanced global supply and demand environment, driven in part by the uncertainty in U.S. biofuel policy.\nIn Milling, slightly higher results in North America has been offset by lower results in South America, [indiscernible] margins were pressured by a more competitive mixing environment.\n[indiscernible], the decrease in corporate expenses was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation. For our year other results included $24 million from the sugar and bioenergy joint venture that will be divested in the fourth quarter of last year.\nNet interest expense of $45 million is down in the quarter compared to last year due to increased capitalized interest, higher interest income on investments in interest-bearing instruments and interest received on Brazilian tax refunds. The increase income tax expense for the quarter was primarily due to lower pretax income in 2025, the prior year unfavorable adjustments related to foreign currency fluctuations in [ South America. ]\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. Of this period, our team has excelled in navigating the complexities of dynamic markets, simultaneously executing various internal initiatives. Recent trend indicates a more balanced supply and demand environment and the impact of trade and biofuel uncertainty, insulating into less volatility and lower [indiscernible].\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation. For the first quarter, we generated $392 million of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $54 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had $338 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $91 million in dividends, invested $256 million in growth and productivity related CapEx. We also received $306 million of cash proceeds related to the sale of an interest in our soy crush footprint in Spain to Repsol as part of our newly formed joint venture and a final payment for the sale of our interest in the sugar and bioenergy joint venture. This resulted in approximately $300 million of retained cash flow.\nMoving to Slide 8. At quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3 billion. Adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.6x at the end of the quarter.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we had committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, all of which were unused, providing ample liquidity to maintain ongoing capital needs. In addition, we had a cash balance of approximately $3.2 billion related in large part from the U.S. public debt offering that we closed last September and supported Viterra transaction. There were no amounts outstanding under $2 billion commercial paper program.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. The trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 9.4% and ROIC was 8.2%. Adjusting for construction in progress on our large multiyear projects not yet operating and the excess cash on our balance sheet in the Viterra [indiscernible], adjusted ROIC would increase by 1.5 percentage points and ROIC by approximately [ 1%. ] [indiscernible] recent highs made above our adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%.\nMoving to Slide 11. In trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion and a cash flow yield of 10.2% compared to our cost of equity of 8.2%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 and our 2025 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account Q1 results, the current margin and macro environment and forward curves, we continue to expect full year 2025 adjusted EPS of approximately $7.75. This forecast [ includes ] the impact of announced acquisitions and divestitures that are expected to close during the year.\nIn Agri business, full year results are forecasted to be slightly lower than our previous outlook and down from last year, primarily due to lower results in processing. Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and down from the prior year, primarily driven by a more balanced supply and demand environment in North America.\nIn milling, full year -- previous outlook and up from last year.\nIn Corporate and Other, full year results are expected to be more favorable than our previous outlook and the prior year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2025. Adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%. Net interest expense in the range of $220 million to $250 million, which is down from our previous expected range of $250 million to $280 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $1.5 to $1.7 billion.\nAnd depreciation and amortization of approximately $490 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. In today's uncertain global environment, we can be certain of the strength of our team, global footprint and our operating model. Our purpose of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel is something the world depends on regardless of external circumstances.\nFor the last few years, our team has consistently risen to the challenge, navigating an ever-changing world, exceeding expectations in the face with global pandemic, trade wars and geopolitical uncertainty. Confident that the same focus, discipline and ability to execute continue to drive our success.\nOur business is built on a resilient global infrastructure that ensures an efficient supply, staple crops and food and feed products that has proven its ability to withstand volatility. We have the right systems and strategies in place to manage risk, adapt to external challenges and remain focused on what truly matters.\nThe combination with Viterra will only enhance our diversification across assets, geographies and crops, providing us with more optionality to help address the world's food security needs. Its core business is resilient, track record proves this. I have no doubt that we'll continue to deliver value for customers at both ends of the value chain.\nWith that, let's turn to Q&A.."

Welcome to the BAWAG Group Full Year 2024 Results Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Anas Abuzaakouk, CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nAnas Abuzaakouk\n\nChairman of the Management Board & CEO\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is keeping well. I'm joined this morning by Enver, our CFO; as well as David, our CRO. As a reminder, we have our Investor Day presentation scheduled for this afternoon at 2:00 p.m. GMT. We plan to release the presentation around noon GMT and hope you will join us for the event. We have a lot to cover this morning, so let's jump right into it with a summary of full year 2024 results on Slide 3.\nFor the full year 2024, we delivered record net profit of EUR 760 million, earnings per share of EUR 9.60 and a return on tangible common equity of 26%. The underlying operating performance of our business was very strong with pre-provision profits of EUR 1.083 billion, up 4% versus prior year and a cost income ratio of 33%. Total risk costs were EUR 82 million with a low NPL ratio of 80 basis points, down 20 basis points versus prior year. Given the solid asset quality and reducing NPL volume, we released our management overlay with a positive one-off, EUR 35 million pretax contribution. The fourth quarter was strong with a net profit of EUR 240 million and a return on tangible common equity of 32%. Which benefited from the one-off management overlay release as well as 2 months of contribution from Knab.\nWe delivered on all 2024 targets with profit before tax greater than EUR 950 million and RoTCE greater than 20% and a cost-income ratio under 34%. We also distributed EUR 393 million in dividends equal to 5 year in 2024. Our liquidity position is robust with cash of approximately EUR 18 billion, around 25% of our balance sheet -- with our capital and liquidity and are ready to deploy into customer lending as well as add to our securities portfolio when the right opportunities present themselves, meeting our risk-adjusted returns. In terms of development, average customer loans were up 28% quarter-over-quarter and up 23% versus prior year. Average customer deposits were up 24% quarter-over-quarter and up 26% versus prior year. Excluding the Knab acquisition, average customer loans were up 2% and customer deposits were flat quarter-over-quarter.\nWe ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 15.2% net of the accrual of EUR 5.50 per share, which we will be proposing to the AGM in April. On a pro forma basis, which considers the acquisition of Barclays Consumer Bank Europe, that closed in February of this year, the return to the standardized approach for the retail and SME business, the CET1 ratio would land at approximately 13.8% representing approximately EUR 175 million of excess capital above our CET1 capital distribution target of 13%, which were out for 2024 and 2025. Both acquisitions closed with higher RWAs given the stronger underlying business growth consumed EUR 600 million of capital and are forecasted to add pretax profit of approximately EUR 250 million in 2025 and over EUR 350 million by 2027. Both deals were underwritten at a premium to our M&A target RoTCE over 20% and are more than 3x more accretive than share buybacks versus our average share price in 2024.\nAlthough early days, we've been positively surprised with the acquisitions, and we'll dive into this more during the Investor Day presentation this afternoon. In terms of business activity, 2024 was another year defined by staying patient and disciplined, given the rates environment, inflation and subdued consumer confidence. We saw an impact on customer lending volumes at high rates and continued inflation negatively impacted retail mortgage lending opportunities in corporate lending throughout the year. However, we saw a pickup of activity in real estate lending during the second half of the year with fundings in the fourth quarter. We've seen this carryover into the first quarter of this year with a solid pipeline of opportunities in both real estate and public sector lending.\nOnce markets settle into a new normal of interest rates and inflation subsides, we anticipate a pickup in mortgage originations and overall lending levels. Despite our record performance in 2024, our best years lie ahead. Our strategy has been consistent since 2012, when focused on being patient, disciplined, cutting through the noise and embracing a continuous improvement mindset, disciplined approach, focused on risk-adjusted returns, not blindly chasing volume growth and thinking beyond the immediate quarter is not always obvious or understood. However, we are rewarded when unique opportunities present themselves, such as Knab and Barclays Consumer Bank Europe. We have the team, operating capabilities, infrastructure, capital and liquidity to act.\nWith the recent closing of both acquisitions, the integrations are on full swing and we're excited about the local teams and the many opportunities ahead. Although 2025 will be a transition year in dedicated to integration, we are targeting net profit greater than EUR 800 million. We expect to continue delivering an RoTCE greater than 20% this year and through this [ segment ] franchise continues to reap benefits of long-term investments over the years.\nMoving to Slide 4, capital development. At year-end 2024, [ Q1 ] ratio was 15.2%, net of our dividend accrual. We generated approximately 370 basis points of gross capital from earnings. We will propose a dividend of EUR 0.05 per share, up 10% from prior year and equal to EUR 432 million. On a pro forma basis, the CET1 ratio would land at 13.8%, with $175 million of excess capital above our CET1 distribution target for both years, 2024 and 2025. This is after having acquired both Knab and Barclays Consumer Bank Europe, which consumed EUR 600 million of capital similarly 300 basis points and will deliver over EUR 350 million of pretax profit by 2027. We continue to generate significant amounts of capital resulting from our very strong earnings generation as we are geared to consistently deliver an ROTCE greater than 20%.\nMoving to Slide 5. Our Retail & SME business delivered full year net profit of EUR 525 million, flat versus the prior year and generating a strong return on tangible common equity of 32% and a cost income ratio of 33%. Full year pre-provision profits were EUR 810 million, up 2% compared to the prior year with operating income up 6% and operating expenses up 18% versus prior year, in large part driven by the recent acquisition of Knab. Risk costs were EUR 102 million. We continue to see solid credit performance across the business with an NPL ratio of 1.2%. With the closing of the Knab acquisition in November, assets were up 55%, with EUR 12.7 billion of the Knab mortgages added. Deposits were up 47%, with EUR 12.7 billion of deposits added from Knab as well.\nOn Slide 6, our corporate real estate and public sector business delivered full year net profit of EUR 188 million up 11% versus prior year and generating a strong return on tangible common equity of 30% and a cost income ratio of 25%. Preprovision profits were EUR 234 million, down 3% versus prior year. Our release of the management overlay translated into EUR 20 million of pretax contribution for the full year. We continue to see solid credit performance across the business with an NPL ratio of 70 basis points, down 10 basis points. We had a strong pipeline of real estate deals fund in the fourth quarter and have a solid pipeline of public sector and real estate opportunities in the first quarter as well.\nWith that, I'll hand over to David to go to provide a year-end update on asset quality and our overall risk profile.\n\nDavid O'Leary\n\nChief Risk Officer & Member of the Managing Board\n\nThanks, Anas. Page 8 provides an overview of the asset side of the balance sheet. With the acquisition of Knab in the fourth quarter, our total assets now exceed EUR 71 billion, an increase of EUR 16 million since Q3. And primarily of the EUR 71 billion in total assets, EUR 18 billion or 25% as determinably positioned ourselves across excess -- with excess liquidity levels to ensure ample capacity for opportunities that may arise and to support all liquidity scenarios. After EUR 3 billion of investment-grade securities in our treasury book, the remainder of EUR 47 billion or 70% of our assets in the customer book. Because of a conservative risk appetite and disciplined underwriting has built a highly resilient and simple balance sheet that has maintained structurally low risk cost and NPL levels consistently over the long term.\nOver 80% of our customer book is secure public sector lending, reflecting a multiyear strategy to grow collateralized lending losses. In terms of segments, retail lending now comprises EUR 34 billion of our customer loans, 85% of that primarily in Austria and the Netherlands, with an LTV of less than 60%. Corporate, real estate and public sector make up the remaining EUR 13 billion of customer assets. Corporate lending continues to be a challenging market for growth as high availability of capital, reduced exposure down to EUR 3 billion, representing a high-quality book of [ secure ] loans to noncyclical industries with average level. Commercial real estate exposure is just over EUR 5 billion and continues to perform [ portfolio ] and feel good about the limited exposure remaining, which I will touch on in coming pages. As of the end of 2024, our risk metrics demonstrate our continued asset quality and conservative on where we have run our business since 2021 and see of asset selection and management.\nOn Page 9, our retail and SME exposure. The portfolio is primarily comprised of EUR 27 billion of housing loans, 37% are state guarantees and the remainder bears a comfortable average LTV of 50%. While originations have been subdued with the impact of higher rates, we have remained cautious regarding the risk of value declines on the stock since early 2020, the LTV of our new originations has averaged below 70%. After the impact of both M&A transactions, we expect housing loans to adjust down to approximately 70% of our mix versus the current high point reflecting Knab.\nIn Specialty Finance and SME, which is primarily collateralized. 11% or EUR 3.8 billion of consumer loans focused on our better risk less. However, as this is unsecured lending, this product is more sensitive to macro developments and unemployment rates. In 2024, we have experienced a return to a normalized pre-pandemic delinquency and loss rates, which have clearly stable at this point and represent the majority of our risk cost composition. Given the sensitivity [ writing ] quality and monitoring is critical, we price for through-the-cycle risk levels and focus on customers with high income stability and debt service cushion. This limits our market share by such focus, but it benefits in the stability of the asset class.\nOn slide 10, an update on the real estate portfolio. Commercial real estate grew to EUR 5.5 billion in the fourth quarter stabilized interest rate environment brought a slow return to transaction activity and so many opportunities. Our pipeline has been selectively built and several low LTV multi-asset portfolio financings were completed in the quarter. The headwinds of higher rates have not fully cleared yet, and therefore, we continue to be highly selective. The portfolio is performing well, a reflection of the underlying residential and industrial logistics assets composing 72% of total portfolio. These sectors are supported by continuing high demand and lack of supply underlying cash flows at the asset levels have generally increased while the rate impacts are being manually cross collateralization that provides diversity and liquidity.\nThe average LTV in the fourth quarter is 50% with an NPL ratio of 1.5% demonstrating the overall high quality maintained throughout this rate cycle. Our office exposure in the U.S. stands at EUR 317 million. This is down from 2022 and 31% from the beginning of the year. The growth in the fourth quarter was driven by a multi-asset portfolio financing as well as FX impacts. The financing included a medical office component that was cross-collateralized with other asset classes supporting conservative risk metrics. The performing U.S. office portfolio remains resilient with an average senior debt yield of 9%, demonstrating sufficient and stable cash flows and an LTV of 70%. The U.S. office exposure is currently less than 40 basis points of our total assets and only 4% of our total commercial real estate portfolio.\nIn 2024, our book reduced as deals refinanced the way on helping from supportive sponsor activity. We proactively managed credit issues to ensure the protection of cash flows and value. While the market will likely see some stressed assets in the office space continue as maturities work through, we anticipate that our remaining portfolio is well for -- asset quality improved with a reduction in our Stage 2 loans from 5% to 4% of total customer assets. Our NPL ratio improved to a historically low 80 basis points on EUR 601 million balance down from 1% of Austrian unsecured in the quarter in our active management processes of problem loans through the life cycle results in a long term consistently low deal profile.\nDuring the quarter, we reallocated 50% of our management overlay to increase our modeled ECL reserves as part of a broad model update and to improve coverage on CRE reserves. The remaining EUR 35 million of overlay was released to P&L is excess. This maintained conservative in our reserve levels, while transparency related to our commercial real estate assets has improved, which resulted in a reserve surplus. Reserve coverage remains healthy at 47% on our nonperforming book, and we continue to see steady performance looking forward SME segment.\nWith that, I'll hand it to Enver.\n\nEnver Sirucic\n\nCFO, Deputy CEO & Member of Management Board\n\nThank you, Dave. I will continue on Slide 13, a strong last quarter of the year with net profit of EUR 240 million, return on tangible common equity of 32%. All numbers include 2 months contributions from comp. Core revenues at EUR 450 million, up 16% versus third quarter and 14% versus last year. Operating expenses at EUR 165 million, 30% up versus third quarter and 34% versus last year. Cost income ratio came in below 36%. We had a net release in risk cost this quarter after we released our management outlay with a positive one-off of EUR 35 million. key balance sheet, as you would mention here, customers at EUR 45 billion up by almost 40% in Q4 and 36% year-over-year, similar changes in customer deposits, which stand at EUR 46 million at year-end, up 37% and 39%, respectively. This is in large part driven by Knab.\nRisk-weighted assets are in this context, only up 16%, given a focus on mortgages. Our cash position for the increased by EUR 2 billion and stands now at EUR 17.6 billion or 25% of our balance sheet. This leaves us with a very comfortable liquidity buffer as potential organic and inorganic market opportunities in the future. On the next slide, our customer funding, which is made up of customer deposits and AAA-rated mortgage and public sector covered bonds, up by 31% versus prior quarter. In terms of customer deposits, we have seen any relevant structural changes in the fourth quarter. Deposit betas are now at around 41%, including Knab. Without the Knab, we would be at 36%, which is above our expectations.\nWith that, moving on to Slide 16. Net interest income was up by 19% versus prior quarter with a strong net interest margin of 303 basis points. The increase was previously driven by Knab while BAWAG stand-alone NII would have been stable quarter-over-quarter. In terms of net commission income, up by 5%, with an overall good performance across securities and payments business in our retail SME segment and Knab's contribution. On a pro forma basis, [ Absent ] our newly acquired credit card business in Germany, we would expect a quarterly NII run rate of more than EUR 150 million and a pro forma NCI run rate of more than EUR 85 million. This leads us to a 2025 outlook for core revenues of greater than EUR 2.150 billion. Operating expenses are up EUR 38 million in the quarter, around 2/3 come from Knab and the rest is mostly share price related tied to bonus awards from prior years.\nWith the Barclays Consumer Bank, we expect the quarterly cost line to be out EUR 200 million and around EUR 800 million for the full year '25. This includes any integration costs. On regulatory charges, nothing to mention in Q4, but we expect an increase in '25 based on the published Austrian government program, introducing a higher bank [ levy ]. Our estimate is that total regulatory charges will go from EUR 15 million in 2024 to about EUR 40 million in 2025.\nMoving to Slide 18. Overall, [ supporting ] with our lowest reported NPL ratio this quarter, we reallocated approximately 50% of our management overlay to increase our ECL reserves and to improve coverage on CRE reserves. The remaining EUR 35 million of overlay was released, and that release completely offset our underlying [ latterly ] risk run rate and the Day 1 ECL impact from [ Dan ]. For 2025, we expect risk costs to be around 40 basis points, including securitization costs and the day 1 ECL impact from Barclays.\nOn Slide 19, our new 2025 outlook and targets although 2025 will be a transition year and dedicated duration, we are targeting a net profit of greater than EUR 800 million and earnings per share of greater than EUR 10. We expect continued delivery and RoTCE greater than 20% this year and going forward. All targets do not include any additional M&A or excess capital distributions.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open the call for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Ma'am, please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. This can be found at the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors.\nOn the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their dedication and focus. We continue to effectively deliver on our commercial and operational priorities, making excellent progress on integration planning. I'm so impressed by this team's passion and drive. We're excited by the opportunities to grow our existing business and look forward to the future combination with Viterra.\nTwo teams are working very well together in the planning process and are identifying in many ways we'll be a more complete company post close. The regulatory approval process is continuing to progress. While we have the bulk of the approvals required, we are continuing to constructively engage with relevant authorities in the remaining jurisdictions. Based on ongoing discussions, we see no issues or material to the economics of the deal, and we expect to receive the remaining approvals in [indiscernible] transaction in the next several months.\nTurning to our results. We delivered solid adjusted EBIT, reflecting improved margin environment in some regions during the second half of the quarter, partially offset by more muted conditions in others. Our balanced market requires a different approach. We're very proud of the team for their ability to adapt and deliver. For the rest of 2024, we see the dynamics we have discussed are still in place. Demand is good, customers at both ends of the supply chain and largely in the spot market, limits visibility later in the year. We're controlling what we can amid the evolving supply-demand environment in markets around the world. We're tapping into the tremendous work we've done over the past several years to strengthen our business. Based on what we see in the markets and the forward curves today, we now expect full year adjusted EPS of approximately $9.25.\nI'll now hand the call over to John to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and then we'll close with some additional thoughts. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Reported second quarter earnings per share was $0.48 compared to $4.09 in the second quarter of 2023. Reported results included an unfavorable mark-to-market timing difference of $0.82 per share and a negative impact of $0.43 per share related to transaction and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra. Adjusted EPS was $1.73 in the quarter versus $3.06 in the prior year.\nAdjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $519 million in the quarter versus $893 million last year. Agribusiness processing results of $265 million in the quarter were down from last year, as higher results in soy and softseed crush, but more than offset by lower results in North and South America and Asia. Merchandising, lower results were primarily driven by global grains. Our volumes were more than offset by lower margins. renewable Refined and Specialty Oils performed well, but down from a strong prior year. Higher results in Asia were more than offset by lower results in North and South America and Europe.\nMilling, higher results were primly driven by South America, reflecting higher volumes and margins. Sales in the U.S. were in line with the prior year. Corporate and Other improved from last year. The decrease in corporate expenses is largely due to lower performance-based compensation. Our results in Other were primarily related to our captive insurance program. In our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture, core results were due to lower Brazil ethanol prices, which more than offset higher sugar prices.\nResults were also negatively impacted by approximately $15 million in foreign exchange translation losses with U.S. dollar-denominated debt. [indiscernible] benefit from the reversal of a tax valuation allowance. The first 6 months of the year reported income tax expense was $147 million compared to $381 million in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to our pretax income. Net interest expense of $86 million in the quarter was in line with last year.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see adjusted EPS and EBIT trend over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. Strong performance over the period reflects a combination of favorable market environment and full execution by our team. The more recent trend reflects more balanced, less volatile markets translating into lower earnings.\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation. First half of the year, we generated $895 million of adjusted funds from operations. After allocating $191 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, we had $704 million of discretionary cash flow available. From this amount, we paid $191 million in dividends, invested $342 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, half of which relates to our large multiyear greenfield investments, and repurchased $400 million of Bunge shares. This resulted in a use of $229 million of previously retained cash flow.\nWe are in progress on our greenfield products. We could end the year with the higher end of our CapEx range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, or perhaps slightly above. However, this would reduce our 2025 expectations.\nMoving to Slide 8. Quarter-end readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3 billion. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA, was 0.5x at the end of the quarter.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, we have committed credit facilities of approximately $8.7 billion, which includes $3 billion that will become available to draw upon at the close of the Viterra transaction. With the $5.7 billion available to us currently, all was unused at the end of the quarter, providing sample liquidity to manage on our ongoing capital needs. These amounts are in addition to the $8 billion of term loan commitments that we have secured to fund the Viterra transaction.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. Rolling 12 months adjusted ROIC was 15.2%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 12.2%, well above our weighted average cost of capital 7%. Moving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow approximately $1.5 billion, a cash flow yield of 13.7% compared to our cost of equity at 8.2%.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account first half results and the current margin environment forward curves, we now expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9.25. Note that this forecast excludes any pending transactions that are expected to close during the year. In the Agri business, full year results are forecasted to be in line with our previous outlook, reflecting higher results and processing, largely offset by lower results in merchandising. [indiscernible] are expected to be down compared to last year.\nThe Refined and Specialty Oils full year results are expected to be [indiscernible] from our previous outlook, with better-than-expected second quarter, but down compared to last year's record performance. The Milling full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook and up from last year. In Corporate and Other, full year results are expected to be similar to our previous outlook. In Non-core, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be down slightly from our previous outlook and down significantly last year.\nAdditionally, company expects the following for 2024: adjusted annual effective tax rate of 22% to 25%; net interest expense in the range of $280 million to $310 million; capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, as I mentioned earlier; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. So before we go to Q&A, I just want to offer a few closing thoughts. As we look ahead, the fundamental drivers of our business remain strong. Long-term demand for our food, feed and fuel product services continues to increase. With our global platform, we're very well positioned to find solutions to meet the needs of our customers at both ends of the value chain regardless of the market environment.\nOur strategic combination with Viterra will help us accelerate our diversification, assets, geographies and crops, providing us with even more capabilities and optionality to address the world's most pressing food security needs. As I mentioned earlier, both teams have been hard at work planning our integration and we look forward to unlocking this additional organizational capacity post close. We're also progressing on a range of other strategic initiatives that will strengthen our company for the future, including the sale of our interest in the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture in Brazil to partner BP.\nI'm very pleased with the great work the team has done to become a leader in the industry. However, this business is not core to Bunge's long-term strategy, but divesting it will allow us to focus those resources on our core businesses. We also recently completed a commercial pilot season in our effort to provide lower carbon solutions for farmers and in consumers. Working with our partners, Corteva and Chevron, farmers planted over 5,000 eggs of winter canola in the Southern U.S. For a successful harvest, the plan is to significantly increase acreage to 35,000 for the next crop year.\nWe hope to build on these promising results to meet consumers' growing demand for energy, creating more [indiscernible] sustainable future, driving additional revenue sources for farmers.\nIn addition, we jointly tested a traceability platform using blockchain technology for sustainable soy with CP Foods, [indiscernible] food and feed committed to nutritious, safe and traceable products. We successfully shipped several vessels of deforestation-free soybean meal from Brazil to Asia, allowing CP Foods to trace the product from farm to processing and transportation, all the way to destination. This is another example of the work Bone is doing to increase transparency and reliability and end-to-end traceability of our customers fulfill their sustainability commitments.\nThe focus remains on delivering great value to all stakeholders while investing to strengthen our business, so that we can provide customers with solutions, not only today but over the longer term. And while we always look for opportunities to improve, we're well positioned to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel to the world.\nAnd with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

Welcome to the BAWAG Group Q1 2024 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. A transcript will be published on the company's website. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anas Abuzaakouk. Please go ahead.\n\nAnas Abuzaakouk\n\nChairman of the Management Board & CEO\n\nThank you, operator. I hope everyone is keeping well this morning. I'm joined by Enver, our CFO. Let us start with a summary of the first quarter results on Slide 3. We delivered net profit of EUR 167 million, earnings per share of EUR 2.11 and a return on tangible common equity of 24% during the first quarter. The operating performance of our business was very strong with pre-provision profits of EUR 258 million and a cost-income ratio of 33%. Other income of minus EUR 9 million related primarily to other operating expenses tied to legal, tax and transactional advisory costs on M&A deals.\nThe bulk of these costs will be capitalized when deals are closed. Total risk costs were EUR 30 million, translating into a risk cost ratio of 28 basis points. We did not release any credit reserves with an ECL management overlay of EUR 80 million. We have a low NPL ratio of 1% and continue to see solid credit performance across our businesses.\nIn terms of our balance sheet and capital, average customer loans were flat and average customer deposits were up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 15.6%, up 90 basis points from year-end 2023 after considering the first quarter dividend accrual of EUR 92 million. We paid the dividend for the financial year 2023 of EUR 5 per share or EUR 393 million on April 15.\nWe have a fortress balance sheet with excess capital now at EUR 623 million, approximately EUR 12 billion of cash, an LCR of 217% and overall strong asset quality. We continue to see a market where customers are cautious and slowly adjusting to higher rates as we maintain our outlook for static to modest customer loan growth.\nWe have earmarked our excess capital for the acquisition of Knab Bank which we signed earlier this year. In addition to other strategic M&A that we are at an advanced stage, we have purposely maintained dry powder to pursue these strategic M&A opportunities that will be highly accretive to the franchise in both earnings as well as allowing us to grow our retail and SME franchise and our footprint in the DACH/NL region.\nToday, our franchise is approximately 70% retail and SME focused with 70% of our customer business in the DACH/NL region. In the midterm, we see this migrating to 80% to 90% retail and SME focus with 80% to 90% of our customer business in the DACH/NL region. This -- the first 4 months of this year have been defined by M&A and integration planning, ensuring constant dialogue with regulators, targets and laying out our detailed day 2 plans.\nThere has been a great deal of work taking place behind the scenes. We're excited about the opportunities ahead, and we'll provide more details as the year progresses.\nMoving to Slide 4. We delivered a net profit of EUR 167 million, up 20% versus prior year and a record first quarter result. Overall, strong operating performance with total pre-provision profits of EUR 258 million, up 4% versus prior year. Tangible book value per share was EUR 36.33, up 16% versus prior year and 3% versus prior quarter. This assumes the deduction of the first quarter 2024 dividend accrual.\nOn to Slide 5. At the end of the first quarter, our CET1 ratio was 15.6% after deducting the first quarter dividend. For the quarter, we generated approximately 90 basis points of gross capital through earnings. We also executed the corporate securitization transaction, which accounted for the majority of lower RWAs in the quarter.\nOur excess capital of EUR 623 million or 340 basis points provides us with enough dry powder for strategic M&A opportunities, both signed and in the pipeline. On Slide 6, our Retail & SME business delivered first quarter net profit of EUR 134 million, up 14% versus the prior year and generating a very strong return on tangible common equity of 36% and a cost/income ratio of 30%.\nPreprovision profits were EUR 208 million up 9% compared to the prior year with operating income up 7% and operating expenses up 4% versus prior year. Risk costs were EUR 26 million. The retail risk cost run rate has now returned to pre-COVID levels as multiple stimulus and government support programs have now expired. However, we continue to see solid credit performance across the business with an NPL ratio of 1.8%. We expect solid operating performance across the Retail & SME franchise in 2024, but muted customer loan growth, given the overall economic environment.\nOn Slide 7, our corporate, real estate and public sector business delivered first quarter net profit of EUR 39 million, up 5% versus prior year and generating a strong return on tangible common equity of 22% and the cost/income ratio of 27%. Pre-provision profits were EUR 58 million, down 1% versus prior year. Risk costs were EUR 5 million. We continue to see solid credit performance across the business with an NPL ratio of 80 basis points.\nWe pride ourselves on disciplined underwriting, focusing on risk-adjusted returns and not blindly chasing volume growth as we continue to remain patient and disciplined. We have the capital and liquidity to support our customers as we expect markets to normalize in the next few quarters.\nOn Slide 8, an update on the real estate portfolio. We experienced a 2% reduction quarter-over-quarter in our real estate portfolio, the bulk of which was related to U.S. office. The portfolio continues to perform well, reflecting the underlying exposure to residential, logistics, industrial and hospitality assets, which make up 75% of the total real estate portfolio and 85% of our total U.S. exposure.\nOur office exposure in the United States stands at EUR 371 million, down 19% versus prior quarter due to refinancings. The performing U.S. office portfolio represents less than 1% of total customer loans and 6% of our total real estate exposure. This remaining portfolio has a debt yield of approximately 9%, occupancy levels of approximately 80%, a weighted average lease term of 6 years with solid tenants and an LTV under 75%.\nWe believe the worst is behind us in terms of stress on our portfolio with our U.S. office portfolio reducing in size and other asset types continuing to perform well. For our remaining office portfolio, in certain cases, we've been able to negotiate equity contributions, resulting in deleveraging and/or additional equity to improve the properties and attract additional tenants.\nAs I've stated before, the stress we are seeing, particularly in commercial real estate will differentiate banks in terms of underwriting and asset quality as we see greater dispersion across lending portfolios. With that, I'll hand over to Enver.\n\nEnver Sirucic\n\nCFO, Deputy CEO & Member of Management Board\n\nThank you, Anas. I will continue on Slide 10. A strong quarter with net profit of EUR 167 million and a return on tangible common equity of 24%. While net interest income was down 1% versus prior quarter, the net commission income was up 4% in the first quarter. Year-over-year, core revenues were up 7% and flat versus prior quarter.\nOperating expenses up 2% in the quarter and cost/income ratio now at 33%. Risk costs were EUR 30 million in the quarter, stable versus the prior quarter. ECL management overlay remained at EUR 80 million.\nOn Slide 11, key developments of our balance sheet. A few things I will highlight here. Customer deposits were down 3% in Q1 and flat year-over-year. This was largely driven by seasonally high deposit balances at year-end versus first quarter, our average deposits were actually up by 1%. Customer loans went up 1%, while our risk-weighted assets came down by 4%, and this is largely due to a corporate securitization transaction that was executed in the first quarter.\nOur cash position came down to EUR 12 billion this quarter, also driven by the full paydown of the remaining TLTRO tranche. Cash and cash equivalents make up approximately 22% of the balance sheet, leaving us with a very comfortable liquidity buffer to address potential organic and inorganic market opportunities in the coming quarters.\nNext slide, our customer funding, which is made up of customer deposits and AAA-rated mortgage and public sector covered bonds grew by 1% since year-end and 5% year-over-year to around EUR 46 billion. Cash position now EUR 12 billion. In terms of customer deposits, no relevant structural changes in the first quarter, repricing continues in line with our expectations. Overall deposit betas now at around 29%, expected to grow to 30% to 35% and peak in the coming quarters.\nWith that, moving on to Slide 13, core revenues. Net interest income was down 1% versus prior quarter, with a net interest margin of 296 basis points. Overall, we have seen stable margins and volumes in the business with a pickup of deposit betas from 25% to 29% and a lower day count, leading to a slightly lower net interest income.\nIn terms of net commission income, up 4% with an overall good performance across securities and payments in our retail and SME segment. For 2024, our guidance remains unchanged. We expect core revenues and net interest income to grow by 1%.\nOn Slide 14, operating expenses are up 2% versus prior quarter largely driven by a full quarter of [indiscernible] Bank in the numbers and some inflation effects. The cost/income ratio increased widely to now 33%. In March, the collective bargaining agreement for banking was finalized with an agreed [ 8% ] wage increase in Austria, which is in line with our expectations.\nThat will be partly offset by our ongoing optimization programs, mostly through further simplification and standardization across the group, leaving us with an expected cost increase of around 3% for 2024 before any M&A. Our expectation for regulatory charges in 2024 remains at around EUR 16 million or EUR 4 million per quarter for the remainder of the year.\nMoving to Slide 15, risk costs. Overall, continued strong asset quality with a low NPL ratio of 1%. We booked EUR 30 million of risk costs in the first quarter, which was in line with prior quarter. We kept our management overlaid EUR 80 million, and we expect risk cost in '24 in the context of 25 to 30 basis points.\nOn Slide 16, we reconfirm our outlook and targets for 2024. This is based on current interest rate expectations and assuming no M&A in 2024. We are targeting net interest income and core revenue growth in 2024 of 1%, while containing operating expenses to 3% growth. Foreseeable regulatory charges are expected at around EUR 16 million in 2024.\nBased on overall macro environment, the recent underlying trends and solid asset quality, the risk cost ratio is expected to be between 25 and 30 basis points. The financial target for 2024 is a profit before tax of greater than EUR 920 million. Return on tangible common equity greater than 20% and and the cost income ratio under 34%. And with that, let's open up the call for Q&A, please. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Maria, and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investor Center on our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well. I'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors. On the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. 2023 was a significant year for Bunge with both our continued strong financial performance and progress on our long-term strategy. I want to thank the team for their exceptional execution on our day-to-day business while also focusing on key projects for the future. First and foremost, we announced our pending combination with Viterra to create a premier Agribusiness solutions company. We received overwhelming shareholder approval and our team has been hard at work planning for successful integration when we close the transaction, which we expect to occur later this year. We continue engaging with relevant authorities in countries around the world as we make progress on regulatory approvals. In addition to the Viterra transaction, we announced the planned acquisition of CJ Selecta, a leading fully integrated manufacturer and exporter of soy-based products in Brazil. We broke ground on our soy protein concentrate plant in Morristown, Indiana, with construction on track for a 2025 commissioning. We also completed the acquisition of a state-of-the-art oil refinery in Avondale, Louisiana. This facility, which has multi-oil capabilities, builds on our ability to provide value-added oils to our food customers in North America, and is already exceeding our initial performance expectations. And in the next few months, we'll be commissioning our new multi-oil refining and packaging plant in India. These growth initiatives will enable us to meet rising demand for plant-based food and feed ingredients. Investments to enhance our existing footprint are also paying off an improved overall performance. Our team continued to execute on planned capital projects, which when combined with our focus on operational excellence, enabled us to reduce oilseed processing unplanned downtime to a historic low, making better use of our capacity directly hits the bottom line. These investments were also made with an eye towards advancing our work in sustainability, running our plants more efficiently improves our performance against our science-based targets, and we're committed to continuous improvement of our operations while expanding regenerative agricultural programs and engaging with the industry to do our part to reduce carbon emissions across the entire supply chain. We're proud of our team's many accomplishments in 2023, a year in which Bunge was selected to be part of the S&P 500, a landmark moment for our company and reflective of the work we've accomplished to transform our business over the last several years. Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we delivered strong adjusted EBIT driven by record results in processing and improved results in milling. During the quarter, we continued to return capital to shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends. Looking ahead, as we've been reminded over the past few years, the only constant is change. Each year brings its own set of challenges and opportunities, and the team has shown we can navigate with agility and speed. Based on the current margin environment and forward curves, the market dynamic in 2024 looks to be different than what we experienced in 2023. And as often the case, forward visibility is limited at this point in the year. For the full year, we expect to generate adjusted EPS of approximately $9. John will go through our forecast in more detail. I want to reiterate that the work we've done to transform Bunge has created a company better equipped to operate in any market environment. And with the combination of Bunge and Viterra, we'll continue to improve our global platform making it more efficient and resilient, allowing us to better serve our customers at both ends of the value chain.\nI'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail and I'll then close with some additional thoughts. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $4.18 compared to $2.21 in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $1.08 per share and a negative impact of $0.60 per share primarily related to acquisition and integration costs associated with our announced business combination with Viterra as well as a fixed asset impairment charge. Adjusted EPS was $3.70 in the fourth quarter versus $3.24 in the prior year. Full year 2023 earnings per share was $14.87 versus $10.51 in 2022. Adjusted full year EPS was $13.66 versus a record $13.91 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $881 million in the quarter versus $804 million last year. Agribusiness had a strong close to the year, Processing results in the quarter of $132 million, primarily related to South America, Europe and Canada, more than offsetting lower results in the U.S., which had a difficult comparison to a particularly strong prior year. Results in Asia were comparable to last year. In Merchandising, results in the quarter were down in all businesses, reflecting lower volatility. Refine and Specialty oils finished a record year with strong fourth quarter results of $212 million. Performance for the quarter was down slightly from last year as higher results in North and South America were more than offset by lower results in Europe and Asia. In Milling, improved results in the quarter were primarily driven by our South American operations, reflecting higher margins due to the combination of lower wheat costs and a more favorable pricing environment. Results in U.S. corn milling also improved. Corporate and other improved from last year. Higher corporate expenses related to investments and growth initiatives were more than offset by positive results in our captive insurance program and Bunge Ventures. In our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture, results were lower as higher sugar prices were more than offset by lower ethanol prices. For the quarter, reported income tax expense was $219 million compared to $131 million for the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pretax income and geographic earnings mix. Adjusting for notable items and mark-to-market timing differences, the full year adjusted effective income tax rate was 23% compared to 17% for the prior year. Net interest expense of $115 million in the quarter was up compared to last year, primarily due to higher interest rates. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were offset with currency hedges reported within EBIT.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. The strong performance reflects our team's continued excellent execution in a favorable operating environment, while also delivering on a variety of initiatives to position the company for long-term growth.\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation. In 2023, we generated approximately $2.5 billion of adjusted funds from operations, which was up by approximately $110 million versus '22's record performance. After allocating $488 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $383 million in common dividends, invested $634 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, which is up significantly from $249 million last year, and repurchased $600 million of Bunge shares, leaving $361 million of retained cash flow for the year.\nMoving to Slide 8. We finished 2023 with a total CapEx spend of approximately $1.1 billion and expect to invest $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion in 2024. Our sustaining CapEx has been higher, reflecting post-pandemic catch-up and increased investments in operational and reliability where we're already seeing the benefits through reduced unplanned downtime. Also, our discretionary spend is up due to executing on our pipeline of growth projects, many of which are multiyear investments. We expect continued elevated spend in 2025 as we complete these projects.\nAs shown on Slide 9, at year-end readily marketable inventory, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.5 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.2x at the end of the fourth quarter.\nSlide 10 highlights our liquidity position. At year-end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs.\nPlease turn to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 18.4%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.3%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%.\nMoving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2 billion and a cash flow yield of 18.2%.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2024 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EPS of approximately $9. Note that this forecast excludes any pending acquisitions that are expected to close during the year. In Agribusiness, full year results were forecasted to be down from last year's record performance, primarily due to lower results in processing where margins have compressed in most regions. Results in merchandising are forecasted to be down slightly from last year. In Refine and specialty oils, full year results are expected to be down from the record prior year, reflecting an environment of increased supply, particularly in the U.S. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from last year. And in Corporate and Other full year results were also expected to be up from last year. In noncore, full year results in our sugar and bioenergy joint venture are expected to be down considerably from last year reflecting lower Brazilian ethanol prices. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2024: An adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 25%; net interest expense in the range of $300 million to $330 million; capital expenditures in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $450 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. So we're proud of the work we've done to optimize our business, and we're always looking for ways to drive continuous improvement. We've got a clear set of priorities, continue that work in 2024 and we're confident that we'll end the year as an even stronger Bunge. We're making great progress towards closing our combination with Viterra, which will increase diversification across assets, geographies and crops, providing us with more optionality and capability to serve customers. And we continue to invest in our people and global infrastructure. Through effective training and proper tools, we can safely and reliably meet our customers' needs. We're also working on a number of initiatives to best equip our team for the future, including strengthening our digital capabilities. We're making these investments to meet the longer-term demand growth for our products and services. And while always looking for opportunities to improve, we are well positioned to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel to the world.\nAnd with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n\nThank you, Rocco, and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations.

I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their dedication and focus throughout the quarter. Our performance proves that we can execute on big strategic moves like hinting into our business combination agreement with Viterra while continuing to keep our eye on the ball operationally.\nWe clearly had a lot going on over the past several quarters, and this team stayed sharp in our day-to-day business, delivering outstanding results and continuing to serve our customers at both ends of the value chain. At the same time, we capitalized on this unique opportunity to enhance the Bunge franchise for the future. John and I, along with the entire leadership team, are extremely proud of this work.\nWe continue to make progress on our combination with Viterra and filed our preliminary proxy statement in connection with the proposed transaction last week, and we're excited to bring our teams and assets together to create a premier agribusiness solutions company built to address some of the most pressing needs of the 21st century across food, feed and fuel.\nTurning to the second quarter. It was a dynamic environment, and our team showed agility. They did a great job of managing against the downside and being smart with the opportunities that were available. In particular, we were able to use our footprint and value chain connectivity to optimize margins as market conditions changed later in the quarter.\nWhile volatility can provide opportunities, it's difficult to predict the timing and where within the value chain those opportunities for upside will appear. However, our ability to execute in rapidly changing environments gives us confidence that we can create value over the long term. We also saw benefits from our investments in maintenance and productivity with improved reliability and reduced the amount of unplanned downtime across our platform.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of the year and based on the forward curves today and on the market environment, which from a macro and geo -- which is one that from a macro environment and the geo -- is geopolitically complex as we've ever seen, we're increasing our full year adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.75 per share.\nI'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and we'll then close with some additional thoughts. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $4.9 compared to $1.34 in the second quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.59 per share and a negative impact of $0.22 per share related to onetime items.\nAdjusted EPS was $3.72 in the quarter versus $2.97 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes or EBIT was $893 million in the quarter versus $709 million last year. Agribusiness adjusted results of $674 million were up compared to last year.\nIn processing, higher results in the quarter reflected better year-over-year performance across all value chains, driven in part by strong Brazil soybean origination, which contributed to higher crush results in Brazil in our destination crush operations in Europe and Asia.\nIn the U.S., results were also higher as we entered the quarter with a significant portion of our capacity locked in at higher margins. In merchandising, higher results in global oils and grains were more than offset by lower results in our financial services and ocean freight operations, which had difficult comparisons to a particularly strong prior year.\nRefined and specialty oils continued its trend of strong performance, though results were slightly lower than last year. Higher results in North America driven by food service and fuel demand were offset by slightly lower results across Europe, South America and Asia.\nIn Milling, lower results in the quarter were primarily driven by our South American operations, which were negatively impacted by the small Argentine wheat crop. Segment results in the prior year benefited from effective risk management of our supply chains during a period of high market volatility. The increase in corporate expenses in the quarter primarily reflected planned investments in growth and productivity-related initiatives that will pay off in future periods, lower other results related to our captive insurance program and Bunge Ventures.\nResults on our noncore sugar and bioanenergy joint venture included a $39 million benefit from the reversal of a valuation allowance. In addition, improved results reflected higher sugar prices that more than offset lower ethanol prices. Adjusting for notable items, net interest expense of $78 million in the quarter was down slightly compared to last year as higher average variable rates were offset by higher interest income.\nFor the 6 months of the year, income tax expense was $381 million compared to $144 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pretax income in 2023 as well as a change in geographic earnings mix. Let's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years along with the trailing 12 months.\nOur team continues to deliver excellent performance, especially when considering the rapidly changing market conditions we have faced while also executing on a variety of internal initiatives to improve our capabilities.\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation of the approximately $1.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we have generated year-to-date. After allocating $181 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $1.2 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $180 million in common dividends and invested $360 million in growth in productivity-related CapEx, leaving approximately $630 million of retained cash flow.\nWe have not purchased any shares this year as a result of our discussions to combine with Viterra. However, we recently announced that our Board has expanded our existing share repurchase program to $2 billion. We want to be in the market as soon as possible, and we expect that a meaningful portion of these repurchases will be executed prior to the close of the Viterra transaction with the remainder to be completed within 18 months of that date.\nAs shown on Slide 8, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.6 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs. In working with our key banking partners, we also recently secured $8 billion in the form of term loan commitments to fund our combination with Viterra. Please turn to Slide 10.\nFor the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 20.3%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 15.1%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%.\nMoving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 19.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2023 outlook.\nAs Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the first half of the year results and the current margin environment in forward curves, we have increased our full year 2023 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.75 per share.\nIn Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from last year, though slightly better than our prior outlook as higher results in processing are more than offset by lower results in merchandising. However, depending on how market conditions evolve over the remainder of the year, there could be upside to our segment outlook.\nIn Refined specialty oils, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook and in line with last year's record performance. In Milling, full year results are expected to be lower than our prior outlook and significantly down from a strong prior year.\nIn Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023, an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%, net interest expense in the range of $350 million to $370 million, which is down from our prior outlook of $360 million to $390 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, which is up $200 million from our prior outlook, reflecting the purchase of the U.S. Oil refinery during the second quarter, and depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our top strategic priorities so we can better serve the needs of customers, both farmers and end consumers regardless of the market environment.\nOver the last several years, we've seen more volatility in the market, and we're all managing through challenges, including food security, market access and the increasing demand for sustainable food, feed and fuel production.\nAs the world's population continues to grow, it will take a collective effort in the industry to more efficiently address these challenges, and Bunge has an important role to play.\nTogether with Viterra, we will be able to utilize our combined platforms and capabilities to more broadly and rapidly expand our work to support sustainable and transparent value chains. This includes promoting sustainable practices such as low carbon product streams, the acceleration of regenerative agriculture to reduce GHG emissions and importantly, full end-to-end traceability across major crops.\nDuring the quarter, we announced the creation of a regenerative agricultural program in Brazil in partnership with Origeo to support Brazilian farmers in the transition to low-carbon agriculture, offering technical support tools, products and services. The program has already enrolled large-scale farmers covering more than 250,000 hectares.\nWe also launched a strategic alliance and commercial agreement with Nutrien Ag Solutions to support U.S. farmers in the implementation of sustainable farming practices that will help increase the development of lower carbon products. This alliance will further strengthen Bunge's connection with farmers in the U.S. and create value for participants across all our value chains. We continue to evaluate and execute on our pipeline of bolt-on M&A opportunities as we work through the process of combining with Vitera. And overall, we're well positioned to deliver on our purpose of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential and sustainable food, feed and fuel to the world while always looking for ways to improve.\nAnd with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Weisner. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Archer Daniels Midland Co.\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation and we encourage you to review these factors.\nOn the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for their continued focus and strong execution. While the volatility in the quarter was less than we experienced last year, we're still in a highly dynamic operating environment. The resiliency of our team are deep partnerships with customers across the value chain and our global platform enabled us to deliver another quarter of strong results.\nOur focus is on continuing to invest in strengthening our business so that we can provide customers from farmers to end consumers with solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing them not only today but as we look ahead. The work we have done to improve and integrate our operational, commercial and risk management approach has enabled us to effectively manage through supply disruptions, severe weather impacts the lingering effects of the pandemic and the volatility in financial markets.\nWhen we execute and capitalize on the options our global footprint provides us along with our team's commitment to quality, service and innovation, we create value for all of our stakeholders. In short, we continue to demonstrate that our team and our diverse platform give us the ability to succeed in any operating environment and help our customers do the same.\nTurning to the first quarter. While many of the factors that drove extreme volatility this time last year are still in place, markets have stabilized somewhat. Our numbers this quarter reflect performance that was among the best in first quarters in Bunge's history, although down from prior year's record results, which reflected those major market dislocations.\nAdjusted core segment EBIT in the first quarter benefited from a record performance in Refined & Specialty oils, offset by lower results in the remaining core segments. This is an industry that requires a long-term view and we're managing our business to maximize our earnings power over long periods of time.\nOur EPS over the last 4 years demonstrates the impact of the team's hard work to drive operational performance, optimize our portfolio and strengthen our financial discipline. Looking ahead and based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we are reaffirming our guidance for full year adjusted EPS to be at least $11. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through financial results in detail, and we'll then close with some additional thoughts on the remainder of the year. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $4.15 compared to $4.48 in the first quarter of 2022. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.84 per share and a positive impact of $0.05 per share related to onetime items.\nAdjusted EPS was $3.26 in the quarter versus $426 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $756 million in the quarter versus $858 million last year. Agribusiness started the year off well. However, results were down from last year's particularly strong performance.\nIn processing, lower results in the quarter were primarily driven by soy crush. Improved performances in North America and Brazil, which benefited from strong protein and oil demand and reduced Argentine exports were more than offset by lower results in Argentina, Europe and Asia.\nIn merchandising, results were lower in the quarter as margins declined from last year's levels, which were impacted by market disruptions due to tight supplies and the war in Ukraine. Refined and specialty oils also started the year off on a strong note.\nAll regions performed well with notable year-over-year improvements in North America and South America, both of which benefited from strong food and renewable fuel demand as well as effective utilization of our distribution network.\nIn Milling, lower results were driven by South America where the small Argentine wheat crop negatively impacted our local upstream merchandising. This was partially offset by stronger structural margins in our milling operations in Brazil.\nResults in the U.S. were down slightly. Segment results in the prior year benefited from very strong South American origination margins during a period of high market volatility. The increase in corporate expenses in the quarter was largely driven by growth-related initiatives, offset in part by an increase in other results primarily related to Bunge Ventures.\nLower results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by lower Brazilian ethanol prices and higher costs. Adjusting for notable items, net interest expense of $69 million in the quarter was up compared to last year, primarily due to higher variable interest rates, partially offset by higher investments in interest-bearing cash instruments and lower average debt levels.\nFor the quarter, reported income tax expense was $183 million compared to $108 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a change in geographic earnings mix as well as higher tax benefits in 2022 from releases of valuation allowances in Europe and Asia.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months. This performance trend not only reflects the strength and resiliency of our global network of integrated assets and capabilities but also demonstrates the outstanding performance and agility of our team to adjust to the changing market conditions.\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation of the $625 million of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first quarter. After allocating $86 million of sustaining CapEx which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety. We had approximately $540 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $94 million in common dividends and invested $87 million in growth in productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $360 million of retained cash flow.\nDuring the first quarter, we did not repurchase shares. As we have discussed previously, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation and share repurchases are absolutely a component of that mix. However, they have been on hold over the last 2 quarters as we've been actively engaged in a variety of discussions to expand our global platform, scale and core capabilities. As we have been in the past, we will be disciplined and make the right decisions as quickly as possible. We believe our stock is undervalued and look forward to getting back in the market to continue our share repurchase program as soon as possible.\nAs shown on Slide 8, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $4.5 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital while reducing debt.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19.8%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.4%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%. At the end of the quarter, we had an unusually large cash balance of approximately $3 billion most of which is expected to be used toward repayment of upcoming debt maturities and increased working capital during the second quarter.\nWhen adjusting for this, the trailing 12-month ROIC and adjusted ROIC for the quarter were more in line with the previous 12-month period. Note that we increased both our WACC and adjusted WACC from 6% and 6.6%, respectively, to 7% to 7.7%, respectively, reflecting the current higher interest rate environment.\nMoving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of over $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of 18.2%. Similarly, we increased our cost of equity from 7% to 8.2%, reflecting the more recent market environment.\nPlease turn to Slide 12 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account first quarter results and the current margin environment of forward curves. We continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share.\nIn Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from last year with slightly higher results in processing, but more than offset by lower results in merchandising. However, depending on how market conditions evolve over the remainder of the year, there could be upside to our segment outlook.\nIn Refined specialty oils, based on our stronger-than-expected first quarter performance, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook, but still below last year's record performance. In Milling, full year results are now expected to be down from our prior forecast, reflecting a more challenging than expected first quarter.\nIn Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023: an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%; net interest expense in the range of $360 million to $390 million, which is down from our previous expectation; capital expenditures in the range of $800 million to $1 billion and depreciation; and amortization of approximately $415 million. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. Looking ahead, we're focused on investing to grow the business so we can increase our ability to serve our farmers and consumers regardless of the environment we're operating in.\nIn the first quarter, we made strategic investments in our growth areas, including focusing on core origination and crush operations, expanding our innovative refined and specialty oil products and solutions and increasing our participation in renewable feedstocks and plant-based proteins.\nAs part of our culture of continuous improvement, investments we made in our origination and crush operations are already showing results. Improvements in maintenance and reliability processes reduced overall unplanned downtime to a record low for the company.\nOur energy reduction projects are showing strong results, and we put through record volumes in our ports in Brazil by adjusting our product mix to improve efficiency. Within Refined & specialty oils, in April, we announced the acquisition of Fuji Oil's newly constructed port-based refinery in Louisiana. This is part of our long-term strategy to expand our specialty oils business, by increasing our ability to serve our food customers with a variety of feedstocks.\nThe team did a fantastic job of onboarding our new colleagues, and we've already started serving food customers from that facility. Investing in innovation and technologies that support low-carbon initiatives are also a key part of our strategy. We've increased our participation in renewable feedstocks announcing a collaboration with Chevron and Cortiva AgroSciences to introduce proprietary winter canola hybrids to produce plant-based oils with lower carbon profiles. This creates new revenue opportunities for farmers with a sustainable crop rotation.\nOur goal is to increase the availability of vegetable oil feedstocks serving the growing demand for the domestic renewable fuels market. It is also another step in our commitment to creating clear paths to support decarbonization. We also announced a multiyear collaboration with Corteva to develop and commercialize soybean varieties that create new value for soybean farmers and feed customers.\nThe protein meal from these varieties is expected to reduce the use of synthetic additives, lower costs and shrink their carbon footprint. This is another example of how our role as the global leader in oilseed processing uniquely positions us to leverage upstream and downstream partnerships with leading and innovative industry players to unlock value for our customers along the value chain.\nExecuting our growth strategy will enable us to deliver on our purpose of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver sustainable and essential food, feed and fuel to the world. Many of the investments and partnerships we've announced, along with others in our pipeline, offer new tools and solutions to connect farmers with markets that value sustainable operations and production. And with that, we'll turn to the Q&A."

I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking the team for delivering another quarter of outstanding results by performing exceptionally well in this highly dynamic environment. Our team remains focused on executing our day-to-day business, effectively utilizing our global footprint and adapting to changing market conditions to meet the needs of our customers, both farmers and in consumers.\nAt the same time, the team continued to make good progress on our integration planning with Viterra. During this process, our teams had the opportunity to work with the Viterra team, reinforcing how similar our cultures are and increasing our confidence in the combination and the value it will create.\nWe reached a significant milestone in October, receiving overwhelming shareholder approval for the merger. We continue to engage with the appropriate regulatory agencies and expect to close the transaction in mid-2024. While we will continue to operate as 2 separate companies until we close, we're looking forward to bringing our teams and assets together to create a premier Agribusiness solutions company.\nTurning to the third quarter. We delivered strong operating results, driven by refined and specialty oils and processing. We also saw strong performance in our noncore sugar business John will cover our financial results in more detail.\nIn addition, since we reported second quarter results, we repurchased approximately $600 million of Bunge common shares, making meaningful progress against the repurchase plan we outlined following the announcement of the Viterra transaction.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of the year and based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we now expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $12.50 and depending on how market conditions continue to evolve, we see the potential for upside. I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results and outlook in more detail, and we'll then close with some additional thoughts. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nChief Financial Officer, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported third quarter earnings per share was $2.47 compared to $2.49 in the third quarter of 2022. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.14 per share and a negative impact of $0.38 per share, primarily related to acquisition and integration costs associated with our announced business combination agreement with Viterra.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.99 in the third quarter versus $3.45 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $735 million in the quarter versus $740 million last year. Agribusiness adjusted results of $472 million were down compared to last year as a slightly higher performance in processing was more than offset by lower results in merchandising.\nIn processing, higher results in Brazil soy origination, Asia and North America were largely offset by drought impacted results in Argentina. Results in Europe were in line with last year as improved performance in soft seeds was offset by lower results in soy crush.\nIn merchandising, higher results in our global corn value chain, which benefited from the large Brazilian safrinha corn crop were more than offset by lower results in financial services and our global wheat value chain. Higher refining specialty oils results were primarily driven by North America. Higher results in Asia, led by our India business also contributed to the improved performance. Results in South America and Europe were lower.\nIn Milling, higher results were primarily driven by our South American operations, reflecting improved margins due to the combination of lower wheat costs and more favorable channel mix. Results in the U.S. were also higher. The increase in corporate expenses primarily reflected investments in growth initiatives as well as performance-related compensation accruals.\nLower other results were related to Bunge Ventures in our captive insurance program. Better results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher sugar prices, which more than offset lower ethanol prices. Net interest expense of $95 million in the quarter was higher compared to last year, primarily due to higher average variable interest rates.\nFor the first 9 months of the year, income tax expense was $495 million compared to $257 million in the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher pretax income in 2023 and as well as a change in geographic earnings mix.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our adjusted EPS and EBIT trends over the past 4 years, along with the trailing 12 months, reflecting our team's continued excellent performance while also delivering on a variety of growth and productivity initiatives.\nSlide 7 details our capital allocation of the nearly $1.9 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated year-to-date. After allocating $321 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental health and safety, we had approximately $1.6 billion of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $287 million in common dividends, invested $484 million in growth in productivity related CapEx, which is up significantly from $168 million this time last year and repurchased $466 million of Bunge shares, leaving $377 million of retained cash flow.\nIn October, we repurchased an additional $134 million of Bunge shares bringing the total amount of repurchases to $600 million since we reported Q2 earnings in early August. This leaves us with approximately $1.4 billion remaining on our existing $2 billion authorization. We expect to complete about half of the authorization prior to the close of the Viterra transaction, with the remainder to be completed within 18 months of that date.\nAs shown on Slide 8, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.2 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow to fund working capital while reducing debt. Our adjusted leverage ratio, which reflects our adjusted net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 0.3x at the end of the third quarter.\nSlide 9 highlights our liquidity position. At quarter end, all $5.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available, providing us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs.\nPlease turn to Slide 10. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 7.7%. ROIC was 14.4%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 7%.\nMoving to Slide 11. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 19.2%. Please turn to Slide 12 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account year-to-date results in the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year 2023 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $12.50 with potential upside depending on how market conditions evolve over the balance of the year.\nIn Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be up from the prior year outlook and in line with last year as higher results in processing are largely offset by lower results in merchandising. In Refined specialty oils, full year results are expected to be up from our prior outlook and last year's record performance.\nIn Milling, full year results are expected to be in line with our prior outlook and significantly down from a strong prior year. In Corporate and Other results are expected to be down from our prior forecast and last year. In noncore, full year results in our Sugar and Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be up from our prior outlook and higher than last year. Additionally, the company expects a falling for 2023, an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%, net interest expense in the range of $340 million to $360 million, which is down from our prior outlook of $350 million to $370 million.\nCapital expenditures in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion and depreciation and amortization of approximately $425 million, which is up $10 million from our prior outlook. With that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Bunge Ltd.\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few thoughts. So looking at the longer term, the fundamental drivers of our business remain in place. Global population continues to grow and the need for sustainable solutions to meet that demand means the world will continue to look to Bunge to supply essential products and services to the feed, food and fuel industries.\nOur strategic combination with Viterra will help us accelerate our long-term growth with greater diversification across customers, assets, geographies and crops, we're creating a platform with enhanced efficiencies, connectivity and capabilities across value chains. This will provide us with more optionality and allow us to even better serve the needs of both farmers and in consumers regardless of market environment.\nIn addition, we're continuing to progress on our other important growth initiatives, including enhancing our footprint with targeted greenfield and bolt-on acquisitions, deepening our relationships with customers at both ends of the value chain, strengthening our digital capabilities and investing in innovative and sustainability-oriented programs and products.\nIn Brazil, we reached an agreement to acquire CJ Selecta, a leading manufacturer and exporter of soy protein concentrate in Brazil. Construction is also progressing well on our soy protein concentrate plant in Morristown, Indiana, and we're nearly ready to begin serving customers from our new highly efficient multi-oil facility in India.\nTo continue to help our customers meet the demand for sustainability and low CI crops, we're executing on regenerative agricultural projects with multiple customers in multiple countries, helping to build sustainable, integrated supply chains and expand global regenerative agricultural practices.\nFor instance, tomorrow, Bunge and CP Food, a leading Asian feed and food company, will announce a collaboration to develop a black chain solution for the traceability of deforestation free soy from Brazil. We're proud of the progress we're making, but also know there's still much to do as we continue positioning Bunge to deliver on our critical mission of connecting farmers to consumers to deliver essential food, feed and fuel to the world.\nI continue to be impressed by the energy, collaboration, innovation and commitment of the Bunge team as we work together and with key partners to find solutions to the world's most pressing food security issues. And with that, we'll turn to Q&A. Thank you"

Our continued strong results speak to the flexibility of our platform and team, which, as I've said before, are built to adjust and even excel in volatile times.\nIn this year that had more than its share of ups and downs, our team proved their ability to help our customers, both farmers and end users globally, manage risks and navigate food security issues against the backdrop of regional conflict, weather impacts and many other factors.\nI want to thank the team for their continued dedication to strong execution which allowed us to build on our positive momentum and deliver our fourth consecutive year of earnings growth. We're focused on our mission and it shows in our financial results.\nLooking at the fourth quarter numbers, adjusted core segment EBIT came in above last year's results, largely driven by strong performance across all regions in Refined and Specialty Oils. John will go into our results in more detail, but I want to note our performance reflects our rigorous and disciplined approach to the business, including our focus on operating costs and the returns on capital we're investing.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we expect the market environment to be similar to 2022 with many of the same drivers still in place, that includes a globally tight crop supply, strong demand for our core protein meal and vegetable oil products and the continued impact to global trade of commodity price volatility and supply chain disruptions.\nWe also expect to see global demand for feedstocks and related services for renewable fuels continue to grow. Based on what we see in the market and the forward curves today, we expect full year adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share for 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll hand the call over to John to walk through the results and the outlook in more detail.\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $2.21 compared to $1.52 in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our reported results included a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.56 per share and a negative impact of $0.47 per share related to onetime items.\nAdjusted EPS was $3.24 in the fourth quarter versus $3.49 in the prior year. Full year results for 2022 were $10.51 versus $13.64 in 2021. Adjusted full year EPS was $13.91 versus $12.93 in the prior year, an increase of nearly $1 per share. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $804 million in the quarter versus $766 million last year.\nAgribusiness finished with an outstanding year with another strong quarter that was in line with last year. In processing, results were primarily driven by North America, which benefited from the combination of large soy and canola crops and strong meal and oil demand. Partially offsetting this strong performance were lower results in Europe and South America.\nEurope was negatively impacted by higher energy costs and lower volume that included increased planned downtime and the idling of our operations in Ukraine. In South America, tight bean supplies reduced margins. In merchandising, higher results in global grains were more than offset by lower results in global oils marketing, which had a particularly strong prior year.\nRefined and Specialty Oils finished another record year with strong fourth quarter results of $222 million, up $68 million compared to last year. All regions performed well in the fourth quarter, benefiting from strong food and renewable fuel demand with notable year-over-year improvements in Europe, Asia and South America.\nIn Milling, the loss in the quarter was primarily driven by lower origination volume and high supply chain costs, reflecting the small Argentine wheat crop that negatively impacted our merchandising operations. Results in the prior year benefited from contributions from our Mexico wheat mills, which we sold in the third quarter of 2022.\nCorporate and Other was in line with last year. A decrease in corporate expense is primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals, was offset by results in our captive insurance program and lower results in Bunge Ventures.\nImproved results in our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher sugar prices, which more than offset lower ethanol margins. For the quarter, reported income tax expense was $131 million compared to $64 million for the prior year. The increase was due to higher pretax income and a year-to-date adjustment in actual geographic earnings mix.\nAdjusting for notable items and mark-to-market timing, the effective tax rate for the full year was 17% compared to approximately 16% for the prior year. Net interest expense of $76 million in the quarter was up compared to last year due to higher interest rates, partially offset by lower average debt levels.\nAlso impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offset with currency hedges reported in gross margin.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. This not only demonstrates the power of our global asset networking capabilities, but also the continued outstanding performance by our team. Each of these years brought a different set of rapidly changing circumstances and the team successfully navigated through them, while also executing on numerous company initiatives.\nAs shown on Slide 7, our full year addressable SG&A increased modestly year-over-year, reflecting a resumption of more normal business activities as well as increasing investments to strengthen our capabilities and to drive growth, particularly in technology. We expect higher SG&A in 2023 related to these initiatives, which we have considered in our outlook.\nSlide 8 details our capital allocation of the approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in 2022. After allocating $306 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety and $8 million to preferred dividends on shares now converted to common equity, we had approximately $2 billion of discretionary cash flow available.\nOf this amount, we paid $341 million in common dividends, invested $249 million in growth and productivity CapEx and repurchased $200 million of common shares. The approximately $1.3 billion of retained cash flow was invested in additional working capital and toward reducing debt.\nAs we laid out in our earnings growth framework in the second quarter of last year, we expect to repurchase about $250 million of stock each year, but actual amounts could vary. During 2023, we expect to deplete the remaining $300 million of our existing $500 million program which was announced in October 2021 and approve an additional share repurchase program.\nMoving to Slide 9. We finished 2022 with a total CapEx spend of $555 million, which was about $50 million lower than we expected in our Q3 forecast. The primary drivers of the reduction were supply chain delays on long lead time equipment as well as additional project planning time, as we look more closely for opportunities to offset inflationary pressures.\nWe expect continued delays in 2023, which are reflected in our current outlook. Lead times for simpler equipment and parts are showing signs of normalizing. However, due to increased project costs, we are reassessing the scope and timing of certain discretionary investments.\nAs shown on Slide 10, at year-end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $3.2 billion. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital while reducing debt.\nSlide 11 highlights our liquidity position. At year-end, all $6.7 billion of our committed credit facilities was unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing capital needs.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 21.6%, well above our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 15%, also well above our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between ROIC and adjusted ROIC reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit. Moving to Slide 13. For the year, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $2.1 billion and a cash flow yield of 20%.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 and our 2023 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2023 adjusted EPS of at least $11 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from last year as slightly higher results in processing are more than offset by lower results in merchandising, which had a very strong prior year.\nWhile we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook if strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue throughout the year.\nIn Refined and Specialty Oils, we expect a favorable environment to continue in 2023. However, we expect segment results to be modestly down from 2022's record year, which reflect very strong results in all regions. In Milling, full year results are expected to be down from last year, but in line with historical performance. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be in line with last year.\nIn noncore, full year results in our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year. Additionally, the company expects the following for 2023: an adjusted annual effective tax rate in the range of 20% to 24%. However, note that this will ultimately be driven by geographic earnings mix of the company. Net interest expense in the range of $380 million to $410 million. Capital expenditures in the range of $800 million to $1 billion, down slightly from our earlier expectation of just over $1 billion due to the reasons discussed earlier, and appreciate -- depreciation and amortization of approximately $415 million.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. This past year demonstrated the critical role we play in global food security and maintaining flows of crops from farmers to consumers. To ensure we can continue to deliver, we further strengthened our core business and built relationships with partners whose capabilities complement Bunge's.\nFor example, our Orígeo joint venture with UPL began operating in the fourth quarter, providing end-to-end solutions to farmers in Brazil. We also announced a partnership with BZ Group in France to strengthen our global platform by connecting with BZ's network of independent farmers to bring more opportunities and flexible solutions to them and end users globally.\nDuring 2022, we made great progress on our commitment to finding innovative, sustainable solutions in the renewable space, including our JV with Chevron, our partnership with CoverCress, and our JV with [Orígeo].\nWe continue to innovating and investing in plant-based lipids and proteins at our R&D and innovation facilities. Our team is working alongside customers as they create unique solutions with plant-based ingredients. We continued investing in data science and technology to better connect farmers and consumers by making our operations even more efficient in delivering real-time insights to help us manage our business.\nAnd science and technology are also key, as we continue to make great strides in our sustainability efforts. Thanks to expanding satellite monitoring, we were able to announce this week that through the Bunge sustainable partnership, we have now achieved traceability and monitoring for 80% of our indirect supply chain in the Brazilian Cerrado.\nThis is in addition to our ability to trace 100% of direct purchases in the priority regions of South America. Improving traceability through our indirect sources of product is a critical step in meeting our industry-leading goal of achieving deforestation-free supply chains in 2025. While we're proud of the progress we've made, a more sustainable tomorrow requires everyone across the value chain to work together.\nBunge's approach will continue to be grounded in solid science, proven technologies, incredible methodologies. With our critical place in the global food supply chain, we look forward to continuing to engage with other companies and organizations in the food and agricultural sectors to find new solutions, and importantly, connect with tens of thousands of farmers around the world on these critical issues.\nAnd with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

Welcome to the BAWAG Group Q3 2022 Results Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded and a transcript thereof will be published on the company's website.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Anas Abuzaakouk, CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nAnas Abuzaakouk\n\nChairman of the Management Board & CEO, BAWAG Group AG\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I hope everyone is keeping well. I'm joined this morning by Enver, our CFO. Before we start with the summary of the third quarter operating results on Slide 2, let me address the City of Linz legal case. In August, the Austria Supreme Court ruled that the swap contract entered between BAWAG and the City of Linz almost 15 years ago was invalid. As a result of the ruling, we took a pretax write-off of EUR 254 million equal to EUR 190 million impact after tax related to the City of Linz receivable on the balance sheet. As the write-off was fully absorbed in regulatory capital in prior years, this will have no impact on our capital distribution plans for 2022. The write-off also resulted in a reduction of 40 basis points to our NPL ratio as the receivable is classified as an NPL in the past.\nFor the remainder of the presentation, all earnings will be presented on an adjusted basis excluding the City of Linz impact as this provides a more meaningful presentation of our operating performance as well as capital distributions. For the third quarter we delivered net profit of EUR 132 million, earnings per share of EUR 1.49 and a return on tangible common equity of 19%. The operating performance of our business was very strong with pre-provision profits of EUR 218 million and a cost-income ratio of 35%. Total risk costs were EUR 35 million inclusive of a EUR 12 million increase in our ECL management overlay bringing our management overlay to EUR 82 million despite sound credit performance and a record low NPL ratio of 1%. In terms of balance sheet and capital, average customer loans were flat quarter-over-quarter and up 9% year-over-year.\nWe are seeing a slowdown in loan growth as customers grow more cautious and deal with the impact of inflation, repricing of loans and uncertain economic environment. Customer loan growth will continue to be subdued in the quarters ahead and offset with the buildup in our securities portfolio as the widening of credit spreads provides for more attractive risk-adjusted returns. In terms of capital development, we generated approximately 60 basis points of gross capital during the quarter. Our CET1 ratio landed at 13% after deducting the year-to-date dividend accrual of EUR 207 million and the EUR 325 million share buyback program. Given the significant inflationary environment and rising interest rates, the bank is positively positioned for a rising rate environment with our retail deposit franchise. This will further add to our positive operating leverage and gradually materialize in the coming quarters.\nWith our strong operating performance during the first 3 quarters of the year and despite potential headwinds building up, we are on track to deliver on all 2022 targets; a profit before tax greater than EUR 675 million, a return on tangible common equity greater than 17% and a cost-income ratio under 38%. We plan to update our original 2025 target at year-end as well. In terms of our existing share buyback program of EUR 325 million, we have executed approximately 65% of the buyback and expect to have this completed by end of year. We will address any further capital distributions around year-end results based on market developments and subject to regulatory approvals. Above all else, we want to make sure we are prudent in our capital distribution plans, always maintaining our fortress balance sheet and ensure we have sufficient dry powder to address potential organic and inorganic opportunities in the coming quarters.\nMarket downturns and dislocations present unique opportunities if you have capital, liquidity and a fortress balance sheet with solid capital generation throughout all cycles. Given the headwinds we see building up from volatility in the energy markets, persistently high inflation, subdued consumer sentiment, prolonged geopolitical conflicts and the repricing of credit risk; we have added to our management overlay as we take a cautious and prudent approach to provisioning in the quarters ahead. Our ACL management overlay, which now stands at EUR 82 million, is equal to almost a full year of normal annual risk costs. We will look to continue and build this up in the fourth quarter as well given the volatility and uncertainty ahead. The management overlay is specifically intended to address any severe downturn and heightened volatility in the quarters ahead despite our very low NPL ratio of 1% and solid credit performance across the business to-date.\nAs I've stated in the past, our actions are borne out of an abundance of caution no different than how we reacted during the early days of the pandemic or more broadly the conservatism that underpins how we've run our business over the past decade. Moving to Slide 3. We delivered net profit of EUR 132 million, up 7% versus prior year. Overall, strong operating performance with operating income of EUR 336 million and total expenses of EUR 118 million, up 9% and down 2% respectively versus prior year. Pre-provision profits were EUR 218 million, up 17% versus prior year. Risk costs were EUR 35 million, up 64% versus prior year driven primarily by the buildup of our management overlay. Tangible book value per share was EUR 31.40, down 9% versus prior year and down 1% versus prior quarter. This captures the deduction of the year-to-date 2022 dividend accrual of EUR 207 million, the EUR 325 million share buyback and the EUR 190 million after-tax write-off related to the City of Linz receivable.\nMoving on to Slide 4. At the end of the third quarter our CET1 ratio was 13%, up 30 basis points from 2Q with approximately EUR 150 million excess capital above our CET1 target of 12.25%. For the quarter we generated approximately 60 basis points of gross capital from earnings, which was offset by negative OCI movements of 10 basis points primarily driven by widening credit spreads and a positive impact of 10 basis points in regulatory capital stemming from the City of Linz write-off.\nThe dividend accrual for the quarter was equal to approximately 30 basis points. On a year-to-date basis we have generated 180 basis points of gross capital offset by growth in RWAs, which consumed about 50 basis points, and negative OCI hit of 50 basis points primarily from widening credit spreads and FX movements. Despite the overall volatility we are witnessing that can impact capital in many ways, we believe we are well positioned to address multiple market opportunities given our earnings, capital and funding base.\nOur total capital distributions for the year reflect deducting the year-to-date 2022 dividend accrual of EUR 207 million, which reflects a payout ratio of 55% of adjusted net profits in 2022, the EUR 325 million in share buyback and the acquisition of a consumer loan portfolio earlier in the year. Net of all M&A and capital distributions, we landed at 13% CET1 ratio. Following our capital distribution framework, our primary focus is to deploy our capital into organic growth and value enhancing M&A.\nWe currently see several potential organic and inorganic opportunities that we will be assessing over the coming quarters. On Slide 5, our Retail & SME business delivered net profit of EUR 111 million, up 17% versus prior year and generating a very strong return on tangible common equity of 33% and a cost-income ratio of 33%. Average assets for the quarter were EUR 22.5 billion, up 9% versus prior year and 2% versus prior quarter.\nAverage customer deposits were EUR 27.8 billion, up 3% versus prior year and down 1% versus prior quarter. RWAs in the segment were EUR 9.5 billion, up 18% versus prior year and 1% versus prior quarter. Pre-provision profits were EUR 172 million, up 21% compared to the prior year with operating income up 12% and operating expenses down 2% resulting from prior year operational initiatives with a continued focus on driving synergies across our various channels and products.\nRisk costs were EUR 23 million, up 51% versus prior year driven by an incremental EUR 6 million booking of the management overlay. The underlying core retail cost run rate is at EUR 17 million per quarter with the addition of the acquired consumer loan portfolio at the end of the second quarter. The trend in asset quality continues to hold across our customer base with a stable low NPL ratio of 1.9%.\nAcross the business, we will remain prudent and cautious as we've tightened our credit box given the increasing headwinds. We also continue to maintain our pricing discipline as we focus on risk-adjusted returns and price against movement in swap rates across the curve. We expect continued earnings growth across the Retail & SME franchise for the remainder of 2022 and going into 2023. However, we see subdued loan growth in the quarters ahead given overall cautious consumer sentiment, impacts of inflation on daily spending and a wait and see approach to new investments as well as the repricing of credit.\nOn Slide 6, our Corporate, Real Estate & Public Sector business delivered net profit of EUR 35 million, down 12% versus the prior year due to the booking of incremental management overlay, but still generating a strong return on tangible common equity of 16% and a cost-income ratio of 23%.\nAverage assets for the quarter were EUR 15.5 billion, up 10% versus prior year and down 2% versus prior quarter. Pre-provision profits were EUR 60 million, down 2% compared to the prior year. However, core revenues were up 6%. Risk costs were EUR 11 million, up 93% versus prior year driven by the incremental EUR 6 million booking of the management overlay. The trend in asset quality continues to be solid with our NPL ratio of 70 basis points, down 30 basis points versus prior year and flat versus prior quarter.\nWe continue to see diversified lending opportunities with a solid pipeline in commitments that we expect to fund in the coming months. We will continue to maintain our disciplined underwriting, focus on risk-adjusted returns and avoid blindly chasing volume growth. As the markets reprice credit risk, which we believe was long overdue, we have further tightened our credit box and adjusted our risk return criteria given the uncertainty ahead and reflecting our disciplined approach to lending.\nWith that, I'll hand over to Enver.\n\nEnver Sirucic\n\nCFO, Deputy CEO & Member of Management Board, BAWAG Group AG\n\nThank you, Anas. I'll continue on Slide 8. Solid operating performance in the third quarter with core revenues up 2% versus prior quarter, with net interest income being up 4% with first impacts from higher interest rates and net commission income down 4% due to overall market environment and a slowdown in the advisory business. Operating expenses remained stable at EUR 118 million and our cost-income ratio landed at around 35% for the quarter.\nTotal risk costs were EUR 35 million inclusive of a EUR 12 million increase in our ECL management overlay bringing it to EUR 82 million, which equals almost a full year of normal annual risk costs. On Slide 9, key developments of our balance sheet. Average interest-bearing assets and risk-weighted assets remained at the same levels as in Q2. Customer deposits were slightly up while we increased our own issues by more than 11% through issuing EUR 1.25 billion covered bond and CHF125 million senior preferred note in Q3.\nCET1 capital and the CET1 ratio improved by 2% and 30 basis points, respectively, mainly coming from solid earnings generation post the dividend accrual. On Slide 10, core revenues. Stronger net interest income up 4% versus second quarter. Net interest margin improved to 231 basis points for the quarter driven by mainly increasing interest rates. Our interest rate sensitivity remains unchanged with 200 basis points increase in overnight rates and 3-month Euribor leading to approximately EUR 200 million increase in net interest income per year.\nGiven the re-fixing structure of our assets, it takes around 4 to 5 months to see the full effect of a rate increase reflected in our run rate, which means that the NII improvement will gradually materialize in the coming quarters. As mentioned before, net commission income was down 4% as we see a slowdown in our advisory business given the uncertainty and volatile market environment, which is likely to continue for the rest of the year.\nHaving said that, we have a positive view on core revenues for the rest of the year. That is why we again updated our outlook from previously over 7% core revenue growth to around 9% growth in 2022. Moving on to Slide 11. We continue to maintain operating expenses at stable levels despite significant headwinds. Cost-income ratio continued to improve and stands now at 35% for the quarter, which is well ahead of our 2022 target of below 38%. We'll also continue to focus on our absolute cost-out target and we are confident to achieve a net cost-out of around 2% in 2022.\nSlide 12, risk costs. Overall unchanged conservative prudent approach on provisioning with stable underlying trends and strong asset quality with an NPL ratio of 1%. The underlying core retail risk cost run rate is around EUR 17 million per quarter including the portfolio acquisition in the second quarter and the total risk cost ratio is around 20 basis points.\nWe added EUR 12 million to our ECL management overlay, which now stands at EUR 82 million and is equal to almost a full year of normal risk costs. For the rest of the year, we expect a stable underlying risk cost ratio of around 20 basis points. In addition, we'll look to continue and build up the management overlay in the fourth quarter. And on Slide 13, so we are confirming our 2022 outlook. With our strong operating performance during the first 3 quarters of the year, we are on track to deliver all 2022 targets; a profit before tax of greater than EUR 675 million, a return on tangible common equity of greater than 17% and a cost-income ratio of below 38%. As mentioned earlier, we have again upgraded our core revenue growth outlook from previously greater than 7% to around 9%. Everything else remains unchanged.\nAnd with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVP of IR, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, Jason, and thank you for joining us this morning for our second quarter earnings call. Before we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations.\nReconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure are posted on our website as well.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties.\nBunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors.\nOn the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann. Good morning, everyone. I want to start by congratulating our team for another strong quarter, thanks to their continued focused execution in this highly dynamic environment.\nThe results that the team delivered confirms that Bunge's global asset footprint, coupled with our operating model, enables us to more quickly adapt to market shifts. Those changes can be difficult to immediately predict, but our team has the agility and discipline to adjust and capitalize on market opportunities over time. With our flexibility and global view of the end-to-end value chains, we're able to help our customers find solutions to the challenges and opportunities they encounter.\nThe war in Ukraine has dramatically upset traditional origin to destination trade flows, and we've worked to find different sources for products that our customers want. Our innovation teams have also been working alongside our customers to help them reformulate products in response to tightening supplies.\nAt the same time, we're keeping our focus on sustainability, including our commitment to have deforestation-free supply chains in 2025. Bunge's sustainable partnership program uses tools like farm scale satellite monitoring to help resellers assess their suppliers' social environmental performance in the Brazilian Cerrado.\nAs described in our most recent sustainability report, Bunge is now able to monitor at least 64% of indirect volumes in our priority regions, surpassing the 50% target set for the end of 2022.\nOur ability to optimize value for both our customers and Bunge is reflected in our results today as well as in our long-term view of our opportunity, which we'll touch on later. But first, turning to second quarter numbers.\nWe continue to build on our strong momentum, delivering our 11th consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth. Results in Agribusiness and also in Refined and Specialty Oils benefited from strong demand and continued tight commodity supplies. Milling results were up, delivering a record quarter, as our teams effectively managed our supply chains in a dynamic environment.\nLooking ahead, we're expecting to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $12 per share for the full year 2022, and that's up from the outlook we provided last quarter. This includes increased estimates in all of our core segments.\nSupplies remain tight in the physical markets across all of our key businesses, regardless of the commodity volatility driven by the broader financial markets. Regular seasonal production factors and continued global supply chain challenges make the value of the services we bring to our customers more relevant than ever and gives us confidence in our outlook.\nBefore handing it over to John, I want to take a moment to discuss both the updated earnings baseline and the growth framework we've announced today. When we first introduced our mid-cycle baseline in June of 2020, we were early in our work to transform our operating model and optimize our portfolio. We provided that earnings framework to help you think about how we intended to operate the business with the changes we were making.\nWith the initial portfolio and organizational work now behind us, we're updating our baseline in the earnings framework from $7 to $8.50, and that reflects our global platform as it stands today. This includes the structural improvements in the oilseed market environment and greater benefits from our operating model.\nWe're also providing you with a way to think about what our platform can deliver in the future, and that's because we've been deploying capital for growth, making investments in our business that will continue to increase our earnings baseline. We also intend to allocate capital for share repurchases.\nThe incremental earnings from capital that we're deploying should enable us to perform at a higher level in a mid-cycle environment. As a result, we're providing a 4-year earnings growth framework of approximately $11 per share by the end of 2026. This growth framework includes the increased earnings baseline of $8.50, plus the future benefits of investments in the business and share repurchases.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to John to walk through the results and the updated framework in more detail.\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported second quarter earnings per share was $1.34 compared to $2.37 in the second quarter of 2021. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $1.26 per share and a negative impact of $0.37 per share related to onetime items.\nAdjusted EPS was $2.97 in the quarter versus $2.61 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $709 million in the quarter versus $550 million last year, reflecting higher results in Ag Processing, Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling.\nIn total, Agribusiness results of $386 million were down compared to last year. The higher results in processing were primarily driven by U.S. and Brazil soy crush due to strong mill and oil demand. Results in softseed crush were also higher primarily driven by North America.\nMerchandising had a good quarter managing market volatility well. However, results were down compared to a very strong prior year as the higher contribution from global grains was more than offset by lower results in ocean freight.\nIn Refined and Specialty Oils, results were higher in all regions with particular strength in North America and Europe refining, both benefiting from strong food demand as well as strong U.S. fuel demand.\nIn Milling, higher results in the quarter were driven by North and South America wheat milling, reflecting higher margins and effective risk management of our supply chains.\nThe increase in corporate expenses in the quarter was primarily related to expenditures on growth initiatives and timing of performance-based compensation accruals. The increase in other primarily related to our captive insurance program and gains on investments in Bunge Ventures.\nIn our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture, higher ethanol and sugar prices were more than offset by the combination of lower ethanol volumes and increased costs.\nFor the 6 months ended June 30, income tax expense was $144 million compared to $242 million in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower pretax income.\nNet interest expense was up compared to last year due to both higher interest rates and higher average debt levels. Also impacting the quarter were foreign currency borrowings in certain countries where interest rates were high. However, the incrementally higher borrowing costs were fully offset with currency hedges reported in gross margin.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 4 years along with the trailing 12 months. In addition to validating the resilience of our global platform and operating model over time, it also demonstrates continuing strong performance by our team that has successfully managed different and rapidly changing market environments over this time period.\nAs shown on Slide 7, addressable SG&A increased modestly year-over-year. After 2 years of COVID-related impacts, employee travel and related expenses have picked up. And as we have discussed on previous earnings calls, we are increasing investments in people, processes and technology to strengthen our capability and drive growth.\nSlide 8 details our capital allocation of the approximately $1.2 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first half of the year. After allocating $101 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and $8 million to preferred dividends on shares now converted to common equity, we had approximately $1.1 billion of discretionary cash flow available.\nOf this amount, we paid $154 million in common dividends and invested $111 million in growth and productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $865 million of retained cash flow, which was invested in additional working capital.\nOur strong balance sheet and cash flow generation puts us in a position to allocate capital to the best value-creating opportunities, which I will discuss later in the presentation. As we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, at quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.7 billion, a significant change from a year ago. Year-to-date, our underlying cash flow has allowed us to invest significantly in inventory, with only a small increase in debt. Over time, as commodity prices moderate, the cash invested in inventory will be released and available for deployment toward debt reduction and/or other uses.\nSlide 10 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, we had just under $6 billion of committed credit facilities unused and available. This provides us ample liquidity to manage our ongoing working capital needs in this volatile commodity price environment.\nAs shown on Slide 11, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 22%, 15.4 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital, 6.6%. ROIC was 14.9%, or 8.9 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these return metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit.\nMoving to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of just over $2 billion and a cash flow yield of 20.8%.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account our Q2 results, the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year adjusted EPS outlook to at least $12 per share, a $0.50 per share increase over our previous outlook, with potential upside depending on market environment and supply and demand balance.\nIn Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be slightly higher than our previous outlook, but remained down from last year due to lower expected performance in merchandising, which had a particularly strong prior year.\nIn Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and higher than last year driven by strong demand in North American and European businesses.\nIn Milling, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year driven by strong first half results. We expect results in the second half of the year to be more reflective of historical performance.\nIn corporate and other, results are now expected to be less favorable than our previous outlook and more in line with the prior year.\nIn noncore, full year results on our Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year.\nAdditionally, the company now expects the following for the year: an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 14% to 16%; net interest expense in the range of $310 million to $330 million; capital expenditures at the lower end of the range of $650 million to $750 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $400 million.\nWith that, I'd like to now shift to an overview of our new earnings growth framework. The waterfall chart on Slide 14 shows a change from our baseline of $7 a share, which we established last year to an updated baseline of approximately $8.50. We are also introducing an earnings growth framework that shows an increase on our mid-cycle baseline to approximately $11 per share by year-end 2026.\nWe see potential upside of $1 plus through additional investments in growth CapEx, bolt-on M&A and/or share repurchases from the deployment of additional retained cash.\nLet's turn to Slide 15 and the drivers supporting this framework. The increase on our baseline to approximately $8.50 primarily reflects structural improvement in the oilseed market environment and greater benefits from our operating model. Consistent with our previous approach, we are defining our long-term average oilseed crush margin range by using the weighted average of our footprint for the past 4 years, plus the trailing 12 months.\nWe also have adjusted for returns likely needed to incent the addition of crush capacity, especially in North America, to meet the growing demand for renewable diesel. This increases our average structural soy crush margin to a range of $37 to $39 per metric ton, and it increases our average structural softseed crush margin, which is more sensitive to oil demand, to a range of $57 to $61 per metric ton.\nWe believe both of these ranges reflect more reasonable mid-cycle margins in a go-forward structural market environment.\nWe have also further increased the normalized earnings of our oilseed origination and distribution businesses and our merchandising subsegment, reflecting the more coordinated and aligned approach within the value chains from the changes we have made to our operating model and approach to managing risk.\nThe slight increase in Refined and Specialty Oils earnings to approximately $400 million annually is being driven by higher capacity utilization in North America refining. Importantly, we assume that margins in North America refining moderate back to roughly historical averages, as we expect in time that the renewable diesel industry will add pretreatment capability to their facilities. However, the timing of this transition has become more uncertain, as we continue to hear of delays to projects due to higher construction costs and supply chain disruptions.\nThere are no changes from our earlier baseline of approximately $100 million annually in Milling. Corporate and other are less favorable primarily due to inflation and increased costs related to growth initiatives. We increased the contribution from our Sugar & Bioenergy JV slightly, reflecting improved execution and market dynamics.\nWith respect to cost management, we expect to partially offset inflation driven per unit costs through increased productivity. There is minimal change to our forecasted effective tax rate, which we updated last year with the increase of our baseline to $7.\nNow let's look at the drivers of the increase in our base of earnings over the coming years, which will enable us to generate EPS at near current levels, but in a mid-cycle environment. In total, we expect to deploy approximately $3.3 billion toward growth investments, with about $2.3 billion being allocated toward CapEx, as we have highlighted in the past, and approximately $1 billion toward bolt-on M&A.\nOur CapEx investments are oriented toward a combination of greenfield, brownfield and productivity projects. Our M&A targets are primarily focused on core Agribusiness origin and crush capabilities.\nWe have also allocated capital towards share repurchases and expect to deploy approximately $1.25 billion through the period. While we plan to repurchase approximately $250 million annually, actual amounts could vary year-to-year depending on M&A opportunities and the amount of dilution from stock-based compensation. Additionally, any proceeds from future divestitures used toward repurchases would be incremental to these expectations.\nAll $3.3 billion of growth investments identified are currently in varying stages of development. While we are confident about the completion of these projects, not all have been formally approved. As such, there is risk that some will not be executed, in which case, the capital will be available for other similar projects or additional share repurchases.\nMoving to Slide 16 and an overview of the types of investments we are pursuing. As we have highlighted in the past, our growth is primarily focused in four strategic areas: strengthening our oilseeds platform; expanding in Refined and Specialty Oils; increasing our participation in renewable feedstocks; and expanding in plant-based proteins. These are all areas that align well with our footprint and capabilities.\nExamples of investments underway include new refineries in Europe and India that are more flexible, efficient and sustainable, and the plants they are replacing, as well as soy crush capacity expansions in the U.S. as part of our joint venture with Chevron. Additional projects will be announced at the appropriate stage.\nNote that our capital allocation process is driven by our strategy and risk-adjusted returns. The percentages shown here are not predetermined targets by strategic area, but rather are based on the mix of our current project list.\nOn Slide 17, you can see the progression of our mid-cycle baseline over time, along with our future expectations. The chart shows that as we increase our base -- earnings base, we will become less dependent on up-cycle market conditions to generate levels similar to our recent performance. Should recent market conditions continue, we would expect to exceed our mid-cycle baseline as we have in the past.\nAs mentioned earlier, our upside scenario of $12-plus reflects incremental earnings driven by the deployment of available free cash flow toward growth investments, in addition to the list of identified projects, as well as incremental share repurchases. From these additional growth CapEx projects, we have assumed earnings contributions ramping from 0 to 100% over 4 years after investment.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, John. Before turning to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts.\nOne of Bunge's strengths is our culture of continuous improvement. This is not an organization at rest. We're constantly looking to learn from what we've done and have put processes in place to ensure that we share best practices with our colleagues around the world.\nWe're using technology, data and analytics to make it easier to innovate and increase efficiency and, importantly, to make it easier for our customers on both ends of the value chains to do business with us.\nIt's this team's focus on making the business better today than it was yesterday that continues to give me the confidence that we're well positioned to succeed, not just in the current environment or the next few quarters, but well into the future.\nAnd with that, we'll turn to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Wisener. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVP of IR, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call.\nBefore we get started, I want to let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion. These can be found in the Investors section of our website at bunge.com under Events and Presentations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are posted on our website as well.\nI'd like to direct you to Slide 2 and remind you that today's presentation includes forward-looking statements that reflect Bunge's current view with respect to future events, financial performance and industry conditions. These forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Bunge has provided additional information in its reports on file with the SEC concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in this presentation, and we encourage you to review these factors.\nOn the call this morning are Greg Heckman, Bunge's Chief Executive Officer; and John Neppl, Chief Financial Officer.\nI'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone.\nI want to start by thanking our team for their continued dedication and strong execution as we navigate volatile commodity markets that have been further disrupted by the war in Ukraine. The team has done a great job remaining focused on our highest priority, the safety of our employees. We are actively supporting our colleagues and their families to provide what resources we can to help them through this terrible crisis.\nLast year at this time, we were talking about a different shock to the markets, the impact of COVID. And here we are a year later, and the lingering effects of COVID are still with us. And now we face the interrelated headwinds of continuing supply chain issues, challenging weather patterns that have reduced the production of palm, canola and soy and government policy reactions, now further complicated by the war in Ukraine. These market disruptions are rerouting many traditional trade flows and contributing to crop price inflation.\nOur team continues to manage through these challenges with great agility and a shared sense of purpose, to connect farmers to consumers, delivering essential commodities and food to communities around the world in a safe and sustainable way. Our ability to improve our day-to-day execution while also delivering on significant growth projects is a credit to the hard work of the team to transform Bunge into a more global integrated company. Working together with a collaborative approach has improved our ability to use our extensive global platform and collective expertise to help customers on both ends of the supply chain, effectively respond to the additional market pressures that have increased their operating risk.\nTurning to first quarter numbers. We continue to build on our positive momentum, delivering year-over-year earnings growth for the tenth consecutive quarter, with all segments of the business contributing to the strong performance. While we incurred losses in our Black Sea operations, our team effectively responded to the situation when industry margins spiked globally due to the combination of continued strong demand and an even tighter supply outlook.\nIn Refined & Specialty Oils, strong results were largely driven by North America refining. Our team used the optionality of our complete portfolio of oils, our global network and our technical expertise to help customers solve their supply challenges. Results in milling were also higher, with our team having effectively managed the supply chain and input cost volatility.\nFurthering our strategy, this quarter, we made an important step in our effort to identify opportunities to reduce carbon in our value chains through our recently announced commercial partnership with Cover Crest. Expanding the support for this new winter oilseed crop is an ideal way to produce a lower carbon intensity feedstock that can help meet the growing demand for renewable fuels. We believe rotational cover crops can play a key role in our joint venture with Chevron to supply inputs to the renewable fuels industry.\nAlong those same lines, we continue to make progress in simultaneously advancing our commercial and sustainability approach in South America. We've expanded our soy origination network through minority investments in resellers that purchase from smaller farms. This business strategy has also allowed Bunge to accelerate traceability efforts to support our progress toward our commitment to be deforestation-free in 2025.\nBefore handing the call over to John, I want to spend a moment on our outlook for 2022. Back in January, we said we expected to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 for the full year. Based on what we can see today, we're now expecting to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $11.50 for the full year 2022. As usual, this outlook is based upon our current visibility and the forward curves for the balance of the year.\nI'll hand the call over to John now to walk through our financial results in detail. And then we'll close with some additional thoughts on 2022. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bunge Limited\n\nBefore I get started, a few additional comments about the situation in Ukraine. We have over 1,000 employees there, and are thankful that as of this date, there have been no reported casualties or injuries among our team. Within the country, we have 2 oilseed processing facilities, a port, several grain elevators and administrative office in Kiev. As has been previously reported, our port facility sustained damage. However, based on initial visual inspections, the damage does not appear to be significant. Beginning late March, we restarted certain commercial and operational activities, primarily exporting grain via rail and truck. However, these activities have been extremely limited. While the region is an important part of our global footprint, the total value of the assets is about 2% of Bunge's consolidated asset base.\nNow let's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 5. Our reported first quarter earnings per share was $4.48 compared to $5.52 in the first quarter of 2021. Our reported results included a positive mark-to-market timing difference of $0.40 per share and a negative impact of $0.18 per share related to onetime items. Adjusted EPS was $4.26 in the first quarter versus $3.13 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, was $858 million in the quarter versus $737 million last year, reflecting higher results in all segments.\nAgribusiness started the year strong. In processing, the U.S., Europe and Brazil reported higher soy crush results, benefiting from improved margins due to strong demand. Those results were partially offset by lower results in softseed crush in Europe and China, which were negatively impacted by tight seed supplies and higher costs.\nMerchandising had a good quarter. However, results were down compared to a very strong prior year, reflecting lower results in our global grains and financial services operations. In Refined and Specialty Oils, higher results in the quarter were largely driven by improved margins and volumes in North America, which benefited from strong food and fuel demand. And results in the other regions were slightly lower compared to the prior year.\nIn Milling, higher results in the quarter were driven by South America, which benefited from higher milling and upstream origination margins, partially offset by increased industrial costs. Higher margins and volumes in the U.S. also contributed to the improved performance.\nThe decrease in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily related to the timing of performance-based compensation accruals. The loss and other was related to our Bunge Ventures investment in Benson Hill. Results in our noncore Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by higher ethanol prices.\nFor the quarter, income tax expense was $108 million compared to $192 million for the prior year. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to lower unadjusted pretax income, releases of valuation allowances in Europe and Asia, and tax benefits associated with equity compensation payments. Excluding a $47 million onetime expense related to the make whole on the early extinguishment of our 2024 bonds, interest expense was $64 million, down from last year, primarily due to lower average debt levels.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends, adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. Not only does this validate the resilience of our global platform, but also demonstrates continuing strong performance by our team to successfully manage numerous transformation initiatives in different market environments over the past 3 years.\nAs shown on Slide 7, addressable SG&A was relatively flat year-over-year. However, similar to other companies, we too are experiencing inflation, and we are working to mitigate it where we can. After 2 years of COVID-related impact, we do expect higher addressable SG&A in 2022, reflecting increased travel, investments in our people, process and technology, and in growth initiatives to strengthen our capability to drive future value. While our investments in technology should bring productivity gains over time, we do expect net incremental spending in the near term.\nSlide 8 details our capital allocation of the nearly $700 million of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in the first quarter. After allocating $49 million to sustaining CapEx, which includes maintenance, environmental, health and safety, and $8 million of preferred dividends, we had approximately $639 million of discretionary cash flow available. Of this amount, we paid $74 million in common dividends, invested $56 million in growth and productivity CapEx, leaving approximately $510 million of retained cash flow, which was invested in additional working capital.\nIn March, due to the strong performance of our share price, our [4.875%] perpetual preferred shares were converted to common shares. This conversion simplified and strengthened our capital structure. Leading up to our May Shareholders Meeting, we will again review our common dividend, giving strong consideration for a higher baseline, the success in strengthening our balance sheet and our improved earnings outlook.\nWith our strong balance sheet and cash flow generation, our credit metrics stand at our target levels of BBB with Fitch and S&P and Baa2 with Moody's, putting us in a position to allocate capital to the best opportunities. And as we have demonstrated in the past, we will continue to maintain a disciplined and balanced approach.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, at the quarter end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $2.8 billion, a significant change from a year ago. This reflects the positive trend of our underlying cash flow that's allowed us to invest significantly in inventory with only a small increase in debt.\nSlide 10 highlights our liquidity position, which remains strong. At quarter end, we had approximately $5 billion of our committed credit facilities unused and available. This provides us ample flexibility to manage our ongoing working capital needs in this volatile commodity price environment.\nAs shown on Slide 11, our trailing 12-month adjusted AROIC was 21%, 14.4 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 14.4% or 8.4 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of [6%]. The spread between these return metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit.\nSlide 12. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion and a cash flow yield of 20.2%.\nPlease turn to Slide 13 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we've increased our full year 2022 adjusted EPS outlook to at least $11.50 per share, a $2 increase. In Agribusiness, full year results are expected to be higher than our previous outlook, but still forecasted to be down from last year due to lower results in merchandising, which had a particularly strong prior year. While we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook if strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue.\nIn Refined and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and higher than last year, driven by strong demand from food and fuel in our North American and European businesses. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from our previous outlook and significantly higher than last year, primarily due to our better-than-expected first quarter results. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be favorable compared to last year.\nAdditionally, we now expect the following for 2022: an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%; net interest expense in the range of $250 million to $270 million; capital expenditures in the range of $650 million to $750 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million. In noncore, full year results in the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, John.\nSo before turning to Q&A, I just want to offer a few thoughts. I know I've said this many times, but I want to reiterate again how incredibly proud I am of our team. We often say that markets are dynamic, but the past 3 years have been unlike anything I've experienced in my career. Our team has shown great resiliency, discipline and a strong commitment to helping solve problems for our customers at both ends of the supply chain.\nAs we look ahead, we know that markets will continue to be volatile as questions around the war in Ukraine, the eventual crop production levels, supply chain challenges, government policy reactions and COVID all have yet to be answered. Regardless, I'm confident that our Bunge team is prepared to execute in the face of these and the other challenges that lie ahead.\nSo now let's open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Ruth Ann Weisner. Please go ahead.\n\nRuth Ann Wisener\n\nVP of IR, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, operator, and thank you for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter earnings call.\nBefore we get started, I will let you know that we have slides to accompany our discussion.

I'll now turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThank you, Ruth Ann, and good morning, everyone.\nTurning to the agenda on Slide 3. I'll start with some highlights of 2021 and accomplishments in the last few years and then share a look into 2022. Then I'll hand it over to John, who will go into more detail on our performance. I'll then share some closing thoughts before opening the line for your questions.\nLet's start with an overview of the year, turning to Slide 4. I'm incredibly proud of our team and the outstanding results they achieved in 2021, allowing us to deliver adjusted EPS of $12.93. Our team's performance in a dynamic market environment is evidence that the way we've transformed the business over the last 3 years is creating the collaborative global culture that we believe would maximize the value of the company.\nWhen we began this transformation in 2019, one of our first changes was moving from a regional to a global operating model to improve visibility and speed to act. Creating end-to-end value chains enables our team to focus on serving our farmer and consuming customers rather than competing with ourselves. This approach also encourages the sharing of information and best practices, which allows us to work more efficiently and use our resources more effectively. Once we're all pulling in the same direction, the next steps became more clear.\nBunge had an industry-leading portfolio, with assets in some of the best locations around the globe. But we also had individual assets and businesses that did not fit the company's goal of growing our relevance with customers at both ends of the supply chain. And after a number of divestitures, we now have a footprint that's stronger than ever and a solid base on which to grow.\nOne example is a successful plant-based lipids platform we're building through the combination of Loders Croklaan and the legacy Bunge Oils business. The Loders Tropical oils portfolio and innovation capabilities, supported by Bunge's strength in supply chains and seed oils is a proposition that resonates with customers. While the entire oil segment delivered a record year, 2021 was also the best year for the former Loders business.\nWe used the same methodical approach in evaluating how we can improve financial discipline in the organization. We've rewired our systems so we have better visibility to our data. And we used that information in a structured way to make better commercial, risk management and capital decisions.\nThe team also embraced the spirit of continuous improvement throughout our operations. In the past year alone, the team set records in total crush volume, refining performance and port volumes. We had over 100 CapEx projects greater than $1 million each in 2021. And we delivered them safely, with 95% of them on budget and on time. And the team accomplished all of this while doing it the right way, taking care of each other, and that's especially during COVID.\nWe're also continuing to focus on fighting climate change with carbon-focused decisions -- carbon-focused decision-making across our organization. In 2021, we announced science-based targets to achieve absolute reduction in carbon emissions for our own operations and in our supply chains. Our industry-leading commitment to have deforestation-free supply chains in 2025 is a big part of our path to our Scope 3 targets. We also closed on the refinancing of a credit facility tied to sustainability targets. And we're actively engaging with other stakeholders to promote change at scale across the entire supply chain.\nWhile we certainly made tremendous progress, we know our work is not done. We'll focus on continuous improvement, finding ways to make Bunge stronger and grow the business as we move forward.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5. The team delivered an outstanding Q4 and full year performance across all of Bunge's operations. Results in Agribusiness were driven by strong execution throughout the value chains, with refined and specialty oils posting record Q4 and full year results. Thanks to their efforts, Bunge delivered a positive earnings trend for a ninth consecutive quarter.\nBefore handing the call over to John, I want to spend a moment on our outlook for 2022. We expect favorable market conditions to continue in 2022. Based on what we see in the forward curves, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 for the full year, which will be the second highest earnings result in Bunge's history.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to John now to walk through the financial results in detail. And we'll then close with some additional thoughts on the year ahead. John?\n\nJohn W. Neppl\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.\nLet's turn to the earnings highlights on Slide 6. Our reported fourth quarter earnings per share was $1.52 compared to $3.74 in the fourth quarter of 2020. Our reported results include a negative mark-to-market timing difference of $0.90 per share and $1.07 per share of impairment charges, primarily related to our Mexico wheat milling business, which is now classified as held for sale. Adjusted EPS was $3.49 in the fourth quarter versus $3.05 in the prior year.\nFull year 2021 earnings per share was $13.64 versus $7.71 in 2020. Adjusted full year EPS was $12.93 versus $8.30 in the prior year. Adjusted core segment earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, were $766 million in the fourth quarter versus $636 million last year, reflecting higher results in Agribusiness and refined and specialty oils.\nAgribusiness completed an outstanding year with another strong quarter. In processing, results were higher in all value chains, with notable strength in North American soy and European softseed crushing. Both of which benefited from large crops, strong oil and mill demand. Merchandising had a strong quarter, driven by our global vegetable oil and grain value chains as well as good execution in ocean freight. However, results were slightly lower than a strong prior year.\nRefined and Specialty oils finished off a record year with strong fourth quarter results of $154 million, up $42 million compared to last year. Results were primarily driven by improved margins in North America and Europe, which benefited from strong food and fuel demand. Results in South America and Asia were down due to lower margins and volumes.\nIn Milling, lower results in the quarter were driven by Brazil, where higher volume was more than offset by lower margins. Results in North America were higher than last year, driven by improved margins.\nThe increase in corporate expenses during the quarter was primarily driven by performance-based compensation accruals. Other was comparable to last year. Lower results in our noncore sugar and bioenergy joint venture were primarily driven by lower ethanol volume, which more than offset higher sugar and ethanol prices.\nFor the quarter ended December 31, 2021, GAAP basis income tax expense was $64 million compared to $97 million for the prior year. The decrease in income tax expense was due to lower GAAP pretax earnings. Adjusted for notable items, the effective tax rate for the full year was 16.5%, which was in line with the prior year. Net interest expense of $45 million in the quarter was below last year, primarily due to lower average debt levels.\nLet's turn to Slide 7, where you can see our positive EPS and EBIT trends, adjusted for notable items and timing differences over the past 5 years. This is an outstanding performance by our team, especially when considering numerous company initiatives and the challenge of navigating through the global pandemic over the past 2 years.\nSlide 8 compares our full year SG&A to the prior year. We achieved underlying addressable SG&A savings of $32 million, of which approximately 65% was related to nonemployee costs. Like other companies, we too are experiencing inflation, particularly related to energy and employee costs. We are working to mitigate the impact of inflation where we can. In 2022, we expect higher addressable SG&A versus 2021, reflecting increased travel, investment in our people, processes and technology, and in growth initiatives to strengthen our capabilities to drive future value.\nSlide 9 details our capital allocation of approximately $2 billion of adjusted funds from operations that we generated in 2021. As we highlighted before, our first priority is managing our balance sheet leverage ratios and rating metrics. We enter 2022 with a very strong financial position as a result of our recent credit rating upgrades and our strong full year 2021 performance.\nOur second priority is sustaining CapEx, where we allocated $226 million towards maintenance, environmental health and safety. These investments will typically run around $275 million per (inaudible). Next, we allocated $34 million to preferred dividends, which left us with approximately $1.7 billion of discretionary cash flow available to allocate toward growth and productivity investments and returns to shareholders, which we view on a relatively balanced basis. Of the $1.7 billion, we invested $173 million in growth and productivity CapEx, paid $289 million in common dividends and repurchased $100 million of common shares, for a total return to common shareholders of nearly $400 million, leaving approximately $1.1 billion of retained cash flow.\nWith the increased flexibility and borrowing capacity that our balance sheet now provides, we are in a position to comfortably deploy excess cash toward areas that will provide longer-term growth benefits, such as greenfield investments, and toward areas which will have a more immediate impact, such as M&A opportunities and returning capital to shareholders.\nSlide 10 highlights our 2022 CapEx forecast along with the listing of some key projects. The primary focus is on debottlenecking capacity in both Agribusiness and Refined and Specialty Oils as well as greenfield investments in both segments to enhance our efficiency through more sustainable modern and flexible capabilities.\nOur CapEx spend in both 2020 and 2021 was below our previous $450 million baseline level, primarily due to COVID-related resource and supply chain constraints. We expect our spend over the next 3 years to be well above our prior baseline levels as a result of these project delays as well as execution on a robust pipeline of growth and productivity investments. Over time, as returns from our growth investments are realized, we will periodically update our earnings baseline model to reflect the increased earnings capability.\nLeading up to our May shareholders meeting, we will again review our common dividend, giving strong consideration for our higher baseline, the success in strengthening our balance sheet and our earnings outlook. We also have the entirety of our recently replenished $500 million share repurchase program remaining. This will continue to be a tool for returning capital to shareholders. As we have communicated previously, we will maintain a prudent and stable dividend along with a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation through the cycle.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, at year-end, readily marketable inventories, or RMI, exceeded our net debt by approximately $1.7 billion, a significant change from a year ago. This reflects our use of retained cash flow and proceeds from portfolio actions to fund working capital, while reducing debt, strengthening our balance sheet and improving our credit metrics.\nPlease turn to Slide 12. For the trailing 12 months, adjusted ROIC was 19.9%, 13.3 percentage points over our RMI adjusted weighted average cost of capital of 6.6%. ROIC was 13.9% or 7.9 percentage points over our weighted average cost of capital of 6%. The spread between these metrics reflects how we use RMI in our operations as a tool to generate incremental profit.\nMoving to Slide 13. For the trailing 12 months, we produced discretionary cash flow of approximately $1.7 billion and a cash flow yield of 21.4%. The decline in cash flow yield from 2020 reflects a growth in discretionary cash flow, which was more than offset by the increase in book equity of the company. The moderate year-over-year growth in discretionary cash flow versus EPS growth reflects the impacts of significantly higher undistributed earnings from JVs as well as deferred taxes related to mark-to-market.\nPlease turn to Slide 14 and our 2022 outlook. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, taking into account the current margin environment and forward curves, we expect full year 2022 adjusted EPS of at least $9.50 per share. In Agribusiness, full year results are forecasted to be down from a record 2021, primarily due to lower results in merchandising and softseed crushing, which had exceptionally strong year. While we are not forecasting the same magnitude of margin-enhancing opportunities that we captured in the past year, we do see potential upside to our outlook as strong demand and tight commodity supplies continue.\nIn Refining and Specialty Oils, full year results are expected to be up from last year, delivering another record year, driven by strong demand from food and fuel customers in our North American and European businesses. In Milling, full year results are expected to be up from last year, primarily driven by improved market conditions in Brazil. In Corporate and Other, results are expected to be comparable to last year.\nAdditionally, the company expects the following for 2022: an adjusted annual effective tax rate of 19% to 21%; net interest expense in the range of $210 million to $230 million; capital expenditures in the range of $650 million to $750 million; and depreciation and amortization of approximately $420 million. In noncore, full year results in the Sugar & Bioenergy joint venture are expected to be in line with last year.\nWith that, I'll turn things back over to Greg for some closing comments.\n\nGregory A. Heckman\n\nCEO & Director, Bunge Limited\n\nThanks, John.\nBefore opening the call to Q&A, I want to offer a few closing thoughts. First, I want to thank our team. Not only have they continued to execute well and deliver for our customers, but they've done so against a volatile backdrop, including the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a highly dynamic market.\nThe changes we began making 3 years ago have resulted in tangible improvements to our business in our earnings potential. We're excited about the additional opportunities we see to continue to grow the company while we do our part to lower carbon emission and encourage best practices across the entire supply chain. Beyond our continued work to capture the upside we see in our core oilseeds processing and origination business, we've also increased our capabilities and focus on 3 additional areas of growth: capitalizing on the increasing demand for renewable feedstocks, for plant-based lipids or specialty fats and oils and plant-based food proteins. With our global platform, our culture of innovation and oilseeds leadership, I believe we're especially well positioned to benefit from the long-term secular growth we're seeing in these areas. We're confident the investments we're making today will set us up for continued growth in the years ahead.\nAnd with that, we'll open the call for your questions."

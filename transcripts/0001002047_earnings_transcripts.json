We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered a strong Q2 with revenue of $1.71 billion, up 3% year over year. Excluding the divested Spot business, total revenue was up 4%. All-flash and public cloud, which address growth markets and carry higher gross margins, made up 70% of Q2 revenue. This shift, combined with our continued operational discipline, has enabled us to drive profitability metrics higher.\nOur gross margin set a Q2 record and exceeded our guidance range. Both operating margin and EPS surpassed expectations, and marked all-time highs. Expected softness in US public sector revenue was offset by growth in all other geographies. We saw strong demand for our AI solutions, first-party and marketplace cloud storage services, and all-flash offerings.\nIn the age of data and intelligence, customers are choosing NetApp for our unified data platform that delivers exceptional value and operational efficiencies, fueling our success in the face of the ongoing uncertain macro environment. In October, we hosted our annual customer conference, NetApp Insight, where we unveiled major advancements to our enterprise-grade data platform, including enhanced AI workload capabilities, stronger cyber resilience, and deeper AI integrations and data solutions with our hyperscaler partners.\nCustomers and partners shared how NetApp is driving their success in the age of data-enabled intelligence. Their feedback and achievements underscore our commitment to innovation and delivering value in a rapidly evolving landscape. We launched AFX, an ultra-scalable, extreme-performance, disaggregated storage platform certified for NVIDIA SuperPOD, designed to power demanding AI workloads and AI service providers.\nAFX seamlessly integrates into an organization's hybrid multi-cloud data estate with the proven enterprise-grade data management and security features of ONTAP. We also introduced the NetApp AI Data Engine, an end-to-end AI data service integrated into ONTAP. The AI Data Engine, referred to as AIDE, simplifies data discovery, querying, searching, and analysis. It helps operationalize and scale data pipelines for AI with integrated data discovery, curation, policy-driven guardrails, and real-time vectorization. This enables fast data access, efficient transformation, and trusted governance.\nTogether, AFX and AIDE transform how enterprise customers achieve positive AI outcomes by accelerating data discovery and simplifying data pipelines while maintaining security, access controls, and data integrity. Native integration with leading AI platforms, including Domino, NVIDIA, and Informatica, enables compatibility with enterprise workflows.\nOur zero-copy caching and native cloud connectivity help organizations unify data and apply advanced AI capabilities across any site, cloud, or model, speeding time to insight. We also enhanced our rapidly growing Keystone storage as a service for enterprise AI, offering AFX and AIDE under a single subscription for elastic scaling and usage-based billing, encouraging broader enterprise AI adoption. These innovations build on our growing success in AI workloads. In Q2, we closed approximately 200 AI infrastructure and data lake modernization deals across diverse geographies, industries, and use cases.\nOur massive install base of unstructured data, advanced data and metadata movement services, industry-leading data security, and unique hybrid multi-cloud capabilities make us the clear choice for enterprise AI. Here's an example of why we are winning in enterprise AI deployments. A global semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer selected NetApp to unify its enterprise AI data foundation across on-premises and cloud environments.\nOur hybrid multi-cloud data visibility and secure governance drove confidence in the compliance and operational efficiency of their AI workloads. We enable them to create a single searchable view of corporate knowledge across millions of documents, emails, and engineering data sets, providing employees with faster, more accurate access to institutional knowledge. A large amount of AI innovation takes place in the public cloud.\nONTAP is the only unified data platform natively integrated in the public cloud, putting us in a unique position to enable customers to leverage any of the major AI models without the complexities of moving data. In Q2, we expanded our native AI capabilities in Azure and Google Cloud, adding to what is already available in Amazon Web Services, giving customers the flexibility to run AI workloads wherever they choose.\nAdding to existing multi-protocol support in AWS, we launched support for block storage capabilities in Google Cloud NetApp Volumes in Q2. This brings the full power of ONTAP to Google Cloud with high performance, unified storage, integrated data management and protection, and a common cloud control plane. We introduced new capabilities in Azure NetApp Files, including single file restore and a flexible service level for independent scaling of throughput and capacity.\nIn Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, we announced support for Amazon Elastic VMware Service, enabling secure, efficient migration of VMware workloads to AWS. By continuously adding new functionalities to our public cloud storage services, we are broadening our addressable market, driving new customer acquisition, and positioning ourselves for continued growth. This strategy has yielded rapid expansion in our highly differentiated first-party and marketplace cloud storage services, with revenue increasing approximately 32% from Q2 a year ago.\nIn Q2, a leading cloud-based media production company selected FSxN as its standard for file and block storage. In addition to multi-protocol support, FSxN delivered cost savings through storage efficiency, high availability, superior multi-tenancy, and intelligent caching to put data closer to its users. The company believes that FSxN gives it a competitive advantage in optimizing cloud storage and enhancing performance for its customers, crediting these capabilities for a key customer win.\nCustomers are choosing NetApp to provide a unified, cyber-resilient, and efficient way to manage their entire data estate. Built for the age of data-enabled intelligence, the NetApp data platform redefines what a modern enterprise foundation should be: unified, enterprise-grade, intelligent, cloud-connected, and ecosystem-ready. We help organizations modernize, secure, transform, and use AI with confidence.\nContinued strong customer engagement and interest in our unified and block-optimized all-flash storage portfolio delivered 9% year-over-year growth in all-flash array revenue to $1 billion in Q2, or an annualized run rate of $4.1 billion. Exiting the quarter, approximately 46% of install-based systems under active support contracts are all-flash. NetApp helps customers confidently safeguard their data with built-in security through real-time threat detection, protection, and recovery.\nIn Q2, we enhanced the NetApp data platform's industry-leading cyber resilience by launching the NetApp Ransomware Resilience Service for both structured and unstructured data. This service is designed to stop cyber threats before they cause extensive damage by proactively detecting data breaches in real time and providing isolated environments for safe, clean data recovery. Our industry-leading cyber resilience capabilities are helping us win new customers and displace competitors.\nIn Q2, a major Asian life insurance company chose NetApp for its mission-critical private cloud environment, replacing its long-standing storage vendor. Ransomware protection was a top priority, and our ability to provide strong cyber resiliency for critical workloads was a key factor in the decision to choose NetApp. We also announced the latest version of StorageGRID, with new capabilities designed to enhance AI initiatives, improve data security, and modernize organizations' data infrastructure.\nMany customers begin their AI journey by updating data lake environments, and StorageGRID object storage delivers the optimized performance, intelligent data management, and modern cloud integrations needed to manage massive data sets. In Q2, a leading financial services company selected StorageGRID to modernize its legacy Hadoop environment, with capabilities for a hybrid architecture featuring data durability, a global namespace, robust security, and automated zero-intervention backup and disaster recovery.\nStorageGRID addressed the company's next-gen AI workload requirements. In summary, strong execution and operational discipline delivered an outstanding Q2. Our focus on growing markets—all-flash, public cloud, and AI—continues to yield top-line growth. The substantial innovation we introduced this quarter extends our differentiation, and helps solidify our leadership position as the intelligent data infrastructure company.\nLooking ahead, we are focused on leveraging our alignment to customers' top data initiatives, and pressing our significant competitive advantage. Despite the unsettled macro environment and near-term USPS headwinds, we remain confident that our visionary approach to a data-driven future will enable us to outgrow the market and capture additional share. I'll now turn it over to Wissam.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nThanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George mentioned, in the fiscal Q2, we delivered strong results, exceeding both the midpoint of the revenue guidance range and the high end of the EPS guidance range. Total revenue for the quarter was $1.71 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.05. Excluding the divested Spot business, which generated $23 million of revenue in the year-ago quarter, total revenue was up 4% year-over-year. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates was favorable to revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point year-on-year, while it was immaterial relative to guidance.\nLooking at revenue by segment, hybrid cloud revenue of $1.53 billion was up 3% year-over-year, driven by product, support, and Keystone. Keystone continues to show great progress, with growth of 76% year-over-year. Public cloud revenue of $171 million increased by 2% year-over-year. Excluding Spot, public cloud revenue was up 18% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in first-party and marketplace storage services. At the end of the Q2, our deferred revenue balance was $4.45 billion, up 8% year-over-year and 7% year-over-year in constant currency.\nRemaining performance obligations were $4.9 billion, growing 11% year-over-year. Unbilled RPO, a key indicator of future Keystone revenue, was $456 million, up 39% year-over-year. Moving to the rest of the income statement, please note my comments will be related to Non-GAAP results unless stated otherwise. Gross margin for the fiscal Q2 was 72.6%, above our guidance range. Sequentially, gross margin was up 1.5 percentage points. Gross profit was $1.24 billion, up 4% compared to Q2 2025.\nHybrid cloud gross margin was 71.4%, up 1.4 percentage points sequentially, due to product gross margin improving by 5.5 percentage points to 59.5%. Our support business continues to be highly profitable at 92.1%. Professional services gross margin was 30.3%, improving 40 basis points sequentially, driven by higher Keystone revenue mix. Public cloud gross margin was 83%, up nearly 3 percentage points sequentially, and over 9 percentage points year-over-year.\nOperating expenses of $707 million were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year, despite the unfavorable effect of foreign currency exchange rates. Operating income was $530 million, up 12% compared to Q2 2025. Operating margin was 31.1%, up 2.4 percentage points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue and gross margin, combined with lower operating expenses. Earnings per share was $2.05, growing 10% year-on-year. Both operating margin and EPS exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges.\nOur results demonstrate strong execution on key growth opportunities in all-flash, public cloud, and AI, as well as continued focus on operational discipline. Cash flow from operations was $127 million, and free cash flow was $78 million. During the Q2, we returned $353 million of capital to our shareholders, with $250 million in share repurchases, and $103 million paid in dividends of $0.52 per share.\nQ2 diluted share count of 202 million decreased by 8 million shares, or 4% year-over-year. At the end of the quarter, cash and short-term investments were $3 billion, and gross debt outstanding was $2.5 billion, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $528 million. I'll now turn to Non-GAAP guidance, starting with Q3. We expect revenue of $1.69 billion, ±$75 million. At the midpoint, this implies a growth of 3% year-over-year. Excluding the divested Spot business from the year-ago comparison, our revenue guidance implies a 5% growth. We expect Q3 gross margin of 72.3% to 73.3%. Operating margin is anticipated to be in the range of 30.5% to 31.5%. We expect EPS to be between $2.01 to 2.11, with a midpoint of $2.06.\nTurning now to full year 2026, we continue to expect fiscal year 2026 revenue to be between $6.625 billion and 6.875 billion, which at the $6.75 billion midpoint reflects 3% growth year-over-year. Excluding Spot, our revenue guidance implies a growth of 5% year-over-year. Based on our Q2 performance and the confidence in our outlook for the second half, we are raising gross margin, operating margin, and EPS ranges for the fiscal year.\nWe now expect our fiscal year 2026 gross margin to be in the range of 71.7% to 72.7% and are increasing our operating margin to 29.5% to 30.5%. We expect other income and expenses to be approximately negative $15 million. For the year, we expect a tax rate in the range of 20.2% to 21.2%. We are raising our EPS range to $7.75 to 8.05, with a midpoint of $7.90.\nIn closing, as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2026, our commitment to executing our strategy remains strong. We are poised to seize the expanding opportunities in all-flash, cloud, and AI, and remain focused on consistently delivering exceptional value to our customers and shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Wissam. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, if you would like to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. To withdraw your question, simply press star one again. We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nYeah, thanks for taking the question. I guess the first question would be, as we think about the component environment, both from a potential pricing perspective as well as whether or not you might be seeing any kind of constraints, I'm curious how the company's managing that. Have you leaned in on any kind of strategic purchases? Any thoughts on the duration of those strategic purchases as far as the next couple of quarters? How much visibility do you have on the pricing dynamics underpinning the gross margin outlook? Thank you.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nHey, Aaron, thanks for the question. On the components, we did mention last quarter that we did lock in some prices. Based on that, we do have visibility for a couple more quarters, I would say, at least until the end of this fiscal year. When you look at where we are, obviously, we did Q2 product margin was slightly better than our long-term model, which is in the mid to high 50%. When we look at the rest of the year, we expect product margin or product gross margin to be relatively stable to where we ended in Q2.\nLooking ahead, if I think of the component pricing, look, this is an environment that could be volatile. We are not going to make a call on that. What we do is we look at various scenarios. We have a very capable supply chain team that has been through many of these past cycles of supply and some of the commodities that we buy with rising cost environments, for instance, but we have been able to manage very efficiently over the years, in fact, while also in some cases growing EPS.\nWe would continue to manage our input cost and maintain our supply continuity. We haven't seen any disruptions so far. We haven't heard of any as such. Ultimately, our goal is really to focus on our total gross margin. This comes down to the various components of our revenue and the mix. There is the rate there and the mix. If we continue to see current levels, let's say, of some of the commodities in particular, I know you probably have in mind that one of the things, for instance, is land. If we continue to see similar levels, we'll probably have a bit of headwind into fiscal 2027 from a product gross margin perspective.\nWhen we look at the mix of the business going forward, we continue to see high growth in the cloud business, which is now operating between 80% and 85%. I mean, in Q2, it was at 83% gross margin. We continue to see good growth in Keystone, and the mix is very much favorable to us. The last couple of points I would say, as we think through all of this, we're focused on driving growth in gross profit dollars, which is foundational to the profitability engine of our business. Lastly, if we are faced with higher commodity prices relative to where we are today, we will always reconsider our pricing. Our commodity prices are typically passed through for us, and we don't have an issue passing them through.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nWissam, I appreciate that. That was a very thorough answer. Looking back historically, how quickly could you pass those through? Is that within a given quarter? Does it take a couple of quarters to see that flow through?\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nThis is probably more of a hypothetical, obviously. As I said, where we are today, we have good visibility till the end of the fiscal year. We do not necessarily need a lot of time to pass them through. We can always adjust prices as needed.\n\nAaron Rakers\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you, Wissam.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nThank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Aaron. Next question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nErik Woodring\n\nManaging Director and Head of US Technology Hardware Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. Maybe I am going to ask a similar question to Aaron and Wissam. That is, you are effectively at 60% product gross margins. I know you said we should expect them to be relatively unchanged through the rest of the year. First part of that is just, is this a function of mix to all-flash? Is this still pricing tailwinds? Is this kind of bomb cost down? I'd love if you could just maybe contextualize what the real drivers are of that product gross margin expansion.\nSecond, I'll just ask both questions at once. I realize you don't really need to talk to fiscal year 2027. It's too early, and the commodity cost environment is quite volatile. Are we kind of at peak product gross margins? Can product gross margins expand from here? I'd just love to understand how you think about the sustainability of where we are, even regardless of the memory cycle. Thank you so much, guys.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nYeah, thanks, Erik. Hey, look, what I said, yeah, for the rest of the year, we expect product gross margin to be more or less where we are now. We're in the 59%, I think, and change. When we think about the drivers, it's a combination of things. If I sort of look at where we are year-on-year, for instance, cost is now roughly flattish. We are seeing differences mostly driven by mix and pricing. That's pretty much what drives the margin. As I look forward, obviously, as you mentioned, it's too early to talk about 2027. I'm going to talk about theoretically how we think of the long-term product margin of our business.\nWe are targeting mid to high 50% margin. That's really we are operating a little bit better than that now. Our target is the mid to high 50% because ultimately, to drive better gross margins for the company, it's really the mix that's going to be also a tailwind. As our fast-growing cloud business continues growing at the high and delivering higher gross margin than the corporate average, this should help us improve on our margins. I wouldn't put a cap on our product margin because ultimately, we continue to be very operationally disciplined in how we conduct the business. I hope this answers your question.\n[crosstalk]\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J. P. Morgan\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe if I can pivot a bit more to the revenue side. George, you talked about sort of the AI-related transactions or deals that you closed. Looks like 200 versus 125 last quarter. Wondering sort of what you're seeing in terms of trends there. Sounds like an acceleration on the headline number of deals you're seeing. Is the AFX solution that you launched at Insights, what sort of customer feedback are you getting? Is that playing into those deals that you're now seeing? I have a quick follow-up after that. Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nWe are seeing a fairly stable mix of transactions. The volume is growing, and the mix has stayed roughly the same, which is data prep and data lake modernization, about 45% of the mix, training and fine-tuning, about 25% to 30% of the mix. The rest is kind of RAG and inferencing. I think you can see the pace of kind of wins have grown. A year ago, it was about greater than 100. Now it's close to 200 or 200 approximately.\nWe're seeing the growth in the number of wins and the mix staying roughly stable. With regard to the AFX platform, listen, we have had a huge amount of interest in it. It's going through customer qualifications. It's too early to say that it's a big cause of the results in the quarter. It takes a few quarters for a new system and architecture to get qualified, but we're seeing strong early interest in it.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J. P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Got it. Maybe a quick follow-up for Wissam here. Wissam, when I look at the Q3 revenue guide, it's roughly sort of flat, modestly maybe down quarter over quarter. I realized last year you had the same seasonality, but for most of the previous years, prior years, you typically sort of have a seasonal growth from Q2 to Q3. Obviously, it's a dynamic macro, and you have sort of public sector headwinds. Anything specifically sort of driving this seasonality to be a bit below average relative to your prior years into Q3?\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nReally the couple of reasons are pretty much what you mentioned. There's a bit of a dynamic macro. We're expecting our US public sector business to be slightly below seasonality given, obviously, the most recent shutdown, and it takes a little bit of time for government to reopen. Having said that, we view these as temporary, and long term, we expect that business to get back to normal levels.\n\nSamik Chatterjee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, J. P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you, Samik.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. I'm going to roll them into one.Maybe George and Wissam, when I think about kind of the demand drivers going into the second half of this year, and I think you said you still expect federal to be subseasonal, how do we marry that sort of outlook and then going into 2027 with kind of how you're thinking about inventory and purchase commitments?\nBecause your inventory on the balance sheet is still relatively modest. Doesn't seem like you took in a lot of finished goods from my quick look. I'm just trying to think how we should think about marrying maybe a recovery in some of the verticals like US federal next year. Hopefully, that's behind us. How you're thinking about adding purchase commitments and working capital to support the business next year. Thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI think maybe I can start, and then Wissam can add color. I think, first of all, if you look at the second half implied growth rate, it is up if you look at export relative to the first half. We are seeing some acceleration despite the US public sector headwinds in the second half of the year. We see the non-US public sector segments had a strong result in Q2. Our flash business accelerated from 6% to 9% in the quarter despite a tough compare a year ago. We feel good about momentum. We are aligned to what customers are spending. Despite the choppy macro, customers are spending on AI projects, on data infrastructure modernization to get ready for AI.\nThey are implementing additional cyber resilience protection. We feel good about our alignment to customer spending. I think the third thing is that the faster-growing parts of our business are now a bigger part of the overall number. Cloud and flash are now 70% of the overall number. The slower, the parts of the business that are not growing are both smaller and also stabilizing more. That gives us belief that second half, hopefully, once US public sector gets clarified, we should have a strong set of results going forward.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nYeah. And David, with respect to purchasing commitments, look, as I mentioned, we have good visibility till the end of this fiscal year, and we would be opportunistic as we go forward. We will be obviously looking at fiscal 2027. Before we enter the year, we would want to be able to have good visibility and, in many cases, secure whatever supply we need. We won't hesitate to take the right actions to make sure we protect our business and we have the supply that's needed.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities\n\nWissam, can I just follow up?\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nYeah. This is Wissam.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities\n\nCould you talk to me like a couple of quarters or full-year kind of purchase commitments given the environment? What's your philosophy going into next year?\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nI would say it all depends on what we're buying and when. There isn't really one answer that fits all. We will be very dynamic. We make decisions very fast. As I said in my earlier remarks, look, we have a very capable supply chain team. We monitor the commodities, and we don't hesitate to take action as needed. We do have a strong balance sheet. If we need to take any specific action to protect our supply or to sort of lock in good prices, we will not hesitate to do that. Great.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nAll right. Thanks, David.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Sankar\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first question, George, is for you. You kind of spoke about the 200 AI deals that you closed in the quarter. What is the average size of these deals? Also, where are we in the pilot-to-production journey for enterprise adoption of AI? Is there a way to think about that into 2026? I have a quick follow-up.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nListen, the deal sizes are all over the map. I think that there are some that are smaller in proof of concept, and there are others that are in scale deployments that are much larger. I would not share a particular number related to the average deal size. It would misrepresent the answer. With regard to the broad themes, I think, first of all, data lakes and data prep are usually prior to scale deployments. They are in the get ready to use AI, bring all of my data together. I think fine-tuning and inferencing are at various stages of the kind of proof of concept to production deployment pipelines. If you look at the industries, life sciences, financial services, some parts of manufacturing, and public sector are areas where we see AI being broadly adopted, with the most advanced use cases in life sciences. I think that the adoption use cases depend on industry.\n\nChris Sankar\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGot it. There's a quick follow-up for you, Wissam. You spoke about the first-party hyperscale services demand was very strong last quarter. Can you just quantify it? How much did that grow last quarter, that services business?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nThe first-party and marketplace services business grew 32% year-on-year.\n\nChris Sankar\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, TD Cowen\n\nGreat. Thanks, George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYep. You're welcome.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nThanks.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder and CEO, Fox Advisors\n\nHi. Good afternoon. I just had one question. Given all the supply shortages that you're talking about, which seem to have accelerated, I guess, in the last several months, and I understand that you've taken some tactical moves to secure supply, why do we think, or is there a risk, I guess, that you run into next year sometime? Not saying Q1 or Q2, but is there a risk that at some point that the lack of supply hurts overall demand, whether it's because of overall price of product or just your availability to ship? Thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI'll just clarify the comment by saying we did not suggest that we have any supply shortages. We said that we have secured supply commitments and pricing through the end of the fiscal year, and will take appropriate actions to guarantee supply across a broad ecosystem of suppliers through the next fiscal year, depending on what we see.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder and CEO, Fox Advisors\n\nOkay. You're confident that the price, whatever price you're talking about a year from now, George, is sustainable in the marketplace, I guess?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nListen, there's a lot of puts and takes in the bill of materials in our products, and we have a broad ecosystem of suppliers. We work with them both to look at a variety of different price points and offerings, and we'll have the right mix. As we said, the historic pattern of this industry is that when component prices, commodity prices go up, there are pricing actions taken to share some of those price increases with customers. If it reaches that point, we have the experience to do that.\n\nSteven Fox\n\nFounder and CEO, Fox Advisors\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nThank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nThank you. Two, if I could as well. Hate to kill the commodities here, but just curious. A lot of talk about NAND, but HDDs are tight and going up as well. Is there, what's the impact on the business of QLC being used more than hybrid or maybe more than TLC? Any moving parts that might actually benefit the move towards all flash, number one. Then number two, the cloud revenues have been pretty consistent, high teens, ex Spot. George, you mentioned a lot of new offerings on the big cloud players. Could you just talk about that kind of ex Spot growth rate? Do you think that high teens is sustainable, or can some of these newer offerings help accelerate that number even though the base is fairly large? Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYeah. On the first question, listen, HDDs actually performed well for us this quarter. It performed, in my expectation, better than we had planned. We are seeing a broad range of use cases for these products. We do not see that one type of technology replaces the other. There are use cases for TLC, QLC, and HDDs, and we are seeing that pattern in our business. I think with regard to your question on cloud, listen, I think broadly speaking, we are super positive about the growth of our first-party and marketplace cloud services business. They have been ticking along nicely, north of 30%, representing strong customer demand for our differentiated offerings.\nI think that the scale of the business, if you look at the Q2 quarter-on-quarter growth, it was the highest quarter-on-quarter incremental revenue in the history of the cloud business. We feel really strong about that. Broadly speaking, we have a really good set of tools for enterprise workloads on the cloud. The next big push is to capture the AI and data-intensive workloads on the cloud.\nYou'll see us bring innovations in the market. We already talked about some of them, and you'll see a lot more of that over the next 6 to 12 months. Super excited. This is really about scaling the go-to-market. It is almost we can bring on as many clients as we want. It's really bringing an effectively scaling go-to-market motion for our cloud offerings.\n\nTim Long\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays Capital\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James & Associates\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to see how you thought about your opportunities to win business with some of the Sovereign or NeoClouds who are not necessarily hyperscale and building their own storage solutions. How do you see that fitting into your strategy, and what kind of opportunities have you seen so far there?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYeah. We are part of a large number of Sovereign clouds across the globe for many, many years. With regard to their AI landscapes, we have mentioned Sovereign AI wins. We have expanded the range of offerings with the AFX solution that allows us to participate in a broader range of footprints within those Sovereign AI clouds. We are bringing more innovation to the market over the next few months. Stay tuned.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James & Associates\n\nHow do you think about the competitive landscape in that application and broadly the AI opportunities?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI think that as those Sovereign providers look to serve enterprise clients with AI workloads, all of the value that we have, both in terms of the differentiated capabilities around security, multi-tenancy, data protection, hybrid landscapes, plays to our advantage. We are seeing some of that momentum with the introduction of the AFX. People have been super interested in our ability to serve those new use cases that those AI cloud providers are trying to go after.\n\nSimon Leopold\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James & Associates\n\nThanks.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you, Simon.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nJason Ader\n\nCo-group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications, William Blair\n\nYeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to first ask just on the performance in the quarter. You had a nice roughly $20 million beat, and then you reiterated for the year. I just wanted to understand why you didn't flow through the beat. Is it just a little bit extra conservatism based on public sector, supply chain, or any other factors?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYeah. I mean, I think we saw in the quarter some really strong, we talked about large deals. We had a good set of those that helped offset the really steep decline in the US public sector business. We had not anticipated when we guided the quarter that US public sector would suffer such a long shutdown. I think as we look out to the second half of the year, if you look at the overall guide for the second half of the year ex Spot, it actually is an acceleration year-on-year from the first half. Clearly, we want to have more line of sight into how US public sector plays out. As Wissam mentioned, it takes a while for the governmental agencies to get back to procurement and spending, and so we're being a tad cautious about that. There are no implications from the supply chain in our guidance.\n\nJason Ader\n\nCo-group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications, William Blair\n\nOkay. Great. Just a quick follow-up on Keystone. I don't think that's come up in the Q&A yet. You've been in this space for a long time, George. I mean, do you feel like we're hitting some type of an inflection in the storage-as-a-service model? Maybe it's not an inflection. Maybe it's just sort of every year it's going to get bigger and sort of be more of a slow burn. It does seem like that part of the business is incredibly strong, and we've seen strength across other suppliers as well. Do you think that this is just going to be more of the norm in the storage market over the next decade or so?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI think this is a new way for customers to buy infrastructure. I think it is driven both by maturity of the offerings, as well as customers' kind of maturity in using these business models coming from the cloud, right? They've learned how to buy infrastructure on a consumption model from the cloud, and we see that growing as a part of the overall business. Like all things, enterprise infrastructure is a very large market, and it will grow as a part of that market. We're excited to lean into that trend. I don't think the whole market switches overnight. Nothing ever happens that way, but it'll grow faster than the rest of the enterprise infrastructure buying models.\n\nJason Ader\n\nCo-group Head of Technology, Media, and Communications, William Blair\n\nThank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you, Jason.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nAnanda Baruah\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Loop Capital Markets\n\nYes. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. George, with video such a big theme at Insight, since we have you, take the opportunity to ask you anything notable or interesting on video that you saw over the last 90 days that you're seeing emerge? I guess video specifically, but unstructured generally in your customer base or in some of the proof of concepts. Thanks. I have a quick follow-up too, if I could, thanks.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYeah. Unstructured is clearly the place that customers are spending time organizing. We talked about one of the use cases where a large semiconductor equipment manufacturer brought together millions of documents across a variety of applications to better understand what their engineers and their operations teams were working on, so that they could kind of continue to optimize yield and efficiency in their business. We see that more and more across organizations.\nI think with video itself, we talked about the content production house that is using AI to build better, more enriched experiences for their digital clients. You're seeing that in certain use cases. We are also seeing the use of multimodal applications starting to grow. Video analytics, for example, in weather forecasting, weather analysis, things like that. It's growing. I wouldn't say it's been a dramatic inflection, but multimodal is growing. We are seeing demand from customers for support for more complex multimodal language models, for example.\n\nAnanda Baruah\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Loop Capital Markets\n\nThat's helpful. Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on memory. The hard drive makers seem, as we go through next year, like they're pretty intent on mixing up pretty quickly from 20 TB drives to 30 TB drives. Is that consistent, relatively speaking, with what your customer base is looking for also? I guess I'm wondering if that's organically in tandem with what your customers also would want. Thanks. That's it for me.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI think broadly speaking, customers are looking for aerial density improvements from all of the silicon. We work with our supplier ecosystem to qualify different media types and density points, and we'll do the same. We follow customer demand. We look at what the supplier ecosystem is telling us. Broadly speaking, performance, cost, and density are the key drivers of new silicon adoption.\n\nAnanda Baruah\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Loop Capital Markets\n\nThanks, George.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks for that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Dowling Capital Markets America. Please go ahead.\n\nLouis Miscioscia\n\nManaging Director, Dowling Capital Partners\n\nHey, George. On the latest earnings call, you'd seem to be a lot more encouraged about AI, and obviously, you have a lot more wins this quarter. I guess you sort of were asked this question before, but let me just try again. Obviously, there's been a massive growth in many areas, mostly in servers, but storage in general hasn't really seen a big, big pickup from AI. When do you think inference applications really start to create more data that would then drive material, new revenue for you? Do you see it as maybe first half calendar 2026, second half?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI mean, I assume at some point it has to hit. Yeah. I think we've always said the compute and network buildout would be both bigger and earlier than the storage buildout. I think it is because the training of large language models and the algorithms that are being used for AI does not require a lot of storage, right? Nobody is creating a second copy of all the internet data to train OpenAI. That buildout, of course, will be bigger and earlier than storage. I think, as we said, storage is 80% of the storage use is actually from inferencing, and as inferencing becomes a bigger part of the overall AI landscape, you will see more storage consumption.\nI think we are seeing it in our business also in the data lake, data modernization business, where people are building large-scale multi-terabyte repositories to bring all their data together. I think if you were to look at what we said, we said, hey, the number of proof of concepts would tick up in fiscal year 2026. We are seeing that. I think with regard to broader enterprise AI adoption, we've always believed it's use case by use case. It's not a horizontal technology that gets deployed. It really depends on the ROI from the use cases that we see. There, we are seeing, like we said, healthcare and life sciences ahead of the market. Some of the other ones are kind of heavy in proof of concept, but not yet in production.\n\nLouis Miscioscia\n\nManaging Director, Dowling Capital Partners\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes. Thank you so much. George, you said at the end of your prepared remarks that you would be capturing share in the market. I was wondering how much of that is predicated on some of the flexibility you have in pricing given the supply that you have secured versus product portfolio mix capability. How are you thinking about that? I have a follow-up.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI mean, broadly speaking, Wamsi, in a transaction, the majority of the value is in software and the data platform that the customer is signing onto, right? They train their teams on the use of the platform. I think our growing differentiation, not only with cloud, but cyber, and bringing more advanced data management capabilities, is the leading indicator. I think when you are trying to displace a competitor, having a kind of flexible set of tools, both things like Keystone or subscription-type services, and the ability to price aggressively is helpful.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay. Okay. Thanks, George. Just to follow up, you just raised your public cloud gross margin range, and you're already kind of at more than halfway through that range with a slight increase in revenue in the quarter. I'm just kind of wondering, what's a natural ceiling for this business that you see? Maybe you can, maybe Wissam can just comment on cash flow as well, which is a little bit weak in the quarter. Just thinking through sort of the trajectory over there, that'd be helpful. Thank you.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nSure, Wamsi. Let me start with the first part of your question. On the cloud gross margin, look, this is the Q2 we're operating within our upgraded target range. We feel comfortable operating within this range. We've seen the mix in that business shifting a little bit more towards software, and as we talked about before, we've had some runoff and depreciation. Having said that, there could be potentially an upward bias, but it's too early to talk about that today.\nI would say we're still comfortable operating within that sort of 80% to 85% range that we published last quarter. With respect to the cash flow, there's a bit of seasonality in our cash flow. Q2 is typically lower. In some cases, it's sometimes the lowest point in the year. Also in Q2, we had the last installment of the tax payment, which had to do with the transition tax that was related to the law that was enacted back in 2017, I believe. Those are, I would say, the couple of factors influencing Q2 cash flow.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you so much.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Wamsi.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Param Singh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nParamveer Singh\n\nResearch Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co\n\nYeah. Hi, and thank you for taking my questions. Really want to dive a little bit more into your AI wins. You talked a little bit about AI differentiation, the AFX, and what's helping you win versus competitors. Wanted to understand, what are you hearing from customers? Technically, do you feel you're there yet? If you could share what mix of your AI wins are with existing customers as opposed to taking share from new customers?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp",
    "content2": "I think with our AI wins, just like with our all-flash business, we are bringing on a lot of new customers. I'm talking about the on-prem business. The cloud business has been a very strong contributor to new clients. As we have shared, roughly half of all our cloud customers are net new to NetApp, right? That pattern has stayed the same for a very, very long period of time. If you talk about the enterprise storage business, the number of new customers that are signing onto us has been strong. A lot of that is because of unified data management, hybrid cloud kind of deployment options, and an increasing number of customers coming because of our built-in NIS2 compliant cyber resilience solutions.\nThose are the key sources of wins. I think with regard for enterprise AI, we feel really, really strong. Yeah. We do not have—we are ahead of all the competition. Most of the competitors have kind of point products. They do not have an integrated stack. They do not have hybrid. They do not have all of those pieces that we have. We feel good. Clearly, in our install base, we have an enormous advantage because we hold all the data. As we talked about at our Insight conference, we can bring AI to your data rather than copy all your data over to do AI. Got it.\n\nParamveer Singh\n\nResearch Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co\n\nBefore my follow-up, anything—sorry, just a quick follow-up. Assuming that you keep winning and your revenue trajectory is going to improve on the product side with incremental workloads coming into AI inferencing. Add to that, you have Keystone going faster, easier comps with Spot, increasing public cloud mix. Wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that off of 5% normalized growth through this year, you should see an acceleration into next year? Would that be the right way to think about it?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI just say we will guide fiscal year '27 when we guide fiscal year '27. All of the comments you made are accurate in terms of a growing part of our business is coming from faster growing components of our business, like cloud, Keystone, all-flash, and AI. I think that as that mix gets to be a bigger part of our business, you should expect acceleration. We'll guide fiscal year '27 when we get there.\n\nParamveer Singh\n\nResearch Analyst, Oppenheimer & Co\n\nThank you so much. Appreciate it.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ari Terjanian with Cleveland Research Company. Please go ahead.\n\nAri Terjanian\n\nManaging Director, Cleveland Research Company\n\nHi, all. Thanks for the question. First, just on the quarter, good to hear the uptick in large deal activity. I know, George, at the start of the year, you mentioned some large deals in the pipeline. What do you think drove some of the larger deal activity this quarter? Was it execution, or maybe there's some pull forward ahead of potential shortages? My second question, it seems like Optix was down year-to-year. It seems like it's been trending that way. How sustainable is that? Is that more timing related of hiring? How should we think about that in the second half and next year? Thank you.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nYeah. I think, first of all, with regard to wins, listen, this is execution, right? We said we had good pipeline, and we are executing to that. I do not think that there are pull-ins due to supply chain, right? I mean, listen, we have never said there's a supply chain issue in our kind of our pipeline. I just will just say, hey, these are wins. You always get some that get closed earlier than others and some that get closed later. I think that our strength in the business helped offset a significant kind of deterioration in US public sector due to the shutdown. We feel good about that. With regard to Optix, I'll let Wissam comment on it.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nYeah. With regard to Optix, look, this is a matter of timing. We expect it to be potentially slightly higher from here for the second half. We do want to continue to invest in the business. We want to invest in the growth of our business. I'll leave it at that.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Ari.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nHannah Lee\n\nResearch Associate, Evercore\n\nHi. This is Hannah for Amit. I was just wondering, for all-flash, the growth accelerated rather well this quarter. Can you just touch on what drove that? Was it pricing, portfolio refresh, or was it AI?\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nI think that from a workload perspective, AI was noticeable. With regard to the mix, listen, I think we have refreshed the full set of systems last year, Hannah. We are seeing the benefit of that as customers have qualified the systems and started to use it. We saw strong results, especially in the high-performance flash area, where our offerings did really well in the quarter.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nThanks, Hannah.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nAsiya Merchant\n\nDirector and Equity Analyst, Citigroup Global Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, you answered partly that about the high-performance mix shift. I think there was some mix shift that worked the other way in the prior quarter. Just as we look ahead, the guide for the overall gross margin is ticking higher here. If you can just kind of lay out how you're thinking about the mix here. What's embedded in terms of public cloud revenues? Because obviously, that's the higher margin. What's embedded in terms of public cloud revenue growth expectations for the Q3? Thank you.\n\nWissam Jabre\n\nEVP and CFO, NetApp\n\nHey, Asiya. Thanks for the question. Look, we don't guide to that level of granularity. I think I've said enough with respect to product gross margin to sort of give an indication as to how we expect the next couple of quarters to shape up. With respect to public cloud, I would expect, as I said, from a margin perspective, we're comfortable in where we are operating, exiting Q2. From a revenue perspective, we talked about the growth being very much in line with what we've seen over the past, let's say, couple of quarters. Hopefully, this helps.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP for Investor Relations, NetApp\n\nAll right. Thanks, Asiya. I'm going to turn it over to George for some final remarks.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nBoard Member and CEO, NetApp\n\nThank you, Chris. Strong execution and operational discipline enabled us to deliver an outstanding Q2. Our focus on AI, all-flash, and public cloud continues to yield top-line growth in an uncertain macro environment. In the quarter, we introduced substantial innovation to extend our differentiation and further solidify our leadership position. Looking ahead, we remain confident that our visionary approach to a data-driven future will enable us to outgrow the market and capture additional share, driving value for customers, partners, and shareholders. Thank you. Have a great Thanksgiving.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. Goodbye. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Wissam Jabre. This call is being recorded live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2026, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered a solid start to fiscal year 2026, achieving revenue of $1.56 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range. As anticipated, robust performance in the Americas enterprise offset year-over-year declines in U.S. public sector and EMEA. This success was fueled by strong demand for our all-flash offerings, first-party and marketplace cloud storage services and AI solutions. By maintaining an unwavering focus on helping customers with their top priorities, we are driving success in a dynamic market. While we continue to observe some macro-related spending caution, the emerging enterprise AI market is driving urgency among customers to modernize data infrastructure, advanced cloud transformation and bolster cyber resiliency.\nThe data infrastructure demands of AI applications are complex and relentless involving the need to unify, search and organize massive volumes of data scattered across multiple silos on-premises and in the cloud. legacy architectures are increasingly becoming bottlenecks, limiting the ability to scale and adapt to new requirements. Organizations are turning to NetApp for data solutions that deliver competitive advantage and operational efficiencies. Our unified data architecture capable of handling any data type anywhere empowers customers to break down silos eliminate complexity and accelerate the AI journey. Customers seeking to build future-proof AI-ready infrastructure choose NetApp.\nIn Q1, we secured a number of wins highlighting the unique benefits of our intelligent data infrastructure platform powered by ONTAP as customers modernize their data infrastructure. For example, a leading global bank turned to NetApp to manage massive amounts of highly sensitive, structured and unstructured data. The customer needed a centralized hybrid cloud data lake to be the foundational source for its AI initiatives with stringent requirements for cyber resiliency and data protection. Our ability to deliver a secure, high-performance, scalable platform with unified management, supporting all data types and spanning both cloud and on-premises environments made NetApp the clear choice. In Q1, our all-flash array revenue grew 6% year-over-year to $893 million, an annualized run rate of $3.6 billion. Exiting Q1, 45% of systems in our installed base under active support contracts are all flash. Healthy customer engagement and strong interest in our unified and block optimized all-flash storage portfolio have enabled us to displace competitive all-flash and hybrid flash footprints. This strength propelled us to the #1 position in the all-flash array market for calendar Q1 2025 as reported by IDC.\nLet me share a couple of examples that highlight why customers are moving to NetApp. In Q1, an aerospace company selected us to replace the competitor's footprint, with on cap-based all-flash arrays, the customer gained cutting-edge security and performance for its defense initiatives with consistent data management across multiple data types and domains streamlining operations, boosting productivity and enhancing security, data protection and resilience against cyber threats. Another example from Q1 is a U.K.-based financial services firm that replaced a competitor's storage infrastructure with our block optimized all-flash arrays. The customer selected NetApp for our enterprise data management capabilities, which help them to secure, protect and efficiently store sensitive client data. Our modern data infrastructure also helped the customer achieve its sustainability requirements with better total cost of ownership through rack space consolidation and more efficient power and cooling.\nIn Q1, we delivered enhancements to each of our first-party cloud storage services, increasing their value to customers and expanding our technology leadership, our natively integrated services enable customers to discover, deploy and manage storage seamlessly alongside other native services. This integration puts us in front of customers at the point of workload design size to hyperscaler committed spend, benefits from hyperscaler seller incentives and reduces procurement and operational friction in addition to a seamless customer experience. Our cloud storage services delivered the performance, cost efficiency, data protection, cybersecurity, multi-protocol support and hybrid multi-cloud capabilities of ONTAP. Our need of integration and advantages over other cloud storage services are driving strong win rates in enterprise critical workloads, our highly differentiated first-party and marketplace cloud storage services continued to deliver rapid growth, increasing 33% from Q1 a year ago.\nIn the first quarter, public cloud services, again, served as a strong engine for new customer acquisition, a leading energy company migrated from its on-premises VMware environment to VMware Cloud and AWS and FSX for NetApp ONTAP. After experiencing ONTAP's rich feature set, this first-time NetApp customer decided to expand its use of FSX for AI and other workloads. A global technology provider migrated from a competitor's on-premises environment, to NetApp block storage in the cloud for its database environment. The customer chose NetApp for our ability to seamlessly move data across multiple clouds as well as our robust data protection capabilities. NetApp helped enhance the customers' data security, disaster recovery posture and operational efficiency, we are already in discussions to expand their usage of our cloud services into new areas.\nJust as we've empowered enterprises to harness public and hybrid cloud environments, we are now helping them achieve faster time to value in their AI journey. Enterprises are beginning to explore and deploy interesting workloads, shifting demand from proofs of concept to transformational initiatives, which require comprehensive analysis of data sets across the enterprise, achieving business outcomes from AI investments is our customers and our priority. On light training environment, successful enterprise AI deployments require more than just performance and scale. They demand unified data management enterprise-grade data protection, production scale, reliability, hybrid multi-cloud integration and the ability to consolidate data without compromising privacy or security.\nOur AI solutions are designed to truly unify enterprise data, delivering outstanding performance and scale while also seamlessly meeting all these critical requirements. This positions us exceptionally well to address the evolving needs of our customers. In Q1, we closed approximately 125 AI infrastructure and data lake modernization deals across various geographies, industries and use cases. We further expanded our AI ecosystem in Q1. We introduced the AI part line with Intel to address the cost and complexity of deploying AI at the department and team level. Additionally, we completed the NetApp reference architecture for NVIDIA cloud partners, providing ultra high performance with the richness of NetApp's hyperscale proven data management. This collaboration allows AI service providers to deliver scalable, high-performance enterprise-grade data services by combining ONTAP advanced data management with NVIDIA's compute and networking platform delivering consistent governance, multi-tenancy and security across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\nOur conversations with customers about AI infrastructure have intensified with organizations recognizing the critical role that data plays. Notable AI wins in Q1 included a leading automaker that shows NetApp to efficiently manage the massive data volumes essential for training advanced AI models and for building an autonomous vehicle software stack. NetApp's data governance, security and auto tiering capabilities were key factors in this customer selecting us as the data infrastructure for their NVIDIA SuperPOD deployment.

I hope to see you all this October at our NetApp Insight Customer Conference, where we will unveil more pioneering innovation for the era of data and intelligence.\nI'll now turn it over to Wissam.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. We delivered a strong quarter, exceeding the midpoint of our revenue and EPS guidance ranges. As expected, first quarter revenue was driven by strength in the Americas enterprise offsetting softness in U.S. public sector and EMEA.\nTotal revenue for Q1 came in above the midpoint of our guidance at $1.56 billion, up 1% year-over-year. Excluding the divested spot business, which generated $23 million of revenue in Q1 2025, total revenue was up 3% year-on-year. The effect of foreign currency exchange rates was favorable to revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point year-on-year, though it was immaterial relative to guidance. Q1 Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion was up 1% year-over-year, driven by support revenue of $647 million, growing 3% and Professional Services revenue of $97 million, growing 18%. Keystone, our differentiated Storage as a Service offering, which was up approximately 80% compared to the same period last year, drove the growth in Professional Services revenue. Product revenue of $654 million was down 2% year-over-year.\nPublic Cloud revenue of $161 million increased 1% year-over-year. Excluding spot, Public Cloud revenue was up 18% year-over-year. We ended Q1 with $4.53 billion in deferred revenue, up 9% year-over-year and 6% year-over-year in constant currency. Q1 remaining performance obligations were $4.94 billion, up 11%. Unbilled RPO, a key indicator of future Keystone revenue was $415 million, up 40% year-over-year. Q1 consolidated gross margin improved by 1.6 percentage points sequentially to 71.1%. Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 70%, up 1.6 percentage points sequentially due to favorable mix of highly profitable support revenue. Product gross margin was 54%. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92.3% and Professional Services gross margin was 29.9%, driven by Keystone. Public Cloud gross margin was 80.1%, up 80 basis points sequentially and 9 percentage points year-over-year. Our Public Cloud business was at the high end of the 75% to 80% long-term target range in Q1. We are confident that Public Cloud gross margin will continue to improve and are increasing the long-term gross margin target range for this business to 80% to 85%.\nOperating expenses of $707 million were down 1% year-over-year despite the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates and flat from Q4 2025. Q1 operating profit was $401 million, operating margin was 25.7% and diluted EPS was $1.55, all aligned with our expectations. We had a strong cash quarter with Q1 records for both cash flow from operations of $673 million and free cash flow of $620 million. This was mainly driven by working capital improvement. During the first quarter, we redeemed the senior notes due in June 2025 for $757 million which comprised principal and interest. We also returned $404 million of capital to our shareholders with $300 million in share repurchases and $104 million paid in dividends of $0.52 per share. Q1 diluted share count of $203 million was down 9 million shares or 4% year-over-year. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with $3.3 billion in cash and short-term investments and $2.5 billion in total debt, resulting in a net cash position of approximately $840 million.\nNow turning to guidance, starting with Q2. We expect revenue to be $1.69 billion, plus or minus $75 million. This implies 2% growth year-over-year at the midpoint. Excluding the divested spot business from the year ago comparison, our revenue guidance implies 3% growth. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be 71% plus or minus 0.5%, and operating margin to be in the range of 28% to 29%. Diluted EPS is expected to be between $1.84 and $1.94 with a midpoint of $1.89.\nTurning now to full year 2026. We are pleased with a solid start to the year and remain confident in our strong portfolio as well as our ability to execute in a dynamic environment. We are reiterating our full year guidance and expect fiscal year 2026 total revenue to be between $6.625 billion and $6.875 billion, which at the $6.75 billion midpoint reflects 3% growth year-over-year. Excluding Spot, revenue guidance implies 4% growth year-over-year. We expect diluted EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.90 for a midpoint of $7.75. In closing, as we look to the remainder of fiscal year 2026, we are focused on executing our strategy, capitalizing on our growing opportunities, enhancing profitability and free cash flow and consistently delivering value to our customers and shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Wissam.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Wissam Jabre. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2026, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.\nDuring the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\nRecord revenue for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 was driven by strong growth and significant market share gains in all-flash storage, along with accelerating growth in our first-party and marketplace storage services. We achieved all-time highs for gross profit operating profit, operating margin and EPS in FY '25, a clear indication of our ability to navigate a dynamic environment. By relentlessly prioritizing our 4 growth opportunities and leveraging AI for increased efficiencies, we are able to invest in growth and expand our profitability metrics.\nIn fiscal year '25, we refreshed our entire systems portfolio, sharpened the focus of our cloud services and positioned ourselves to lead in the enterprise AI market. I believe that we've now reached an inflection point where the growth of all-flash systems and Public Cloud services reinforced by the ongoing development of the AI market will drive sustained top line growth. Five years ago, these areas accounted for less than half our total revenue. Today, they represent over 2/3. Looking ahead, we expect these growth drivers, along with our laser focus, prioritize investments and robust execution to deliver more company records in FY '26 and beyond.\nOrganizations are turning to NetApp to help them with data-driven strategies to deliver competitive advantage and operational efficiencies. As the enterprise AI market evolves and expands, there is greater urgency to transform. The demands of AI are complex and unrelenting with massive volumes of data scattered across multiple silos. This fragmentation leads to difficult integrations, inefficiencies and challenges in governance, security and data protection. GenAI transformation has made it clear that legacy architectures are inadequate to serve these complex workloads.\nNetApp's unified data architecture, spanning any data type, anywhere, enables customers to build an intelligent data infrastructure, delivering the required flexibility needed to overcome these barriers. Our modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management empowers organizations to harness the full potential of their entire data estate: simply, securely and sustainably. We are expanding our installed base and reaching new customers with our AI-ready intelligent data infrastructure, which reduces cost and complexity by seamlessly bridging on-premises and cloud storage with unified control. The world's biggest cloud providers as well as governments and leading companies trust and rely on our technology.\nAll-flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 14% from Q4 a year ago to a record $4.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, all-flash made up approximately 2/3 of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue, and 44% of systems in our installed base under active support contracts are all-flash. The rich data services of our all-flash unified data storage systems, create a secure foundation for consolidating organizational data and accelerating AI-powered insights. As organizations seek to build future-proof AI-ready infrastructure, they increasingly choose our solutions driving our faster-than-market growth. In calendar 2024, we gained almost 300 basis points of all-flash market share, more than any other vendor as reported by IDC.\nWe are in the early stages of our entry into the dedicated block storage market with plenty of headroom for continued growth. The breadth of our advanced data management helps organizations lower operational risk, enhance business continuity by keeping data available, protected and secure. We are seeing accelerating growth from our block optimized ASA systems as we displace competitors' legacy installations with our simple, powerful scale-out all-flash block storage. Our momentum outpaced the market and resulted in almost 100 basis points of share gain in calendar 2024 per IDC.\nDemonstrating the power of our comprehensive all-flash portfolio, we signed a deal in the fourth quarter with a leading life sciences company to replace a competitor's nearly 10 petabyte footprint. With NetApp, they can now meet diverse multi-protocol and price performance requirements under a single operating environment, streamlining their data operations. To keep pace in an AI-driven world, companies must unlock the scale and agility of the Public Cloud. Only NetApp can help them achieve the required cost efficiency, cyber security and AI readiness which [indiscernible] us co-engineered with the major cloud providers. We continue to expand the workloads we address in the cloud and enhance our alignment with our hyperscaler partners go-to-market motions, broadening our opportunity and accelerating growth.\nOver the course of fiscal year '25, we focused our Public Cloud services to emphasize our highly differentiated first-party and marketplace cloud storage services closely complemented by intelligent data, operational and workload services. This strategic focus continues to yield positive results. First-party and marketplace cloud storage services grew 44% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. These services compose roughly 75% of Public Cloud segment revenue, which grew 22% from Q4 a year ago, excluding the recently divested Spot by NetApp services.\nA SaaS provider needed high-performance, multiprotocol storage to meet their cost optimization and resiliency requirements. In Q4, this new-to-NetApp customer chose to migrate to AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP. FSxN helped the customer achieve a high-performance, unified file and block environment, with improved availability and resiliency for efficient and secure operations with a more cost-effective solution than alternatives.\nJust as we have helped enterprises harness the power of Hybrid Cloud environments. We are now enabling them to accelerate their AI deployments and achieve faster time to value. As the market for enterprise AI evolves, customers are moving from proof-of-concepts to real-world deployments, driving the need to unify their data for business impact. Our secure cloud integrated silo-free infrastructure positions us as a leader in this transformation. We power AI pipelines from data preparation to model training to production deployments on premises and in the cloud.\nIn the fourth quarter, our AI business grew fivefold year-over-year again performing ahead of plan. We closed approximately 150 AI infrastructure and data lake modernization deals spanning multiple geographies, industries and use cases.\nOver the course of FY '25, we dramatically expanded our AI ecosystem, delivering innovations with NVIDIA, Domino, Dremio, the Open Platform for Enterprise AI open-source projects, and leading hyperscaler AI toolkits. We also introduced AI reference architectures with NVIDIA for AIDP, Cisco for FlexPod, Lenovo for AIPod and most recently, Intel for AIPod Mini. In Q4, our high-performance ONTAP all-flash storage was certified for NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, NVIDIA Cloud Partners and NVIDIA-Certified Systems. Building on our large installed base of unstructured data, we enable customers to gain intelligence from their data in place, making it ready and useful for production AI use cases without the need for migrations or changes to data operations. We are helping customers deploy AI inferencing in production today and expect FY '26 to be a pivotal year for enterprise AI storage, with the opportunity outstripping that of model training.\nIn the quarter, a large Asian telco service provider selected NetApp as the foundation for its AI workloads. The company needed to quickly stand up a cloud-based model training environment and at the same time, build a larger model training cluster to support its plan to deliver GenAI as a Service. By leveraging NetApp solutions both on-premises and in their cloud, the customer optimize performance, cost and scalability for both environments. This ensures seamless integration with their training pipeline supporting current and future AI projects.\nBefore turning to the details of the quarter, I want to share some observations about the environment as we enter fiscal year '26. The global macroeconomic outlook faces mixed signals with a general slowdown in growth, lingering inflation concerns and a significantly higher level of uncertainty. Looking ahead, we expect some increased spending caution as well as ongoing friction in U.S. public sector and EMEA. We are incorporating an appropriate level of caution in our outlook due to these factors.\nOur fiscal year '25 results demonstrate how the alignment of our solutions with key IT priorities, our focus and the strength of our business model enables us to deliver strong performance in an uncertain environment. Additionally, the unfolding enterprise AI market is driving urgency amongst customers to modernize their data infrastructure, drive cloud transformations and increased cyber resiliency. We are currently negotiating sizable AI and data infrastructure modernization deals with multiple large enterprises, which we expect to close later in the year. This gives us confidence in our full year outlook.\nWe are starting FY '26 following a year of market share gains, armed with the strongest portfolio in the company's history and a value proposition that addresses customers' top priorities. We plan to make prudent investments in R&D and sales capacity to drive ongoing innovation and capture additional market share. Looking ahead, I am confident in our ability to capitalize on this significant opportunity and deliver more record results.\nFinally, I am happy to introduce Wissam Jabre, our new CFO. I'm excited to have Wissam with his deep knowledge of our market and strong track record of value creation on the team. He has quickly integrated into NetApp and will be a key partner to me and the leadership team as we continue to execute on our visionary approach for our data-driven future. Wissam, welcome.\n\nWissam G. Jabre\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Western Digital Corporation\n\nThank you, George, for welcome, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by expressing my appreciation to George and the entire Board for giving me this opportunity and to Mike for his help and transition during my onboarding. I am extremely excited about joining NetApp and look forward to partnering with George and the rest of the talented team as we continue to drive innovation at NetApp.\nAs George noted, we achieved all-time highs across a variety of financial metrics in fiscal year 2025. We refreshed our entire systems portfolio, honed our focus in cloud, and expect to see even more enterprise AI growth in fiscal year 2026.\nAs a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted.\nTotal revenue for Q4 came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.73 billion, up 4% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially. Q4 billings of $2.03 billion were up 12% year-over-year. This marks our sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth. Q4 hybrid cloud revenue of $1.57 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $845 million was up 5% year-over-year. Support revenue of $625 million was flat year-over-year. Professional Services revenue of $98 million was up 13% year-over-year mainly driven by Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering.\nPublic Cloud revenue of $164 million was up 8% year-over-year. Excluding the recently divested Spot business, Public Cloud revenue grew 22% year-over-year, which is a better representation of the underlying growth rate of the segment.\nWe exited fiscal year 2025 with $4.54 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year and 5% year-over-year in constant currency. Q4 Remaining Performance Obligations were $4.97 billion, up approximately $500 million from Q1. Unbilled Remaining Performance Obligations, which is a key indicator of future Keystone revenue growth was approximately $430 million, up 23% quarter-over-quarter.\nQ4 consolidated gross margin was 69.5%. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 68.4%. Product gross margin was 55.4%. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92.3%. The Public cloud gross margin was 79.3%, up 290 basis points sequentially and 11 percentage points year-over-year. Our Public Cloud business now operates towards the high end of the 75% to 80% long-term target range, and we remain confident in future tailwinds that can improve upon Q4's record margin.\nOperating expenses of $707 million were down 2% year-over-year and up 6% sequentially.\nQ4 highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined execution with operating margin of 28.6%, up 50 basis points year-over-year and representing the highest for Q4 in the history of NetApp.\nEPS of $1.93 was $0.04 ahead of the midpoint of the guidance range and up 7% year-over-year. predominantly driven by lower operating expenses and effective tax rate.\nIn Q4, cash flow from operations was $675 million, and free cash flow was $640 million. These cash flow metrics were driven by higher collections and lower supply chain payments year-over-year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we returned $355 million to shareholders the rough $250 million in share repurchases and $105 million in cash dividends. Q4 diluted share count of 206 million was down 6 million shares or 3% year-over-year. We had approximately $350 million left on our current share repurchase authorization at the end of fiscal year 2025 and -- and today, we are announcing an increase in debt authorization by $1.1 billion.\nBefore moving to guidance, let's review the results for the full fiscal year 2025. We Revenue of $6.57 billion was up 5% year-over-year and billings of $6.78 billion was up 8% year-over-year, both all-time company highs Disciplined operational management also yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS, demonstrating the effect of high operating leverage in our business model. For fiscal year 2025, operating margin was 28.3%, up 150 basis points year-over-year driven predominantly by flat operating expenses against the backdrop of 5% revenue growth. EPS grew 12% year-over-year, over twice the rate of revenue growth.\nOperating cash flow was $1.51 billion, and free cash flow was $1.34 billion. Both metrics were down low double digits percentage points year-over-year due primarily to changes in working capital, including higher variable compensation payments and tax-related outflows.\nOur balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.85 billion in cash and short-term investments against $3.24 billion in total debt for a net cash position of approximately $610 million. We intend to use $750 million of our cash to redeem the notes maturing in June. Inventory decreased in the quarter and inventory turns increased to 12%.\nNow turning to guidance, starting with fiscal year 2026. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, such as data infrastructure modernization cloud transformation, AI innovation and cyber resilience. However, as George noted, the macro environment remains uncertain with both cost and demand-related variables that could lower IT spending and make it challenging to forecast through the remainder of the year.\nAs a result, we expect fiscal year 2026 total revenue to be in the range of $6.625 billion to $6.875 billion, which at the $6.75 billion midpoint reflects 3% growth year-over-year. Excluding the divested Spot business from the compare, our total revenue guidance implies 4% growth year-over-year. Spot generated around $95 million in revenue annually and accounted for a low teens percentage of Public Cloud segment revenue. As a reminder, we expect the divestiture to impact reported Public Cloud and total revenue growth for fiscal year 2026.\nWe expect fiscal year 2026 consolidated gross margin to be in the range of 71% to 72%.\nWe expect operating margin of approximately 28.8% to 29.8%.\nWe anticipate other income and expenses to be approximately negative $10 million.\nFor the year, we expect the tax rate in the range of 20% to 21%.\nWe expect EPS in the range of $7.60 to $7.90, and for a midpoint of $7.75.\nWe expect operating cash flow will move in line with net income as it has done historically.\nIn fiscal year 2026, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in cash dividends and share buybacks. We also expect to reduce share count by low single-digit percentage points year-over-year.\nNow turning to Q1 guidance. We expect revenue to range from $1.455 billion to $1.605 billion, which at the $1.53 billion midpoint implies a decline of 1% year-over-year.\nExcluding the divested spot business from the year ago comparison, our revenue guidance implies a 1% growth year-over-year. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be in the range of 71% to 72% and operating margin to be in the range of 25% to 26%.\nEPS is expected to be in the range of $1.48 and $1.58 with a midpoint of $1.53.\nIn closing, as I look forward to fiscal year 2026, I am confident in our strategy and execution capabilities as we are well positioned to capture our expanding opportunities, increased profitability and free cash flow and deliver sustainable long-term value to our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Wissam.

We expect these actions will enhance our execution and improve our momentum already a number of the slipped deals have closed.\n\nCompared to Q3, a year ago hybrid cloud revenue increased 1% and our all flash array business grew 10% to an annualized revenue run rate of three $8 billion.\n\nAlthough impacted by sales execution.\n\ncapacity flash arrays storage grid object storage systems, and assays scale out all flash block storage system, all delivered solid growth.\n\nKeystone our storage as a service offering also had another strong quarter with revenue growing almost 60% year over year.\n\nWe are gaining ground with our industry, leading solutions and earning recognition for our efforts.\n\nWe were recently named our customers choice for primary storage in Gardner's 2025 voice of the customer report.\n\nTestament to our strong market position.\n\nWe continued to deliver innovation at a blistering pace in Q3, we introduced entry and mid range ASF E series High performance and C series capacity Flash arrays, completing the refresh of these product lines.\n\nAt the start of Q4, we introduced new entry level and mid range Asa's systems to complement the high end ASC products introduced earlier in fiscal year 'twenty five.\n\nThese new systems make it easier for customers to scale up from a smaller starting point or expand capabilities to remote and branch locations powered.\n\nPowered by on tap they deliver simplicity at scale and enable customers to reduce storage costs through integrated data hearing with consistent streamlined operations and data protection.\n\nThe new products are already gaining traction with customers.\n\nOur ability to unify data across hybrid multi cloud environment and strong ransomware protection puts us ahead of the competition does.\n\nTo support real time, AI enabled fraud detection, a U S based financial services firm.\n\nSelected the ASF 80, 94, its scalable performance native container support and comprehensive security certifications.\n\nRequiring a storage solution that could provide a consistent unified named space across the different locations with a single management interface and electronics manufacturer chose the C 64, its proven ability to span multiple locations.\n\nIncluding edge core and cloud at the right price point for each well.\n\nWe continue to see growth in demand for AI solutions as a large market opportunity for enterprise journey II begins to open and customers seek a unified and structured view of their data assets in Q3, our AI business again performed ahead of our X.\n\nSpectation with over 100, AI infrastructure and data Lake modernization wins.\n\nThese wins span geographies.\n\nBuried inside and included a number of service providers deploying net app as the storage foundation for their AI as a service offerings.\n\nFor many organization the journey to widespread use of enterprise AI begins with modernizing data lake environments to object storage in the quarter, we enhanced our storage grid object storage solutions with improved scalability and flexibility and double the density of.\n\nDeployment.\n\nUsing rackspace requirements, and lowering power and cooling costs.\n\nA leading U S retail bank selected storage grid as its foundational platform for its private cloud storage, including AI and data link optimization.\n\nThe initial deployment is five petabytes and expected to triple in size with subsequent phases later this calendar year.\n\nOther enterprises are further along in the area of evolution deploying Gen AI models in production for inferencing in Iraq.\n\nOne of the world's largest banks struggled with scalability siloed data platforms and disparate tools for its journey II training and inferencing workloads.\n\nTo address these challenges they selected as the storage foundation for their journey I factory.\n\nOur ability to deliver a solution with secure and economical data movement into and out of the AI factory hearing for model checkpoints and model traceability enabled us to beat the competition and win the deal.\n\nNow turning to public cloud.\n\nWe further hone the focus of our public cloud business with the sale of the spot buy naira business.\n\nAs many spot in cloud checker customers are also customers of our other products and services. It was important to us to select the right partner.\n\nAssumed this portfolio and we are confident that these customers will benefit from a more complete spinoffs portfolio from flex era.\n\nMike will share with you the financial impact of the sale.\n\nBased on our expectation that the deal will close in early March.\n\nAs we've discussed in the past our public cloud strategy is led by our highly differentiated first party and marketplace cloud storage services complemented by intelligent data and operational services, such as data infrastructure insights, formerly known as cloud insights.\n\nAnd workload services like instant cluster.\n\nservices in concert with our hybrid cloud products enable customers to build a seamless intelligent data infrastructure across hybrid multi cloud.\n\nFirst party and marketplace cloud storage services again grew well over 40% from last year driving total public cloud segment revenue growth of 15%.\n\nExcluding sparked by net App first party and marketplace storage services made up over 70% of the Q3 public cloud segment revenue.\n\nIn the quarter, we announced innovations to Amazon FSX for Netapp on tap.\n\nAnd Microsoft Azure Netapp files.\n\nAnd received the Google cloud ready regulated and sovereignty solutions designation for Google Cloud Netapp volumes and cloud volumes on tap.\n\nAdvancements highlight the strength of our partnership and collaboration with the leading hyper scaler broadening our addressable opportunity.\n\nAs customers move workloads into the cloud they choose netapp storage services to deliver high performance and low T C O.\n\nEuropean Bank is executing a large scale migration to AWS for its Vmware database and container applications. The.\n\nThe customer will migrate tens of thousands of Vms and containers composing almost 15 petabytes of data largely from our competitors' footprint.\n\nTwo .\n\nwill deliver significant cost savings compared to other native storage services and its ability to support unified file and block access will reduce the bank's management overhead.\n\nLooking forward our mission is clear and our focus is sharp customers value. Our modern approach to hybrid multi cloud infrastructure and data management, which enables them to build an intelligent data infrastructure and leverage the power of their entire data estate simply securely.\n\nand sustainably.\n\nPortfolio has never been stronger or more tightly aligned to it organizations top priorities, although we didn't perform to our standards in Q3. It remains true that broad based customer preference for our solutions and our visionary approach for a data driven future enables.\n\nUs to outgrow the market and take share.\n\nWe enable customers to treat data as an enterprise wide asset to stay agile and competitive in the age of AI.\n\nAs we close out fiscal year 'twenty five we believe the actions we've undertaken to improve sales execution will get us back on track in Q4.\n\nHowever, as you will hear from Mike our expectations are tempered by the divestiture of spot buy naira.\n\nFX and near term headwinds to global public sector, resulting in a slight decrease to our fiscal year 'twenty five guide all.\n\nAll factors considered we remain confident in our ability to achieve the financial goals. We laid out last June at our Investor day.\n\nBefore I close I want to acknowledge that this is the last earnings call. Mike will lead his successor with some job re joins us on March 10.\n\nMike.\n\nFor your partnership over the past five years.\n\nYou helped drive growth and profitability strengthening our performance to create tremendous shareholder value.\n\nMore importantly, you have been a respected colleague and wonderful leader for net app as well as a close partner and friend to me.\n\nI am confident in our ability to build on this strong foundation you've helped to establish.\n\nI'll now hand, it over to you for details on the quarter.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone and thank you for the kind words, George they are greatly appreciated.\n\nWanted to thank you for our partnership and the confidence and Trust you placed in me.\n\nI will always value our relationship and I'm very proud of what we have all accomplished at net app.\n\nAs everyone knows I will be handing the baton with sometime after this earnings call, but for now it is business as usual so let's jump into the results.\n\nBefore I get into the financial details of Q3, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter.\n\nAs a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted.\n\nFirst our disciplined operational management yielded operating margin above our guidance and EPS in line with our guidance despite revenues towards the lower end of our expectations in Q3.\n\nSecond we have adjusted our outlook for Q4 and fiscal year 'twenty five due to our recently announced divestiture of spot and cloud checker.\n\ncalled spot by net App.\n\nThe negative revenue and EPS impact from the stronger U S dollar.\n\nAnd our Q3 revenue performance our forecast assumes that our Q4 is back on track in terms of our execution.\n\nSomewhat offset by expected global public sector weakness third while our full year revenue guidance is reduced slightly we remain laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation.\n\nTowards this end, we have taken Swift action to control our expenses in Q4 as well as remain disciplined on pricing.\n\nWe ended the year finally, we returned over $300 million to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q3 diluted share count by 3 million shares year over year.\n\nNow to the details of the quarter.\n\nRevenue of $1.64 billion increased 2% year over year, while our revenue was $44 million below the midpoint of our guidance around a third of this was FX driven bill.\n\nBillings of $1 seven $1 billion increased 2% year over year.\n\nThis marks our fifth consecutive quarter of year over year revenue and billings growth.\n\nrevenue of $758 million was up 1% year over year.\n\nSupport revenue of $621 million declined 2% year over year, but was roughly flat year over year in constant currency.\n\nProfessional services revenue of $88 million grew 14% year over year, mainly driven by Keystone, our storage as a service offering which grew nearly 60% year over year.\n\nPublic cloud revenue over $174 million increased 15% year over year, driven by Hyperscale or first party and marketplace storage services.\n\nQ3 cloud revenues, excluding spot by net App grew 21% year over year, and we expect this to accelerate on a year over year basis in Q4, driven by our cloud storage business signaling a continued healthy cloud demand environment.\n\nQ3 deferred revenue was $4 $1 billion flat year over year, but up 1% year over year in constant currency.\n\nRemaining performance obligations were $4 5 billion.\n\nUnbilled RP O was approximately $350 million up 6% quarter over quarter.\n\nGrowth in Unbilled RP O is a key indicator of future Keystone growth.\n\nQ3 consolidated gross margin came in at 71%.\n\nProduct gross margin was 57% and we expect product gross margin to be around 56% in Q4.\n\nWe plan to utilize the majority of our remaining strategic SSD purchases in Q4.\n\nOur recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margins of 92%.\n\nQ3 public cloud gross margins improved to 76% from 66% in the prior year.\n\nWe are particularly proud of the 1000 basis point improvement in public cloud gross margins.\n\nWe expect to make further progress on our public cloud gross margins and exit fiscal year 'twenty five towards the high end of our long term target of 75% to 80%.\n\nOperating expenses of $669 million was down 2% year over year and down 7% from Q2 25.\n\nQ3, again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 30%.\n\nAhead of expectations.\n\nEPS of $1 91 was in line with our guidance with revenues and gross margins below our guidance points, but offset by operating expense control.\n\nOperating cash flow was $385 million in Q3 compared to $484 million a year ago.\n\nFree cash flow was $338 million compared to $448 million a year ago.\n\nOur lower year over year cash flow results for Q3 were primarily driven by lower collections and higher cash outflows for previously secured strategic SSD purchases.\n\nThese strategic purchases resulted in much higher than usual inventory levels and inventory turns of 7% in Q3.\n\nAs previously noted we expect to utilize the majority of these purchases by the end of our fiscal year and see a commensurate reduction in inventory and then fiscal year 'twenty five.\n\nAs mentioned on our last call, we expect free cash flow in fiscal year 'twenty five to be lower year over year due to working capital related factors that we don't expect to repeat in the fiscal year 'twenty six.\n\nIn the quarter DSO increased to 50 in line with seasonal averages.\n\nDuring the quarter, we returned $306 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends.\n\nWe have approximately $600 million remaining on our existing repurchase authorization.\n\nOur balance sheet remains healthy we ended the quarter with approximately $2 $3 billion in cash and short term investments against $2 billion in debt.\n\nBefore I go through our updated guidance I want to quickly level set on two of the changes that happen from our last guidance in November.\n\nFirst as.\n\nAs we have all seen the strength of the U S. Dollar is having a negative impact on reported results.\n\nFor net App, the expected impact to the second half of fiscal year 'twenty five as compared to our previous guidance is approximately $30 million less in reported revenue and an eight cent impact to EPS.\n\nSecond we plan to close the spot divestiture in early March and this will result in around $15 million less in cloud revenue in Q4.\n\nThe transaction is expected to be largely neutral to EPS.\n\nNow turning to guidance starting with the full year.\n\nOur new revenue guidance for the full year is between 6.49 and $6 six $4 billion, representing approximately 5% year over year growth at the midpoint.\n\nThe slight reduction in our full year guidance is primarily driven by FX and the planned divestiture of spa.\n\nWe now expect fiscal year 'twenty five consolidated gross margin to be approximately 71%.\n\nWe continue to expect fiscal year 'twenty five operating margin to be 28 to 28, 5%.\n\nWe expect net interest income to be approximately $55 million.\n\nWe expect our tax rate to be 20% to 21%.\n\nAs a result, we expect EPS to be in the range of $7 17.\n\nThe $7 27.\n\nWhich at the $7.22 midpoint implies 12% growth year over year.\n\nTurning now to our fourth quarter guidance, we expect Q4 revenue to range between 165, and one $8 billion, which at the midpoint implies 3% growth year over year.\n\nWe expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be between 69, and 70% and operating margin to be approximately 28%. We expect net interest income to be approximately $10 million in the quarter and our tax rate to be 20% to 21% .\n\nis expected to be in the range of $1 84.\n\nTwo a dollar and 94 in closing I want to thank the net app ecosystem for their commitment and investment in our company I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals.\n\nWe are well aligned to priority investments and are committed to deliver sustainable long term value for our stockholders.\n\nBefore handing the call to Chris for Q&A I want to thank our employees customers and shareholders for their commitment to net app. During my five years in this role.\n\nIt has been an honor and a privilege to be the CFO of Netapp and I am confident that George with some and the whole net app team will continue to deliver shareholder value going forward.\n\nWith that said I'll now turn the call over to Chris to open the Q&A, Chris Thanks, Mike Operator, let's begin the Q&A.\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session to.\n\nTo ask a question you May press Star then one on your telephone keypad.\n\nIf you were using a speakerphone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys.\n\nTo withdraw your question. Please press Star then two.\n\nPlease limit yourselves to one question. If you have additional questions you may rejoin the queue.\n\nOur first question today is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, Thanks for letting me ask a question and Mike It's been great working with you and wish you the best.\n\nReal quickly George you had mentioned some comments in your prepared remarks around just sales execution I'm curious if you could kind of double click on that a little bit what efforts you've put in place to kind of rectify those issues then.\n\nAny thoughts on the duration of which those could show up maybe on the other side of those efforts. Thank you.\n\nYes, we have a strong pipeline.\n\nBy both secular growth drivers and company specific growth drivers and a fully refreshed product portfolio that is highly differentiated as.\n\nAs we progressed through the quarter.\n\nGood momentum across our business.\n\nLast couple of weeks of the quarter.\n\nSeveral of the large seven or eight figure deals that we had expected to close in the quarter began to take longer to get through procurement into order.\n\nFulfillment and so what this required us to do is to inspect at a much higher level of detail in terms of our closing plan for every transaction.\n\nWhat we have seen is many of the deals that pushed from Q3 have closed in Q4, particularly many of the largest ones in the quarter and so we expect to bring this ongoing discipline through Q4, and then it becomes part of the norm.\n\nAnd of course, our business as we head into the implementation of fiscal year 2006 sales plans.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe next question is from meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nGreat.\n\nMaybe just kind of following up on that question. So it sounds like it was more execution day, it's worth if I just wanted to kind of clarify that customers may be werent kind of a little bit more uncertain kind of in that first month of the year just as we have the same kind of administrations change.\n\nAnd then second question, just kind of any commentary around public sector. Thanks.\n\nIn Q3.\n\nAnd continuing in Q4, we have seen a degree of caution in the European markets.\n\nParticularly the ones like France, and Germany, where there are no government in place.\n\nWe have seen.\n\nA little bit more.\n\nCaution in U S public sector as part of our Q4 guide in Q3 U S public sector performed according to plan.\n\nYou are correct that January always is the first month of the calendar year for many customers and so that sometimes budgets take a little longer to get on frozen. We have good line of sight into our pipeline and we are progressing the deals according to plan.\n\nAlright, thank you.\n\nThe next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with S. I G. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, thanks for taking my question.\n\n.\n\nI just want to better understand the competitive landscape I understand that there were some execution issues.\n\nBut where are we in terms of increasing the QC mix that would give you better.\n\nAnd how do you see the competitive environment.\n\nAnd into the spring and later in the year. Thank you.\n\nWe did not see any changes to the competitive landscape, it's always been competitive and our portfolio has been strong as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have refreshed the entire product portfolio of both the FX theory.\n\nAnd the C and the ASC or block storage theories.\n\nWe have.\n\nThanks, good traction in the quarter in the C series product family in the assay product family as well as with storage. Greg. So we are winning new footprints with those products and I didn't see any fundamental change to that dynamic during the quarter.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe next question is from Amit with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, This is irvin Liu on for Amit and thank you for the question and congrats congratulations on your retirement, Mike I wanted to ask about how you're thinking about product gross margins I think the 56% you guided to for fiscal Q4. It reflects some benefit from your strategic SSD purchases.\n\nBut is there any way to help us think about the direction of product gross margins beyond Q4. Once you use up some of these strategic purchases and then to what degree can you pass through some of these higher commodity costs to your customers.\n\nYes, Greg Great question. So let me, let me take a step back and talk about gross margins as a whole I will talk about Q4, even though we're not guiding for fiscal 'twenty I do want to give you a view of what we're thinking as we sit here today.\n\nFirst of all let's back up for a second folks we've always said our goal here and that happens to drive incremental gross margin dollars and we've done that in 'twenty five the really good news.\n\nThe mix of gross margin is a lot better now diversified between the different product lines.\n\nproduct support and cloud.\n\nThe progression of the gross margin has largely played out as we expected at the beginning of the year with cloud gross margins increasing materially our product gross margins declining throughout the year as we used up some of those strategic pre buys I do want to underline a couple of things April we did the pre buy.\n\nIn 2004 and through the first half of 'twenty five and you can see it in our product margins as some of that has worked through those higher cost is what's reflected in the P&L.\n\nAs we sit here today in Q4, what were expecting from those pre buys is really close to where the market is so I will then talk about in a second what that means for 'twenty six your second part of your question, though I want to hit first which as we all know there is two pieces of gross margin. There is revenue and there is cost.\n\nOn the revenue side, we did implement some price changes going into Q3, given the longer sales cycles in our business, we really don't see a material impact in our fiscal 'twenty five, but we do expect to see this tailwind pickup as we enter fiscal 'twenty six.\n\nAnother tailwind is the introduction of our new products that George talked about specifically the a series, where we continue to introduce new products that deliver better performance.\n\nCustomers at a better cost structure for net out.\n\nAlso as these new products become a bigger portion of our billings in fiscal 'twenty six that should also be a tailwind to margins. So that's the revenue side now specifically our component costs.\n\nWe expect to use the majority of the pre buys up in fiscal 'twenty five as I just mentioned folks we're basically at the same as the industry is today. So as we go into fiscal 'twenty six we expect there to be continued weakness in the NAND market, we've seen that over the last two quarters and it's expected to continue into.\n\nThe first half of our year.\n\nBased on these current projections, we expect Q4 dollars 25 to be the high point of our component costs and expect to see cost remains steady entering fiscal 'twenty six and then start to decline.\n\nWhat that means is assuming that stays consistent because mix is super important.\n\nExpect 56 to be the low point of product gross margins and start to increase as we enter 2006.\n\nSo hopefully that answers that.\n\nQuestion and I, just have to get one shot up to a shifting to cloud margins for a second.\n\nWe are particularly proud of the 1000 basis point increase that we've seen there and we expect those margins to continue to increase in addition, with the divestiture of spot we actually got about another 100 basis points of product margin, our cloud margin goodness. So thats gross margins as a whole again, we're not guiding 2006.\n\nThat helps with people worrying about what was going to happen going into next year.\n\nGot it thank you.\n\nThe next question is from David vote with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys for taking my question and my congratulations on the retirement, we will Miss you.\n\nMaybe George can you talk about obviously deals closing late in the quarter are getting pushed out.\n\nYet your all flash array business seem to perform reasonably well in the quarter at least on the metrics can you talk into more specificity in terms of.\n\nWhat were sort of the deciding factors that got pushed to the right was it the size of the deals was it price was it what type of technology, just trying to get a little bit better sense for maybe where customers maybe got a little bit of a pause and why it shifted a little bit more to the right. I know you touched on it earlier, but just some more color around that given that all flashing are look pretty good.\n\nDuring the quarter.\n\nI think that our Oh.\n\nAll flash numbers would have been substantially higher if we had been able to close the transactions that moved to the right.\n\nThose are primarily flash based product transactions. They were a few different reasons clearly there are some clients that are not yet ready to make the procurement decision at the window that we wanted them to and where they had previously communicated that they might be ready to do it.\n\nSome of this as you can imagine was because it's the first few weeks of a new calendar year and the budgets haven't get flowed down to the departments in other cases clients wanted to upsize their transactions. So they wanted to consolidate more equipment under the same procurement.\n\nVehicle and so it took us longer to close and I think those are fundamentally a couple of the main reasons in Europe. We saw a couple of deals push because of the softness in the overall.\n\nMarket and so it took it's taken them a little bit more caution in some of those cases in Europe.\n\nGreat. Thank you that's helpful.\n\nThe next question.\n\nExcuse me. The next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah. Thank you good afternoon.\n\nCould you I know you said $15 million in the quarter from spot can.\n\nCan you just give a sense of like the.\n\nIf you could annualize that.\n\nThe spot impact so we can get a sense of what we need to take out of our models for FY 'twenty six.\n\nAnd then just a quick second question I know I'm supposed to ask one but can you give us the U S fed exposure.\n\nOverall sort of for the fiscal year as well, what's your U S fed exposure.\n\nOkay.\n\nHey, Jason it's Mike So on the first question. So the business that was that we are divesting for the trailing 12 months. The cloud revenue has been about $94 million, it's been relatively consistent it bounces around a little bit by quarter from a gross margin perspective, the gross margins are relatively consistent.\n\nThe cloud gross margins, but slightly lower hence my earlier comment about getting a little bump in gross margins and then when all is said and done we expect it to be relatively neutral to EPS as George mentioned and we bought the U K.\n\nThe as reported number in Q3 was 15% growth excluding it from both the previous year and this year it moved up to 'twenty, one so hopefully that helps size businesses.\n\nDivested.\n\nAnd third.\n\nListen I think the U S public sector business.\n\nIncremental.\n\nCaution is factored into our Q4 outlook.\n\nSome of that is related to the near term.\n\nEfficiency.\n\nDirection that some parts of the administration have been.\n\nDirected to undertake we think that these are tied to technology led productivity improvement initiatives over time, and so once they stabilize it should be a benefit to us.\n\nPublic sector.\n\npartner Fisher to net out at it.\n\nA material part of our.\n\nAmericas business.\n\nAnd so I'll just leave it there and Jason just this is Chris really quickly public sector, which includes federal state and local governments.\n\nOunces around between 10 to 12, 13% of total revenue.\n\nThat's global public sector.\n\nAt U S public sector U S. Okay.\n\nTotal revenue not of total U S revenue right.\n\nTotal company revenue, Okay, all right. Thanks, Chris.\n\nOkay.\n\nThe next question is from Wamus, Hey, Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead alright. Thanks for taking the question that filling in for Onesie, Mike Great working with you congrats.\n\nI have a question for you are you taking any incremental cost actions and how should we think about operating expenses as well as your investments going forward and if you can also comment on free cash flow is it lower sequentially in fiscal and what would what would drive further our strategic SSD purchases.\n\nAnd when would you do that and what would be the criteria for that thank you.\n\nSo thank you for the kind words and I think there are three questions in there.\n\nSo first of all from a operating expense perspective for this year, we're basically flat year over year. The team does a wonderful job continuing to invest in new projects.\n\nProjects George talked about all the new products that we've rolled out and the changes also we've made a go to market.\n\nLook at it every quarter, we look at it every day, we want to make sure that we get a return. So we are scrutinizing opex. The same today as we have in the last couple of years.\n\nThe second question was on cash on cash flow, let's talk about cash flow.\n\nAnd then.\n\nCost actions so.\n\nCastle first so right now on an operating cash flow perspective were down year over year by about $241 million. The driver to this is really two big things that we've talked about all year. What is the prepay the payments we've made on our strategic buys thats going to continue to be a working capital headwind for us in fiscal .\n\n25.\n\nOther tech piece is incentive payments that we made and mostly in Q1, you aggregate those together and the working capital impact is about $300 million year over year.\n\nIn Q4, we have some headwind from the timing of tax payments.\n\nShould increase sequentially, but we do expect to be below last year and Thats, what we said in Q3 as well.\n\nI need to take cost actions.\n\nSo just like we talked about we look all the time and cost as it relates to I think the third one was pre buys right.\n\nSo at this point.\n\nAs you look at the NAND market as we've talked about we did a strategic pre buys when it was really a dislocated market and it was almost a no brainer to do it and we benefited and our customers did because we were able to offer great products.\n\nFor almost the last four quarters at this point, we view ourselves up going forward, we have to see a material. This location of Gan to do those pre buys.\n\nWonderful news as my successor knows us industry really well, so you'll be able to look at it as well, but at this point, we are not expecting to do any more pre buys but what the NAND market continues to change. So we'll all wait until gets here and he can talk about that on the next call. Thank you for that.\n\nYeah, Yeah, Mike. Thank you so much thanks for all the details.\n\nYou bet. Thank you.\n\nThe next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, good afternoon.\n\nJust following up on that just from a competitive dynamic standpoint, having had Mike a lot of experience with doing these pre buys now some some of your competitors don't do them. Some do them in different ways has that at all affected the competitive environment and given your comments about NAND pricing.\n\nGoing down I mean, I guess, it's all relative but some of the NAND suppliers are talking about the bottom of the inventory cycle. So I'm curious if you see any risk that maybe you are being too optimistic on NAND pricing. Thanks.\n\nSo let me address those two questions right I think first of all in terms of the competitive landscape there.\n\nReal competitive differentiator that Ipass is really our software and hybrid cloud.\n\nThe .\n\nPercentage of our cost to a customer that comes from NAND is a small part of the total cost and so we have a full lineup of products with different forms of NAND and I think that the competitive dynamic with our software strength, our hybrid cloud and AI technologies gives us a real strong.\n\nin the market and a durable competitive mode with regard to the .\n\nThe NAND market itself.\n\nWe are very very closely aligned with all of the large suppliers of solid state technology in deep discussions with them, we will make strategic decisions about procurement.\n\nAnd the way that Mike talked about and so we feel very very good about our.\n\nOur ability to understand the market and does the dynamic market like you said, but we are in very close dialogue with these suppliers as we have been for many many years.\n\nThank you that's helpful.\n\nThe next question is from Krish Shankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah, Hi, Thanks for taking my question George just wanted to find out kind of like where are we in the AI and the enterprise cycle and along the same path or focus on enhancements to the storage grid with this object storage is this also related to capitalizing on.\n\nIn the enterprise and then Mike. Thanks for all your help just a clarification as spot completely out of the model in the April quarter. Thank you.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo let me get the first one and then Michael give you the answer on spot we are starting to see the opening up of AI in the enterprise.\n\nWhere we are seeing clients standup AI centers of excellence with AI infrastructures that combined GPU based compute with HIFU.\n\nHigh performance storage infrastructures, we had several large wins in that category.\n\nWe're also seeing people build out Ada lakes, which are applications that allows you to combine data from multiple types. So that you can then normalize it and feed it into a larger language model our AI businesses performed according to our high.\n\nPatients multiple quarters in a row, we are also seeing a growing number of wins.\n\nAI service providers, who are building as a service infrastructure for enterprise AI and all of our differentiation around.\n\nEnd of multi tenancy security AI model data mobility, all of those things come into play and all of those use cases.\n\nPlease it's in the early innings, like we said, but our technology and our approach with customers is resonating.\n\nMike Thanks, George Crush there is about $9 million of cloud revenue in the Q4 guide that's with the expected close date of early March So thats. The difference the 15 that we talked about as we expected there to be that full quarter of about 24, and there was about a month ago.\n\nThanks, Scott Thanks, Mike.\n\nJoe.\n\nThe next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nThank you very much I wanted to see if you could talk about your expectations for tariffs and the risks I know Mike you had mentioned some some commentary on gross margin.\n\nThat was really in the context of NAND pricing.\n\nLike to get a better understanding of what you're thinking for the rest of apparel and if you've baked anything in and my congratulations on your retirement as well.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nI think you were.\n\nSpeaking about tariffs listen we have a global supply chain that has given us the ability to fulfill products.\n\nTwo customers from multiple locations and that is a very highly flexible supply chain.\n\nWe have as you know through the course of the past several years removed our dependency on China to a very immaterial amount.\n\nSo any tariff supply to products coming from China don't really affect us.\n\n.\n\nLocation in Mexico out of which we do build product, but we have the flexibility to move those capabilities to other locations that are not in a fairly short period of time.\n\nSo it's dynamic we are watching the situation we have as you can imagine several contingency plans and I'll just close by saying that.\n\nWe have not factored tariffs into our Q4 guide.\n\nAnd if tariffs applied to a wide swath of technologies that everybody in the industry users.\n\nWhich is our typical approach to using industry standard commodity components, then of course, it will affect the entire industry.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe next question is from Lou with DIY capital markets. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, thanks, Lew with Guidewire.\n\nMicra greatly appreciate all your support and help throughout the years and best to you. So George you mentioned a couple of times that it's going to take a while for AI really to contribute to give your material revenue growth. Just if you just give us an update on that you did just mentioned a minute ago that some AI inference applications.\n\nWe're starting to ramp, but obviously didn't seem like it really helped to the product revenue too much in this quarter. So are we still six months out 12 months out or anything that you could shed.\n\nShed light on without guidance would be helpful.\n\nWe said no.\n\nIn our prior commentary that what we are seeing clients do.\n\nIs put AI projects into proof of concept and start to learn from that and that.\n\nMovement of those projects into production in the enterprise would be in the second half of calendar year, 'twenty five or 'twenty six.\n\nSee the same thing can be the case. It is certainly the case that we are seeing the larger clients being more facts ILEC building AI centers of excellence.\n\nAnd being able to deploy those kind of technologies into their business environment.\n\nSo it will take time as we have said to brought and will keep you updated as we go through the quarter through the quarters, but we feel good about our position there are sort of really good wins that we are seeing across industries and across geographies and I feel good about our progress.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nThe next question is from Tim long with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, This is on for Tim Long I was just wanting to check in on Keystone.\n\nAnother strong quarter of growth and can you talk about customers kind of willingness to move to as a service versus traditional sale any kind of change in customer behavior increased interest you can mentioned thank you.\n\nWe offer as a service models in a broad range of ways clearly cloud.\n\nOur Super strong performance in cloud is reflective of a broad based enthusiasm and customers for as a service and the flexibility that cloud transformation gives them. We are seeing clients, who are either looking to transform their IP landscape, you'll have the same model as.\n\nPublic cloud taking on Keystone.\n\nReally like our hybrid offerings, so that they can build an architecture that spans public and on premise with Keystone. The second is clients that are deploying.\n\nApplications that are going through an early validation right. So it could be like an AI application that is not yet at scale. So they don't want to buy a full scale infrastructure for that use case they wanted to buy.\n\nWe have a flexible infrastructure model and when they are ready they can deploy it into a more capital like.\n\nPending Chuck kind of architecture. So we feel good we are focused on executing that part of our business.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question is from Ananda Baruah with loop capital. Please go ahead.\n\nYeah. Thanks, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question and Mike Yeah really enjoy working with you, we'll we'll miss working with you all have a great time.\n\nThe question I guess the question is for it could be for both of you at the Analyst day, guys you talked about.\n\nThrough 2027, and the average mid to high single digit digit.\n\nIs it Gregg.\n\nWhat yes it was.\n\nGoing on this quarter next quarter is that impact that.\n\nAt target at all yet and any early way to think about the productivity.\n\nDuring fiscal 'twenty six.\n\nWas there as well would be helpful. Thanks, a lot.\n\nAnd Thats why I. Thank you for the kind words I will miss working with you as well so as we talked about last quarter, we still feel very good about the long term targets. We gave at Investor day, and nothing that happened in Q3 is change that in terms of the mid to upper single digit growth.\n\nMargins as well as the cash flow conversion. So we felt really good about the product lineup George talked about that entering into 26 all of the all of the product momentum that we have the go to market changes. So nothing that we sit here today to say that that would change and we will we will hold fiscal 'twenty six guidance in total.\n\nOur next call.\n\nThank you thanks guys.\n\nThe next question is for from merchant with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my call and Mike again, congratulations on your retirement and.\n\nAnd working with you if I can just ask about the flash installed base I mean, how far along are we in terms of converting that installed base and net new customers that you can tell us about the overall installed base that still has line of sight to perhaps move to the Flash me. Thank you.\n\nYes, Thanks George at.\n\nThe penetration of our all flash.\n\nOur footprint into our installed base is now 43%. So it's up again modestly every quarter, which is a reflection of both the scale of our installed base and the fact that we are growing new footprints in that installed base. So that's it's 43% with Rick.\n\nGot to be.\n\nNo kind of nature of our wins in all flash listen all flash and public cloud are the two vehicles that allow us to win new customers and the pace of new customers continues to be good.\n\nThank you.\n\nThe next question is from stomach chatterji with J P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nHi, Thanks for taking my question and Mike.\n\nWe'll miss working with you know because good experience working with you.\n\ncharged off just on the product side you talked about.\n\nDisaggregated solution.\n\nAnd sort of launching that's on Libya.\n\nInsights to feel maybe if you can help me with those sort of update on the progress on doing a disaggregated solution and how do you think about on the service side and how you think about the incremental addressable market.\n\nProduct.\n\nIt would allow you to address and maybe just on the same lines. One of your peer companies has talked about the hyperscale deal whether it has been like mosquito scheme with a software solution.\n\nParticularly how do you think about sort of those being in your strategic roadmap or are those sort of beans in something that you would consider giving some of the puts or takes about.\n\nHow you think of pork product.\n\nOur product portfolio yourself positioned right now thank you.\n\nWe made good progress on disaggregated.\n\nDisaggregated storage it is for high performance unstructured data use cases, and you'll hear more as we get towards in sight.\n\nAs you know our disaggregated storage is third generation disaggregated storage, which is the most scalable the most high performance and of course, the richest set of features in the industry. Many clients are using us for high performance NASS.\n\nReady for AI and other use cases, but this opens up our ability to attack. The other players in the Nash market, particularly the large other nascent incumbent Dale and so we feel good about our opportunity there with regard to cloud listen our cloud business offers compelling value.\n\nto all three large hyper scale providers.\n\nOut that we've been in that market since 2019, which was the GE of the first.\n\nCloud hyper scaler solution, it's a highly valuable technology to them because it allows them to bring clients to their platforms and it's a very high margin business for both us and them and so we're going to continue to drive the full stack value, we have into more and more and more use cases.\n\nAnd we feel really good about the momentum in the Hyperscale business.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd the final question today comes from with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\n\nThanks for taking the question and Mike Best of luck here.\n\nJust want to wrap on any more updates on dynamics, we're seeing with .\n\nVmware and Broadcom and customers.\n\nCustomers contemplating new architectures converged hyper converged cloud et cetera.\n\nPotential.\n\nOpportunities and challenges that that might be presenting the business. Thank you.\n\nI think we are well positioned with the Vmware.\n\nDiscussions and our clients if they want to stay on Vmware and optimize their overall Vmware landscape. We have good solutions with Vmware to allow customers to do that and we've seen some of our clients start to shake that up we talked about in my prepared remarks some clients.\n\nPlatforming from on premise Vmware cloud using a combination of Vmware cloud offerings as well as you know.\n\nModern container based architectures you have.\n\nVery good progress with some of our clients on cloud and then I think with regard to using on Prem alternatives.\n\nAgain as he said, we have joint solutions, with Microsoft and Red hat and others.\n\nSo I think it's a topic that will take time to clarify where customers are headed but we have good choices for them, regardless of where they're going.\n\nYeah.\n\nThank you.\n\nWe're actually able to squeeze in one more question from Singh with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nYes, yes. Thank you for squeezing me in I really appreciate it and.\n\nThanks for taking my question now.\n\nTo beat a dead horse, but wanted to understand going back to the deal cash outs.\n\nWhat percentage of those were displacement of competitive opportunities worth is.\n\nOur replacing your existing ACD to hybrid footprint and as you look towards your.\n\nIn the quarter had a is progressing a year.\n\nWhat has been the opportunity to replace cost.\n\nOur competitors versus again your existing footprint, if you could talk about that a little bit I'd really appreciate that.\n\nThere was no specific dynamic in related to the deals that pushed out that followed any pattern of competitive versus .\n\nNet app refresh it was really tied to customers buying in procurement.\n\nKind of lifecycle and our lack of visibility into some of those right that we are correcting with more detailed inspection of exactly who and the customer has approved.\n\nAnd the various steps that a transaction typically it takes to get to closure. So I wouldn't comment that there was anything specific with regard to whether it was our footprint our competitors listen in every quarter. There are a huge number of transactions that we undertake some of them are refreshes of our installed footprint some of.\n\nDenmark competitor footprint take out I can just tell you having sold flash for so many many years and the fact that we are 43% of our installed base penetrated with flash.\n\nGive you an indication that a preponderant.\n\nPart of our flash business is net new footprint or net new logos right because of it.\n\nDisplacing our installed base, we will be at a much much higher percentage of penetration today.\n\nAlright. Thanks, Thanks for that I appreciate your question.\n\nThank you I'm going to pass it back to George for some final comments. Thank.\n\nThank you Chris.\n\nWhile we did not perform to our standards in Q3, we remain very well positioned with customers as their supplier of choice for AI and other data driven workloads. We are taking actions to get back on track and have already seen several deals that slipped out of Q3 flows in early Q4.\n\nOur portfolio has never been stronger or more tightly aligned to it organizations top priorities.\n\nWe enable customers to trade data as an enterprise wide effort to stay agile and competitive in the age of AI.\n\nI am very confident in our continued ability to outgrow the market and to take share.\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially.\nFor more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website. including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone. We started FY '25 strong, building on our momentum exiting last fiscal year. In Q1, we delivered 8% year-over-year revenue growth and set records for first quarter operating margin and EPS. These results are a testament to our strong execution in a continued uncertain macroeconomic environment, our unfavoring confidence in the customer benefits of the highly differentiated NetApp intelligent data infrastructure platform and our disciplined management of the business.\nAs a result, we are raising our FY '25 outlook for both revenue and profit. As we said during our recent Investor Day, we are focused on our uniquely differentiated solutions in flash, block, cloud storage and AI. They address markets which are bolstered by both secular and company-specific tailwinds and represent our biggest opportunities to fuel revenue growth and increase market share. In Q1, we experienced notable momentum across all these areas, evidence that our value proposition is resonating. This focus coupled with our dedication to innovation, drives my confidence in our continued success. Customers choose NetApp because we help them address their most important data challenges. Leveraging the power of public and hybrid clouds to rapidly deploy new applications, unify the data for AI, simplify cloud integration and strengthen data protection.\nWe uniquely deliver a comprehensive and integrated storage and data management platform, giving our customers the power to unify all their data for any application anywhere and the ability to seamlessly and consistently manage it while ensuring data remains secure and protected. We again delivered robust year-over-year performance in our hybrid cloud segment with revenue growth of 8% and product revenue growth of 13%, driven by strength in all-flash storage. Broad-based demand across our all-flash storage portfolio propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to $3.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year.\nAt the start of Q1, we introduced the new AFFA Series family of high-performance all-flash arrays, capable of powering the most demanding environments from today's mission-critical applications, to tomorrow's Gen AI workloads, delivering the advanced data management, industry-leading ransomware protection and cloud integration that modern workloads require. The new AFFA Series saw positive customer reception and performed ahead of our expectations. Both our capacity flash and block optimized all-flash array families exhibited strong growth year-over-year, addressing an expanded TAM and driving share gains.\nIn Q1, we had numerous competitive takeouts across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C Series and the [ ASA ] products to modernize the legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like artificial intelligence. The ASA enabled us to capture a new to NetApp customer displacing a legacy block storage competitor at a European-based manufacturer the compelling price performance of the ASA, together with its modern architecture and comprehensive software capabilities help the customers realize savings as they refresh their [ SAN ] environment. This is the first step in a larger relationship as the customer plans to purchase additional ASA systems to replace the remaining competitive footprint and evaluate our public cloud services.\nKeystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering was again a highlight this quarter with revenue growing over 60% from Q1 a year ago. Keystone gives customers the operational agility and reduce financial risk they need to manage in a dynamic environment. A good example of this is the leading automotive supplier that chose Keystone to help address rapidly changing storage demands created by ongoing transformation of the automotive market. Keystone gives them the flexibility to manage rapid growth, but also the ability to shrink based on changing circumstance. AI is the cornerstone of many of my customer conversations, reinforcing NetApp's position as a proven data infrastructure platform provider and thought leader in this space.\nCustomers are selecting NetApp as their partner at every stage of the AI life cycle because of our high-performance all-flash storage, unique cloud integration and extensive data management capabilities. These capabilities support a wide range of needs from data preparation, model training and tuning to retrieve a augmented generation or RAG and inferencing and address the requirements for responsible AI including model and data versioning as well as data governance and privacy.\nWhile we believe the large opportunity for enterprise AI is still ahead of us, we are seeing good momentum today with our AI business performing well ahead of our expectations. In Q1, we had over 50 AI and data lake modernization wins. I'll give you just a couple of examples. We were selected by another of the world's largest oil and gas companies for their AI and high-performance compute workloads. Our all flat storage will power the customers' AI environment. servicing more than 40,000 CPU cores and GPUs, which run simulations and 3D virtualization workloads, Additionally, we made it practical for a leading financial services institution to consolidate petabytes of data into a single data lake for AI and analytics workloads including fraud detection, credit scoring and portfolio management and improving the productivity of their data scientists.\nBoth instances are examples of how our deep understanding of and experience in AI workloads, together with our intelligent data infrastructure platform, help drive customer preference for NetApp infrastructure to service their growing AI requirements. We continue to advance our strong position with the development of Gen AI cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. In Q1, in partnership with Lenovo, we announced a full stack OBX system optimized for Gen AI and designed to support RAG. Additionally, we introduced new capabilities designed for cloud AI workloads. We integrated the NetApp Gen AI toolkit with Microsoft Azure NetApp files, giving customers the ability to generate unique high quality and also relevant results from Gen AI projects by combining their proprietary data with pretrained foundational models.\nIn conjunction with AWS, we released a reference architecture for Amazon Bedrock to help customers implement RAG enabled workflows that bring proprietary data stored on Amazon FSX for NetApp ONTAP into the Gen AI data pipelines. Gen AI is a truly hybrid workload, and only NetApp has the breadth of products and services to reduce the complexity resources and risk for customers in managing these strategic workloads across increasingly complex hybrid multi-cloud environments. Public cloud segment revenue was $159 million, up 3% year-over-year. Our highly differentiated first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our focus and top priority. These services continue to grow rapidly, increasing roughly 40% year-over-year and performing ahead of our expectations at each of our hyperscaler partners.\nAs we are [indiscernible] on previous calls, we expect the headwinds from subscription services to lessen over the course of FY '25 and allowing the strength of our first-party and marketplace storage services to shine through. Our rapid innovation in cloud storage services broadening workload support, capabilities, price and performance points continues to solidify our leadership position. In Q1, we again enhanced the capabilities of AWS, FSX or NetApp or DAP, boosting scalability and performance to address evolving business needs. Microsoft recognized the unique value we and [ Cap Gemini ] bring with its 2024 Partner of the Year Award in the migration to Azure category for our work in moving a large Asian retail customer to Azure, which included Azure NetApp files.\nOur strong Q1 performance continues the momentum from last year, paving a confident path into FY '25. The robust growth in our revenue billings and profitability reflects the increasing alignment of customer needs with our unique solutions. We believe our highly differentiated, intelligent data infrastructure platform designed for the age of data positions us to capture the growth potential in flash, block, cloud storage and AI, promising continued success for our shareholders and customers. Looking ahead, our priorities are clear. We are well positioned to seize a growing market opportunity. As we grow, we will maintain our disciplined operational management to drive leverage throughout our business model.\nIn closing, I want to thank the NetApp team for their dedication to delivering exceptional results in an uncertain macro environment. I also want to remind you that we are hosting our Insight customer conference in Las Vegas next month, where we will announce advances to our innovation agenda and showcase how we help our customers make their data infrastructure intelligence for the age of AI. I hope to see you there. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I'm sure you've already seen the news of his upcoming retirement.\nMike has been a great partner to me in our focus on delivering profitable growth and shareholder value. Over the course of his tenure, from FY '21 through FY '24 he has helped drive revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of almost 60%. Mike, I have been blessed to have a wise partner from whom I learned much every day. a world-class human being whose trusted friendship has helped us navigate disruption smoothly and who has entertained us with his encyclopedic knowledge of country music. I appreciate Mike's commitment to stay through the end of the fiscal year to ensure a seamless transition. Over to you, Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, George. I greatly appreciate the very nice comments. I'll come back to those comments after I run through the numbers. While my family and I are excited about what is to come in our next phase of life, I want to assure everyone that it is business as usual until we name a new CFO. My focus will remain on delivering our plans here and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition.\nWe executed a solid quarter in an uncertain macro environment, hitting or exceeding all of our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, as evident in our solid Q1 results. We made progress towards our long-term Investor Day targets of mid- to upper single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth on average through fiscal year '27. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our top line billings and revenue exceeded our expectations, growing 12% and 8% year-over-year, respectively, in Q1 and with product revenue growing 13% year-over-year.\nAs expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong at 72%, near all-time highs. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 26% and EPS of $1.56, both Q1 records. We returned approximately 170% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 diluted share count by 2% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow this year. Due to solid execution and strong operational management, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of the year.\nAs a result, we are raising our fiscal year '25 revenue and EPS expectations. Now to the details of the quarter. Revenue of $1.54 billion increased 8% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range. Q1 billings of $1.45 million increased 12% year-over-year. This marks our third straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth, even with an uncertain macro environment continuing to pressure IT spending. We are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident that our innovations will drive growth through the rest of fiscal year '25. Product revenue of $669 million was up 13% year-over-year. Support revenue of $631 million grew 3% year-over-year. Public cloud revenue of $159 million increased 3% from Q1 a year ago, driven by hyperscaler first-party and marketplace storage services offset by expected declines in subscription services.\nQ1 consolidated gross margin came in at 72% and was up 160 basis points from a year ago. Product gross margin was 60%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call and during the subsequent Investor Day, we have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue through fiscal year '25. We have made strategic purchase commitments to lock in SSB supply and mitigate rising prices in the future, which continues to give us confidence in our product gross margins for fiscal year '25. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margins of 92%. The Q1 public cloud gross margins improved to 71% from 68% in the prior fiscal year fourth quarter.\nDuring fiscal year '25, we expect to continue to make progress on our public cloud gross margins towards a long-term target of 75% to 80%. We Operating expenses of $714 million was up 2% year-over-year and declined 1% from Q4 fiscal year '24. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 26% ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.56 was also above the high end of our guidance, driven by higher revenues, operating margins and interest income and a slightly lower tax rate. Operating cash flow was $341 million in Q1, a decrease of 25% year-over-year, driven by higher annual incentive compensation payouts and payments for strategic SSD purchases, partially offset by higher customer collections from higher billings.\nIn Q1, DSO decreased to 40 and inventory turns were 8. Free cash flow decreased 28% year-over-year to $300 million due to lower operating cash flow. During the quarter, we returned $507 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Q1 deferred revenue was $4.2 billion, down less than 0.5% year-over-year, a smaller decline than in each of the past 3 quarters. We expect continued improvement in our deferred revenue growth during fiscal year '25 as we drive billings growth.\nWe are adding RPO as a new disclosure this quarter as it is a leading indicator of future growth in our business. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering continues to gain traction in the market, broadening our relevance to customer use cases and is becoming a more meaningful part of our business. RPO, which includes unbilled commitments, was $4.5 billion in Q1. Now turning to guidance, starting with the full year. While we continue to believe that macro indicators are uncertain, our continued execution gives us confidence in our business going forward. To that end, we are raising our revenue guidance for the full year to between $6.48 billion and $6.68 billion in revenue representing 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\nWe expect fiscal year '25 consolidated gross margin to be 71% to 72% and our operating margin to be 27% to 28%, both unchanged from prior expectations. We are raising our net interest income expectations to $50 million driven by higher interest income. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 20% to 21%. As a result, we expect EPS to be in the range of $7 to $7.20, which at the midpoint, implies 10% year-over-year growth. Turning now to our second quarter guidance. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.55 billion and $1.715 billion, which at the midpoint implies 5% growth year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be in to 72% and operating margin to be approximately 28%.\nWe expect net interest income to be approximately $15 million in the quarter our tax rate to be between 20% and 21%, and EPS in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. -- in closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stockholders.\nFinally, before we go on to Q&A, I would like to add some personal comments on my announcement. It has been an honor and a privilege to lead such a dynamic and visionary organization over the last 4.5 years. I am so proud to be part of the NetApp team and being able to play a role in helping NetApp grow and deliver on its promise of profitable growth. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will continue to lead the finance organization until an appropriate successor is identified. Like all companies, NetApp continues to evolve, and I am excited to welcome a new CFO who will all take NetApp to the next level and execute against the strategic road map we laid out at our recent Investor Day.\nI want to thank all of you for your continued support of NetApp and look forward to the continued success in the business. That being said, I want to reiterate that it is business as usual for now, and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor events. Kris, please take it away for Q&A.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategy.\nThese statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone. We concluded FY '24 on a high note, demonstrating robust performance in the fourth quarter and building positive momentum as we step into FY '25. Our revenue for both Q4 and FY '24 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting the strong growth of our expanded all-flash portfolio. Throughout FY '24, we maintained a high level of operational discipline, leading to company records for annual gross margin operating margin, earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow.\nAt the start of FY '24, we implemented a plan to enhance the performance of our storage business and build a more focused approach to the public cloud business while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro environment. This plan has yielded tangible results and our value proposition is resonating strongly in the marketplace. Customers are increasingly turning to NetApp to help them build intelligent data infrastructure and leverage the power of public and hybrid clouds for rapidly growing data-intensive workloads like AI, cloud native, open source and enterprise applications while ensuring their data remains secure and protected from ransomware attacks.\nNetApp uniquely delivers a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, supporting any application, any data type and spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. We deliver unparalleled simplicity of data management and infrastructure and application deployment with consistent automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. In a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and escalating cybersecurity threats, we empower customers with the flexibility to rapidly deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, simplify cloud integration and strengthen data protection.\nNow to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our hybrid cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 8%. Strong customer demand for our broad portfolio of modern all-flash arrays particularly the C-Series capacity flash and ASA block optimize flash was again ahead of our expectations. This demand propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to an all-time high at $3.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year.\nEarly in Q1 of FY '25, we unveiled our new all-flash A-Series unified data storage products offering customers enhanced performance and effective density at a lower cost than the previous A-Series generation. These products set a new standard for enterprise storage enabling customers to turbocharge workloads ranging from traditional enterprise applications to Gen AI. The new AFF A-Series, coupled with our highly successful C-Series, and TAM expanding ASA products position us to further increase our share in the all-flash market. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering was also a highlight of the quarter. Keystone provides cloud-like management for hybrid cloud resources in a single subscription with flexible multiyear contracts that aligns storage costs with business needs, enabling rapid response to changing capacity and performance requirements.\nWe consistently hear from customers that are integrated service level assurance with performance, availability, ransomware recovery and sustainability guarantees is our differentiator. This has enabled us to accelerate growth by displacing competitors' storage-as-a-service subscriptions, winning new Keystone subscriptions and expanding existing ones. FY '24 total contract value sales of Keystone more than doubled from the prior year to almost $150 million. We expect this momentum to continue and that FY '25 will be another significant growth year for Keystone. A leading semiconductor manufacturer, selected Keystone as the vehicle to consolidate its storage needs.\nInitially aiming to select one vendor for block and another for file, we established ourselves as a single global standard for both environments displacing the incumbent for block storage. This multiyear 8-figure deal allowed the customer to reduce the complexity and improve the availability of their storage environment. AI is a top priority for organizations as they seek to accelerate innovation, revolutionize operations, drive competitive advantage and deliver superior solutions to their customers. Data management is essential for enterprise AI. Customers choose NetApp to support them at every phase of the AI life cycle.\nDue to our high-performance all-flash storage, complemented by comprehensive data management capabilities that support requirements from data preparation, model training and tuning, retrieval augmented generation or RAG and inferencing as well as requirements for responsible AI, including model and data versioning, data governance and privacy.\nWe continue to strengthen our position in enterprise AI, focusing on making it easier for customers to derive value from their AI investments. In Q4, we introduced NetApp AI pod with C-Series capacity plaque systems, delivering a new level of cost and performance, rack-based utilization and sustainability. In conjunction with Cisco, we updated FlexPod AI reference architectures to support the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform, giving customers an end-to-end blueprint to efficiently design, deploy and operate AI infrastructure.\nWe were one of the first partners to complete the storage validation for NVIDIA OVX systems and at the start of Q1, we were the first to announce a full stack OVX system, the NAV AI part with Lenovo think system servers for NVIDIA OVX is optimized for Gen AI and designed to support RAG. We announced much of this innovation at NVIDIA GTC, where we were honored to be recognized during the keynote for our role in storing a significant portion of enterprises unstructured data, which is the fuel for Gen AI. Through our partnership with NVIDIA, we give customers the ability to talk directly to the large amount of existing data stored on NetApp on-premises and in the cloud, demonstrating the value of our installed base and the critical role we play in AI.\nWe are the AI infrastructure of choice from one of the world's leading oil and gas companies. The company is developing its own large language model using the high-performance AI cluster with NetApp all-flash storage. They are now also building an AI center of excellence to support various departmental AI initiatives and have again selected NetApp storage for this part of their AI infrastructure, leveraging CCVs to optimize price and performance, they are rapidly ramping up their AI infrastructure building new models and onboarding AI resources.\nThey awarded us the deal over their AI server vendor because of our ability to remove roadblocks in their AI workflows and accelerate the time to value from their AI investments. Public Cloud segment revenue was $152 million, up 1% year-over-year, first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and driving cloud storage services to 2/3 of total public cloud ARR. These offerings are highly differentiated and closely aligned with customers' purchase preferences in Q4, we had a good number of takeouts of competitors on-premises infrastructure with cloud storage services based on NetApp ONTAP technology. which helped drive our best quarter for cloud storage services with each of our hyperscaler partners.\nWe are well ahead of the competition in cloud storage services and we are innovating to further extend our leadership position. In Q4, we further increased the performance of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP addressing an even broader set of performance-intensive workloads. We also introduced a new service level for Google Cloud NetApp volumes giving customers more granular control to match the capacity and performance needs of their cloud workloads. We were proud to receive Golden Clouds Technology Partner of the Year for infrastructure, storage for the second consecutive year.\nReflecting on FY '24, I want to thank the NetApp team for their work to strengthen our position. We have a stronger, more complete all-flash portfolio, are addressing a wider set of cloud storage workloads and have a robust go-to-market plan better positioning us to win across the board and in new markets like AI. Without question, our modern approach to unified data storage, spanning data types, price points and hybrid mother cloud environment is resonating in the market, giving us solid momentum as we enter the new fiscal year.\nLooking ahead to FY '25, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro environment. The backdrop is better now than it was at the start of FY '24. We will remain laser focused on our top priorities, while continuing to raise the bar on execution and maintaining our operational discipline. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. I'm confident that this leadership, coupled with the strong momentum we've built through FY '24 positions us for continued growth and share gains. I encourage you to attend or tune into our June 11 Investor Day to learn more about our long-term strategy. Visit our Investor Relations website for more information.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George noted, we are laser-focused on managing the elements within our control. This focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for Q4 and the full year.\nBefore getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered solid revenue growth in Q4 driven by our all-flash and cloud storage portfolio, which have strong momentum as we head into fiscal year '25. For Q4, our all-flash array revenue achieved a $3.6 billion annualized run rate, growing 17% year-on-year. Flash now accounts for approximately 60% of hybrid cloud revenue. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering delivered another strong quarter and a strong year with revenue growth up triple digits year-over-year in fiscal year '24. And first-party and marketplace cloud storage, the largest part of our cloud business grew double digits quarter-over-quarter and over 30% year-over-year in Q4.\nOur operating profit margin was a record for a Q4 and operating cash flow was an all-time record. For the full year of fiscal '24, product gross margins reached a record high of 60% representing around 1,000 basis points of year-over-year improvement driven by product mix, lower SSD costs and a normalizing supply chain environment. We have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue into fiscal '25.\nIn fiscal '24, we generated $1.53 billion in free cash flow, a 76% year-over-year increase compared to fiscal year '23 and an all-time high. And we returned 86% of fiscal '24 free cash flow to shareholders through $900 million of share repurchases and around $400 million of dividends. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction of full year diluted share count by approximately 3% from the prior year.\nWe plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal '25 and are announcing today an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.52. Furthermore, today, we are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion. Now to the details of Q4. Revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.67 billion, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 billings of $1.81 billion were up 8% year-over-year. This marks our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.52 billion was up 6% year-over-year.\nProduct revenue was $806 million and up 8% year-over-year. Support revenue of $623 million increased 4% year-over-year. Public cloud ARR exited the year at $630 million up 2% year-over-year and up $22 million from Q3. Public cloud revenue composed 9% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 1% year-over-year to $152 million. We exited fiscal '24 with $4.23 billion in deferred revenue, a decrease of 2% year-over-year consistent with the year-over-year decrease in Q3. Q4 consolidated gross margin was approximately 71.5%.\nTotal hybrid cloud gross margin was 72%. Product gross margin was 61%, 130 basis points ahead of our prior guidance driven by better mix and continued growth in our C-Series products. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin increased 290 basis points, both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 68%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 28%, the highest for Q4 in the history of NetApp and the second only to last quarter's 30% operating margin.\nEPS of $1.80 was $0.02 ahead of guidance of $1.78, predominantly driven by better gross margins. As a reminder, we had a onetime improvement in our tax rate in Q3 that normalized towards our usual low 20% range in Q4, which was contemplated in our prior guidance. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $613 million, and free cash flow was $567 million. These cash flow metrics came in above our expectations in Q4 due to higher customer collections, lower tax payments and lower supply chain payments.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $104 million in dividends. Q4 diluted share count of $212 million was down 2% year-over-year. We had approximately $500 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal '24. And today, we are announcing an increase in that authorization by another $1 billion.\nBefore moving to guidance, let's review the results for the full year fiscal '24. Revenue of $6.27 billion was down 1% year-over-year and billings of $6.25 billion were down 2% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. For fiscal '24, operating margin was 27%, up 260 basis points year-over-year driven predominantly by 450 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross margins, slightly offset by the small year-over-year revenue decline and targeted operating expense growth.\nFor fiscal '24, operating cash flow was $1.69 billion, and free cash flow was $1.53 billion, both all-time company highs. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.25 billion in cash and short-term investments against $2.4 billion in total debt. Now to guidance, starting with fiscal '25.\nLet me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, such as business analytics, AI, cloud transitions, data security and application modernization. Macro indicators today are better than a year ago. However, while there has been some improvement in our view, the macro environment remains unsettled. And as a result, we expect fiscal '25 total revenue to be in the range of $6.45 million to $6.65 billion, which at the midpoint reflects 4.5% year-over-year growth.\nImplied in our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of fiscal '25. While we are not providing specific cloud revenue guidance, we do expect public cloud revenue to return to consistent growth in fiscal '25. We expect fiscal '25 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% to 72%, consistent with fiscal '24 gross margins despite the pressure coming from rising NAND component costs.\nWe expect growth in supporting cloud gross profit to help maintain our overall gross margins. Implied in this guidance is growth year-over-year in gross profit dollars, which is our focus. We have secured a large majority of our forecasted SSD demand for fiscal '25 albeit at higher prices than fiscal '24. Given our existing inventory levels and the forecasted use of our prebuy supply, product gross margins are expected to be higher in the first half of fiscal '25 as we utilize our inventory compared to the second half of fiscal '25. We remain confident in our long-term public cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80% and expect to make progress in fiscal '25 towards this target. We anticipate operating margins of 27% to 28% and EPS of $6.80 to $7.\nFor the year, we expect the tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. We expect operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital, especially in Q1 when we will pay our annual incentive compensation plans. Our anticipated healthy cash generation enables us to continue our strong return of capital to shareholders.\nIn fiscal '25, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders and share buybacks and dividends. Our conviction and future cash flow generation is driving the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share in fiscal '25 with the remainder of free cash flow going to share buybacks. We expect to reduce share count by approximately 1% to 2% in fiscal '25.\nNow on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.455 and $1.605 billion which at the midpoint implies growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 72% and operating margin to be approximately 25%. EPS should be in the range between $1.40 and $1.50.\nIn closing, I want to echo George's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued focus and execution in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal '25, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to capture our growing set of opportunities and increased profitability.\nI'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategies.\nThese statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY '24 call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered exceptional performance across the board despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength, coupled with continued operational discipline, yielded company all-time highs, for consolidated gross margin, operating margin and EPS for the second consecutive quarter.\nEntering FY '24, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our storage business, and build a more focused approach to our public cloud business while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro economy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to date support our raised outlook for the year and enhance our position for the long term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models.\nOur unified data solutions address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today. Modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks and building scalable, high-performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services and unique and proven capabilities for hybrid cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify its scale and lower storage costs.\nOur siloes-free approach to unify data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our hybrid cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry-leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion.\nIn Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of hybrid cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C Series all-flash arrays, again exceeded our expectations, delivering new to NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize legacy 10K hard disk drives and hybrid flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our all-flash solutions driving share gains.\nOur newly introduced ASA families of SAN-optimized high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We are excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees are well positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive takeouts across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C series and the ASC products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like artificial intelligence.\nWe continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of ransomware protection solutions. We help customers take proactive steps to protect, detect and recover their data. Competitive solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risk and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first enterprise-class storage solution, validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art data protection and cybersecurity solutions.\nWe saw good momentum in AI with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA super pod and base pod deployments. We help organizations and use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI.\nNetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance and simplicity that enterprises require for their Gen AI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of Gen AI-driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service and cloud native offerings providing customers with our widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements.\nKeystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering delivered another strong quarter with revenue growing triple digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year.\nThese offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships and deliver growth in customer count capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our public cloud business. As a part of this, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and Instaclustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some stand-alone services into the core functionality of cloud volumes to widen our competitive moat.\nIn Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from nonrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year '25, building a strong base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services position us to address the new and emerging Gen AI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open source developer of Gen AI tools, data sets and models is leveraging AWS' FSX for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings.\nThe customer was looking for a high performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AIML workloads. FSXN gave them a scalable solution with performance storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSXN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market.\nWe are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders.\nFinally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year.\nThe momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income.\nThe strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability.\nNow to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services.\nNow for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter.\nEPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. [ DSL ] 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal '24 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward.\nWe have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point.\nEven with the increase in commodity costs, we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let's turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 billion to $6.335 billion or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and hyperscaler first-party and marketplace services.\nFiscal '24 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60% and driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 and to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately 40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion.\nIn Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product road map items.\nOur tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also, please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for fiscal '25 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the 8 to 10x range. In closing, I want to thank our customers partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top line results demonstrate the value that customers realize from our products and services.\nOur innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded company all-time high for gross margin, operating margin and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions with increased profit and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth.\nIn Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed that tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorated to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity, with intelligent data infrastructure. Today's organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of Public and Hybrid Clouds, while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud native and open source applications, and they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers.\nOnly NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer [ gains ] with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include storage life cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees.\nIntelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash Array, continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new [ generated ] NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition.\nIn the quarter, we successfully completed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an infrastructure as a service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data managed suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities.\nBuilding on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The A SA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance.\nKeystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and which efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low latency interconnection to all major public clouds.\nTurning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first-party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our [ Hypers ] partners' go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services.\nHowever, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers while refocusing some services such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr to complement and extend our Hybrid Cloud storage offerings, creating greater differencing and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as stand-alone subscriptions today, such as data protection into the core functionality of cloud volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services.\nWe anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first-party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow.\nNow to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first [ and ] marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers' buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio.\nIn Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp volumes. Now we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud but we are natively integrated into all 3 of the leading hyperscale vendors, and we are not standing still with this advantage. Just 2 months after introducing the GCN [ D-Service ], we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud.\nAs examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud's Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp volumes as well as cross protocol hybrid cloud AI pipeline on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp App to replace a competitor's [ sand ] systems when they move their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer's first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating [ FSxN ] for workload consolidation and disaster recovery.\nLooking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24 despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management, which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I'm confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT [ event ]. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted.\nOur modern innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry-leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year.\nQ2 consolidated gross margins of 72% and were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margins of 61% also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in line with net income for the full year.\nDue to our solid execution and operational efficiencies and we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24.\nNow to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160 basis points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year.\nAs discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue and most notably, product revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue and attached to our installed base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first-party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services.\nNow for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72%, and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from 3 main factors: number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products; number two, favorable COGS stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost-sensitive competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point. There were no unusual or onetime transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2.\nOperating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2, operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15.\nMore importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multiyear support and product cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nNow turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance and still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenues to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyperscale or first-party and marketplace services as we work through minor headwinds from Public Cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%.\nFor the second half, we expect product gross margins to range between 58% to 60% driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of $212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in line with net income although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital.\nIn Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71% and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74.\nIn closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and other growth initiatives and strategies.\nThese statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on managing the elements within our control, reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business.\nWe are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-Series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family.\nSimilarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level high-performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience.\nBuilding on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-Series, a family of SAN-specific all flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms.\nComplementing our unified storage offering, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud.\nIn May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objective appropriately aligned to each team's strength. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities.\nThe changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion and should help drive top line growth in the second half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion, was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on products and AFA revenue.\nAdditionally, as Mike will outline, the first half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA proven architecture in 2018.\nToday, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective, predictive and generative AI projects depend on high-quality, well-managed unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on-premises. High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves.\nWhile early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp cloud volume services.\nAccelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on premises and in the cloud. With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions.\nOur confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list.\nNow turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive action to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first-party services and improve subscription performance. We will add more details to share with you on our next call.\nThat said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first-party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of our portfolio.\nOur expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth.\nLikewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about an expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's, SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability and recovery requirements.\nThis is a large long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environment on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth.\nOur modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate, simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects.\nLooking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24.\nBefore turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you, we will be hosting our INSIGHT User Conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted.\nOur disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectation for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year.\nCash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year '24, cash flow should normalize with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal '24 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year.\nNow to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion, decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion, decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovation will drive growth in the second half of fiscal year '24.\nHybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion, was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million, was down 25%. Remember that first half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million, grew 2% year-over-year.\nPublic Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million, increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First-party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services.\nAs George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71%, came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago and again, reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record loan NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future.\nNAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations, and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%.\nPublic Cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million, were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4 '23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kickoff meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations.\nEPS of $1.15, was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nNow turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected, primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue.\nWe continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25% and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year.\nIf FX rates stay at the end of July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first half fiscal year '23 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year's supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70% and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45.\nIn closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry.

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director\n\nThanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter FY '23 call. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance with disciplined operational management yielding all-time high quarterly operating margin and EPS above expectations. For FY '23, we delivered record high annual operating margin and EPS despite the slow demand environment and relatively flat revenue from fiscal year '22.\nEven as customers are tightening their budgets in response to the macro, they are not stopping investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Digital transformation projects involving business analytics, AI, data security and application modernization, both on-premises and in the cloud, remain top priorities for IT organizations. This drives our confidence in the health of our market and future growth opportunity despite the temporary macro headwind. We are participating in the areas of priority spending with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management by providing customers with the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security and sustainability, we increase our relevance and value, and we continue to introduce new innovations to deliver greater customer value, further strengthening our position.\nOn our last call, I outlined our 3 areas of focus to sharpen our execution to better deliver results, while at the same time, positioning ourselves for long-term success. As a reminder, the focus areas are: remain prudent stewards of the business tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage systems business and build a more focused approach to our public cloud business.\nAs you can see from our Q4 and FY '23 results, we have demonstrated success in managing the elements within our control and staying flexible to adapt to the ever-changing environment. We remain committed to maintaining operational discipline as we move through FY '24 adjusting as appropriate to drive operating margin expansion and EPS growth while also continuing to invest for the long term.\nTurning to our storage systems business. Q4 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.4 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Our all-flash array business decreased 4% from Q4 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Similar to Q3, headwinds from large enterprises, weighed on our product and AFA revenue. As you've seen, we are reinvigorating our storage portfolio, innovating to deliver greater customer value, reach new customers and better address areas of priority spending and market growth.\nONTAP AI and Flex bot-AI are proven and tested reference architectures to help feed and simplify AI deployments. These solutions are designed around our all-flash arrays which are uniquely suited to meet the performance, multi-protocol and data mobility demands of AI workloads. In Q4, we demonstrated industry-leading performance in the GPU direct benchmark, [indiscernible] to enable customers to use the full power of GPU technology for AI. Our affinity to AI use cases doesn't stop at performance. ONTAP includes native data management tools that streamline workflows for data science teams and integrate multi-platform, multi-site and multi-cloud data pipeline with new performance and data management features planned in upcoming ONTAP releases, we expect to raise the bar again, not just for performance, but for total workflow solutions that help companies realize the benefits of AI faster and with better results.\nThe new AFF C-Series, our comprehensive portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays began shipping late in Q4. We are very pleased with the initial customer response in addition to lots of coding activity we closed a good number of deals in the fourth quarter. One of our early C-Series wins was a $15 million deal at a large financial institution for business-critical workloads in its cloud-ready service level defined environment. We beat the competition with a solution that was significantly denser and more energy efficient.\nFollowing this highly successful launch, we introduced the NetApp AFA A-Series early in Q1. The ASA is a new line of [indiscernible] specific flash storage systems that deliver high levels of performance, scalability, data availability, efficiency and cloud connectivity with up to 50% lower power consumption and associated carbon emissions and competitive offering. The ASA complements our unified storage offering to address block-only use cases while avoiding the operational and data silos of competitors' products. We are also innovating to improve the customer experience. In Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a portfolio of programs, bringing predictability and adaptability including the storage life cycle program for nondisruptive storage upgrade. At the start of Q1, we announced ONTAP 1, a simple way to buy and consume all the native software capabilities of ONTAP. We are enhancing the value of these built-in capabilities with our ransomware recovery guaranteed, which leverages ONTAP unique combinations of key built-in security and ransomware protective features to detect, stop and recover from ransomware attacks in real time. In addition to delivering significant innovation, we've also rebalanced our go-to-market efforts, including focusing our broad sales organization on selling flash through compensation plans, and reinstituting a specialist sales team for cloud. We believe these actions will allow the team to better address the large storage TAM.\nEntering FY '24, I'm confident that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. We are seeing early positive signs but the full benefit of these changes will take time to develop and should be a driver for product revenue growth in the second half.\nWhile we are sharpening our attack on the storage market, we are not taking our eye off the Public Cloud opportunity. Public cloud ARR of $620 million was up 23% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by strength in Public Cloud storage services. Our Public Cloud business in Q4 was back-end loaded, resulting in softer revenue and lower DBNRR than our ARR results would indicate. Public Cloud revenue for Q4 was $151 million, and DBNRR was 114%. Our Public Cloud services are highly differentiated with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors, and they create customer preference for NetApp. The number of total cloud customers, customers using multiple of our Public Cloud services and customers with better than $500,000 of revenue in the quarter, all continue to grow nicely.\nWhile like our cloud partners, we see continued cloud optimization, some of the customers whose optimization created significant headwinds for us in FY '23 has kicked off new projects that we expect to scale over the next 18 months. We believe that our first-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners represent our biggest opportunity. We have aligned our sales specialist resources to our cloud partners' customer segmentation and go-to-market structure to tighten our alignment to and improve our execution against this opportunity. Over the course of FY '24, we will scale our customer success team to further improve customer retention and expansion and develop a more focused cloud channel model. Cloud operations remains an important market for us, and we have dedicated go-to-market resources to address this opportunity.\nWe have not wavered in our convictions that public cloud services has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. While the shift to cloud is experiencing an industry-wide slowdown, the long-term trend in favor of cloud is unchanged.\nIn conclusion, while FY '23 was not the year we expected at its outset, our disciplined management enabled us to overcome a number of headwinds to deliver all-time high operating margin and EPS. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We are entering fiscal year '24 with substantially more innovation and a new more focused operating model to attack the areas of priority spending. In this uncertain environment, we will remain agile and continue to be disciplined stewards of the business. We believe our actions will drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year.\nThank you to the NetApp team for their dedication and focus. I am pleased with our progress, but we recognize our work is not done. We look forward to building on this momentum and driving long-term value for our shareholders.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George noted, we are laser-focused on managing the elements within our control. Our focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for the full year and Q4.\nBefore getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes of our results and expectations for fiscal year '24. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered record-setting operating margin and EPS above our guidance range in both Q4 and fiscal year '23. We will continue to prudently manage the business to position ourselves for long-term success while driving further operating margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal year '24. We are confident in the strength of our position and alignment to areas of priority spend. However, macro uncertainties and FX headwinds have pressured IT budget and lower spending. We believe these headwinds are temporary and that the spending environment will rebound in time.\nWe reached our product gross margin target of mid-50s ahead of expectations. In fiscal year '24, we expect to maintain product gross margins at this level and drive improvement of public cloud gross margin. In fiscal year '23, we returned 148% of free cash flow to shareholders and reduced full year share count by 4% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal year '24.\nNow to the details. Fiscal year '23 billings of $6.41 billion were down 4% from fiscal year '22. Revenue of $6.36 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusting for the headwind from FX, billings would have been down 1% and revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. Operating margin was 24.2%, including a 150 basis point headwind from FX. EPS was $5.59 and included $0.57 of year-over-year FX headwinds. Q4 billings of $1.67 billion were down 17% year-over-year, including roughly 2 points of FX headwinds. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.58 billion, down 6% from last year or 4% adjusting for FX.\nThe uncertain macro negatively impacted revenue in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segment as customers continue to exhibit caution in capital expenditures and look to optimize cloud spend. Public Cloud revenue of $1.43 billion was down 8% year-over-year. Product revenue was $744 million and down 17% from Q4 last year. Support revenue of $598 million increased 1% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year ahead of expectations at $620 million up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue composed 10% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 26% year-over-year to $151 million. We exited fiscal year '23 with $4.31 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 2% year-over-year.\nGrowth of deferred revenue is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Q4 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth. Q4 consolidated gross margin was 69%, above our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 69%. Product gross margin was 55%, well ahead of guidance, driven by lower premiums, better mix and lower FX headwinds. As we've described on previous calls, we expect to retain all of the benefit from the reduction in premiums and will be responsive to market pricing of commodity components. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin was 66%. The Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 26%, an all-time quarterly high. EPS of $1.54 was comfortably above the high end of guidance and included $0.08 of year-over-year FX headwind. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $235 million and free cash flow was $196 million. Free cash flow for fiscal year '23 of $868 million came in below expectations due to lower collections and timing of payments. As we noted on our last call, Q4 cash flow included certain one restructuring and tax payments together totaling approximately $85 million. Inventory turns of 12 were steady from last quarter and last year.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $106 million in cash dividends. For the year, we repurchased a total of $850 million in stock and paid out $432 million in cash dividends, representing 148% of free cash flow. Q4 diluted share count of $217 million was down 5% year-over-year. We have approximately $400 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal year '23, and today are announcing an additional authorization of $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.07 billion in cash and long-term investments.\nNow to guidance. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, like business analytics, AI, data security and application modernization. However, we expect the macro to remain challenged with continued pressure on IT budgets and the demand environment. As a result, we expect fiscal year '24 total revenue to be down in the low to mid-single digits measured on a percentage basis. Public Cloud will continue to be a positive contributor with revenue growth expected in the mid-teens. Implied in our fiscal year '24 revenue guidance is year-over-year growth in the second half, driven by sales of recently introduced flash products and benefits from our go-to-market changes. While we are hopeful that the macro economy will improve in the second half of our fiscal year, our plans for fiscal year '24 incorporate the environment we are seeing today and do not assume a material change to the economic or demand backdrop. We expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%. We believe that product margins will remain at approximately 55%, supported by lower premiums and a rotation to higher-margin all-flash products. To take advantage of record low NAND prices, we have made strategic purchase commitments to lock in pricing for a large portion of our expected fiscal year '24 SSD demand. This will help us maintain product gross margin levels when component prices rise in the future. We expect to see Public Cloud gross margin improvement in fiscal year '24, driven by revenue scale and lower depreciation expense. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80%.\nWe anticipate operating margins of approximately 25% and EPS of $5.65 to $5.85. Implied in this guidance is the expectation that we will hold operating expenses roughly flat versus fiscal year '23. Fiscal year '24 OpEx includes benefits from the Q4 reduction in force, offset by annual merit increases, a reset of variable compensation and incremental expenses to support our first in-person sales kickoff and Insight user conference since 2019.\nOperating expenses should be spread fairly evenly throughout the year. We expect the tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. Operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. As we've stated before, fiscal year '23 should be the peak for CapEx with expenditures beginning to come down in fiscal year '24. Our healthy cash generation enables us to continue our strong program of capital returns to shareholders. In fiscal year '24 we intend to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. We plan to hold our quarterly dividend steady at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal year '24, with the remainder of free cash flow going to share buyback. We expect the timing of buybacks to be roughly similar to fiscal year '23 and to reduce share count by at least 2% in fiscal year '24. Now on the Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a decline of 12% year-over-year. Remember that first half fiscal year '23 revenue, most notably product revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog from supply chain constraints impacting the year-over-year comparable. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70% and operating margin to be approximately 20%. EPS should be in the range of $1 to $1.10. Q1 cash flow will be impacted by payments associated with SSD purchase commitments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments year-over-year related to our fiscal year '23 performance.\nIn closing, I want to echo Georgia's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued commitment in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal year '24, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to improve our execution and increase profitability.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Kris for Q&A.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; our alignment with the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformation; our expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers, their usage of cloud services and the resulting impact on our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments; our ability to deliver innovation, sharpen our execution and focus on our strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating cost; and our ability to strengthen our position, rebalance our sales and marketing efforts and drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending, inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility and the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruption, as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, maintain our customer partner supplier and contract manufacturer relationships on favorable terms and conditions, manage material cybersecurity and other security breaches and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow.\nPlease also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors section.\nDuring the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.\nIn Q3, we executed well on the elements under our control in the face of a weakening IT spending environment and continued cloud cost optimization. Disciplined operational management yielded operating margin and EPS that exceeded expectations despite revenue coming in at the low end of our guidance.\nWe are delivering on our commitments and responding to the dynamic environment. We adjusted our cost structure, introduced a portfolio of capacity flash arrays to support cost-sensitive customers and continue to work with our customers to help them optimize their cloud spending.\nOn today's call, I will discuss our Q3 results in the context of the current environment and our plans to sharpen our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our long-term position.\nWe continue to see increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles and some deals pushing out. We are feeling this most acutely in large enterprise and the Americas tech and service provider sectors.\nCustomers are looking to stretch their budget dollars, sweating assets, shifting spend to hybrid flash and capacity flash arrays from higher cost performance flash arrays and, as our cloud partners have described, optimizing cloud spending.\nWe saw signs of a softening environment early in fiscal year '23 and took swift action to control costs with increased scrutiny of program spending, a hiring slowdown in Q2 and a hiring freeze in Q3. At the start of Q4, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 8%.\nDecisions that impact our employees are always difficult. I take great pride in fostering the NetApp culture, and I'm committed to using this difficult action to refocus our team guided by the values and mission of the company.\nOur hybrid flash and QLC-based all-flash arrays continue to perform well, benefiting from customers' price sensitivity in this challenging macro. The shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to lower-cost solutions, coupled with the lower spending environment, especially among large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers who are large consumers of flash, created headwinds to our product and all-flash array revenues.\nIn Q3, our all-flash array business decreased 12% from Q3 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Public Cloud ARR of $605 million did not meet our expectations, driven by a shortfall in cloud storage as a result of the same factors we experienced last quarter. Spending optimization and the winding down of project-based workloads like chip design, EDA and HPC were headwinds again in Q3.\nWe have a sizable base of public cloud customers with a number of large customers who have grown rapidly over the past year and are now optimizing. Their cost optimizations masked the growth of other customers. We continue to add new customers, and churn has remained consistently low. Overall, the Cloud Ops portfolio performed to plan.\nCloud Insights have stabilized, and Spot continues to grow nicely, benefiting from the cost optimization trend. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate decreased to 120% but is still within healthy industry norms. We are confident that we remain well-positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations.\nWe are aligned to customers' top priorities and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Building on that solid foundation, we are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results while strengthening our position for when the spending environment rebounds. We have 3 areas of focus. First, we will remain prudent stewards of the business, and we'll continue to tightly manage the elements within our control. Second, we are reinvigorating efforts across the company in support of our storage business. Third, we are building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business.\nStarting with the first area of focus, remaining prudent stewards of the business and managing the elements within our control. We will maintain our focus on cost controls so that expenses do not grow ahead of revenue. We will achieve this by maintaining our scrutiny on program spending and hiring as well as focusing our investments on the products that represent the biggest opportunity.\nWe've made difficult decisions to reduce investment in products with smaller revenue potential like Astra Data Store and SolidFire. The results of this focus are visible in our ability to maintain our free cash flow, operating margin and EPS guidance despite lower revenue.\nOn to the second focus area, reinvigorating our storage business. As we moved rapidly to embrace cloud, we lost some momentum in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are taking decisive action to strengthen our position and performance by better addressing the areas of market growth, delivering more customer value and realigning our go-to-market activities to better address this opportunity.\nWe were slow to fully embrace the customer desire for lower cost, capacity-oriented all-flash systems. At the start of Q4, we rectified that situation with the introduction of the AFF C-Series, the most comprehensive industry-leading portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays that addresses a wide range of workloads and price points. These products will help customers manage through a cost-sensitive environment while at the same time supporting their pursuit of sustainability targets.\nInitial response has been very positive, and we are already quoting deals for customers. The AFF C-Series will drive AFA revenue and support product gross margin as customers rotate from lower-margin hybrid flash to all-flash systems.\nIn addition to expanding our product portfolio, we've introduced a number of innovations to improve the customer experience and bring predictability to their investment process. In Q3, we released BlueXP, a unified control plane that helps decrease resource waste, complexity and the risk of managing diverse environments. As a part of our sustainability commitment, we are previewing a new dashboard in BlueXP to help customers understand their data center carbon footprint across environments.\nEarly in Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, our best-in-class portfolio of programs and guarantees, which is already helping us win new customers and drive revenue.\nWe are rebalancing our sales and marketing efforts to better address the significant storage market opportunity, including aligning compensation plans to drive sales of our reinvigorated storage portfolio. We believe that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market.\nFinally, our third area of focus, building a more focused approach to cloud. While we are reinvigorating our storage business, we have no intention of taking our foot off the pedal in public cloud. It represents a huge growth opportunity for us with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the business.\nAdditionally, our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors and create customer preference for NetApp. We have sharpened the focus in our Cloud Ops portfolio and have taken actions that could have future revenue and ARR implications. We believe that our Cloud Ops services will continue to deliver stable, steady growth over the long term. Our customer success team has made good progress in driving utilization of our Cloud Ops services, but we need to do more with our cloud storage and data services.\nAdditionally, we recognize that we have not been using our go-to-market resources to their best effect here. In addition to refocusing our sales team on the reinvigorated storage portfolio, we are identifying ways to most effectively align our sales resources to the buying centers and consumption models for all our solutions.\nOur cloud storage business is predominantly consumption-based and largely driven by our hyperscaler partners. These factors, coupled with the current cloud cost optimization environment, have impacted our ability to forecast ARR. However, as we grow the business, the impact from a subset of customers will be mitigated, smoothing its growth and improving predictability. I want to underscore my confidence in this opportunity. The migration of enterprise applications like SAP and VMware to the cloud as well as cloud-native applications, like artificial intelligence, create a massive market in which we can grow.\nWe believe strongly that Public Cloud services can be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. However, achieving that target will take longer than we initially planned due to the industry-wide slowdown in cloud spending and our recent performance.\nIn closing, we have seen tangible success from our efforts to manage the elements within our control in a challenging environment. Despite our lowered revenue outlook, we have preserved free cash flow and EPS expectations. In the first 3 fiscal quarters of this year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders and reduced share count by 4%. We are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our position for the long term. We are taking these steps now so that as we begin FY '24, we are in a new, more focused operating model to attack the opportunity ahead, drive growth and deliver shareholder value.\nBefore turning the call over to Mike, I want to give my thanks to the NetApp team for their operational discipline and rapid response to set us up for better results. I have seen firsthand how hard they are working to navigate the challenging environment, and I really appreciate their efforts.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to reiterate the key themes for today's discussion that George highlighted.\nNumber one, despite the temporary headwinds to revenue, our disciplined operational management yielded op margin and EPS above the high end of guidance.\nNumber two, the macro backdrop and demand environment continue to be major headwinds. The weakening IT spending environment was most pronounced in our large enterprise and U.S. technology and service provider customers and materially impacted our all-flash revenue in Q3, while significant cloud optimization across all 3 major hyperscalers continue to weigh heavily on ARR growth. Although the U.S. dollar weakened slightly during Q3, FX continues to be a material headwind to our financial results on a year-over-year basis.\nNumber three, as we navigate through this fluid demand environment, we remain laser-focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. Towards this end, we took swift action in Q3 to control costs through increased program spending scrutiny and a hiring freeze. And at the start of Q4, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 8%. In addition to adjusting our own cost structure, we also introduced C-Series, a portfolio of QLC capacity flash arrays to support cost-sensitive data center customers, and we continue to work with our cloud customers to help optimize their spending.\nAnd number four, as a result of our disciplined cost management, we are reiterating our full year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50. We are also confident in our free cash flow target of $1.1 billion, adjusting for the restructuring and onetime cash payment in Q4. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. Q3 billings were $1.57 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 340 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been down 7% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q3, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall revenue growth profile of NetApp.\nHybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.38 billion was down 9% year-over-year. Product revenue of $682 million decreased 19% year-over-year as customers took a decidedly cautious approach to capital spending. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $616 million increased 5% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base.\nPublic Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $605 million, up 29% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $150 million, up 36% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As highlighted by our 3 major hyperscaler partners, customers continue to optimize our cloud spend as organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. While the timing of the recovery remains unclear, we are confident that secular trends of AI, machine learning, IoT and high-performance computing, along with the migration of enterprise apps like VMware and SAP, will drive long-term growth in cloud storage consumption.\nRecurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $766 million was up 10% year-over-year, constituting 50% of total revenue.\nWe ended Q3 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth.\nTotal gross margin was 67% in Q3, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 46.5%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. As noted, our large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers have continued to reduce CapEx spend as they right-size their spending envelops. These customers are the most forward-leaning technology adopters and the biggest consumers of all-flash systems in the economy, and their pause in CapEx spending has had a material impact on our total revenue, all-flash mix and product margins.\nAnd while the supply chain component premiums and NAND pricing notably improved in Q3, we had to work through higher cost inventory during the quarter. We expect the improving supply chain and NAND pricing to be a tailwind to product margin in Q4 and fiscal '24.\nOur growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 69% was accretive to the corporate average for the ninth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80% as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions.\nWhile revenue came in at the low end of guidance, Q3 highlighted our operational discipline and cost controls, with operating margin of 24%, including 2 points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.37 came in above the high end of guidance and included $0.14 of year-over-year FX headwind.\nCash flow from operations was $377 million, and free cash flow was $319 million. Inventory turns increased to 12 in Q3, up from 9 in Q2, as supply chain challenges eased in the quarter, enabling us to take down inventory by nearly $70 million sequentially.\nDuring Q3, we repurchased $200 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders, representing 97% of free cash flow. Share count of 219 million was down 4% year-over-year.\nWe closed Q3 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, up $108 million sequentially.\nNow to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen continued softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year, which includes 3 to 4 percentage points of FX headwind. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67% as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins.\nWhile the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time, particularly when you factor in our new C-Series portfolio, which will largely displace lower-margin hybrid spinning disk systems in our product mix.\nGiven our disciplined cost controls, we are raising our fiscal '23 operating margin guidance. We now expect op margin to range between 23% and 24%, which includes approximately 2 points of FX headwinds. Last quarter, we committed to protecting both EPS and free cash flow during this uncertain macro environment. Today, we are reiterating our full year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50, which includes $0.54 of currency impacts. We also continue to expect to generate $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding onetime items. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases.\nNow on to Q4 guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% decrease year-over-year or a 6% decrease in constant currency. In this macro environment, we expect customers to continue to optimize our cloud spend at our 3 major hyperscaler partners. As a result, we expect cloud revenue and ARR to be approximately flat sequentially in Q4.\nPlease note, as we head into fiscal '24, we plan to anchor our cloud segment guidance on revenue dollars instead of ARR. To be clear, we will continue to disclose cloud ARR as a key metric as we go through the year.\nWe expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%. As we head into Q4, we are forecasting a material reduction in component premiums, decreasing NAND costs and engineering product efficiencies. As such, we are confident that product margins will rise in Q4. These trends also position us nicely heading into fiscal '24 to drive the leverage through our business model, particularly as customers begin to reengage on all-flash capacity buildouts and customers mix shift away from hybrid spinning disk systems to new QLC all-flash solutions.\nWhile the exact timing is unclear, large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers are the largest consumers of data and storage in the global economy, and our all-flash ONTAP systems are structurally linked to their data growth cross-cycle.\nIn Q4, we expect operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 21%. We are forecasting earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is net interest income of $7.5 million and a share count of approximately 218 million.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such an uncertain economic environment.\nI'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for third quarter and fiscal year 2023; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; our alignment with industry megatrends and expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers and their usage of cloud services; our ability to deliver innovation and focus on strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating costs; and our ability to drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility, the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; and the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending; as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow.\nPlease also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections.\nDuring the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris, and welcome, everyone, to our Q2 FY '23 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities.\nOn today's call, I will walk through 4 topics. One, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs.\nLet's start with the first point: our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations.\nAs our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending. This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services, as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads, like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year. As the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base.\nIn our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1. As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to Cloud Insights and are seeing early positive signs with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2.\nWe continue to see healthy growth of new to NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services. And those customers are growing in scale, as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth.\nCompared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays both performed well.\nOn to the second point: our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers. We believe strongly in the sizable, durable and growing opportunity created by these megatrends.\nAs many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage services, integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily and cost-effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors' on-premises systems.\nAt the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments.\nIn addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy-efficient products. We've added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure, and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems. We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4:1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage.\nWe not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I'm proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies.\nNow the third point: the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher-level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half.\nAnd finally, point 4: driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze and are reducing discretionary spending as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower-yield activities to our biggest opportunities.\nIn closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds. By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization.\nI would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution and operational discipline. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion.\nNumber 1, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number 2, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number 3, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser-focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business. Number 4, as a result of these cost-saving measures, the entirety of the op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental 1 to 2 points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. And number 5, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases.\nNow to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 6 points in revenue growth.\nHybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base.\nPublic Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially.\nRecurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue.\nWe ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year or, 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth.\nTotal gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a 3-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 93%.\nPublic Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions.\nQ2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including 2 points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind.\nCash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a back-end loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance.\nOur component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nNow to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes 5 points of FX headwind versus the 4-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our public cloud segment driving 3 points of total company revenue growth for the full year.\nThree drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number 1, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR. Number 2, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale. But as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR. And number 3, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don't expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24.\nIn fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in U.S. dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring parts at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time.\nFor the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It's important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental 1 to 2 points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call.\nWe continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insights value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I have said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases.\nNow on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for second quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, our resilience and opportunity for future growth in the turbulent macroeconomic environment, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, our ability to invest in areas of high return while managing supply chain constraints and maintaining disciplined operational management, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections.\nActual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions and the IT capital spending environment, as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry, technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our data fabric strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and generate greater cash flow.\nPlease also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections.\nDuring the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon.\nWe delivered a great start to the year with company all-time Q1 highs for billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS, fueled by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Achieving record results in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, decades-high inflation and supply constraints underscores our disciplined operational management.\nAs organizations accelerate their data-driven digital and cloud transformations, our relevance grows. We are helping customers navigate disruption with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. Our opportunity is defined by the complexities created by rapid data and cloud growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-generation technologies such as AI, Kubernetes and modern databases.\nThe urgency to address these priorities increased with the COVID pandemic, and is further driven by the turbulent macro economy. Customers are searching for ways to reduce costs, improve flexibility, increase automation and accelerate application delivery in the Public Cloud, in their own data centers and in Hybrid Cloud environments. Our role in helping organizations achieve these transformation goals underpins our strategy and confidence in future growth.\nLet me share with you a couple of examples how data-intensive applications like AI, drive demand for both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud solutions. A global e-commerce company chose ONTAP AI for several AI workloads, including natural language processing, recommendation engines and deep learning. Our ultra-high-performance storage, close partnership with NVIDIA and tight application integration were key to the win, and the customer has realized better performance and reliability while reducing its operating costs and data center footprint.\nA Fortune 500 hyperscaler is adopting a Hybrid Cloud strategy to augment existing on-premises AI/ML workloads. It chose Azure NetApp Files to accelerate AI research and development on cutting-edge, machine learning, training workloads for its AI business unit. The initial footprint consists of nearly 1 petabyte of Azure NetApp Files storage with plenty of opportunities for continued growth.\nOur AI solutions remove data processing bottlenecks at the edge, core and cloud to enable more efficient data collection, accelerated AI workloads, faster time to Insight and smoother cloud integration.\nNow let's turn to our Public Cloud segment performance for the quarter. In Q1, we continue to see strong demand for our Public Cloud services. Public Cloud ARR grew 73% year-over-year, exiting Q1 at $584 million. Public Cloud segment revenue grew 67% from Q1 a year ago to $132 million, and dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 151% remains healthy. We continue to expand our Public Cloud customer base, the penetration into our Hybrid Cloud installed base and the percentage of customers using multiple of our Public Cloud services.\nStorage services constitute approximately 60% of our Public Cloud ARR. We see significant opportunity for continued growth in this part of our business as we help customers migrate or deploy data-intensive, demanding storage workloads to the cloud. Early in Q1, AWS announced that FSx for NetApp ONTAP is SAP certified. SAP certification for Azure NetApp Files has helped drive large business-critical deployments on that service, and we are excited about the potential to see similar workloads deployed on FSx for ONTAP.\nWe recently announced that NetApp is the only cloud storage service provider certified and supported for use as an external data store for VMware cloud environments, further expanding the opportunity for our Public Cloud storage services. We've long been known for the high levels of enterprise-grade data services we bring to on-premises VMware environments. And now we can bring those same benefits to VMware workloads running in the major Public Clouds.\nAs we discussed on last quarter's call, we made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and refined our go-to-market execution to better address the cloud operations opportunity. These actions are starting to deliver results.\nIn Q1, Spot bounced back, returning to its prior growth trajectory. Cloud Insights stabilized but remains a work in progress, as we continue to optimize our sales and customer success motions.\nWe delivered a substantial amount of innovation in our cloud operations portfolio, with announcements of general availability of Spot Security, Spot PC and Ocean for Apache Spark, providing a fully managed serverless infrastructure for Apache Spark on Google Cloud. We also completed the acquisition of Instaclustr, a leading provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline and workflow applications. We can now combine the Spot capabilities of continuous infrastructure optimization, automation, monitoring and security with expertise in deploying and operating fully managed open-source applications to help our customers focus on their business goals, building and releasing leading-edge applications at speed.\nOnto our Hybrid Cloud segment. In Q1, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 6% year-over-year, driven by solid product revenue growth of 8%. All-flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 7% year-over-year to $3 billion. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 32% of installed systems. FAS hybrid arrays, again, posted strong unit growth. The breadth of our storage systems portfolio enables us to address a broad range of customer business, technical and economic requirements under a single unified management environment, we offer high-performance all-flash arrays for mission-critical, performance-sensitive deployments, QLC-based all-flash arrays for capacity-oriented applications and hybrid flash arrays for price-sensitive workloads.\nDespite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformation. Organizations around the globe want to learn how NetApp can increase the performance and reliability of these transformational projects, while helping reduce cost, risk and complexity. Our ability to address a broad range of customer problems while also optimizing cloud and IT investments makes NetApp more resilient to a potential further slowdown than many of our peers.\nJust as our customers are looking to save while transforming, we too must be agile in our response to the dynamic macro. We will continue to invest into areas of high return to drive growth, while at the same time, moderating spending elsewhere.\nIn closing, we delivered a great quarter, kicking off a strong start to FY '23. Customer priorities are increasingly aligned with the solutions that we uniquely provide. You are seeing evidence of that in the strong growth of our revenues, billings and profitability. I am proud of the NetApp team's focus, execution and disciplined operational management in navigating this dynamic environment.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike to walk through the details of our outstanding Q1.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion.\nNumber one, as George highlighted, we had an outstanding Q1 in a dynamic environment with all-time Q1 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS, despite an uncertain macro and unprecedented FX headwinds.\nNumber two, our Public Cloud business had an outstanding quarter, with excellent performance by our Cloud Volume Service offerings from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, which collectively grew ARR over 100% year-over-year. We also saw improved execution in our CloudOps portfolio.\nNumber three, as George mentioned, we continue to see healthy customer engagement and demand trends. Like everyone on this call, we are mindful of the complexity in both the macro backdrop and supply chain. We will remain extremely disciplined in running our business while continuing to invest in our key strategic initiatives.\nAnd number four, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, margins, EPS, free cash flow and Public Cloud ARR, even when factoring in a 3- to 4-point revenue headwind from FX versus the 2-point FX headwind contemplated in our guide provided last quarter.\nNow to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. In Q1 despite elevated freight and logistical expense, significant component cost premiums and unprecedented FX headwinds, we delivered solid revenue with both operating margin and EPS coming in above the high end of guidance. Strong execution yielded Q1 billings of $1.56 billion, up 13% year-over-year.\nRevenue came in at $1.59 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 4-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 18% and 13% year-over-year, respectively. Our solid Q1 results were driven by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 9 points in revenue growth.\nHybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.46 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue as we go through fiscal '23. Product revenue of $786 million increased 8% year-over-year. Consistent with growth in fiscal '22, software product revenue of $476 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by the value of our ONTAP software and data services. Total Q1 recurring support revenue of $598 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base.\nPublic Cloud ARR exited Q1 at $584 million, up 73% year-over-year driven by strength in cloud storage services, led by Azure NetApp Files, AWS FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $132 million, up 67% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.\nRecurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $730 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 46% of total revenue, a new record for NetApp. We ended Q1 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth.\nTotal gross margin was 67%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 93%.\nPublic Cloud gross margin of 70% was again accretive to the corporate average. The sequential increase in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by improving software mix within our Public Cloud business. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to scale the business and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions.\nQ1 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain and currency headwinds. EPS of $1.20 came in nicely ahead of guidance.\nCash flow from operations was $281 million, and free cash flow was $216 million. During Q1, we had strong cash collections while we continue to invest in inventory that included paying substantial premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. This purchasing strategy allowed us to meet as much customer demand as possible but was clearly a headwind to cash flow and gross margins.\nWe are seeing early signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain. However, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through fiscal '23.\nDuring Q1, we repurchased $350 million in stock and paid out $110 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $460 million to shareholders, representing 213% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investment.\nNow to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal '23 guidance. Our revenue guide of 6% to 8% growth year-over-year now includes 3 to 4 points of FX headwind versus the 2-point headwind assumed in our original guidance provided last quarter. We will continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business and expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 million to $820 million. At the ARR midpoint, we expect Public Cloud segment to drive 4 points of total company revenue growth.\nIn fiscal '23, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67% as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. Adding to these product cost overhang is an additional 1 point from incremental FX headwinds. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in U.S. dollars.\nWe are cautiously optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on recurring parts at significant premiums. We should also start to see a benefit from declining prices for our hardware components. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time.\nDespite the incremental currency headwinds, we remain committed to driving operating margin of 23% to 24% and EPS of $5.40 to $5.60 for the full year. Like all of you, we are closely monitoring the demand signals and broader macro trends. As George noted, customer engagement and demand remain healthy. However, given the fluidity of the environment, we will continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook and extremely disciplined with our spending envelope. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year.\nNow to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.595 billion and $1.745 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 7% increase year-over-year, including 4 points of currency headwinds. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.28 and $1.38 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is net interest expense of $5 million and a share count of approximately 223 million.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in Q1. As a result, the year is off to a strong start.\nI'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

Welcome to the NetApp Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry.\nThis call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for first quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, the value we bring to customers, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions and the IT capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business and generate greater cash flow.\nPlease also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections.\nDuring the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, Kris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon.\nOur solid fourth quarter results cap off a strong year. We made sustained progress against our strategic goals, successfully achieving our commitment to grow the business while delivering operating leverage in fiscal 2022. We gained share in enterprise storage with strong growth in all-flash array and object storage products. We expanded our Public Cloud business with robust expansion of customers, ARR, innovation and routes to market. And most notably, we delivered record levels of gross margin dollars, operating income and earnings per share.\nWhile the demand environment remains strong, macroeconomic uncertainty, including supply constraints, rising interest rates, inflation and geopolitical conflict has increased since we last spoke with you at our Investor Day in March. Navigating this complex and dynamic environment is testing our teams, and we are sharply focused on managing what is in our control.\nBacklog is elevated due to supply constraints, despite our excellent supply chain management, helping us meet as much of the demand as possible. I want to thank our global team for their disciplined execution and agile response to changing conditions. That we achieved all-time highs for gross margin dollars, operating income and earnings per share in the face of these headwinds demonstrates our disciplined operating management.\nThe turbulent environment also creates challenges for our customers, raising the urgency for data-driven, digital and cloud transformations. We sit at the intersection of these mega trends as the complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-gen technologies, such as AI, cloud-native and modern application and data infrastructures create a sizable opportunity for us.\nAt our Investor Day, we outlined our objective to deliver long-term value through sustained growth, and that thesis remains unchanged. Our critical role in helping customers achieve their transformation goals underpins our strategy and drives confidence for future growth.\nPublic Cloud ARR of $505 million grew 68% year-over-year, and the Q4 dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains strong at 159%.\nBefore I get to the many highlights of the quarter, I want to address the fact that our Public Cloud ARR came short of our expectations. Demand for our cloud storage solutions was strong in Q4. We also saw a healthy number of new customer additions across both cloud storage and cloud operation services in the quarter. Unfortunately, these tailwinds were not enough to offset the lower-than-expected growth created by higher churn, lower expansion rates and sales force turnover in our cloud operations portfolio.\nWe understand the root causes of these temporary headwinds, and in FY '23, our focus will be on returning these services to the growth trajectory we saw in the first 3 quarters of the year. We have made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions, and we'll continue to refine our go-to-market activities to better address the cloud operations market. Additionally, we have refreshed the sales organization and strengthened the leadership team.\nWe believe strongly in the sizable opportunity created by our cloud operations portfolio, where we bring differentiated enterprise capabilities to cloud infrastructure management built on our long experience, supporting a broad range of applications. Our differentiation in this space continues to receive third-party validation. Spot by NetApp was recognized as a leader and the only outperformer in GigaOm's Radar for cloud resource optimization.\nAs I noted earlier, our cloud storage services continue to perform well. Azure NetApp Files remains the standout here. Cloud volume service for GCP, and FSx for NetApp ONTAP also had strong growth in ARR and customer additions, albeit off small bases.\nWe continue to deliver significant innovation to help customers get the most from their cloud storage environments. AWS announced FSx for ONTAP support for single-availability zones, lowering storage costs and improving performance as well as its inclusion in the EC2 Launch Wizard, streamlining the selection of FSx for ONTAP as file storage for customers creating a new compute instance. These new capabilities unlock new use cases, expanding the opportunity for FSx for ONTAP.\nOur cloud storage and data management services are complemented by our cloud operations, infrastructure management and optimization functionality. Together, these capabilities deliver an industry-leading portfolio of multi-cloud infrastructure services, for stateful and stateless workloads.\nNow we're enabling customers to deploy applications quickly, easily and cost effectively on that multi-cloud infrastructure. For big data applications with Spark on Kubernetes; for managed desktops, with Spot PC; and for open source database, data pipeline and workflow applications with our most recent acquisition, Instaclustr.\nInstaclustr delivers open source data and workflow applications as a fully managed service. Instaclustr will leverage our best-in-class infrastructure services, cloud volumes, storage optimization, Spot's compute optimization and cloud insights monitoring and troubleshooting to make it easier and faster for customers to build, deploy and operate cloud applications.\nThis will enable us to deliver more value to cloud operations teams and capture more revenue from those same buyers by delivering new services as well as through the significant synergies with our cloud storage services. I am excited to welcome the Instaclustr team to the NetApp family.\nOverall, fiscal year '22 was a good year for our cloud business. We doubled Public Cloud segment revenue from $199 million in fiscal year '21 to $396 million in fiscal year '22. We expanded our cloud partnerships and routes to market, introduced new organic innovations. And we completed a number of acquisitions that position us well for the future. In the coming year, we will prioritize the integration of these services.\nTo underscore our commitment here, we plan to slow the pace of acquisitions and re-prioritize our use of cash in FY '23 to favor shareholder returns. Mike will provide the details in his commentary. I want to underscore that we remain convinced of the opportunity, the strength of our position and our ability to achieve $2 billion in ARR exiting fiscal year '26.\nNow turning to Hybrid Cloud. Demand for our Hybrid Cloud solutions remains high. Despite supply constraints that again impeded our ability to meet all customer demand, we grew product revenue 6% in the fourth quarter and 10% in fiscal year '22.\nAll flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 12% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Thanks to strong unit growth in SaaS hybrid arrays, all flash penetration remained flat at 31% of installed systems.\nIn Q4, we further enhanced our position in Hybrid Cloud with new innovations and recognition. We updated our object storage solution with security and compliance enhancements, Google Cloud integration and faster performance for analytics workloads. We also announced the next generation of our collaboration with Cisco, Flexpod XCS for hybrid multi-cloud deployments. Additionally, Business Intelligence Group recognized NetApp AI as a winner of its Artificial Intelligence Excellence award.\nLooking forward, our priorities are clear. We remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services while continuing to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions.\nThe long-term thesis we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth remains intact. The strong fundamentals of our business, including our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength.\nI want to underscore my confidence in our strategy, our execution and the value we bring to all our stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nAs a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted.\nAs we look back on fiscal '22, I am incredibly proud of the results the team delivered in an environment with such fluid and complex supply chain challenges.\nWe delivered billings of $6.7 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and grew revenue 10% to $6.3 billion. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, all flash revenue grew 20% and object storage revenue grew 49%. We finished fiscal '22 with $505 million in Public Cloud ARR, with Public Cloud revenue growing 99% for the full year.\nWe balanced strong growth in our key strategic areas with another year of disciplined investment, delivering record operating margin of 23.7%, up more than 3 points from last year, with an all-time high EPS of $5.28, up 30% year-over-year.\nIn Q4, despite supply-constrained shipments, elevated freight and logistical expense and component cost headwinds, we delivered solid revenue, with both gross margin and operating margin coming in above guidance.\nStrong execution yielded Q4 billings of $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.68 billion, up 8% year-over-year, including a 2-point headwind from FX. Our solid Q4 results were driven by continued strong demand for our all flash and object storage solutions.\nOur cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 8 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.56 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into fiscal '23.\nProduct revenue of $894 million increased 6% year-over-year. Software product revenue of $530 million increased 10% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing mix shift towards our all flash portfolio. Total Q4 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 2% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base.\nPublic Cloud ARR exited Q4 at $505 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by strength in cloud storage, led by Azure NetApp Files. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $120 million, up 82% year-over-year and 9% sequentially.\nWe didn't end the year as expected for Cloud ARR, but are confident that we remain well positioned to deliver on the long-term Public Cloud opportunity. While it is not unusual for hyper-growth assets to hit air pockets along their journey, we are using this moment to learn and continue to improve the operational rigor across the CloudOps products. Towards this goal, we are laser-focused on using fiscal '23 to strengthen our field and customer success go-to-market motions, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio.\nRecurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $710 million, was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 42% of total revenue. We ended Q4 with a record $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q4 marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth.\nTotal gross margin was 66% and came in solidly ahead of our guidance, reflecting better-than-expected product margins. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 65% in Q4.\nWithin our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 51% as the supply chain team did an amazing job of mitigating a portion of the component cost headwinds, and our sales team was very focused on capturing our recent price increases.\nOur growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was again accretive to the overall corporate average. The sequential decline in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by lower-than-expected cloud revenue and incremental CapEx investment for Azure NetApp Files, which is a healthy leading demand signal.\nWe remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80% as we continue to drive scale in cloud storage and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business being built on software solutions.\nQ4 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23% despite the ongoing supply chain headwinds.\nEPS of $1.42 was up 21% year-over-year, and even excluding a onetime tax benefit of $0.12, represents a new Q4 record for the company.\nCash flow from operations was $411 million, and free cash flow was $343 million.\nThe ongoing supply constraints resulted in shipments being pushed to the end of the quarter, leading to the highest-ever accounts receivable balance of $1.2 billion exiting the year, an increase of $431 million from Q3. As a result, we expect healthy cash collections in the first half of fiscal '23, which will be a tailwind to operating cash flow for the full year.\nDuring Q4, we repurchased $250 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $361 million to shareholders, representing 105% of free cash flow.\nWe closed Q4 with $4.1 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nNow to guidance. In fiscal '23, we are guiding revenues to grow 6% to 8% year-over-year, which includes a 2-percentage point headwind from FX.\nIn fiscal '23, we anticipate sustained demand for and continued share gain momentum in both our all flash and object storage solutions, which we expect to drive product revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We will also continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business.\nWe expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 million to $820 million, which includes approximately $40 million from our recently closed acquisition of Instaclustr.\nAt the ARR midpoint, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive 4 points of total company revenue growth in fiscal '23. As George noted, we remain confident in our ability to deliver $2 billion in Public Cloud ARR exiting fiscal '26.\nIn fiscal '23, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67% as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. We expect first half product margins to be roughly consistent with Q4 levels.\nAs we have previously disclosed, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature, and we believe that Q4 '22 is the trough for product margins. As you all know, the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remains fluid, but we do expect cost improvements, coupled with our recent price increases to be a modest tailwind to product margins as we head into the back half of fiscal '23.\nWe anticipate operating margin to range between 23% to 24% for the full year as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives while maintaining a disciplined approach to spending. Our commitment is to, again, grow revenue faster than operating expenses in fiscal '23.\nMoving down the P&L. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $30 million and our effective tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%.\nDespite the considerable headwind to earnings as a result of the higher tax rate, we are committed to delivering $5.40 to $5.60 in fiscal '23 EPS.\nWe expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal '23 as we continue to drive incremental profitability in our Hybrid Cloud segment to fund the growth in our Public Cloud business.\nFree cash flow is expected to exceed $1.1 billion for the full year. Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow growth is a step-up in CapEx to approximately $250 million to $300 million.\nThe higher CapEx forecast is being driven by 3 key items: one, additional capacity deployments in Azure and GCP; two, higher cloud software capitalization; and three, growing pipeline for our Keystone offering. As we've discussed before, additional capacity deployments within Azure and GCP are a healthy leading indicator for cloud storage demand.\nGenerating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our shareholder return commitments while also investing in our key strategic areas. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to hit pause on CloudOps acquisitions for the first half of fiscal '23 as we focus on strengthening our field and customer success go-to-market motions while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio.\nAs a result, we plan to return 100% of fiscal '23 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We expect our quarterly dividend to remain at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal '23, with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We plan to front-end load these share repurchases, with $500 million coming in the first half of the year, which will reduce share count by 2% to 3% as we go through fiscal '23.\nNow on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 6% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%, and operating margin to be approximately 21%.\nWe anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $1.05 and $1.15 per share.\nAssumed in our Q1 guidance is net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million, and a share count of approximately 224 million.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding dedication, focus and hustle in delivering strong fiscal '22 results in a very fluid environment. We remain disciplined and committed to the long-term thesis we shared with you as we continue to navigate the dynamic supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible.\nWe are confident, enthusiastic and incredibly focused on our long-term strategic priorities and the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next several years.\nI'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike.\nOperator, let's begin the Q&A.",

Welcome to the NetApp Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.\nDuring today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; the value we bring to customers; our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments; and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.\nWe disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; and the IT capital spending environment; as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business and generate greater cash flow.\nPlease also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors section. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to George.\n\nGeorge Kurian\n\nCEO & Director, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kris. Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to our Q3 FY '22 earnings call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, building on the momentum we've had in recent periods. Demand for our solutions is strong and powered by the alignment of our differentiated technology portfolio with customer priorities.\nIn Q3, our focused execution delivered double-digit revenue growth, led by the impressive performance of our public cloud services and all-flash array businesses; record high gross margin dollars, operating income and earnings per share. NetApp plays a critical role in helping customers achieve their business and cloud transformation goals. I am pleased that our differentiation here continues to receive third-party validation by industry leaders, independent analysts and existing and new customers.\nWe were recognized by Amazon Web Services for our achievements as an AWS partner. NetApp was named the 2021 AWS Independent Software Vendor Design Partner of the Year - U.S. for the jointly-engineered and natively-integrated Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP service. Additionally, GigaOm called out NetApp as the only vendor with a multi-cloud strategy and execution that translates to a continuous data management plane across clouds and locations, a comprehensive enterprise-grade feature set and flexible deployment options. We were listed as a leader in 3 GigaOm Radar reports: Cloud File Systems, Primary Storage for Large Enterprises and Enterprise Scale-Out File Systems. Not only are we a leader in each category, we are the only vendor to lead in all 3. This recognition spotlights the value we bring to our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys.\nCustomers are also endorsing our value, creating strong demand for solutions in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by continued strength in object storage and all-flash arrays. Our all-flash array business hit another milestone in Q3, with a record-high annualized run rate of $3.2 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. All-flash array penetration of our installed base picked up another point to 31% of installed base systems, giving us substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize the storage environments with cloud-connected flash arrays. We further enhanced our position with the introduction of the AFF A900, which delivers unified support for file, block and object protocols, built-in data protection with cutting-edge anti-ransomware capabilities and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads.\nPublic Cloud ARR grew to $469 million, an increase of 98% year-over-year, including the benefit from the CloudCheckr acquisition, which closed early in Q3. Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 169%, as customers increase their usage of our public cloud services and adopt new products. The expanded market reach from our cloud partners and the broadening participation of our field sales organization has delivered outstanding performance in our Public Cloud segment this year, which puts us well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year '25.\nWe uniquely have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers. I am pleased with the level of engagement from our cloud partners and with the performance of our Cloud Storage services. Azure NetApp files again grew ahead of plan; Cloud Volume Service for Google Cloud is ramping nicely; and while still very early days, we are seeing lots of proofs of concept and activity with AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP.\nOur differentiated CloudOps portfolio for multi-cloud infrastructure management is also growing well, led by Spot and Cloud Insights. It is expanding our addressable market and opening opportunities with new buyers at existing customers and with new customers as we help them reduce the cost and complexity of managing their rapidly growing cloud environments.\nWe are delivering innovation at cloud speed and enhancing our solutions to address the needs of cloud native and born-in-the-cloud applications. We've made Cloud Backup Kubernetes aware and broaden Spot Ocean with automated cloud infrastructure and application management for Apache Spark and Ocean CD, enabling faster deployment of Kubernetes applications with end-to-end visibility and management.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. CloudCheckr complements the FinOps capabilities of Spot with the multi-cloud reports, analytics and governance needed to plan, manage and optimize cloud costs to ensure organizations get the most out of their cloud investment.\nWe continue the rapid pace of organic and inorganic innovation with today's announcement of the acquisition of Fylamynt. Fylamynt extends our leadership in cloud operations. Adding Fylamynt's cloud automation technology to the Spot platform will make it easy for customers to integrate Spot solutions with their existing tools, processes and infrastructure code. This will accelerate their ability to take advantage of Spot's suite of capabilities for understanding and optimizing their cloud infrastructure. I'm excited to welcome the Fylamynt team to NetApp.\nAs I've said many times, our strategy to help customers deal with the challenges of managing data and applications and hybrid multi-cloud environments is helping us expand our business by winning new customers and displacing the competition. A global third-party logistics company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to host data migrated from Nutanix systems in its data centers. They chose NetApp-based cloud services for our resiliency, cost efficiency and multi-protocol support. This win marks a new logo for us and has already created additional opportunity for Cloud Manager and Cloud Insights.\nAnother new customer win came from a multinational energy infrastructure company, who chose Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure to migrate workloads away from on-premises Dell systems. They are now considering replacing expired Dell systems with on-premises NetApp systems to make it easier to move data across environments in the future. We had a first-time win at an international government agency with Spot Eco to optimize its multimillion dollar cloud spend. This win becomes a lighthouse reference account for us which we can leverage to reach into other related agencies.\nIn summary, our strong Q3 results underscore our unique position in solving organization's most significant challenges in both cloud-native and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments.

Harv brings with him more than 25 years of experience building industry-defining software categories and cloud services. I also want to thank Brad Anderson for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement.\nWith that, I'll hand it over to Mike.\n\nMichael J. Berry\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion.\nNumber one, Q3 was another strong quarter, with all-time company highs in gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS as our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Number two, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter. We clearly are solidly ahead of our original plan to hit our $1 billion ARR target in fiscal '25. Number three, we are prioritizing meeting as much customer demand as possible as we navigate near-term component shortages and expect revenue to continue to be constrained in Q4. And number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q3 and a very healthy demand backdrop for Q4.\nNow to the details. In fiscal Q3, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q3 billings of $1.76 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.61 billion, also up 10% year-over-year. Our solid Q3 results were driven by continued strong demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments.\nHybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.5 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Q4 and throughout fiscal '23. Product revenue of $846 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last 2 quarters, software product revenue of $507 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $586 million increased 3% year-over-year.\nAs George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3.2 billion for the first time in the company's history, and was up 23% year-over-year.\nPublic Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $469 million, up 98% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights, with CloudCheckr contributing $35 million in ARR. Organic public cloud ARR, excluding CloudCheckr was $434 million in Q3, up 83% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $110 million, up 100% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The growing scale of our Public Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 10 points in revenue growth.\nRecurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $696 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion, another company high and increased 14% year-over-year, representing 75% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q3 '21.\nWe ended Q3 with $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth.\nTotal gross margin was 67%, reflecting the value of our software and public cloud portfolio. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 52%, while our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%.\nPublic Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software solutions. The introduction of FSx for ONTAP with AWS and the addition of CloudCheckr to the Spot portfolio, both of which are software offerings, support our long-term margin goal.\nQ3 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 25%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.44 was up 31% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $260 million, and free cash flow was $199 million. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $236 million to shareholders, representing 119% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments.\nAs many companies have highlighted during this earnings season, the dynamic supply chain situation continues to cause disruptions across the technology ecosystem. These headwinds were further exacerbated by Omicron. In addition to a worsening freight and expedite environment, we also experienced component supplier decommits beginning in the second half of Q3, which required us to purchase components in the open market at significant premiums. We were faced with the short-term decision of supporting the robust customer demand versus optimizing near-term product margin.\nNetApp has consistently focused on being a great long-term strategic partner to our loyal customer base, especially throughout the last 2 years of COVID. Consistent with this philosophy, we made this strategic decision to prioritize meeting customer demand with the trade-off being lower product margins in the short term. To be clear, the pricing and availability of our core HDD and SSD components are stable and are not a contributor to the near-term headwinds.\nWith these supply chain headwinds as a backdrop, I want to highlight 2 critical takeaways. Number one, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and number two, we expect that Q4 will be the trough for product margins. As you all know, -- the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remain fluid, but we do expect cost improvements in the coming quarters as the supply headwinds begin to ease throughout the first half of fiscal '23. We also expect our recent price increases to help further stabilize product margins in the coming quarters. As the supply base for components and airline cargo normalize, we are confident that product margin will return to its structural level in the mid-50s, particularly as our mix continues to trend towards all-flash.\nWe do anticipate these supply chain challenges to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in Q4. The supply chain headwinds and our ongoing actions to mitigate them have been factored into our Q4 and updated full year guidance.\nWe expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.635 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin in Q4 to be approximately 64%. The near-term margin headwind is being driven by an incremental $50 million to $60 million of premiums we expect to incur in open market component purchases.\nConsistent with our philosophy and culture, we actively prioritize being a great strategic partner to our loyal customers, many of which have been with us for over 25 years, and feel great about the discipline and execution the NetApp team has displayed in managing through the current supply situation. We expect operating margin to be approximately 22% in Q4, which would have been closer to 25% without the recent supplier decommits.\nAssumed in this guidance, our Q4 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. We anticipate earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million, and our tax rate will be approximately 18%. Our Q4 guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year for fiscal '22.\nWe also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our Public Cloud ARR with a new range of $525 million to $545 million exiting fiscal '22. Please note that Fylamynt is a tech and talent acquisition and will not contribute any ARR in Q4.\nThe implied forecast for total gross margin is approximately 67% for the full year. Our disciplined management of the business, despite the backdrop of supply cost headwinds, has allowed us to reaffirm our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are raising our fiscal '22 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $5.07 and $5.17, representing 26% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.\nIn closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution and delivering strong Q3 results. We will continue to be disciplined and long-term minded as we manage through the temporary supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. Given the current environment, George and I are incredibly proud that the team stayed focused on our strategic priorities and have collectively leaned into executing against a tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next 3 to 5 years.\nAs George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day on March 22, where we will further discuss the long-term growth potential and value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris?\n\nKris Newton\n\nVP of Corporate Communications & IR, NetApp, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Let's open the call for questions. Operator, let's begin the Q&A.",

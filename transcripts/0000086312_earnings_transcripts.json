Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 16, 2025. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2025 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our 3 segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance Jeff Klenk Bound & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.\nActual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nAlso in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report excellent third quarter results. We have core income of $1.9 billion or $8.14 per diluted share. Core return on equity for the quarter was 22.6%, bringing our core return on equity for the trailing 12 months to 18.7%. Very strong underwriting results and higher investment income drove the bottom line.\nUnderwriting income of $1.4 billion pretax more than doubled compared to the prior year quarter, benefiting from both the lower level of catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying result was driven by higher net earned premiums and an underlying combined ratio that improved 1.7 points to an exceptional 83.9%. Underwriting income was higher in all 3 segments.\nOur high-quality investment portfolio also continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $850 million for the quarter, up 15% driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return almost $900 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $628 million of share repurchases.\nAt the same time, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share was up 15% compared to a year ago. With strong results over the past year in a particularly light cat quarter, we have a higher-than-usual level of excess capital and liquidity.\nConsequently, we anticipate a higher level of share repurchases over the next couple of quarters. Dan will have more to say about that in a minute. Turning to the top line, we grew net written premiums to $11.5 billion in the quarter. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 3% to $5.7 billion, led by 4% growth in our domestic business. Excluding the property line, we grew domestic net written premiums in the segment by more than 6%.\nThe declining premium volume in property continues to be a large account dynamic. In fact, we grew property in both middle market and small commercial. We've seen this dynamic in the large property market before, and we won't compromise our underwriting discipline. Over time, particularly as catastrophic events inevitably unfold, the value of that discipline and the cost of those who abandon it will become unmistakable.\nRenewal premium and change in business insurance was 7.1%, driven by continued historically high RPC in our middle market and select businesses. Excluding the property line, renewal premium change in the segment was a very strong 9%, and renewal rate change was a very strong 6.7% Greg will share additional detail by line.\nRetention in this segment was 85%. Given the high quality of the book, we were very pleased with that result. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums to $1.1 billion with higher renewal premium change and continued strong retention of 87% in our high-quality management liability business. Net written premiums in our market-leading surety business remains strong.\nIn Personal Insurance, net written premiums were $4.7 billion, with strong renewal premium change in our homeowners business. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. As we head toward the end of the year, our planning for 2026 is well underway. As always, that process involves assessing the environment ahead.\nThere are uncertainties out there. Economic, political, geopolitical not to mention the loss environment. We are very confident that we're built and very well positioned for whatever lies ahead. We're operating from a position of considerable strength. Profitability is strong, reflecting our leading underwriting expertise and the operating leverage we've built through a sustained focus on productivity and efficiency.\nOur competitive advantages have never been stronger or more relevant. Strong underwriting is the flywheel that sets everything in motion. Our premium growth at attractive margins has generated strong cash flow, which enables us to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow our investment portfolio. Since 2016, we have successfully invested $13 billion in technology returned more than $20 billion of excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio by nearly 50% to more than $100 million.\nScale matters increasingly so. We have the scale to win in an environment where technology and AI will continue to segment the marketplace. We have a track record of identifying the right strategic priorities and driving value from them. You can see that in the 300 basis point reduction we've achieved in our expense ratio since 2016, even while we were significantly increasing our overall technology spend.\nImportantly, our size gives us the data to power AI, creating a virtuous cycle, better insights, better decisions, better outcomes, more resources to invest. For example, our long-time focus on organizing and curating data has given us access to more than 65 billion clean data points from decades of history across multiple business lines. We leverage that to sharpen our underwriting and shape our claims strategies.\nWith the vast majority of our business in North America, we hold a leading position in the largest and most stable insurance market in the world. An advantage that insulates us from much of the risk arising from the economic instability and geopolitical uncertainty around the globe. Our fortress balance sheet and exceptional cash flow provide us with the financial strength to invest consistently in the business regardless of the external conditions.\nOur financial strength also enables us to manage comfortably through large loss events like the January California wildfires. When it comes to the loss environment from weather volatility to the impact of social inflation on casualty lines, no one is better positioned. Diversification provides powerful protection. In fact, our business mix produces a consolidated loss ratio that's actually less volatile than the loss ratio of our leased volatile segment.\nThat's the power of a balanced and diversified portfolio. Equally important is our demonstrated ability to confront the loss environment head on. We have the data, the analytics and the discipline to establish reserves and loss picks appropriately and generally ahead of the market. That matters because until you have an accurate view of the loss environment, your risk selection, underwriting and claim strategies are all operating with the wrong inputs.\nSince our early identification of the acceleration of social inflation in 2019, we've grown the business and delivered significantly improved margins. Getting an accurate and timely view of the loss environment isn't just about the balance sheet. It's foundational to running the business effectively. Our internally managed investment portfolio is another source of strength.\nOur disciplined focus on achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns has served us exceptionally well through various markets, especially during periods of market turmoil. More than 90% of our portfolio is in fixed income with an average credit rating of AA. We're highly selective. We don't reach for yield. We hold the vast majority of our fixed income securities to maturity, and we carefully coordinate the duration of our assets and liabilities.\nThe track record speaks for itself. Our default rates during the most challenging environments over the past 2 decades were a fraction of industry averages. This consistency comes from a world-class investment team with extraordinary tenure and a shared long-term perspective. In short, the franchise we've built, the capabilities we've developed and our depth of expertise created advantages that are durable across operating environments.\nBefore I wrap up, I'll share that we're just back from one of the industry's premier conferences, but we have the opportunity to meet with dozens of our key agents and brokers who collectively represent a substantial amount of our business. We left as convinced as ever that our position with the independent distribution channel is an unmatched strategic advantage.\nWe heard clearly that our strategic investments are resonating and that looking ahead, we're focused on the right priorities to extend that advantage. I want to acknowledge and thank all of our distribution partners. I also want to reiterate our unwavering commitment to being an indispensable partner for them, and the undeniable choice for their customers.\nTo sum it up, we're very well positioned and very confident about the road ahead. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. In the third quarter, we once again delivered excellent financial results on a consolidated basis and in each of our 3 segments. Core income for the quarter of $1.9 billion resulted in core return on equity of 22.6%, reflecting both excellent underwriting results and strong investment income.\nWe generated higher levels of written premium and earned premium, while delivering excellent combined ratios on both a reported and underlying basis. At 83.9% the underlying combined ratio marked its fourth consecutive quarter below 85. The combination of higher premiums and the excellent underlying combined ratio led to an 18% increase in after-tax underlying underwriting income, which surpassed $1 billion for the fifth consecutive quarter.\nThe expense ratio for the third quarter was 28.6% bringing the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.5%. We continue to expect an expense ratio of around 28.5% for the full year 2025 and expect to manage to that level again in 2026.\nCatastrophe losses in the quarter were fairly benign at $402 million pretax consisting mainly of tornado hail events in the Central United States. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $22 million pretax. In Business Insurance, the annual asbestos review resulted in a charge of $277 million.\nExcluding asbestos, Business Insurance had net favorable PYD of $152 million driven by continued favorability in workers' comp. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was $43 million pretax with favorability in Fidelity and Surety Personal Insurance had net favorable PYD of $104 million pretax driven by favorability in auto.\nAfter-tax net investment income of $850 million increased by 15% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again the driver of the increase reflecting both the benefit of higher invested assets and higher average yields. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also up from the prior year quarter. During the quarter, we grew our investment portfolio by approximately $4 billion.\nOur outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities has increased from the outlook we provided a quarter ago, and we now expect approximately $810 million after tax in the fourth quarter. For 2026, we expect more than $3.3 billion with quarterly figures starting at around $810 million in Q1 and growing to around $885 million in Q4.\nNew money rates as of September 30 are roughly 70 to 75 basis points above the yield embedded in the portfolio. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter were a new record at $4.2 billion, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2.8 billion.\nInterest rates decreased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3 billion after tax at June 30 to $2 billion after tax at September 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $150.55 at quarter end, up 8% from year-end and up 15% from a year ago. Also of note for Q3, we issued $1.25 billion of debt back in July with $500 million of 10-year notes and $750 million of 30-year notes.\nThis was simply ordinary course capital management, maintaining a debt-to-capital ratio in our target range as we continue to grow the business. Sticking with the theme of capital management, we returned $878 million of our capital to shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $628 million and dividends of $250 million.\nAs Alan shared, our very strong earnings over the past year have provided us with an elevated level of capital and liquidity well in excess of what we had planned to use for investment and to support continued growth. As a result, we expect to increase the level of share repurchases in the fourth quarter to roughly $1.3 billion.\nAlso keep in mind that we previously shared our plan to deploy about $700 million from the sale of our Canadian operations expected to close in early 2026 for additional share repurchases as well. So if we look across the 3 quarter period from Q3 2025 through Q1 2026, our repurchases in Q3, combined with our current outlook for the next 2 quarters, has us repurchasing a total of somewhere around $3.5 billion worth of our stock.\nUsing the average share price over the past 30 days for purchases during the next 2 quarters, that would result in a reduction of our outstanding share count of about 5% in the 9-month period. Of course, the actual amount and timing of repurchases will depend on a number of factors, including the timing of the closing of the transaction in Canada, actual quarterly earnings and other factors we disclosed in our SEC filings.\nRecapping our results. Q3 was another quarter of excellent underwriting profitability on both an underlying and as-reported basis and another quarter of rising net investment income. These strong fundamentals delivered core return on equity of 22.6% for the quarter and 18.7% on a trailing 12-month basis and position us very well to continue delivering strong results in the future.\nAnd now for a discussion of results in Business Insurance, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a very strong quarter, delivering a record third quarter segment income of $907 million and an all-in combined ratio of 92.9%. The quarter reflected relatively benign catastrophes and the continued strong contribution from our exceptional underlying underwriting results. This quarter's underlying combined ratio of 88.3% and marked the 12th consecutive quarter where we've produced an underlying combined ratio below 90%.\nWe're pleased that our ongoing strategic investments have contributed to this sustained level of profitability. In particular, through meaningful advancements in data and analytics, we continue to advance our underwriting tools. One specific highlight is the development and utilization of sophisticated models that derive risk characteristics, refined technical pricing and summarize historical and modeled loss experience, all of which is provided to our underwriters at the point of sale.\nMoving to the top line. Our net written premiums increased to an all-time third quarter high of $5.7 billion. We grew our leading middle market and select businesses by 7% and 4%, respectively. These 2 markets make up 70% of the net written premiums in business insurance. We saw a decline in net written premiums in National Property and other, which, as you heard from Alan, reflects our disciplined execution in terms of risk selection, pricing and terms and conditions.\nAs for production across the segment, pricing remained attractive with renewal premium change just over 7%. We Renewal premium change remained strong in select and middle market. From a line of business perspective, renewal premium change was positive in all lines, double digits in umbrella, CMP and auto and up from the second quarter or stable in all lines other than property.\nAs you heard from Alan, excluding the property line, renewal premium change in the segment was 9%. The Retention remained excellent at 85%, and new business of $673 million was about flat to a very strong prior year level. We're very pleased with these production results and particularly our field execution of our proven segmentation strategy. Across the book, Pricing and retention results this quarter reflect excellent execution, aligning price, terms and conditions with environmental trends for each line.\nAs for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change of 10.8% was about flat with the second quarter. Retention ticked up as expected as we near completion of our targeted CMP risk-return optimization efforts. And lastly, for Select, we generated new business of $134 million, up 3% over the prior year.\nAs we've mentioned previously, we've made meaningful strategic investments in this market in both product and user experience. Our new BOP and auto products have been well received in the market. And we're pleased that the industry-leading segmentation contained in both products is contributing to profitable growth. We're also very pleased with the success of Travis our digital experience platform for our distribution partners.\nAs we continue our strategic rollout, Travis is already producing over 1 million transactions annually. In our core middle market business, renewal premium change of 8.3% was also about flat sequentially from the second quarter. Price increases remain broad-based as we achieved higher prices on more than 3/4 of our middle market accounts. And at the same time, the granular execution was excellent with meaningful spread from our best performing accounts to our lower-performing accounts.\nWe're pleased that retention of 88% remained exceptional given the level of price increases we achieved. And finally, new business of $391 million was our highest ever third quarter result and up 7% over the prior year. We're pleased with the new business risk selecting and strength of pricing and overall with the combination of strong returns and customer growth in middle market.\nOn a strategic note for Middle Market, we continue to enhance our industry-leading underwriting workstation. With models that assess new business opportunities for risk characteristics with the propensity to produce the highest level of lifetime profitability. This information helps our field organization focus on the highest priority opportunities, resulting in a greater likelihood of success in winning more accounts that contribute to strong margins.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial and production results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty delivered very strong third quarter results. We generated segment income of $250 million an outstanding combined ratio of 81.6%, nearly 1 point better than the prior year quarter. The strong underlying combined ratio of 85.8% drove very attractive returns in the segment. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums in the quarter to $1.1 billion.\nIn our high-quality domestic management liability business, renewal premium change improved to 3.7% and while retention remained strong at 87%. These results reflect our intentional and segmented initiatives to improve pricing in certain lines with a focus on employment practices liability, cyber, and public company D&O.\nWe're pleased with the strong underlying pricing segmentation achieved by our outstanding field organization on both renewal and new business. enabled by our advanced analytics and sophisticated pricing models. New business was lower than the third quarter of 2024 as we expected as [ Corvus ] production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter, and is now mostly reflected as renewal premiums.\nComparisons to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted for the remainder of the year. Outside of the Corvus impact, we're pleased with early returns on multiple tech and operational investments we've made to drive account growth. For example, in our private and nonprofit business, we're leveraging predictive analytics and AI to enhance our customer segmentation and sales effectiveness.\nWe're pleased that these initiatives drove a 40% increase in new lines of business sold to existing customers as compared to the prior year quarter. Turning to our market-leading surety business. where production can be lumpy based on the timing of bonded construction projects. Net written premiums remained strong relative to the record high quarter in the prior year.\nThis reflects our customers' continued confidence in our industry-leading surety expertise and value-added service offerings as well as benefits from digital investments we've made to enhance distribution experiences in our small commercial surety business. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits of our market-leading competitive advantages.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, we delivered third quarter segment income of $807 million an excellent result that reflects the continued impact of our disciplined approach to selecting, pricing and managing risk. The combined ratio of 81.3% improved 11 points relative to the prior year quarter. Driven primarily by lower catastrophe losses and a lower underlying combined ratio.\nThe underlying combined ratio of 77.7% was 5 points better compared to the prior year quarter driven by continued improvement in both homeowners and other and auto. Net written premiums of $4.7 billion in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on improving profitability in homeowners while seeking growth in auto as we execute our strategy to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns across the portfolio.\nThe ceded premium impact of the enhanced personal insurance excess of loss reinsurance program we announced last quarter, reduced net written premium growth in the quarter by 1 point as the full year's worth of ceded premium was booked in the third quarter. In auto, the third quarter combined ratio was very strong at 84.9%. And reflecting lower catastrophe losses, a strong underlying combined ratio and favorable net prior year development.\nThe underlying combined ratio of 88.3% improved by 2.9 points compared to the prior year quarter. The improvement was driven by favorable loss experience in bodily injury and to a lesser extent, vehicle coverages. Similar to last year's third quarter results, this quarter's underlying combined ratio included a 2-point benefit related to the reestimation of prior quarters in the current year.\nThe year-to-date underlying combined ratio was also 88.3% and reflecting sustained profitability in an auto book that is larger than it was 5 years ago, both in terms of premium dollars and policy count. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2025. It's important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been 6 to 7 points above the average for the first 3 quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 78% improved by 13.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily because of lower catastrophe losses and improvement in the underlying combined ratio. Net prior year development was favorable, but lower compared to the prior year. The underlying combined ratio of 68% improved by almost 6.5 points compared to the prior year quarter.\nThe year-over-year favorability in homeowners was primarily related to the benefit of earned pricing as well as favorable non-catastrophe weather. Overall, these outstanding results reflect favorable weather conditions throughout the third quarter along with our actions to manage exposures in high catastrophe risk geographies to help optimize risk and reward.\nTurning to production. We're making progress in positioning our diversified portfolio to deliver long-term profitable growth. While our production results don't quite show it yet, we're confident that the actions we're taking will build momentum towards this objective. In domestic auto, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent quarters.\nRenewal premium change of 3.9% continued to moderate and will continue to decline in the fourth quarter, reflective of improved profitability and our focus on generating growth. Auto new business premium was up year-over-year for the fourth consecutive quarter as new business momentum continued in states less impacted by our property actions.\nIn Homeowners and Other, retention of 84% remained relatively consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change remained strong at 18% as we continue to align replacement costs with insured values. We expect RPC to remain elevated in the fourth quarter and then drop into single digits beginning in early 2026 as values will have largely aligned with replacement costs.\nWe continued to execute actions to reduce exposure and manage volatility in high-risk catastrophe geographies in the quarter, causing further declines in property new business premium policies in force. Most of our property actions will be completed by the end of the year, at which point the downward pressure on both property and auto growth should begin to moderate.\nAs we conclude this year and ahead into 2026, we're focused on building momentum toward generating profitable growth. To that end, we have a range of actions currently or soon to be in market, including the following: adjusting pricing appetite, terms and conditions to better reflect improved profitability in both auto and home, removing temporary binding restrictions and winding down some of our property non-renewal actions in certain geographies.\nAnd appointing new agents and partnering with existing agents to consolidate books of business, continuing to modernize our specialty products and platforms and investing in artificial intelligence and digitization to deliver better experiences for our agents and customers. These messages resonate as we share them in the marketplace, reinforcing our commitment to being the undeniable choice for consumers and an indispensable partner for our agents.\nTo sum up, we delivered terrific segment income as our team continued to invest in capabilities and deliver value to customers and agents. These results position us well to build on a long track record of profitably growing our business over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. And with that, we're ready to open up for Q&A.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report exceptional second quarter results, driven by excellent underwriting and investment performance. We earned core income of $1.5 billion or $6.51 per diluted share. Core return on equity for the quarter was 18.8%, bringing our core return on equity for the trailing 12 months, 17.1%.\nUnderwriting income reflects strong net earned premiums and a reported combined ratio that improved almost 10 points to 90.3%. The improvement in the combined ratio benefited from strength across the board as lower catastrophe losses, higher underlying underwriting results and favorable prior year reserve development, all contributed. Underlying underwriting income of $1.6 billion pretax was up 35% over the prior year quarter, driven by 7% growth in net earned premiums to $10.9 billion and an underlying combined ratio that improved 3 points to an excellent 84.7%. All 3 segments contributed to these terrific results with strong net earned premiums and excellent reported and underlying profitability. The underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance improved by almost 1 point to an excellent 88.3%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was a very strong 87.8%, and the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved by 7 points to a terrific 79.3%.\nOur high-quality investment portfolio also continued to perform well. generating after-tax net investment income of $774 million for the quarter, driven by reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return more than $800 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $557 million of share repurchases. At the same time, we continue to make strategic investments in our business. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share was up by more than 14% as compared to a year ago.\nTurning to the top line through skilled execution by our field organization, we grew net written premiums to $11.5 billion in the quarter, with growth in all 3 segments. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 5% to $5.8 billion. Renewal premium change remained strong 7.7% with renewal premium change of 8.6% in our core middle market business, and 10.7% in our small commercial select business. Those 2 markets make up 70% of the net written premiums in Business Insurance. Given the high quality of the book, we were very pleased with strong retention of 85% in this segment. New business was a record $744 million, a reflection of the relationships we've built with customers and distribution partners, by delivering value products, services and experiences.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 4% to $1.1 billion, with retention of 87% in our high-quality management liability business. In our industry-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by 5% from a particularly strong result in the prior year quarter.\nIn Personal Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 3% to $4.7 billion, driven by strong renewal premium change in our homeowners business. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nIn May, we announced an agreement to sell most of our Canadian business to Definity for $2.4 billion or 1.8x book value, excluding excess local capital. As we noted at the time, the transaction does not include our premier surety business. We also shared that we expect to allocate about $700 million of the net cash proceeds for additional share repurchases in 2026. And that we expect the transaction to be slightly accretive to earnings per share in each of the next several years. It was a relatively small transaction for us, it's noteworthy in reflecting an important point. We are relentless in our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and value creation.\nTaking a step back, the Canadian marketplace has evolved over the last decade or so in a few significant ways. First, a small number of insurers have built significant scale and market influence, in part, through vertical integration with distribution. There were no compelling inorganic opportunities for us to close the market share gap and we didn't see vertical integration as a realistic opportunity for us. Also, the regulatory environment has become more challenging. But we were confident that we could continue to manage successfully in Canada. The outlook for our Canadian business relative to our other businesses, combined with the very attractive offer from a strategic buyer made reallocating the capital the better decision. Disciplined capital management isn't only about deciding how to deploy the marginal dollar. It's also about continually and rigorously reassessing the capital we have already deployed and whether it's still delivering the best long-term value.\nI want to thank our outstanding team in Canada and recognize the value they've created over many years. I'm confident that they and our Canadian customers and brokers will benefit from being part of the country -- of one of the country's leading and fully integrated property casualty insurers. I also want to reaffirm our commitment to our ongoing international businesses. This deal is not part of a broader geographic repositioning, it's simply a smart transaction. Transaction speaks volumes about the way we think about our business. At Travelers, we're optimizers, relentlessly focused on ensuring that both our capital and our retention are invested that we can generate attractive returns, profitable growth and the greatest long-term value for our shareholders.\nTo sum things up, our results for the first half of the year reflect exceptional underwriting performance, record operating cash flow and steadily rising investment returns in our growing fixed income portfolio. We're building on the strong momentum through continued disciplined execution of our proven strategy. With our diversified business operating from a position of strength, our outlook for continued premium growth at attractive underwriting margins, orderly conditions generally in our target markets and a positive trajectory for investment income, we remain highly confident in the outlook for our business. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. We're very pleased with our financial results this quarter, both overall and by segment. We generated higher earned premiums and meaningfully improved both the reported and underlying combined ratios compared to the prior year quarter. At 84.7%, the underlying combined ratio marked its third consecutive quarter below 85. The combination of higher premiums and the excellent underlying combined ratio led to our fourth consecutive quarter with after-tax underlying underwriting income of more than $1 billion, up $339 million or 36% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 28.6%, 20 basis points better than last year's second quarter and in line with our expectations. That brings the year-to-date expense ratio to 28.4% and we continue to expect the full year expense ratio of 28% to 28.5%.\nAs we've discussed previously, the second quarter is historically our most active cat period. This year, however, our pretax cat losses of $927 million or 8.5 combined ratio points, while significant, were nearly 4 points less than the second quarter cat plan we shared with you during our year-end earnings call in January.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $315 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $79 million pretax was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, partially offset by reserve additions in our runoff book related to environmental, abuse, and other long-tail exposures with no single adjustment being particularly noteworthy. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was $81 million pretax with favorability in Fidelity and Surety. Personal Insurance had net favorable PYD of $155 million pretax, driven by recent accident years in both auto and home.\nAfter-tax net investment income of $774 million increased by 6% from the prior year quarter. As expected, fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher invested assets and higher average yields. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were positive but not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Notably, for the first time, Total invested assets surpassed $100 billion, excluding the net unrealized loss. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities has increased from the outlook we provided a quarter ago. We now expect approximately $770 million after tax in the third quarter and $805 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30 are more than 100 basis points above the yield embedded in the portfolio. Fixed income NII should continue to increase beyond 2025 as the portfolio continues to grow and gradually turns over with higher yields replacing maturing yields.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.3 billion were, again, very strong. we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. This marks our 21st consecutive quarter with operating cash flows of more than $1 billion, totaling more than $40 billion over that time frame. Interest rates decreased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3.3 billion after tax at March 31 to $3 billion after tax at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $144.57 at quarter end up 4% from year-end and up 14% from a year ago. We returned $809 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $557 million and dividends of $252 million and we have approximately $4.3 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nTurning to reinsurance. Page 18 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1 reinsurance placements. We renewed our Northeast property cat XoL treaty which continues to provide $1 billion of occurrence coverage above the attachment point of $2.75 billion. We also replaced our personal insurance coastal hurricane cat XoL treaty with an all perils countrywide personal insurance treaty that provides 50% occurrence coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1 billion. You may recall that last year's treaty had an attachment point of $2 billion. While in a modeled year, we wouldn't expect this to have much of an impact given the prospect of continued weather volatility, we were pleased to obtain broader coverage at a reasonable cost.\nRecapping our results. Q2 was another quarter of continued premium growth in all 3 segments. The quarter also featured excellent underwriting profitability, both on an underlying and as-reported basis and rising net investment income. These strong fundamentals delivered core return on equity of 18.8% for the quarter and 17.1% on a trailing 12-month basis and position us very well to continue delivering strong returns in the future. And now for a discussion of results and business insurance, I'll turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a very strong second quarter, delivering segment income of $813 million, up nearly 25% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher net earned premiums and a combined ratio that improved 2.5 points from the prior year quarter to a terrific 93.6%. The improvement was broad-based, reflecting higher underlying underwriting income, higher favorable prior year reserve development, higher net investment income and lower catastrophes. We're extremely pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 88.3%, which improved from the prior year by almost 1 point, driven by the benefit of earned pricing.\nMoving to the top line. our net written premiums increased 5% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.8 billion, led by strong growth of 10% in our core middle market business. This was partially offset by a 3% decline in net written premiums, in National Property and other, reflecting our disciplined underwriting. As for production across the segment, with renewal premium change of nearly 8%, driven by renewal rechange of 5.3%.\nRenewal rate change and renewal premium change in every line other than CMP and property were about the same or higher compared to the first quarter. Renewal premium change in both umbrella and auto were both well into double digits. Renewal premium change in CMP was a little lower, but remained in the double digits. The decline in renewal premium change in property was driven by based on national property, reflecting the outlook for continued attractive returns after several years of compounding price increases and improvements in terms and conditions. Renewal premium change in the property line outside of National Property was down some, but remained solid.\nRetention across the segment remained excellent at 85%. Retention in middle market was strong, while retention in our National Property business was a bit lower as we ceded some large accounts to the subscription market on terms and pricing that we weren't willing to access. Lastly, new business of $744 million was a new quarterly record.\nWe're pleased with these production results and particularly our field segmented execution. Our proven strategy focuses on managing our business in a granular manner, balancing retaining our high-quality book of business while obtaining appropriate pricing. Our rate and retention results this quarter reflect excellent execution, aligning rates, terms and conditions with environmental trends for each line. While our continued high retention levels are an indication of a rational marketplace, we believe our execution is differentiating. It's the best people in the business powered by the best analytics and tools at the point of sale that deliver these segmented production results, ultimately producing these strong returns across BI.\nAs for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remains strong at nearly 11%, marking the seventh quarter in a row of double-digit renewal premium change. Renewal rate change of 5.3% was in line with the prior year level. As we expected, retention was stable at 80%, reflecting our targeted CMP risk return optimization efforts, which will begin to wind down next quarter. New business of $148 million continues to benefit from our industry-leading product offerings, including BOP 2.0 and our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 42 states.\nIn our core middle market business, renewal premium change also remained strong at almost 9%. Renewal rate change of 7.1% was up a bit from the second quarter of last year, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business of $430 million was a second quarter record.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had another outstanding quarter. We continue to grow our quality book of business while investing in differentiating capabilities that position us for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted another very strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $244 million and an outstanding combined ratio of 80.3% in the quarter -- up modestly driven by the impact of earned pricing on our management liability business.\nTurning to the top line. We're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 4% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, renewal premium percent, while retention remained strong at 87%. These results reflect our intentional and segmented initiatives to improve pricing given the loss environment. As expected, new business was lower than the second quarter of 2024. As a reminder, [ core business ] production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter and is now mostly reflected as renewal premium. Comparisons to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted for the remainder of the year.\nTurning to our market-leading surety business. We grew net written premiums by 5% from a very strong level in the prior year quarter, reflecting continued robust demand for our surety products and services. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits of our value-added approach and market-leading competitive advantages.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share that Personal Insurance delivered segment income of $534 million for the second quarter of 2025. Significantly improved underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year development contributed to this excellent bottom line result.\nThe combined ratio of 88.4% improved 20 points relative to the prior year quarter, driven by a decrease in catastrophe losses of nearly 14 points and a 7-point improvement in the underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 79.3% reflects the benefit of the actions we've taken to improve the fundamentals of our business in both auto and homeowners. Net written premiums grew 3% in the quarter, driven by higher renewal premium change in homeowners. In automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 85.3% and included a 5-point benefit from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 89% improved 6.2 points compared to the second quarter of the prior year. This improvement was driven by favorable loss experience across both bodily injury and vehicle coverages and, to a lesser extent, the benefit of higher earned pricing.\nIn homeowners and other, the second quarter combined ratio of 91.3% was a significant improvement compared to the prior year, reflecting lower catastrophes and strong underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 70.3% improved over 7 points compared to the second quarter of 2024. This year-over-year improvement was driven by both favorable non-catastrophe weather losses and the continued benefit of earned pricing.\nTurning to production. Our results reflect further progress toward positioning our diversified portfolio to deliver long-term profitable growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent periods. Renewal premium change continues to moderate as intended, reflecting improved profitability and our focus on returning to profitable growth in auto. We're pleased to note that all the new business premium increased 12%. In addition, for the first time in more than a year, we wrote more new business policies than in the prior year quarter. The new business momentum was primarily driven by our continued efforts to improve auto growth. The relaxing of some of our property restrictions also contributed to the new business momentum in auto.\nIn domestic homeowners and other, retention remained relatively consistent. Renewal premium change of 19.3% reflects our continued actions to align insured values with rising replacement costs and secure rate increases in geographies where we have the need. The decline in homeowners policies in force continues to be a result of our deliberate actions to manage exposures in high cat risk geographies. We're pleased with the progress we've made.\nWhile we will maintain restrictions on property capacity where we can't achieve appropriate risk reward, we expect to relax many of our rate and non-rate actions in most markets by the end of 2025.\nTo sum it up, this is a great quarter. We delivered strong segment income as our team continue to improve the fundamentals of our business while further positioning our portfolio for long-term profitable growth.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nGreat. Thanks, Michael. We are ready to open up for Q&A.",

Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 16, 2025. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2025 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski, Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk, Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nAlso in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report a substantial profit for the quarter despite the devastating January California wildfires. We delivered core income of $443 million or $1.91 per diluted share as outstanding underlying results, strong net favorable prior year reserve development and higher investment income more than offset catastrophe losses.\nOver the last 4 quarters, thanks to strong underlying fundamentals, we generated a core return on equity of 14.5%. That demonstrates our ability to deliver healthy returns over time, notwithstanding elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses. Underlying underwriting income of $1.6 billion pretax was up more than 30% over the prior year quarter. That was driven by strong net earned premiums of $10.7 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio that improved 2.9 points to an excellent 84.8%.\nAll 3 segments contributed to these underlying results with strong and higher net earned premiums and excellent underlying profitability. The underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance improved to an excellent 88.2%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was a very strong 87.3%, and the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance improved by more than 6 points to a terrific 79.9%.\nConsistent with the announcement we made in February, our catastrophe losses from the California wildfires were $1.7 billion pretax. I'm grateful to our claim team, their continued excellent work taking care of our customers and supporting the community's recovery. We've already paid out nearly $0.75 billion, including substantial advanced payments to our customers who suffered total losses. Even after that, operating cash flows for the quarter were a very strong $1.4 billion.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well. After-tax net investment income of $763 million for the quarter was driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and positive returns from our thoughtfully managed alternative investment portfolio. Our underwriting and investment -- our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return nearly $600 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $358 million of share repurchases.\nAt the same time, we continue to make important investments in our business as we completed another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. Even after this deployment of capital, adjusted book value per share increased by 11% as compared to a year ago. In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend of $1.10 per share, marking 21 consecutive years of dividend increases, with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period.\nTurning to production. Excellent execution by our field organization drove our top line growth, with all 3 of our segments contributing. During the quarter, we grew net written premiums to $10.5 billion. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 2% to a record $5.7 billion after the ceded premium impact of the enhanced Casualty Reinsurance Program that we announced last quarter. As we previewed with you, that reduced the segment's net written premium growth in the quarter by 4 percentage points, as the full year's worth of ceded premium was booked in the first quarter. Renewal premium change in the segment was double digits or high single digits in every line other than workers' comp. Even with strong pricing pretty much across the board, retention improved nearly 2 points from the fourth quarter to 86% and was higher in every line. That dynamic of strong pricing and retention speaks to continued discipline in the marketplace. New business for this segment was a record $735 million, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 6% to $1 billion, with excellent retention of 89% in our high-quality management liability business. In our industry-leading Surety business, we grew net written premiums by 13%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.\nIn Personal Insurance, net written premiums grew 5% to $3.8 billion, driven by strong renewal premium change, particularly in our Homeowners business. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to comment on how Travelers is positioned for what feels like an uncertain macroeconomic road ahead. In short, we are entering 2025 in a position of strength. We are a market leader in a diversified portfolio of businesses, each with a strong value proposition to offer to our customers and distribution partners. Our underlying margins are in great shape. And in each segment, we have attractive loss ratios and expense ratios that reflect years of strategic focus on optimizing operating leverage.\nOur cash flow is strong and resilient. Our investment portfolio was thoughtfully managed to deliver highly reliable returns, including through periods of market stress. And we have a fortress balance sheet, featuring a strong capital base, and almost no debt coming due in the next 8 years. On top of all that, we have the resources and financial strength to continue making strategic investments in our business without interruption, all of which is to say, just as we have successfully served our customers and distribution partners and created shareholder value over time, including through periods of economic disruption, we are very well positioned to continue doing so now. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Travelers delivered $443 million of core income in the first quarter despite significant losses from the California wildfires. Higher level of cat losses was partially offset by a significant increase in underlying underwriting income, a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development and higher net investment income. And as you heard from Alan, trailing 12-month core return on equity was 14.5%. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $1.6 billion was up 32% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio that improved by 2.9 points to 84.8%. The underlying combined ratio was our second best result ever and once again featured very strong results in all 3 business segments.\nWe were pleased with the first quarter expense ratio of 28.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points from the prior year quarter. For the full year, we remain comfortable with an expense ratio expectation of 28% to 28.5%. Our continued focus on operating leverage enables us to maintain this level of expense ratio even as we increase the amount of strategic technology spend to further strengthen our competitive advantages, positioning us for continued success well into the future. We reported net favorable prior year reserve development of $378 million pretax in the first quarter, with all 3 segments contributing.\nIn Business Insurance, net favorable development of $74 million pretax was driven by workers' comp. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $67 million pretax was driven by better-than-expected results in Management Liability and Surety. Personal Insurance recorded net favorable PYD of $237 million pretax, with significant improvements in both Auto and Home.\nCatastrophe losses for the quarter totaled $2.3 billion pretax, driven by the California wildfires in January, for which our estimate of $1.7 billion is unchanged from the estimate we preannounced in February. After-tax net investment income increased 9% from the prior year quarter to $763 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations, benefiting from both higher yields and a higher level of invested assets. Our outlook for fixed income NII by quarter, including earnings from short-term securities, the $725 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $755 million in the third quarter and then to around $790 million in the fourth quarter.\nNII from our alternative investment portfolio was also positive in the quarter. Given recent movement in the equity markets, this is a good time to remind you that results for our private equities, hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. And while not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns tend to directionally follow the broader equity markets. In other words, the impact of the decline in financial markets that occurred in the first quarter will be reflected in our second quarter results.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were again very strong despite the elevated payout related to the California wildfires. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates decreased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $3.6 billion after tax at year-end to $3.3 billion after tax at March 31. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $138.99 at quarter end, basically unchanged from year-end and up 11% from a year ago.\nShare repurchases this quarter included $250 million of open market repurchases. We had an additional $108 million of buybacks in connection with employee share-based compensation plans. We have approximately $4.8 billion remaining under prior Board authorizations for share repurchases. Dividends were $241 million in the quarter. And as Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized a $0.05 increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.10 per share.\nIn summary, our first quarter results once again demonstrate the significant earnings power that results from our ability to leverage our competitive advantages to grow premiums across our well-diversified book of business while maintaining very attractive margins, along with steadily increasing net investment income from our growing investment portfolio. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had a strong start to 2025, with segment income for the first quarter of $683 million. Underlying underwriting income, net prior year reserve development and net investment income all improved from the first quarter of 2024. The underlying combined ratio of 88.2% was an excellent result and 1 point better than the prior year quarter, driven by the benefit of earned pricing.\nTurning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 2% to a record quarterly high of $5.7 billion, inclusive of the 4-point ceded premium impact that Alan referenced. As we indicated in our comments previously, we expect the change in our reinsurance program to be neutral in terms of underwriting income. Pricing remains strong, with renewal premium change of 9.2% driven by a renewal rate change of 6.4%. Retention increased to an excellent 86%, and new business of $735 million was an all-time quarterly high. We're pleased with these production results and our ability to sustain strong levels of pricing and retention. That combination is a reflection of market-wide discipline in response to ongoing environmental trends and uncertainty.\nRenewal rate change remained high, coming in at well over 6% for the eighth quarter in a row. The small tick down from Q4 was driven by our national property book, where returns are very strong after several years of compounding rates and improvements in terms and conditions. In our Select and core Middle Market businesses, renewal rate change remained strong and in line with fourth quarter levels. From a line perspective, renewal rate change was highest in umbrella and Auto, while CMP reached an all-time high, and GL remains strong.\nThe execution by our field organization was exceptional, achieving the highest retention levels in our best-performing business and the highest levels in our other accounts. The granular execution contributes to optimizing the portfolio's returns. This success is possible based on the robust data that we have, the advanced analytics and sophisticated tools we put in the hands of our frontline underwriters, as well as the strength of the talent that we have in the field.\nAs for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.6%, up 1.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while renewal rate change of 5.8% was up nearly 2 points from a year ago. As we expected, retention was stable at 80%, driven based on our targeted CMP risk return optimization efforts, which will begin to wind down in the third quarter. New business of $159 million was a quarterly record.\nOverall, we feel terrific about how we're strategically managing the mix of business to drive long-term profitable growth in Select. Our distribution partners have embraced the industry-leading experience and segmentation benefits we're getting from our BOP 2.0 and new commercial auto products.\nIn Middle Market, renewal premium change was in line with the fourth quarter at close to 10% with strong renewal rate change of 7.5%. The rate increases remain broad-based as we achieved positive rate change of more than 3/4 of our middle market accounts. Retention of our high-quality book remained historically high at 89% and increased 1 point from the fourth quarter, while new business of $434 million was an all-time quarterly high.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our high-quality book while investing in capabilities that position us well for long-term success. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $220 million, an excellent combined ratio of 82.5% and a strong 87.3% underlying combined ratio in the quarter.\nTurning to the top line. We're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we delivered excellent retention of 89%. Renewal premium change remained positive and generally consistent with the fourth quarter. As expected, new business was lower than the first quarter of 2024. As a reminder, Corvus production was reflected as new business in the prior year quarter and now is mostly renewal premium. Comparison to prior year new business levels will be similarly impacted for the next few quarters.\nTurning to our market-leading Surety business. We grew net written premiums by an excellent 13% from the prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our surety products and services and outstanding execution by our team in growing our high credit quality portfolio.\nSo we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter while continuing to make significant strategic investments in our business with some notable achievements. To name just a few, we released our first product on our new management liability technology platform, a modernized accountants professional liability product and rate plan with enhanced digital capabilities and a significantly streamlined workflow. Capitalizing on the Corvus acquisition for the benefit of our admitted cyber customers, we launched an improved cyber risk policyholder portal with enhanced value-added services. And we're leveraging our industry-leading data advantage and deploying multiple artificial intelligence models to drive underwriting enhancements, including as just 1 example, automating the process for certain employment practices liability renewals.\nLooking ahead, we're planning additional capability and product releases during the year that will further extend our competitive advantages. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the first quarter segment loss of $374 million and combined ratio of 115.2% reflect the impact of the California wildfires, a significant event for us and the industry. Strong underlying underwriting income and favorable prior year development partially offset catastrophe losses in the quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 79.9%, a record quarterly result for the segment, continues to reflect the actions we've taken to improve the underlying fundamentals of our business in both Automobile and Homeowners and Other. Net written premiums grew 5% in the quarter, driven by higher renewal premium change.\nIn Automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 83.4% and included a 6-point benefit from favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 87.5% improved 7.4 points compared to the first quarter of the prior year. This improvement was driven by lower losses resulting from both favorable frequency across all coverages and sustained moderation of severity trends, as well as the benefit of higher earned pricing. As a brief reminder, the first quarter is historically our seasonally lowest combined ratio of the year in Auto.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the first quarter combined ratio of 145.5% includes the impact of the California wildfires. The underlying combined ratio of 72.6% improved 5 points compared to the first quarter of 2024, driven by the continued benefit of earned pricing and lower non-weather losses compared to the prior year. Our production results reflect our efforts to position our portfolio for long-term profitable growth. In Domestic Automobile, retention of 82% remained consistent with recent periods. Renewal premium change continues to moderate as intended, reflecting improved profitability and our focus on returning to profitable growth in Auto. We're pleased to note that Auto new business premium increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by states that are not constrained by our property actions.\nIn Domestic Homeowners and Other, renewal premium change increased to 19.6% as a result of our actions to align insured values with rising replacement costs, while we continued to achieve strong rate increases. The decline in homeowners' policies in force continues to be driven by our deliberate efforts to improve profitability and reduce exposures in high cat risk geographies. While those same actions continue to constrain our ability to grow auto PIF in the near term, we believe the trade-off makes sense for the long-term performance of our diversified personal lines portfolio.\nBefore I wrap up, I'd like to thank our team and our distribution partners for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. With their partnership and support, we remain confident in our ability to deliver value to our clients and to build a larger, more profitable business over time. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. We are ready to open up for Q&A.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 22, 2025.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our Fourth Quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the tragic wildfires that have devastated communities across Los Angeles. Our hearts go out to everyone affected. Those who've lost their homes, their businesses and lost tragically their loved ones. At times like these, words alone are, of course, not enough. As a company rooted in the communities we serve, we will be there for our customers and neighbors to support them as they recover and rebuild. We've assessed impacted areas through aerial imagery and made live contact with the substantial majority of our customers with claims, enabling us to expedite claim payments.\nIn addition, our expert claim team is on the ground, we're grateful for their efforts. We also have mobile claim offices positioned in the area where customers can file a claim in person or receive an advanced claim payment. And we look forward to working with policymakers in California, to make sure the state has a resilient insurance market going forward.\nNow let me turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2024 results. We're very pleased to report that for the full year, core income was up 64% to more than $5 billion or $21.58 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 17.2%. These results were driven by strong fundamentals, growth in earned premiums, excellent underwriting profitability and a higher level of net investment income. That combination makes for a powerful earnings engine and that momentum is at our backs as we enter 2025.\nTurning to our fourth quarter results. We are very pleased to have generated exceptional top and bottom line results. Core income for the quarter of $2.1 billion was a record. Net earned premiums increased 9% to $10.9 billion, the combined ratio improved 2.6 points to 83.2%. The improvement in the combined ratio was driven by very strong underlying profitability and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The underwriting margins were strong in all 3 segments. The combined ratio in Business Insurance improved by more than 1 point to an excellent 85.2%. The combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was a very strong 82.7%, and the combined ratio in Personal Insurance improve than 6 points to an exceptional 80.7%. These terrific segment results led to a reported consolidated combined ratio that improved 2.6 points to 83.2%.\nTurning to investments. After-tax net investment income for the full year was up 21%, $3 billion, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. These results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 13% during the year to $139.4. After making important investments in our business and turning more than $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders.\nTurning to the top line through continued terrific marketplace execution across all 3 segments. We grew net written premiums during the year by 8% to more than $43 billion and in the quarter by 7% to $10.7 billion. The strong value proposition that we offer to our customers and distribution partners, along with outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top of success.\nIn Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 8% to $5.4 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment remained very strong at 9.6%, including renewal rate change of 6.9%. Retention also remained strong at 85%. A combination of strong pricing and excellent retention reflects our deliberate and granular execution in a generally disciplined marketplace.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 7% to $1.1 billion, with excellent retention of 88% in our high-quality management liability business. In our market-leading surety business, we grew net written premiums by 19%. We are very pleased to have generated terrific production results across our commercial segments where margins continue to be attractive. That includes our E&S offerings, where we grew net written premiums by 13% in 2024.\nIn Personal Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 7% to [ $1.3 ] billion. Driven by continued strong premium change, particularly in our homeowners business.\nAs we wrap up the year, I'd like to take a few minutes to reflect on our 2024 results and put them into an overtime context. As we've shared, we are and have been focusing our investments on 3 strategic innovation priorities. First, extending our advantage in risk expertise. Second, providing great experiences for our customers, distribution partners and employees; and third, optimizing productivity and efficiency. These investments are designed in large part to position us to grow over time at leading returns. The successful execution of that strategy has been an important contributor to our strong results providing us with the financial resources that enable us to continue investing at scale, which we believe will increasingly be a differentiator in this industry. It's a virtuous cycle.\nThe data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation illustrates the significant acceleration of our performance since we launched this strategy. We've grown our net written premiums over the past 8 years by more than 70% to over $43 billion. At the same time, we've improved our underlying combined ratio by nearly 7 points. High-quality growth with strong underwriting profitability is a noteworthy achievement in this industry. In lines of business with returns that meet our objectives, growth over time has generally come from a combination of price increases and growth in customers. In lines where the emphasis has been on improving returns, premium growth has been driven by higher pricing.\nIn addition, our growth has largely been organic from products in which we have deep expertise to distribution partners with whom we have long-standing relationships, and in geographies where we have a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and other market dynamics. In other words, a relatively low-risk growth strategy. Through our focus on productivity and efficiency, we've also meaningfully improved our operating leverage over this time. We've allocated some of that benefit to investments in strategic priorities.\nAs you can see on Slide 21. Since 2017, we've more than doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over an 8-year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend and improve the strategic mix of the event. In 2017, our strategic investments represented about 1/3 of our tech spend. In 2024, our strategic tech investment approached nearly half of our overall tech spend of more than $1.5 billion. At the same time, our efforts to improve operating leverage also enabled us to lower our expense ratio by more than 3 points or about 10%. The flexibility that operating leverage gives us to allocate the benefit between investment opportunities and the bottom line is a valuable competitive advantage.\nTurning to underwriting. The tremendous strength and relative predictability of our underlying underwriting income has increasingly contributed to our bottom line. Our underlying underwriting income has more than tripled over the last 8 years, reaching $4.5 [ billion ] after tax in 2024. This level of underlying underwriting income positions us to deliver strong income and returns even with the level of outsized natural catastrophes we and the industry experienced in 2024.\nOur growth in underwriting income also contributed to the increase in our cash flow from operations which was $9.1 billion in 2024, our highest level ever and nearly $4 billion more than it was just 5 years ago. Our strong operating cash flow is important. It gives us the ability to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio, which we grew almost $100 billion at year-end, positions us to continue generating a higher level of predictable and reliable net investment income.\nIn summary, we're capitalizing on the successful execution and effective strategy. Our strong results and financial position enable us to be there when our customers need us most, as our friends and neighbors in Los Angeles do right now. The significant momentum we have built gives us great confidence in our ability to continue serving our customers and distribution partners, while delivering for our shareholders. In other words, we remain very confident in the outlook for travelers.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $2.1 billion, and core return on equity was 27.7%, bringing the full year core income to $5 billion and full year core ROE to 17.2%. We once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and we're very pleased with both the total combined ratio of 83.2% and the underlying combined ratio of 84%. The value of premium growth at strong underlying margins is evidenced by the quarter's underlying underwriting income of $1.4 billion after tax, bringing the year-to-date figure to $4.5 billion. That's our first time ever above $4 billion and an increase of nearly 40% from last year's then record level. The reported and underlying combined ratios for both the quarter and the full year were very strong in all 3 segments.\nThe expense ratio for the fourth quarter came in at 28.2%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. The full year expense ratio of 28.5% was in line with our expectations and our guidance throughout the year. Even as the excellent loss ratio resulted in higher supplemental commission expense.\nLooking ahead to 2025, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio at this level for now as the strength of the underlying loss ratio provides continued opportunity to make meaningful investments in both people and technology that we believe will broaden and deepen our competitive advantages well into the future.\nCatastrophe losses in the fourth quarter were a modest $175 million pretax, including a net increase of a little more than $100 million related to re-estimation of prior quarter cats. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $262 million pretax with all 3 segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $147 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in Abuse and Molestation exposure and our runoff book. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $45 million was driven by better-than-expected results in Fidelity and Surety. Personal Insurance had $70 million of net favorable PYD with favorability in both Auto and Homes.\nAfter-tax net investment income of $785 million was up 22% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets, which, as Alan mentioned, is approaching the $100 billion mark. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2025, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $3 billion after tax, beginning with $710 million in the first quarter and growing to $790 million in the fourth quarter.\nPage 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long-standing CAT XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events, and we have increased the amount of total coverage for 2025. The [ Borocurren's ] loss deductible was unchanged at $100 million, and we've placed coverage for $3.7 billion of the $4 billion layer above the $4 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have added $150 million of coverage while reducing the total amount of ceded premium for this treaty.\nAlso as part of our January 1 renewals, we enhanced our Casualty Reinsurance Program for 2025. Thanks to the reinsurance market's receptivity to our casualty book, we were able to purchase more coverage at a lower attachment point on a roughly margin-neutral basis. I'd point this out to make you aware that the incremental ceded premium related to the additional coverage will impact the growth rate of consolidated net written premium for full year 2025 by a little less than 0.5 point because the written ceded premium impact all hits business insurance in the first quarter. The impact on net written premium growth in Q1 for the BI segment will be about 4 points or about 2 points on a consolidated basis.\nAnd while we're talking about the 2025 year on a financial modeling note, as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, our pretax catastrophe plan for 2025 is 6.9 combined ratio points. Slide 23 also provides a summary of the seasonality of our CAT losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, second quarter is regularly and noticeably been our largest CAT quarter. We've provided this view of historical data in our year-end packages for a few years now, but we thought it might also be helpful to share our plan view for the coming year by quarter, so you'll find that here as well. Obviously, the 2025 plan figures were put together without knowledge of the January wildfires in California.\nAs you know, the California wildfires that began earlier this month are going to be a material event for the industry and will have a material impact on our first quarter earnings. Because the event is so recent and to some degree, still ongoing, we'd like to take more time to refine our analysis before providing an estimate. Also of interest for 2025, we continue to value our relationship with Fidelis and are pleased to have renewed the 20% quota share with them. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had in place for both 2023 and 2024.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. For the full year, we generated our best ever level of operating cash flow at $9.1 billion. Interest rates increased during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $2.1 billion after tax at September 30, $3.6 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gain losses, was $139.4 at year-end, up 13% from a year ago. We returned $494 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $252 million and dividends of $242 million. We have approximately $5 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nRecapping our results for 2024, core income was just over $5 billion and core ROE was 17.2%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, underwriting income, net investment income, core income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. In short, we're extremely well positioned for 2025 and beyond.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding out a terrific year in terms of financial results execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Segment income for the quarter was nearly $1.2 billion, our highest quarter ever and up about 25% from the prior year quarter which was our previous quarterly high. The improvement from the prior year was broad-based, driven by higher net investment income, higher underlying underwriting income and higher favorable prior year reserve development. The all-in combined ratio of 85.2% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.2%, an all-time quarterly best. The underlying loss ratio improved by more than 0.5 point from the prior year, driven by the benefit of earned pricing. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%.\nTurning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 8% to an all-time fourth quarter high of more than $5.4 billion. Pricing remained strong with renewal premium change of 9.6% driven by a renewal rate change of 6.9%. Retention remained excellent at 85%, a new business of $641 million was the second highest fourth quarter result ever, second only to last year's record fourth quarter.\nWe're pleased with these production results and our ability to sustain strong levels of pricing, reflecting the relative return profiles and environmental trends for each line. Renewal rate increases in Umbrella and Auto were both well into double digits and both up sequentially from the third quarter. Rate increases in CMP NGL remains strong and generally in line with third quarter levels, while the rate increases in property were less than Q3. More specifically on property rate, the moderation continues to be driven by our national property book where returns are very strong after several years of compounding rate and improvements in terms and conditions. Across the book, even with the sustained strong pricing levels, retention remained excellent, as I mentioned earlier, reflecting our strong value proposition and the marketplace's acknowledgment of environmental trends and uncertainty.\nAs for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 12%, up about 1 point from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal rechange of 5.6% ticked up from the third quarter and was up more than 1.5 points from the prior year quarter. As we expected, retention moderated as we continue to intentionally optimize our CMT risk return profile in a couple of targeted geographies. New business was healthy and near historical highs. Overall, we remain pleased with the granular pricing and underwriting execution driving profitable growth in Select. The mix we are achieving through these actions positions us for long-term success.\nIn Middle market, renewal premium change was close to 10%, with renewal rate change of 7.8%, about flat with the third quarter and up about 1 point from the prior year quarter. The rate increases remain broad-based as we achieved positive rate change on almost 80% of our middle market accounts, and the execution was once again excellent with meaningful spread from our best-performing accounts to our lower-performing accounts. Lastly, new business of $357 million was our highest ever fourth quarter, and we're pleased with the risk selection and strength of pricing on the accounts we added to the portfolio.\nAs we close out 2024, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income of more than $3.3 billion, the underlying combined ratio of 88.1% and top line of more than $22 billion were all record results. As for production, renewal premium change in retention both remained historically high while new business premiums reached an all-time best. These results are a direct reflection of our strong value proposition as well as the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies.\nAnd while delivering these exceptional financial and production results, I'm also extremely pleased with our field execution and our broader team's dedication to delivering new tools, insights and product enhancements. We have strengthened our competitive advantages in several key areas. Among other achievements, we have developed a more granular and predictive price to risk models, enhanced submission insights based on quality and appetite, leverage more segmented and responsive loss analytics methodologies and integrated a customer relationship platform with our cutting-edge underwriting workstation. Our financial and operational performance this year was terrific, and our continued focus and investment in strategic capabilities positions us extremely well for long-term profitable growth. We're proud of these results and the best-in-class team that produce them.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended the year with another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $228 million, an excellent combined ratio of 82.7%, and a strong 86.8% underlying combined ratio in the quarter.\nTurning to the top line. We're pleased that we grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we delivered very strong retention of 88%. We're pleased that Corvus transition from an MGA to writing on our high-quality paper drove higher attention relative to Corvus historical experience. Management liability renewal premium change was positive and improved 1 point from the third quarter and new business were consistent with the very strong fourth quarter of 2023.\nTurning to our market-leading surety business. We grew net written premiums by an outstanding 19% from prior year quarter. This growth reflects a robust construction environment, continued strong demand for our Surety products and Services and outstanding execution by our team in growing our high credit quality portfolio. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter in Bond & Specialty Insurance, caring off a year during which we delivered record levels of net written premiums in both our surety and management liability businesses.\nWe're also pleased to have delivered excellent returns while making significant strategic investments in our business, including enhancing our cyber capabilities, upgrading our management liability technology platform and optimizing segmentation and productivity through advanced analytics and AI.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm very pleased to share that Personal Insurance delivered segment income of $798 million and a combined ratio of 80.7% for the fourth quarter of 2024. Both results outpaced last year's strong fourth quarter results. For the full year, PI delivered record segment income of $1.25 billion and a combined ratio of 94.4%, reflecting substantial improvement in the fundamentals of our business.\nNet written premiums grew 7% in the quarter and 8% for the year, bringing full year net written premium to a record of nearly $17.2 billion. In Automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 94.2%. The underlying combined ratio of 96.3% improved 6.4 points compared to the prior year. This improvement was primarily driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing, lower losses resulting from favorable frequency across a number of coverages and sustained moderation in physical damage [indiscernible]. This quarter's underlying results included a 1.5 point benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year.\nFor the full year 2024, the Auto combined ratio of 95% was a considerable improvement compared to the prior year, reflecting the success of our disciplined approach to execution. With another quarter of sustained profitability, we remain focused on growing the Auto book.\nIn Homeowners & Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 67.8% improved 3 points compared to the prior year as an improved underlying combined ratio was partially offset by the impact from higher catastrophes. The underlying combined ratio improved 4.3 points, primarily driven by favorable non-weather losses relative to the prior year, and the continued benefit of earned pricing. This quarter's underlying results included a 2-point benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year.\nStepping back, the 2024 full year property combined ratio of 93.9% was a strong calendar year result. That said, we have more work to do to improve accident year profitability and consistently deliver target returns over time. Our production results reflect our continued focus on generating growth in Auto while improving profitability in property through the execution of a granular state-by-state strategy.\nIn Domestic Automobile retention remained consistent, while renewal premium change of 10.2% continued to moderate as intended, reflective of Auto profitability. We're pleased to note that Auto new business premium increased relative to the prior year quarter, driven by growth in new policies and new business premiums in states that are not constrained by our property actions.\nIn Domestic Homeowners and Other, retention rose slightly to 86% and renewal premium change of 14.1% remained strong and consistent with recent quarters. In 2025, we expect renewal premium change to increase to the high teens as we continue to see rate increases and further increase insured values to ensure they remain aligned with replacement costs. The slight decline in Homeowners policies in force continues to reflect our deliberate efforts to improve profitability and thoughtfully deploy our property capacity.\nTo recap, in 2024, we delivered record net written premiums and segment income. The substantial year-over-year improvement reflects the success of the significant actions we've taken to improve the fundamentals of the business, as well as the moderation of underlying loss trends. At the same time, we continue to invest in and deliver capabilities that will support the profitable growth of our business. Examples include the replatforming of our specialty products, continued advancement of our [ IntelliDrive ] telematics offering, further evolution of our AI-enabled aerial imagery capabilities and modernization of our infrastructure.\nI couldn't be more proud of our team or more grateful to our distribution partners for their hard work and dedication in the face of an environment that continues to test and challenge us and our industry. In particular, I'd like to recognize our claim team who, as we speak, are on the ground in California, supporting our customers in their time of need.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. We are ready to open up for questions now.",

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to have generated a strong bottom line result in the quarter that included a record number of severe convective storms across the United States. Excellent underlying results, favorable net prior year reserve development and higher net investment income contributed to core income of $585 million or $2.51 per diluted share. Underlying income of $1.2 billion pretax or 55% over the prior year quarter. This year's exceptional result was driven by record net earned premiums of $10.2 billion and a continued underlying combined ratio that improved 3.4 points to an excellent 87%. [indiscernible] premiums were higher in all 3 of our business segments.\nThe underlying combined ratio in our Business Insurance segment was an excellent 89.2%, and the underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. Looking at our 2 commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 80.7% for the quarter. Underlying combined ratio in personal insurance improved by nearly 8 points to a terrific 86.3%.\nTurning to the top line. Weaker net written premiums by 8% to $11.1 billion in the quarter. Outstanding execution by our colleagues in the field across all 3 segments contributed to our top line success. We are very pleased to report [ Tribik ] production results in our commercial segments, where as you've heard, margins are attractive. In business insurance, rent net written premiums [indiscernible] by 7% to more than $5.5 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.1%, while retention remained high at 85%. The combination strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined.\nNew business increased 9% to a record $732 million, a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 8% to more than $1 billion, driven by very strong retention of 90% in our high-quality management liability business and excellent production in our market-leading surety business, where we grew net written premiums by 11%. At year-end 2023, we shared that across our 2 commercial segments, our E&S writings had reached $2.5 billion for the year, double the level from 2021.\nYear-to-date, we've grown E&S net written premiums by 16%. The margins continue to be quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, continued strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premiums, with growth of 10% in auto and 8% in home. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $727 million, driven by strong and reliable terms from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our nonfixed income portfolio.\nOur investment results benefit from the strong cash flow we've generated over a sustained period. This quarter marks the seventh consecutive quarter in which we've generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow. This is the measure that we as the industry talk a lot about, but it's important. Cash flow is what enables us to make strategic investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow our investment portfolio. Since 2016, we've invested $11 billion in important technology initiatives, returned more than $20 billion of excess capital to our shareholders and growing our investment portfolio by more than $25 billion.\nIt's a virtuous cycle as well conceived and executed strategic initiatives and effective capital management strategy and a thoughtful investment strategy contribute to attractive returns and growth in adjusted book value per share. Strong underwriting is the flywheel that sets it all in motion. Thanks to exceptional franchise value and excellent marketplace execution, we've profitably grown our premium base from about $25 billion in 2016 to more than $40 billion today. Our growth over this period of time has been largely organic, selling products in which we have deep expertise through distribution partners with whom we have long-standing relationships, and in geographies where we have a thorough understanding of the regulatory environment and other market dynamics.\nIn other words, our competitive advantages have enabled us to effectively execute a relatively low-risk growth strategy. The success of that strategy is evidenced by a return on equity that has averaged about 900 basis points over the 10-year treasury over that period and industry low volatility. But all this boils down to is steady consistent growth in adjusted book value per share after making important investments in our business and returning substantial excess capital to shareholders.\nAnd as a leader in the U.S. P&C market with broad product capability, demonstrated success with innovation and plenty of market share headroom, we're confident there's a lot more opportunity in front of us. To sum it up, we continue to be very confident in the outlook for our business. Our results for the first half of the year include strong premium growth, an excellent bottom line result, record operating cash flow and steadily rising investment returns in our growing fixed income portfolio. With the strong and diversified business and balance sheet, we delivered 13.6% core return on equity over the last 12 months despite substantial industry-wide catastrophe losses. With this momentum, we remain well positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an underlying combined ratio of 87.7%, a 340 basis point improvement from last year's strong [indiscernible] in the third consecutive quarter below 88%.\nThis led to 1 of our strongest ever underlying underwriting gains of $952 million after tax, up $337 million or 55% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the second quarter was 28.8%, and in line with our expectations and once again benefit from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. We continue to expect 2024s full year expense ratio to be 28% to 28.5%. As Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active [ cat ] quarter. In our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pretax catastrophe losses driven by a record number of severe convective storms. As disclosed in the significant events table in our 10-Q, we had 5 events surpassed the $100 million mark in Q2, all in the month of May.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $230 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $34 million resulted from approximately $300 million of better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years, largely offset by about $250 million of strengthening and general liability driven by umbrella for accident years [ 2020]. In terms of the umbrella line, these are very young accident years made up almost entirely of IBNR.\nWhile we will obviously continue to evaluate loss activity as it comes in, we believe we have been proactive and decisive in addressing the latest observed loss activity and adjusting our view of loss development factors to allow for the prospect of rising settlement costs and lengthening settlement patterns. Importantly, our picks for accident years 2015 through 2020 did not require much adjustment in the first half of this year. It's also worth noting that our returns in the umbrella line for the impacted accident years remain attractive. As we saw 5 years ago, when we were the first to call out a change in loss levels tied to an increase in attorney rep rates, sharpening our view of loss costs early in the developed lines positions us to enhance our risk selection, pricing and claims strategies, ultimately setting us up to outperform in terms of growth and profitability.\nAnd on a related note, with court backlogs from the COVID shutdown now largely resolved, that element of uncertainty is, to a large degree, behind us. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD was $24 million pretax. Personal Insurance had significant net favorable PYD of $172 million [indiscernible] with good news from recent accident years in both home and auto.\nAfter tax net income of $727 million increased by 22% from the prior year quarter. As expected, fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and higher invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also up from the prior year quarter. Our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities has increased slightly. We now expect approximately $675 million after tax in the third quarter and $695 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30 are still above the yields embedded in the portfolio. So fixed income NII should continue to improve beyond 2024 as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Interest rates increased in the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased modestly, from $3.7 billion after tax at March 31 to $4 billion after tax at June 30. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $126.52 at quarter end, up 3% from year-end and up 10% from a year ago.\nWe've written $498 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $253 million and dividends of $245 million. We have approximately $5.5 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorism from our Board of Directors. Turning to reinsurance. Page 19 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1 reinsurance placements. We increased coverage when we renewed our Northeast property CAT XOL treaty, which now provides $1 billion of coverage above the attachment point of $2.75 billion. A year ago, we purchased $850 million of coverage and the attachment point was $2.5 billion. We also renewed the Personal Insurance Hurricane CAT excess of loss treaty for coastal exposure, which continues to provide 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $2 billion.\nRecapping our results. Q2 was another quarter of strong premium growth, excellent underwriting -- underlying underwriting profitability and continued growth in net investment income, all of which bode well for our future returns. Our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pretax CAT losses and still deliver $585 million of core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our diversified franchise and the fundamentals of our business.\nTo give a little more color on that. Underlying underwriting income has become an increasingly reliable and important component of our earnings power. Going back to the combination of Travelers in St. Paul, from 2005 through 2019, annual underlying underwriting income averaged $1.2 billion after tax. Our focus on profitable premium growth, which began accelerating around 2016, resulted in underlying underwriting income surpassing $2 billion for the first time ever in 2020, and we stayed above $2 billion through 2022. We then surpassed $3 billion in 2023 through the first half of 2024, and Underlying underwriting income of just over $1.9 billion is up by 32% compared to the first half of 2023.\nIn short, underlying underwriting income has become a significant and growing contributor to our ability to continue generating industry-leading returns with industry low volatility. And now for more color on each segment results, I'll turn the call over to Greg to begin with a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter in terms of both and bottom line results. Segment income was $656 million, up more than [ 60 ]% from the prior year quarter, driven by prior year reserve development, higher net investment income and higher underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2%, our best second quarter result ever. For modeling purposes, property losses for this quarter were about 1 point favorable to our expectations. Net written premiums increased 7% to an all-time second quarter high of more than $5.5 billion.\nRenewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1%. With renewal rate change of [ 6.5 ]%, driving the majority of the strong pricing. Retention remained excellent at 85% and new business was up 9% to a record quarterly high of $732 million. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change which was double digits for the fifth quarter in a row. The strong pricing was broad-based with renewal premium change in every line other than workers' comp at or pretty close to double digit. In terms of pure renewal rate change, we're pleased that the exceptional granular execution by our field organization reflects and appropriately balances the current return profile and environmental trends for each line.\nIn terms of sequential rate movement from the first quarter, CMP, auto, umbrella and workers' comp all increased. Umbrella and auto led the way with double-digit rate increases. Renewal rate change in our property line moderated, driven the National Property business, reflecting strong returns after several years of substantial compounding improvements in terms and conditions. Even with these strong pricing levels, retention was improved or flat in every line other than property. Where some large accounts in our National Property business, in particular, traded away to the subscription market this quarter on terms we weren't willing to accept. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was exceptionally high at 12.3%, with a renewal rate change of 5.3%, up 1.5 points from the first quarter and more than 2 points from the second quarter of last year.\nRetention remained healthy, but ticked down a bit from recent periods to 83% as we begin to purposely optimize our risk return profile in a [indiscernible] targeted geographies and classes. New business remains strong and increased 8% from the prior year quarter. We're pleased with the impact that our production, product and platform initiatives are having in the marketplace and building a high-quality mix of business and driving profitable growth in this market.\nIn middle market, renewal premium change remained strong and consistent with recent levels at almost 10%. Renewal rechange of 7% was up more than 1 point from the second quarter of last year, and that has now been at or around the 7% mark for the fourth consecutive quarter. Retention also remained strong at 89%, a new business of $383 million was the highest ever second quarter result. Lastly, pressure off my most recent round of field visits, I couldn't be more pleased with our team's execution, ideation, energy and enthusiastic adoption of the tools and capabilities that have come from the strategic investments we've been making.\nAnd our distribution partners were once again crystal clear about our team's value and shared many examples of how our local teams the best of business distinguish themselves. These trips continue to highlight for me the value of our high performant in training curriculum as well as the dividends we are receiving from our investments to be the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\n[indiscernible]. Bond & Specialty posted another strong quarter on both the top and bottom lines. We generated segment income of $170 million and a strong combined ratio of 87.7%. The underlying combined ratio improved 1.7 points to a very strong 86.1%. The underlying loss ratio improved 4.1 points to an excellent 46.4%, reflecting the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the prior year quarter from a small number of surety accounts. As we discussed last quarter, the expense ratio is modestly elevated primarily due to the [ Corvus ] acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for a few more quarters as we integrate the operation and as premiums from Corvus' attractive book of business ramp up and earn in.\nTurning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 8% in the quarter to a record high. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered extra retention of 90% with positive renewal premium change that is generally consistent with recent quarters. We're pleased that we grew new business by nearly 60% from the prior year quarter to a record $111 million, driven by Corvus.\nAs a reminder, all of Corvus production will continue to be reflected in new business through next quarter. We grew net written premiums in our leading surety business by a terrific 11% in the quarter reflecting a robust construction environment and continued strong demand for our surety products and services. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance and excellent underlying underwriting results and strong net favorable prior year reserve development drove a significantly improved bottom line results relative to the prior year quarter despite another period of elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 86.3% reflects nearly an 8-point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and Homeowners & Other. Continued strong price increases in both auto and home drove 9% growth in net written premiums.\nIn auto, we're pleased with another quarter of improvement ability and with the underwriting underlying fundamentals of the business. The second quarter combined ratio of 97.9% improved more than 10 points compared to the prior year quarter. due to a lower on combined ratio as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio improved more than 8 points, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing and, to a lesser extent, lower losses from physical damage coverages. For modeling purposes, we view roughly 2.5 points of the improvement in the quarter as nonrecurring.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio improved over 16 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio as well as higher favorable prior year development. While catastrophe lost dollars were similar to the prior year quarter, they had a smaller combined ratio impact as price increases continue to benefit earnings premiums. Catastrophe losses this quarter, primarily resulting from severe convective storms, again, significantly exceeded long-term industry averages. The 28 PCS designated CAT events were the most ever for a second quarter, and 150% of the historical 10-year average.\nOur catastrophe losses in the quarter were consistent with our market share. And for context, our average annual CAT losses over the last 5 and 10 years remain below our market share. This most recent experience will, of course, be reflected in our models going forward, and we will continue to weigh our recent experience more heavily in our ongoing process of optimizing our exposure, underwriting and pricing. The underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved [ 7.6 ] points due in large part to lower-than-expected fire and nonweather water losses as well as the benefit of earned pricing. For modeling purposes, we expect approximately 5 points of the improvement in the homeowners and other underlying combined ratio to be nonrecurring.\nTurning to production. Our results reflect the ongoing execution of our dealers state-by-state strategy as we balance profitability and growth across the portfolio. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remains strong. Renewal premium change of 15.8% continued to moderate as anticipated. The auto renewal premium change will continue to gradually decline, reflecting the improved profitability on the line. While new business premiums were higher than the prior year quarter in many states, new business premium in aggregate was down slightly relative to the second quarter of last year.\nThis is the result of our continuing efforts to manage auto profitability in a few remaining challenged states, as cross-line impact resulting from some of our property actions, particularly in high-risk CAT areas. Production results in homeowners and other reflect our focus to manage growth while improving profitability. Renewal premium change increased sequentially to 15.1%, reflecting higher rate change, while retention remained strong at 85%. We expect renewal premiums to remain at this level through year-end. As we intended, new business and policies in force declined, reflecting our efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity.\nTo sum up for the Personal Insurance segment overall, we are pleased with our progress as we continue to deliver improved profitability. We're confident that the actions we've taken and continue to take will result in a profitable growing portfolio of personal lines business over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you we're ready to open up Q&A.",

Welcome to the first quarterly results teleconference for travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 17, 2024. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nGood morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2024 results. We released our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at Travelers.com under the Investors section.\n\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO, Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer, and our three segment presidents, Greg Toslowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond and Specialty Insurance, and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation.\n\nOur presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\n\nAlso, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the investor section on our website.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.\n\nWe are very pleased to report excellent top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income was $1.1 billion, or $4.69 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 15.4%. After-tax core income increased by $126 million, despite a $211 million one-time tax benefit in the prior year quarter. On a pre-tax basis, this year's core income was $413 million, or 45% higher year-over-year. Strong core income was driven by record net earned premiums of $10.1 billion, up 14% compared to the prior year period, and an excellent combined ratio of 93.9%. The combined ratio improved 1.5 points, notwithstanding elevated catastrophe activity, primarily in the Central and Eastern regions of the United States.\n\nThe underlying combined ratio improved 2.9 points to an outstanding 87.7%, driven by strong underlying results in each of our three segments. Looking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI-BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88.8% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in personal insurance was 86.1%.\n\nA 6.8 point improvement over the prior year. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well, generating after-tax net investment income of $698 million for the quarter. SEP> Driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and higher returns from our non-fixed income portfolio, our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share. After returning $620 million of excess capital to shareholders, due dividends and share repurchases, and Making Important Investments in Our Business.\n\nNext, we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In recognition of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 5% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.05 per share, marking 20 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period.\n\nTurning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 8% to $10.2 billion in the quarter. All three segments and excellent execution by our colleagues in the field contributed to our top line success. In business insurance, we grew net written premiums by 9% to $5.6 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, while retention remained high.\n\nThe combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and a marketplace that continues to be generally disciplined in the face of persistent headwinds. The segment generated a very strong $691 million of new business in the quarter. This is a reflection of the fact that our customers and distribution partners value the products and services that we offer and the experiences that we provide. In bond and specialty insurance, we grew net written premiums by 6% to $943 million.\n\nThat was driven by strong retention of 90% and record new business in our high quality management liability business, along with excellent production in our market-leading surety business, where net written premiums are up 15%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business sectors. In personal insurance, strong pricing drove 9% growth in net written premium. The real premium change was 16.6% in our auto business and 13.4% in home.\n\nYou'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff, and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share that more than 100 of my Travelers colleagues and I just returned from our Travelers Leadership Conference, or TLC, as we call it.\n\nIt's a multi-day event that we host every year for the principals and senior leaders of our most significant distribution partners. Most of our guests have been coming for years, some for decades. We're also pleased every year to host a number of first-timers. The represented firms are industry leaders and collectively account for more than half of our premium volume. We all returned home with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business partners and their firms are as strong as ever.\n\nWe've confirmed that they remain very supportive of the strategic initiatives that we have underway, and we took away valuable feedback on how we can accomplish even more together. The Independent Agent and Broker Channel remains a robust and growing part of our industry. At Travelers, we proudly partner with more than 15,000 agent-broker firms across their 35,000 locations.\n\nWe're a top three market for the majority of these firms. That's a critical advantage because distributors place a disproportionate amount of their business with their top few carriers. We don't take these relationships for granted.\n\nAs we've shared before, the vision for our innovation agenda includes optimizing our value proposition as an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. We continue to make significant investments to ensure that we realize that vision by offering best-in-class products, services, and experiences. Case in point, in our bond and specialty business, we recently conducted a blind survey of agents and brokers, ours and others, to determine how we ranked on the 10 attributes they identified as most likely to impact their placement decision.\n\nAmong our key competitors, we ranked first or tied for first in each of the 10 categories. We hear over and over again that Travelers' deep specialization across a wide range of modernized, simplified, and tailored products, along with a broad and consistent appetite, are major differentiators for us in the market.\n\nFor example, in business insurance, we offer a wide variety of coverages and product solutions, admitted and ENS across industries representing more than 85% of domestic GDP. Everything from a bought product for a local florist to a package solution for a main street middle market account to law-sensitive workers compensation for a large national account. Across our three business segments, our distribution partners generally don't need to go to multiple carriers to satisfy customers' insurance needs.\n\nAnd the more lines per account we write, the higher the lifetime value of the customer. The primary focus of ours has been digitizing the value chain, in part to create value and provide great experiences for agents and brokers, and in part to create efficiencies for them and for us. I'll share a few examples.\n\nIn business insurance, we believe we were the first to offer agents and brokers a comprehensive portfolio loss data exchange, which allows us to digitally transfer to a small commercial or middle market distributor loss information on their entire book with us. This capability enables our distribution Partners to efficiently develop important insights into their books of business and supports their marketing efforts. In our middle market business, we believe we were the first carrier to offer multiline digital submission capability. In our small commercial business, agents can transact with us through APIs or through our new quote issue platform Travis, which has reduced quoting time by 25% for our leading bot product.\n\nAcross business insurance, nearly all of our largest distributors are currently leveraging one or more of our digital capabilities. In personal insurance, earlier this year, we added our proprietary aerial image reviewer to our agent portal. This advanced capability integrates a high-resolution, over-time photo series of a home into the AgentsQuoting workflow.\n\nThis gives our partners a bird's eye view, helping them to better understand a customer's or prospect's insurance needs and how they may have evolved. We bring our franchise value directly to agents and brokers through distribution, underwriting, sales, and claim professionals in more than 80 local offices. Through our expansive and empowered field organization, we foster deep relationships with our partners and are well positioned to deliver the strength and expertise of travelers at the local level. We're also investing in our distribution partners' workforce by providing education and training programs to their up-and-coming producers. Our flagship Travelers Agency Leadership Program and Agency Producer School provide in-person training to invited participants.\n\nWe also offer larger, larger virtual programs that have trained thousands of producers, including more than 3,000 just last year. We remain deeply committed to our vision of being the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner to our agents and brokers. Our pole position with leading distributors is a significant competitive advantage and one that's hard to replicate.\n\nTo sum it up, the year is off to a terrific start with strong profitability and production in all three sectors, as well as higher investment income. In short, we're firing on all cylinders. We also continue to invest in important strategic initiatives. We have demonstrated success in executing our innovation strategy, which has contributed to superior returns with industry-low volatility, growth in our premium base, and higher adjusted book value per share. With this momentum and the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success this year and beyond. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan. Thank you, Alan.\n\nCore income for the first quarter increased by 13% to $1.1 billion, and core return on equity was 15.4%. The growth in core income was driven by higher net investment income and despite the one-time tax benefit in the prior year that Alan mentioned. Higher Underlying Underwriting Income, partially offset by a higher level of catastrophe losses. Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $1.2 billion was up 50% from the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio that improved by 2.9 points to 87.7%.\n\nThe underlying combined ratio was among our best ever, featuring continued strong results in both business insurance and bond and specialty, complemented by a strong result in personal insurance. Reflecting another quarter of significant improvement, we were pleased with the first quarter expense ratio of 28.7%, which was flat year over year despite the impact of Corvus, for which we had a full quarter of expenses but very little earned premium as there was no unearned premium carried in from the closing of the transaction on January 2nd. For the full year, we remain comfortable with an expense ratio expectation of 28 to 28.5%.\n\nWe reported a net favorable prior year reserve development of $91 million pre-tax in the first quarter. There was no net prior year reserve change in business insurance, as favorable development and workers' comp of nearly $100 million was largely offset by modest increases for liability coverages in recent accident years, along with modest charges in our runoff book, and Bond & Specialty, a net favorable PYD of $24 million pre-tax was driven by better than expected results across multiple lines. Personal insurance recorded a net favorable PYD of $67 million pre-tax, with improvements in both auto and home.\n\nAfter tax net investment income increased 25% from the prior year quarter to $698 million. Fixed income NII was higher than in the prior year quarter and in line with our expectations, benefiting from both higher levels, higher yields, and a higher level of invested assets. The returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were also up from last year's quarter. Our updated outlook for fixed-income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, is $640 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $665 million in the third quarter, and then to around $690 million in the fourth quarter.\n\nRegarding income taxes in the first quarter, recall that last year's quarter included a one-time tax benefit of $211 million related to the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847. And that's the main reason you see a higher effective tax rate in this year's quarter.\n\nTurning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates increased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.1 billion after tax at year-end to $3.7 billion after tax on March 31st. However, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio.\n\nWe generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high, and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus, or regulatory capital requirements.\n\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $125.53 at quarter end, up 2% from year end and up 8% from a year ago. Share repurchases this quarter included $250 million of open market repurchases. We had an additional $138 million of buybacks in connection with employee share-based compensation. We have approximately $5.8 billion remaining under prior board authorizations for share repurchases. Dividends were $232 million in the quarter.\n\nAnd, as Alan mentioned earlier, our board authorized a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1.05 per share. In summary... The quarter's strong results once again demonstrate the significant earnings power of our ability to grow premiums across our well-diversified book of business while maintaining very attractive margins, along with steadily increasing net investment income from our growing fixed income portfolio. And with that, I'm going to call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nAs you know, business insurance continues to deliver exceptional results with a strong first quarter of 2024 in terms of both the top and bottom lines. Segment income of $764 million was up from the first quarter of 2023, driven by higher net investment income and higher pre-tax underlying underwriting income. We're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's exceptionally strong underlying combined ratio of 89.2%, among our best ever. Net written premiums increased 9% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.6 billion.\n\nRenewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.6%, with renewal rate change of 7%, driving most of the strong prices. Retention remained excellent at 86%, and new business of $691 million was an all-time first quarter high. Let me give you a little more texture on the continued strong pricing environment. Renewal rate change remained high, coming in at 7% or higher for the fourth quarter in a row. It was also up almost two and a half points from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIn our select and core middle market businesses, renewal rate change in our national property book was strong and in the double digits, but down a couple points sequentially. That's an appropriate result threading the needle between healthy returns in the business and continued weather volatility. From a line perspective, Umbrella, Property, and Auto led the way, all with renewal rate changes and are very close to double digits.\n\nRenewal rate change was higher compared to the preceding and prior year quarters in GL, Umbrella, Auto, and CMP. In workers' comp, renewal rate change was about half a point more than negative than the preceding and prior year quarter. With continued healthy exposure, renewal premium change in comp continues to be positive in the low single digits, again, an appropriate result given the strong results in the line.\n\nRetention remains healthy across the board. We're pleased with our production results, the exceptional granular execution by our field organization, and the resulting growth in top line and attractive margin. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remains strong at 10.4% with a renewal rate change of 4%, consistent with the fourth quarter and up more than two points from the first quarter of 2023. Retention also remains strong at 84%, while new business increased 22% from the prior year quarter to $156 million.\n\nWe're driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product, but we're also encouraged by the impact we're seeing from Travis, our new front-end rate, quote, and issue interface platform that Alan mentioned. In the middle market, the renewal premium change was 10%, with a renewal rate change of 7%, consistent with the strong fourth quarter result and up close to three points from the prior year quarter. Your attention remains strong at 87%. To sum up, business insurance had a great start to the year.\n\nWe continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nFondant Specialty started the year with another quarter of strong returns and our 29th consecutive quarter of profitable net written premium growth. Segment income was $195 million, driven by strong earned premiums and a combined ratio of 84.5%. Underneath the combined ratio, the underlying loss ratio improved 2.7 points to an excellent 46.4%. As Dan mentioned, the expense ratio was elevated compared to recent periods, primarily due to the Corvus acquisition. We expect that to continue to be the case for the next several quarters as we integrate and earn profits from Corvus' business.\n\nTurning to the top line, we grew net written premiums by 6% in the quarter. In our high quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, with a slightly higher sequential renewal premium change. We grew new business by 34% from the prior year quarter to a record $91 million, driven by Corvus production. As a reminder, we are in the midst of transitioning Corvus's $200 million profitable book of business onto Travelers paper, which will continue to be reflected in our new business production in the coming quarter.\n\nNet written premiums in our market-leading surety business grew a terrific 15%, reflecting continued strong demand for our surety. So we're pleased to have once again delivered strong top and bottom line results this quarter. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike.\n\nThanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report personal insurance generated first quarter segment income of $220 million in a combined ratio of 96.9%, both of which are significantly improved relative to the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 86.1% reflects a 6.8 point improvement compared to the prior year quarter, driven by higher earned pricing in both automobile and homeowners and other. Net written premiums grew 9% as a result of continued price increases in both auto and home.\n\nIn Automobile, the first quarter combined ratio of 94.6% improved 10 points compared to the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower underlying combined ratio, as well as favorable prior year development. The underlying combined ratio of 94.9% improved 8.5 points compared to the prior year, driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. At the same time, vehicle severity trends moderated, and the quarter also included a modest frequency benefit from the mild winter. As a brief reminder, the first quarter underlying combined ratio is typically our seasonally lowest in Ottawa. We are very pleased with the trajectory of auto profitability. In homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.1% was impacted by higher catastrophe losses.\n\nReflecting an active quarter with 19 PCS designated events for the industry, more than 50% higher than the long-term average, the underlying combined ratio of 77.6% improved 5 points, primarily driven by the impact of earned pricing. Turning to production, our results demonstrate continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate measures to balance profitability and growth. In domestic automobile, retention of 82% remained strong, and renewal premium change of 16.6% was consistent with our expectations.\n\nGiven the improving profitability of our book, we continue to expect renewal premium changes to moderate throughout 2024. New business premium was consistent with the prior year quarter. Underneath this headline number, new business volumes grew in states where we have achieved written rate adequacy. In homeowners, and other, retention of 84% remained strong and was consistent with recent quarters. Renewal premium change of 13.4% reflected higher renewal rate changes and was consistent with our expectations as we have largely closed the gap in insurance to value.\n\nWe expect renewal premium change to remain at these levels throughout 2024, as we continue to seek rates in response to elevated loss costs. The declines in homeowners' new business and policies in force reflect our ongoing efforts to thoughtfully deploy capacity as we continue to manage rate adequacy, catastrophe risk, and regulatory risk.\n\nThe personal insurance team has made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business, while sustaining investments in key capabilities for the future. We're moving closer to our goal of delivering target returns. Auto profitability continues to improve. We have reached written rate adequacy in all but a few states and are continuing to temper non-rate actions accordingly.\n\nFor homeowners, we remain focused on managing growth while improving profitability. At the same time, we're delivering key strategic capabilities. In February, we completed two noteworthy product launches, Quantum Boat 2.0 in the U.S. and Optima Home in Canada. Quantum Boat 2.0 delivers a better agent and customer experience with improved segmentation and strengthens our position as a provider of total account solutions, building on the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 and Quantum Home 2.0\n\nOptima Home is an extension of our market-leading Quantum Home 2.0 property product, enabling us to deliver a more robust total account solution in the Canadian market. Both product launches mark further progress on our journey to modernize our products and platforms, making us an even more compelling choice for customers and distributors. To sum it up, I'm very pleased with a positive start to the year in personal insurance and grateful to our team. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nThank you. We're ready to open up for questions.\n\nThank you. If you would like to ask a question, simply press star 1 on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press star 1 again. Please ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking your question. Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden of Evercore. Your line is open.\n\nHi, thanks. Good morning.\n\nI had a question just on the more recent accident year reserve increases in business insurance and some of those liability lines that Dan was highlighting. I'm wondering, is there any more detail you can provide here with regard to specific accident years? It sounded like GL and also, I don't think you guys are alone in seeing some negative on these years, but I think everyone had thought that these were better priced years relative to 19 and prior. So could you just talk about what exactly is the disconnect here and why there's some negative coming on those years? Hey David, it's Dan.\n\nHey David, it's Dan. Sure, so I'll take that. So yeah, by more recent than accident years, you know, we're not talking about 15 through 19. We're talking about years more recent than that. I guess the thing I'll reiterate from my comments is that we're talking about some pretty small movements here. So we had some adverse in those recent accident year liability lines. We also had some modest charges in the runoff book. I think what we're doing here, David, is trying to... be reactive to all the information we're seeing those recent accident years in the liability lines, which tend to take longer to develop and are beyond the books for a while are more leveraged to IBNR.\n\nWe're just trying to get some more IBNR into those lines to recognize that I'm sorry. David, the other thing I'd add is that there are not any significant new developments here. These are generally the same trends we've been talking about for a long time, a little more of the same. And again, to reiterate Dan's comment, when you look at the overall reserves we have for these lines, these are very small adjustments.\n\nGot it. Okay, that's helpful.\n\nAnd then maybe just switching gears to the personal auto business. Michael, I think you had mentioned that there was maybe some benefit just from mild frequency given a warmer than typical first quarter. Is there any way you could size that just to help us think about the sustainability of the improvement in the auto business? Yeah, sure, David. I think mild frequency\n\nYeah, sure, David. I think the mild frequency impact on the underlying combined ratio was a little less than a point.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning, everyone. So for the first question, I'll focus on the business insurance segment. In the comments and in the stats, I think there's been 7% or higher renewal rate change for four consecutive quarters, and retention seems to be holding up, maybe slipping a little bit. Maybe you could step back and give us some context about or texture, I think is the word you used, about the competitive environment. Curious, you know, given all the rate changes that's coming through, why haven't we seen more aggressive actions on behalf of some of the competitors yet? Or maybe it's that they're still reconciling previous year's results as well. I don't know. There would be just some color there. Good morning, Greg. It's Alan.\n\nHey, good morning. Greg, it's Alan. I'll start and then turn it over to Greg.\n\nIt's hard for us to comment on competitors, but we do think that in the pricing we've been able to achieve with these retentions, you do see a reflection of the competitive environment. And I'd say that, you know, everybody is. Well, what we would speculate is that everybody's reacting to the same things that we're reacting to. I mean, there are returns in a much better place after, you know, years of pricing and improvements in terms of conditions.\n\nBut there are some headwinds and some uncertainty out there. And it's, you know, all the things we've talked about. There's social inflation, economic inflation, a tight labor market, weather. Geopolitics, I think, puts a certain lens over the way we all see the world. And so I suspect what you have is a marketplace that's reacting to an overall level of risk and uncertainty.\n\nOkay, I guess I'll pivot then. You know, if you look at the proxy statement, I know ROE targets are a very important metric for y'all. I think the target was 12.8% for 23, up from 11.6% from 22. Can you talk about how you're looking at the ROE targets for the company for 24, please? Yeah, I don't think we're going to share that target.\n\nYeah, I don't think we're going to share that target. It gets, you know, competitively sensitive and close to pricing. But I will say we think about that, in terms of the overall outlook for business, we think about the rate at which the interest rate environment is earning into the fixed income portfolio, which turns over on a lag basis. And we think about really what we want to achieve as a margin over both the 10-year treasury and our cost of equity. So those are the things we think about as we put the plan together. Do you see anything else I'm missing there? No, you have got it all.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nHi, thanks. My first question is about personal auto. I think you guys said that, you know, Q1 is seasonally the lowest combined ratio quarter, but you still have a good amount of rate earnings in the book. So shouldn't that obscure some of the seasonality, or would you expect, you know, Q1 to be better from a combined ratio perspective on the underlying side relative to the other three quarters of the year, even knowing you have rate earnings to earn?\n\nSure, Elyse, it's Michael. So just taking a step back and talking about cars, the seasonality comment is a long-term average comment. Typically, Q1 is roughly three points lower than the overall combined ratio for the year. But that's, again, a long-term average and largely an all-else equal environment. So that three points doesn't adjust for earned effective pricing potentially having an impact in the back half of the year. And so you have to make an adjustment for that, no question. But again, I would just take a step back and maybe put a little more color around my response to David as well, right?\n\nSo the mild winter weather benefit we would view as, you know, sort of a one-off in the quarter that we wouldn't expect to continue. We don't see any reason to assume that it would have been adjusted for that. That seasonality is any different today than it was historically. And at the end of the day, you know, to the premise of your question, earned effective pricing is far and away the biggest driver of the improvement in the quarter. And, And there's more of that to come going forward.\n\nAnd then my second question, I wanted to go back to the liability reserve increase in the quarter. Can you give us a sense, you know, if there were some additions, I know the numbers are modest, like you guys said, for accident year 2023. And then, you know, given the additions you see here, are you adjusting your longer trend, long-term loss trend assumption for the liability lines?\n\nSo, Elyse, it's Dan. I'll start with the PYD piece and avoid the temptation of splitting what is a small number to begin with into its individual accident years. So we're not going to do that. But I do think if you look at the results in business insurance, you know, we talked about the fact that you saw some improvement in the underlying combined ratio, including in the underlying loss ratio. You have the benefit of pricing, and a couple of other things like mix, which we talked about last quarter.\n\nAt the same time, like in any quarter, you've got some puts and takes, and one of those puts and takes in this quarter is booking a little bit more IBNR in the current accident year to reflect some of the uncertainty that we're seeing. Not big numbers, but we are reacting.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nYeah, thanks. First one from Michael. Michael, I'm just curious, you know, one of your competitors in the personal auto space is showing some pretty strong growth in policies and forth, really kind of capitalizing on the market. I'm just curious, are you in a position at this point to kind of go after and get some growth given how your results have improved so much?\n\nSure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Certainly, you know, again, underneath the results in the quarter, if you look at it on a state by state basis, the states where we have achieved written adequacy, we did achieve new business premium growth. And consistent with our comments last quarter, what I would say to you is we're executing a very granular state by state, geography by geography strategy as we look to temper some of the non-rate actions that we had in place in auto. And if you take a step back, you know, if you look at it over the last couple of years, we have had a small increase in policies enforcing auto over the last couple of All the while, premiums are up 30 plus percent.\n\nSo we feel pretty good about the starting point. And, you know, directly to your question, our focus in auto is on profitably growing auto on a go forward basis. Our focus on home remains on improving profitability. And so that's why we talk about sort of balancing profitability and growth across the whole portfolio.\n\nThanks. And then I will follow-up on the business insurance.\n\nAlan and Greg, I wonder if you could kind of dissect the competitive landscape, kind of large, middle, small. Are any of them kind of incrementally more competitive? It feels like the small-middle seems to be a little more stable right now than maybe the large from what we're hearing in the marketplace.\n\nYeah, Brian, let me just comment. I'll turn to Greg.\n\nI think all of these markets are always competitive all the time. And that's sort of the way we think about it. So I'm not sure. I mean, yes, as Greg shared in his prepared remarks, you know, to the extent that you're thinking about whether the renewal price change is a proxy for competition. And I don't think it is, by the way.\n\nUm, that did come down a couple of points, but again, still among our highest rate achieved in any line and, you know, double digits and a reflection of, you know, terrific returns in the line. So I don't think there's been any sea change in or any significant shift among those businesses. I'd said competitive business that we have. I don't know, Greg, what?\n\nYeah, maybe I'll touch on new business since Alan just hit on rate. And, um, you can see on new business, we had a real strong quarter in small commercial, up 22%. So we are seeing a little more dislocation in that market than we are in the middle market. But the combination of our new segmented products, BOP 2.0, and our new commercial automobile product, we feel terrific about, you know, our position there and where we're writing that new business and at what returns we're going to achieve there.\n\nUm, the middle market still had, you know, the Delta wasn't as big on new business, but we had a record result in the first quarter of the prior year, so really strong new business levels. So not as much dislocation, Brian, in the middle market, but really feeling good about the combination of where the returns are and our field team staying really active on the new business front.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning.\n\nI just had a couple on exposure acting as a rate. Um, so yeah, exposure activeness rates clearly have been a pale wind, in particular for margins. It's been flagged, you know, for the past couple years, especially in the workers comp line. But this is the first quarter in a long time, and I think I've seen workers' comp, NPW, shrink year over year. So curious sort of, you know, what dynamic might be going on there? Yeah.\n\nYeah, good morning, Ryan. How are you doing? This is Greg.\n\nYeah, exposure, you know, continues to be strong, down somewhat, as you look at the business. It's not a surprise to us, as the Fed has been very active in curtailing inflation. So definitely, we're seeing some of that in workers comp, but the primary driver of the decline in comp is, you know, we do still have rate reductions, as I shared in my prepared comments relative to the other products. And as we're in account solution, you know, we're going to remain very active and disciplined with our underwriting. And as we invoke both of those dynamics in the business, that's what drove the overall net written premium change in the comp line.\n\nAnd I guess if I look at the overall exposure still positive across the book, so clearly something else is picking that up on the property side. Are you guys still getting positive exposure adjustments from, like, insured value adjustments? Or is that really just kind of a 2023 type of thing that's already happening?\n\nYeah, as you can imagine, it's somewhat linear with inflation, Ryan. So, at 23, we had some record results of trying to keep up with replacement costs and building materials. So it's down somewhat from 23, but still up overall. Ryan is a macrocom\n\nRyan, as a macro comment, if you look at that exposure, it's easy to get very focused on recent periods, but if you look at that number over time, it's a pretty healthy number that I think is consistent with what is today a pretty healthy economy.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nGreat, thanks. If I can stick with property for a second. Last year, when we tracked renewal pricing changes, it sort of peaked in the second and third quarters, and I'm wondering whether there's a seasonal element to that, or we should just sort of follow that curve to anticipate smaller rate increases because of the reduced indicated need over the course of 2024.\n\nMark, yeah, there really isn't a seasonal element in pricing overall, you know, our field underwriters are going to look at the exposure at hand, and the renewal book will change over time as we write incremental new business. And so overall, it's dependent on the exposures that come up for that particular quarter. That's more of a dynamic than any seasonality.\n\nYeah, Mayor, it's Dan. I'll just add it in case your question is not just seasonality of pure price change, but within the property line, there's some seasonality of its mix on a written premium basis. And to your point, and you can see it in the financial supplement, you know, the second and third quarters tend to be relatively higher levels of commercial property compared to what comes up in Q1 and Q4.\n\nOkay, that's very helpful. Thank you.\n\nIf I can switch gears, I wanted to talk a little bit about workers' compensation reserve releases, because based on the statutory numbers, there were like 900 million releases in 2023, and I think you said less than 100 this quarter. So that's slowing down. I was hoping you could maybe break that down either by accident year or the difference between actual claim emergence versus indication.\n\nYeah, Mayor, it stands. So again, I'm going to resist the temptation to do it by accident here. It's multiple accident years in comp, just like it normally is. We're really just going through the same robust and disciplined review process every quarter and comp and in every line. We'll go through the latest data, we'll look at how it might have varied from what our actuarial models would have expected, and we'll do our best to determine the reasons why the actuals varied from expected and book the necessary adjustments accordingly.\n\nAnd the number is just sort of going to be what it's going to be. If you think about this quarter versus last quarter or this quarter versus next quarter in any particular line, Prior Reserve Development might be more, might be less; we'll, we'll wait and see what the data tells us. But it's more of the same in terms of thematically what's coming through. We have continued to make assumptions around what the long-term severity is going to be, and we have assumptions around what the frequency is going to be. The net of those things has been some more good news in the first part of this year.\n\nMerrill, I'll also add that as we consider this, one part of our consideration process as we go through this is to make sure that we're, you know, appropriately reflecting our thoughts about uncertainty. So that's, you know, something to keep in mind.\n\nOkay, so it's very helpful.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of BMO. Your line is open.\n\nHey, great morning.\n\nOn the maybe question on the business insurance segment, you know, when we look at the underlying combined ratio, it's shown a nice trend of, I guess, improvement versus prior years, and that's kind of despite you all kind of topping off IV&R and kind of adding to reserves on recent vintages. And so just curious about that dynamic; how is it that your view of the kind of the underlying has stayed excellent, kind of, and not kind of drifted a bit higher as you've taken some just small actions? Is it, you know, is it, and, you know, is it just... Pricing power has been, you know, you think just much higher than the lost cost trend or any color that would be helpful.\n\nLet me start and I'll turn it over to you, Dan. We understand that sometimes the investment community can get very focused on a couple of metrics as you think about what drives it, but that's really not the way it comes together. It comes together through all the things that impact margins. So if you look at the excellent result this quarter, earned pricing was a significant benefit, favorable mix was a little bit of a benefit, and then there were some small items going the other way that partially offset some of that benefit.\n\nAs Dan mentioned, we booked a little bit more IBNR as a reflection of uncertainty, a little bit of non-cat weather, a little bit of discrete large loss activity, none of those things significant. And as you can tell from the fact that it was an excellent and improving number, but every quarter there are just a bunch of factors that add up and put and takes. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAnd I think the only thing I'd add to that, and I sort of confirm your premise in the question, Mike, is that it's really a very strong pricing environment. If you go back and look at VI commentary over the last year or two, it's one of the reasons we've been so pleased to see retention remain as strong as it has, because we love the profile of the book, and we're trying to... So we're happy to be retaining them, happy to get pricing on top of it. And that's improving margins. And then in any quarter, you know, it's going to be impacted by some of the things that Alan just mentioned.\n\nOkay, that's helpful. My last follow-up is maybe more on homeowners' personal lines. You know, given the, you know, what seems like a continued trend of higher capacity losses, any changes you're seeing in the industry or the travelers trying to implement on terms and conditions, such as roof replacement? Are there any trends there we should be thinking about? Thanks.\n\nSure, Mike, it's Michael. Absolutely. I think if you, you know, if you dig underneath our comments around non-rate actions, there's a variety of things that we're executing on, and many of which we're seeing across the industry. And examples include, first of all, eligibility, right, based on an evaluation of the exposure, as well as eligibility on the age of the roof, and underwriting restrictions around things like roof condition and tree overhang. Our primary approach to this sort of risk sharing, if you will, is really to focus on AOP and wind hail tornado deductibles.\n\nWe've implemented higher wind hail tornado deductibles in virtually every severe convective storm-exposed state across the country. I think the last count was up to, I think, 21 states where we've increased the deductible to help to deal with the exposure. And then, you know, managing distribution and managing appetite to manage aggregation of exposure, you know, within a local or state by state geography. So really, those are some examples of the variety of actions taken from a non-rights perspective, which is really what we're referring to when we talk about managing growth and improving profitability and property. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\n\nSure, great, great question. And certainly something that we spend time evaluating. What I would say is, certainly reforms in Florida, and some of the depopulation of citizens in Florida are certainly things that make Florida look better than it has in the past, but it is still a highly-exposed geography. It is still a place where we think the risk reward is not in balance. And one of the things, frankly, in Florida that remains a significant concern is the potential assigned risk obligation in the event of a significant catastrophe.\n\nAnd so, and I think Alan has referred to this in the past, we see, you know, signs of improvement in the state, but it is going to take more than what we have seen. And one of the things that it causes you to think about is whether or not you can compete in Florida on an admitted basis versus an excess and surplus lines basis. So those are all some of the considerations in Florida.\n\nThe upshot for us is while we do see those signs of improvement, we haven't seen enough change to cause us to change our perspective on wanting to, you know, reopen for new business and property in Florida. Yeah, the TOR reforms that they enacted were an excellent start. We certainly would like other states to follow suit.\n\nYeah, the TOR reforms that they enacted were an excellent start. We'd certainly love other states to follow suit because we think regulatory reform is important as it relates to affordability, not just of insurance but of home ownership and autos. But there are some other structural things in the state that just make it difficult at the moment. We'll continue to reevaluate it.\n\nSure, Michael. I would say that, you know, in Q1, it's, you know, first of all, bodily injury is where most attorney involvement occurs. And in Q1, it's the longest tail element of the exposure we see in personal insurance. So concluding anything based on what we saw in the quarter from a bodily injury standpoint is a challenge. But the same, you know, sort of social inflation, litigation, and abuse challenges that Greg has talked about a lot in business insurance, we're not immune to in personal insurance.\n\nWe have seen over a longer period of time increased attorney involvement impact bodily injury. But all that said, if we look at bodily injury results in the quarter, the bodily injury loss trends were pretty consistent with what we expected. Okay, thank you very much. Your next question comes from the line of\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Ward with Citi. Your line is open. Thanks. Good morning.\n\nUm, I was just curious whether the growth in commercial auto sales accelerated pretty meaningfully. Was that mostly price? Or what should we think?\n\nGood morning, Michael. Yeah, it was. Most of the growth that happened from a net written premium change was due to RPC. One thing I would point out, and I referenced a little bit earlier, we do have our new automobile product that we've rolled out across all business insurance in our express select underwriting route model and also in our transactional middle market business, our TCAP product. So we feel terrific about that latest segmentation, and that should ultimately improve the return profiles on that business overall. But the biggest change was RPC.\n\nHey, Michael, it's Dan. I guess I'll say if you just look at the comment being that, you know, comp was approaching 100 million, the segment was zero, some of it was run off, you could get to an implication of sort of a box around how much the GL must have been. And for whatever it's worth, and I'm not sure how much it's worth, that would tell you that the first quarter number was probably less than some of the magnitude that we saw last year. But again, we'll do a full evaluation again next quarter, and the number will be more or less favorable or unfavorable depending on what the data tells us.\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.",
    "content2": "Hey, thanks. So we saw some data potentially indicating a slowdown in premium growth in the E&S market, and I know Travelers has about $2.5 billion in E&S, and you guys have indicated that margins there are quite attractive. Just curious if you saw any changes in competitive dynamics in ENS or pricing.\n\nRobert, this is Greg. Yeah, as we've shared with you, underneath that 2.5 billion, we have quite a bit of diverse businesses that drive that, and we didn't really see any material slowdown in the segments that we compete in.\n\nOkay, got it. And maybe secondly, I'm curious as I think you've started to go through some of the re-underwriting of the Corvus book, you know, if you've learned anything material and if there are any major takeaways. Yeah.\n\nYeah, thanks, Robert. It's Jeff.\n\nYou know, we're three and a half months now into our integration, and we're feeling really good about bringing together and leveraging the capabilities of both organizations. I would tell you that we feel really good about the quality and profitability of the Corvus Book of Business. It's consistent, and we're taking advantage of some of those capabilities. We've already completed the scans using their proprietary technology to the existing Travelers Book of Business, and we're really comfortable with what we're seeing. Thanks for the call.\n\nI think we have time for one more question. It will... Sorry.\n\nIt will be from Paul Newsome of Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome, your line is open.\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for squeezing me in. Maybe just a couple of quick personalized questions. Is it fair to say that the renewal premium change for both auto and home, given what you've already filed and the fact that you're getting closer to, or you've gotten most states to adequacy, that we should see that decelerate fairly meaningfully in the next couple of quarters? And just any thoughts about that so that we aren't...\n\nSure, Paul, it's Michael. So I would separate auto and home. So for auto, you'll see RPC moderate as we go throughout the year, but I wouldn't suggest it's going to be a sharp decline. You know, one of the things that I think is important to think about as you think about RPC over time for us is... We write mostly 12-month policies in auto. And so while someone who writes a lot of six-month policies is going to see RPC accelerate quickly on the front end, they're going to actually see it decelerate more quickly on the back end.\n\nOurs is going to be a more gradual increase and then a more gradual decrease because we set a rate in May of 2023, and we're still renewing policies at that same higher rate in April of 2024. So just a little bit of context for why I say, you know, it's going to be more of a gradual process of acceleration and Auto-RPM. In property RPC, we don't anticipate a deceleration; we're going to continue to drive rates into the property portfolio in response to increased loss costs, and I would expect RPC to remain relatively consistent through the balance of 2024 in property.\n\nI did notice that the renewal parade in HOME did come down quite a bit, at least sequentially. Is that just sort of an anomaly, or is it something that...\n\nSure Paul, so the RPC drop from Q4 to Q1 in property is what we were referring to last year when we talked about the fact that we've made a lot of progress on insurance to value in homes. So when you think about the renewal premium change in personal lines property, it's really driven by two primary things. One is the rate, and then the other is increasing the coverage limit on the dwelling. And in 2022 and 2023, we made dramatic increases in property coverage aid limits in-home.\n\nThat drove a decent amount of the property RPC. In my prepared remarks, that's why I mentioned that when you look at that 13.4%, it actually reflects an improvement in rates from last quarter to this quarter. And the drop is really because we've essentially caught up on insurance to value and property. So that's why I say, you're not going to see, you know, a further incremental change in RPC due to that coverage and limit dynamic because that's just going to stay the same. And now what you're looking at is mostly our outlook for the rate of property prices in 2024, which again is to keep it pretty consistent.\n\nThank you. Your help is always much appreciated.\n\nThank you. I will turn the call over to Ms. Goldstein for her closing remarks.\n\nThank you all very much again for joining us this morning, and, as usual, if there's any follow-up, please feel free to reach out directly to Investor Relations. Have a great day.\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. We thank you for joining us. You may now disconnect your lines."

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 19, 2024. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2023 results.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to report exceptional top and bottom line results for the quarter. Core income, earnings per share and return on equity were all record highs driven by both underwriting and investment results. Our underwriting gains were broad-based. In each of our 3 segments, underlying underwriting income was higher and prior year development was favorable. Catastrophe losses were also light. Record underlying underwriting income resulted from net earned premiums of $10 billion, up more than 13% over the prior year quarter and an underlying combined ratio, which improved 5.5 points to a record 85.9%. Looking at our 2 commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 85.9% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance was coincidentally also 85.9%, an improvement of more than 10 points year-over-year. In addition, we are pleased to have delivered full year core income of $3.1 billion, generating core return on equity of 11.5%. Notwithstanding elevated industry-wide catastrophe losses earlier in the year, and a personal lines operating environment that while improving was difficult during the year.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform well. generating after-tax net investment income of $645 million for the quarter and $2.4 billion for the year, driven by strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio. Our operating results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% during the year. After making important investments in our business and returning nearly $2 billion of excess capital to shareholders, through dividends and share repurchases. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 13% to $10 billion in the quarter. For the year, we grew net written premiums by 14% to more than $40 billion. All 3 segments contributed to our top line success. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums in the quarter by 14% to more than $5 billion. Renewal premium change remained high at 11.8% while retention also remained high at 87%. The combination of strong pricing and retention reflects deliberate execution on our part and the disciplined marketplace. The segment generated $672 million of new business in the quarter, which was $118 million or about 20% higher than in the prior year quarter.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 7% to $989 million, driven by excellent production in our surety business, where net written premiums were up 9%. Production was also strong in our management liability business. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. In Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 21.2% in home and 16.7% in our auto business. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $2 billion of written premium in this segment over the past year. With another strong production -- with another year of strong production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to take a minute and put our 2023 results into an overtime context with an update to some data we shared previously. A half dozen or so years ago, we laid out a focused innovation strategy, ensure that if we were successful in this execution, we would expect to grow our business at attractive returns. A reflection of our belief that any strategy to achieve industry-leading returns over time requires a strategy to grow over time. The data on Slide 19 of the webcast presentation show the success we've achieved. Starting at the top left corner. In terms of the top line, we've grown net written premiums at a compound annual rate of 7% over the past 7 years. That's 2.5x our rate of growth from 2012 to 2016. The growth rate in each of the past 2 years was double digits, the result of a deliberate and tailored strategy, stronger pricing where we need it and a combination of pricing and unit growth where we like the opportunity. In Business Insurance, we've added more than $4 billion to our top line over the past 2 years. The investments we've made in capabilities to enhance the franchise value that we offer to our customers and distribution partners have contributed to strong retention and growth in new business.\nIn Bond & Specialty, we've increased net written premiums over that period by about $0.5 billion or 14%. More than half of that growth has come from a very profitable surety business, where our market-leading position has enabled us to benefit from increased demand for bonds with higher contract values and projects resulting from the Federal Infrastructure and Jobs Act and other federal programs. Across both of our commercial segments, since 2021, we have about doubled our E&S writings to around $2.5 billion. That includes organic growth from the E&S business we write in National Property, our North field business and our Lloyd's business as well as the impact of more recent strategic efforts, which include our relationships with Fidelis and Corvus. The margins in our E&S business are quite attractive. In Personal Insurance, where margins have not been at target levels in recent periods. Net written premium growth of $3.4 billion over the past 2 years has been almost entirely a result of price increases. The PI team has done an excellent job of threading the needle, maintaining a strong customer base while achieving meaningful pricing gains. They've also done a great job with private product management. Our advanced [ Peril by Peril ] Quantum Auto 2.0 offering now represents more than 60% of the domestic property portfolio. And adoption of our telematics product and Teledrive among new customers has been strong. With pricing gains and enhanced product sophistication, the book should contribute to our earnings power going forward as we move to our target returns.\nAlso important is that across all 3 segments, we've grown mostly in products, classes of business and geographies and through distribution partners that we know well. That gives us a lot of confidence in the business we're adding to the books. Moving to the right, you can see that while we've meaningfully increased our rate of growth, we've maintained very strong and consistent underlying profitability. That demonstrates that we're not growing by underpricing the business or compromising our underwriting discipline. We've grown by investing in the products, services and experiences that our customers want to buy and our distribution partners want to sell. We've also grown through a lot of great hustle and hard work on the part of our outstanding field organization. One of the clear strategic objectives of our innovation strategy has been to optimize productivity and efficiency.\nMoving to the top right of the slide, you can see that over the last 7 years, we've reduced our expense ratio by 3.6 points to just over 28% for 2023, which is more than a 10% reduction relative to our 2012 to 2016 expense ratio of around 32%. Enhanced operating leverage gives us the flexibility to let the benefit fall to the bottom line and/or invest further in our strategic priorities. Case in point, as you can see on Slide 21, since 2017, we have doubled our investments in strategic technology initiatives. Over that same period, we've carefully managed growth in routine but necessary technology expenditures. In other words, over a 7-year period, we simultaneously and meaningfully increased our technology spend improve the strategic mix of that spend and lowered our expense ratio. The upshot of what we've accomplished on the top half of Slide 19 is what you see on the bottom half. On the bottom left, you can see that we've increased underlying underwriting income significantly. From 2012 to 2019, underlying underwriting income averaged $1.3 billion. In 2020, we crossed the $2 billion mark, and 2023 marks the first time that we've exceeded $3 billion. We've taken our underlying underwriting income to a meaningfully higher level. We've also significantly increased our cash flow from operations to more than $7.5 billion in 2023. The fourth consecutive year it's been more than $6 billion and more than double our average cash flow from operations in the earlier part of the last decade.\nCash flow isn't a metric that we or our industry talk a lot about, but it's important. It's what gives us the ability to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to shareholders and grow the investment portfolio. We've grown our investment portfolio significantly to nearly $93 billion. As we continue to reinvest our fixed income portfolio at higher rates, this is a highly reliable lever of earnings and value creation. To sum it up through a well-executed strategy, we've more than doubled our rate of growth, sustained strong underlying underwriting margins and meaningfully lowered our expense ratio. That has resulted in record levels of underlying underwriting income, cash flow and invested assets. Ultimately, of course, 1 number that brings everything together is adjusted book value per share. On Slide 20, you can see that we have steadily increased adjusted book value per share each year since 2006 at a compound annual rate of 7.5%. The effective management of our capital complements that result. We've increased our capital base to support the profitable growth of our business. At the same time, we've been disciplined about returning excess capital to shareholders. Over this period, we've increased our dividend at a compound annual rate of more than 8% and returned more than $40 billion to our shareholders through share repurchases at an average price of about $74 per share. These results, together with our track record of strong returns and low volatility demonstrate the strength of our business and the success of our overtime strategy. Looking ahead, we're very confident about how we're positioned for 2021 and beyond. The fundamentals across our business are in excellent shape. We're confident that we're focused on the right strategic priorities and that with demonstrated success in execution, there's plenty more opportunity ahead of us.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $1.6 billion, and core return on equity was 24%, both all-time record quarterly results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 85.9%, a 5.5 point improvement from last year's quarter. The combination of premium growth and underlying margin improvement led to underlying underwriting income of $1.1 billion after tax, up $511 million or 89% from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio improved from the prior year in all 3 segments. The expense ratio for the fourth quarter improved by 0.5 point from last year's quarter to 27.4%, once again, reflecting the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. The full year expense ratio of 28.1% was our best ever. As Alan mentioned, our focus is on operating leverage. And looking ahead to 2024, we're comfortable with the annual expense ratio in the range of 28% to 28.5% for now.\nOur fourth quarter results include a modest $125 million of pretax catastrophe losses with no individually significant events impacting our book of business. Turning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $132 million pretax, with all 3 segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $56 million was driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by adverse development in umbrella and general liability. Even after the reserve charge, the returns in both umbrella and GL remain very attractive. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $36 million was driven by better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $40 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After-tax net investment income of $645 million was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets.\nReturns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also higher than in the prior year quarter. In terms of our outlook for fixed income NII for 2024, including earnings from short-term securities, we expect approximately $2.6 billion after tax, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter and growing to approximately $675 million in the fourth quarter. Page 22 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 catastrophe reinsurance renewal. Our long-standing cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. And we've increased the amount of total coverage for 2024. Despite the growth in our property book, our attachment point remains steady, and the per occurrence loss deductible is unchanged at $100 million. For 2024, we have placed coverage for $3.5 billion of the $4.5 billion layer above the $3.5 billion attachment point. We're pleased to have obtained the extra protection in light of the recent inflationary impact on insured values. With context, we've never hit this treaty. Nonetheless, this is prudent, affordable balance sheet protection for tail events. The cost of the additional reinsurance will be largely offset by the strong renewal pricing we continue to achieve on our direct written property premiums resulting in only a de minimis impact on the underlying combined ratio.\nOn a financial modeling note, let me turn your attention to Slide 23 of the webcast presentation. As we enter 2024, we thought it would be helpful to once again highlight the seasonality of our cat losses over the prior decade. As shown in the data, the second quarter has regularly and noticeably been our largest cat quarter. Cat losses in the second quarter have been, on average, more than 3 combined ratio points higher than in any other quarter and the second quarter has been our largest cat quarter in 7 of the past 10 years. Also of interest for 2024, in light of continued strong pricing and terms in the E&S and reinsurance markets, we are pleased to share that we have renewed the 20% quota share with Fidelis. The renewal includes the same loss ratio cap we had for 2023. The written premium volume, which will again be included as part of international within the Business Insurance segment is not expected to be material to the segment. but should have a modestly favorable impact on the underlying combined ratio for 2024 as it earns in.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.1 billion were again very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As you may have seen, S&P issued their updated capital model, and we now expect that the result of the new model will be a modest improvement in their assessment of our capital metrics. Interest rates decreased and spreads narrowed during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.5 billion after tax at September 30 to $3.1 billion after tax at year-end. As we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have a little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $122.90 at year-end, up 8% from a year ago. We returned $298 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $66 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nThinking about share repurchases in 2024, while there is no change in our capital management philosophy, we will factor in the need for increased capital in light of our top line growth as well as the $435 million we just deployed to complete the Corvus acquisition. Currently, we expect repurchases in the first quarter of somewhere around $250 million. Recapping our results for 2023. Core income was $3.1 billion, and core ROE was 11.5%. We delivered our highest ever levels of written premium, earned premium, underlying underwriting income and cash flow from operations. In addition, we ended the year with our all-time high in adjusted book value per share and with our largest investment portfolio ever. We've never been better positioned for the year ahead.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding on a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Last year at this time, I indicated that we were firing on all cylinders, and that certainly remains the case today. Segment income for the quarter was $957 million, our highest quarter ever and up well over $200 million from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income as well as lower catastrophes. The all-in combined ratio of 86.5% was a great result, and we're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 86.8% and an all-time best result. The underlying loss ratio improved by almost 2.5 points from the prior year quarter, with the drivers of the improvement, including the benefit of earned pricing a mix shift to the property line and an impact from non-cat weather that was modestly favorable to both the prior year and our expectations. The expense ratio remained excellent at 28.8%. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 14% from the prior year to a fourth quarter record of $5 billion, benefiting from high retention, strong renewal premium change and increase in new business levels. As Alan mentioned, given the attractive margins in this segment, we're very pleased with this growth.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 11.8%, with renewal rate change of 7.4% and continued strong growth and exposure. Renewal rate change increased from the third quarter in select and middle market, however, ticked down at the segment level, driven almost entirely by a lower mix of national property written premium in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. Retention remained excellent at 87% and new business of $672 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. We're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. As for renewal rate change, during the quarter, we achieved meaningful renewal rate increases in all lines other than workers' comp. The property, umbrella and auto lines led the way. Renewal rate change in each of the casualty lines was comparable or better than the third quarter. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels.\nAs for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 11.9%, up more than 1.5 points from the third quarter driven by renewal rate change, which increased to 4.1% for the quarter. Even with strong pricing, retention remained very strong at 85%. New business was up $49 million from the prior year quarter driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change of 10.4% and retention of 90% remained historically strong. New business of $348 million was an all-time best fourth quarter result. As we close out 2023, let me provide a little color on full year results before turning the call over to Jeff. Segment income was nearly $2.6 billion, an exceptional result. The underlying combined ratio of 88.9%, top line of $20.4 billion renewal premium change, retention and new business premiums were all record results. These results are a direct reflection of our successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages. For example, during the year, we continued to advance our data and analytics capabilities by leveraging evolving technologies, including AI, and new data sources to help us manage the portfolio and equip our frontline underwriters with data and insights to better enable our risk selection, underwriting and pricing. In addition, we continued to advance our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in all but a couple of states as well as our new commercial auto product, which is now live in 14 states.\nBoth products deliver industry-leading segmentation and user experiences. In addition, we continue to make progress on developing other industry-leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. In our Small Commercial business, we continued to roll out our new front-end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us. while maintaining all the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes. And finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency. We're proud of these extraordinary results in the best-in-class team that produce them.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Fund & Specialty ended a strong 2023 with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $240 million, up 9% from the prior year quarter. delivered very strong underlying underwriting income and an outstanding underlying combined ratio of 80.6%. Turning to the top line. We grew net written premiums by 7% in the quarter. In our high-quality domestic management liability business, we again delivered excellent retention of 90%, in line with the prior year quarter, while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. New business was up driven by a new domestic cyber capacity agreement with Corvus. Surety net written premiums increased 9%, reflecting continued strong demand for surety bonds. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter, capping off a year during which we generated record segment income and net written premium.\nFinally, we're pleased that earlier this month, we closed our previously announced acquisition of Corvus Insurance. Corvus is an industry-leading cyber insurance managing general underwriter, powered by proprietary technology. Corvus has developed cutting-edge capabilities, including digitally integrated cyber sales, underwriting, service and support, sophisticated underwriting algorithms and advanced vulnerability scanning. Corvus also brings deep cyber underwriting and risk management expertise, and we're pleased to welcome them to the Travelers family. This acquisition affords us the opportunity to write Corvus' profitable book of business which will be reflected as new business in our production results over the course of 2024.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share that Personal Insurance generated $520 million of fourth quarter segment income, strong results and a significant improvement compared to the prior year quarter, due to higher underlying underwriting income and lower catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.9% improved over 10 points compared to the prior year quarter. reflecting improvements in both Automobile and Homeowners and Other. Net written premiums grew 13%, driven by continued elevated levels of renewal premium change in both Auto and Home bringing full year net written premiums to a record of nearly $16 billion. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 103.6%, the underlying combined ratio of 102.7% improved nearly 8 points compared to the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by the benefit of higher earned pricing. To a lesser extent, it also benefited from the year-over-year impact of a modest favorable reestimation of prior quarters in the current year compared to a modest unfavorable reestimation in the prior year quarter.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 70.8% improved by over 28 points, reflecting catastrophe losses that were favorable to both the prior year quarter and our expectations and an improved underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio improved 12.5 points, primarily due to non-catastrophe weather-related losses that were favorable to both the prior year and our expectations and the impact of earned pricing.\nTurning to production. Our results demonstrate our continued disciplined execution of rate and non-rate actions to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile retention remained consistent. Renewal premium change of 16.7% remains strong and as expected, moderated from the third quarter of 2023 and as the majority of our book reached rate adequacy on a written basis. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the mid-teens through the first half of 2024 as we continue to assess the environment and seek rate on a state-by-state basis as appropriate. We're pleased to note that auto new business increased relative to the prior year quarter, as we tempered our non-rate actions in states where we've achieved written rate adequacy. We will continue to evaluate our non-rate measures as more states reach adequacy throughout 2024. In Homeowners and Other, retention remained consistent even as renewal premium change reached a record level at 21.2%, primarily driven by higher renewal rate change. As we noted last quarter, we expect homeowners' renewal premium change to moderate to low double digits in 2024. We will continue to see great increases in response to elevated loss levels. But at the same time, our automatic increase in limit factors will return to more normal levels, reflecting the progress we've made on aligning insured values with replacement costs.\nOur continued efforts to manage new business flow and thoughtfully deploy capacity in the face of market dislocation drove the year-over-year decline in homeowners new business and policies enforced during the quarter. We anticipate this trend will continue as we take further actions to improve profitability and manage growth in property. In 2023, we made notable progress on improving the underlying fundamentals of our business and are moving towards our goal of delivering target returns. While the environment remains dynamic, we're confident we're on a path to generating leading returns in personal insurance and growing profitably over time.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks very much. We're happy to open up for your questions.",

Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers.\nWe ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session.\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 18, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2023 results.

All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our three segment presidents: Gregory Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeffrey Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.\nThey will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.\nThese factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Core income of $454 million for the quarter benefited from very strong underlying underwriting results and net investment income, but was also impacted by elevated catastrophe losses and net unfavorable prior year reserve development. Mike will provide more context on the catastrophe losses.\nThe unfavorable prior year reserve development was driven by the results of our annual bets review in our runoff book. The reserves in the ongoing businesses of all three segments developed favorably. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Underlying underwriting income of $868 million pretax was up more than 40% over the prior year quarter, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.7 million and a consolidated underlying combined ratio which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 90.6%. The underlying combined ratios in our commercial segments remained excellent.\nOur Business Insurance segment once again delivered very strong results with an underlying combined ratio of 89.7%. The underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was also excellent at 80.7%.\nLooking at the two commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was 88.3% for the quarter. among our best ever.\nIn our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved more than 5 points to 94.2% as a strong written rate from prior courses earning in. Our underlying results in Personal Insurance are improving and heading in the right direction.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio continued to perform extremely well. generating after-tax net investment income of $640 million, reflecting strong and reliable returns from our growing fixed income portfolio and solid returns from our non-fixed income portfolio.\nIn terms of production, thanks to great execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value they have to sell. We grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.5 billion.\nIn Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 16% to $5.1 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was very strong at 12.9%. And driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated year-over-year and sequentially to 7.9%. Renewal rate change was higher sequentially in every line other than workers' comp, where overall renewal premium change remains positive and appropriate given returns in the line.\nFor the segment, even with higher pricing at record levels, retention remained very strong at 87%. And a reflection of a rational market. New business was strong and hired broadly across the segment.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, we grew net written premiums to a record $1 billion, achieved 91% retention of our high-quality management liability business and grew net written premiums in our industry-leading surety business by 13%. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments.\nIn Personal Insurance, top line growth of 14% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.4% in our homeowners and other business increased to a record high 18.2% in our [ ad ] business. Another quarter of strong production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nWith the end of the year in sight and 2024 on the horizon and coming into focus, we feel very well positioned for what's ahead and quite confident. In our Business Insurance segment, written margins are expanding. Pricing has been strong and the components of core goods inflation that impact our loss costs are moderating. Medical inflation, in particular, remains benign. Nonetheless, given the duration of relevant liabilities, we continue to incorporate medical inflation and our loss costs based on the higher longer-term trends.\nIn terms of the top line of business insurance, we're pleased that economic output and consumption so far remain robust. Given our leading workers' compensation business, we've ended in particular, from the near 50-year low in unemployment the primates labor participation rate, which is at its highest level since 2007 and ongoing wage inflation, which contributes to premium growth and margins.\nAs a result of strong pricing in recent years and higher fixed income NII, returns in the segment are currently attractive. Nonetheless, given the uncertainty generally in terms of weather volatility, economic and social inflation, hardening reinsurance market and the geopolitical landscape, we plan to continue pursuing strong price increases in both the property and casualty lines to achieve our overtime return objectives.\nTurning to our industry-leading bond and specialty business. We just reached a milestone $1 billion in net written premiums returned terrific. And as you've heard, results in our personal insurance business are headed in the right direction. Earned margins are improving and additional price increases will earn in from here. We're very pleased with our targeted marketplace execution. At same time, inflationary pressures are moderating.\nIn terms of the investment portfolio with interest rates at their highest levels in recent memory and most indications suggesting higher for longer we are extremely well positioned. In the last 5 years, we've grown our very high-quality investment portfolio by nearly $19 billion or about 25% to more than $90 billion portfolio is allocated to fixed income.\nAs we look ahead to 2024, we expect our after-tax fixed income NII will be more than $2.6 billion. to ensure that our competitive advantages continue to distinguish us and fuel our performance. We will continue to invest in our ambitious and focused innovation priorities. We're spending more than $1.5 billion this year on technology. inside an excellent expense ratio and with a higher proportion allocated to strategic technology investments. We're confident that we're working on the right priorities, executing effectively and that will see the benefits play out in growth at attractive returns going forward.\nLastly, I'll share that we're recently back from one of the year's largest industry conferences where we met with many of our distribution partners. We left confident that we have the pole position with distribution in the United States and that we're positioned to support each other's strategic and marketplace priorities. We're committed to being their best partner and to offering the products and services that best serve our mutual customers.\nTo sum it up, we remain very confident in the outlook for our business. I couldn't be more grateful to my 30,000 colleagues who show up every day committed to our culture for standard of excellence and fulfilling our mission of creating shareholder value and our purpose of taking care of the people we're privileged to serve. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $454 million and core return on equity was 6.9% and as heavy cat activity impacted our results. We're pleased to have once again generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6% and a 1.9 point improvement from last year's strong results.\nThis combination of growth and underlying margin improvement led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $684 million after tax, up $206 million or 43% from the prior year quarter. The expense ratio for the third quarter improved 10 basis points from last year's quarter to an excellent 28% and continues to reflect the benefits of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth.\nOur third quarter results include $850 million of pretax catastrophe losses, resulting from another quarter of both frequency and severity of weather across North America.\nTurning to prior year reserve development, we had total net unfavorable development of $154 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $263 million was driven by charges in our runoff business, including $284 million related to our annual asbestos review, as well as increased reserves for abuse and molestation resulting from the volume of claims related to the closing of the reviver window in California. This year's asbestos charge includes an additional increase to strengthen our carried reserve position relative to the range of outcomes.\nOutside of runoff in our ongoing businesses, Business Insurance had $132 million of net favorable PYD driven by favorability in workers' comp that was partially offset by unfavorability in commercial auto. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $72 million was driven by another quarter of better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance had $37 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other.\nAfter-tax net investment income of $640 million was up 27% from the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and the significant growth in our portfolio of invested assets. Returns in the non-fixed income portfolio were also above the prior year quarter. With interest rates having moved higher during the third quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $615 million after tax for the fourth quarter.\nFor 2024, we now expect more than $2.6 billion after tax, our highest level ever, beginning with approximately $630 million in the first quarter of 2024 and and growing to approximately $690 million for the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30 are about 180 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of more than $3 billion were an all-time record. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.7 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $4.6 billion after tax at June 30, to $6.5 billion after tax at September 30.\nAs we've discussed previously, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally did not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $115.78 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $333 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $101 million and dividends of $232 million. We have approximately $6.1 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nSimilar to my comments on last quarter's call, a significant level of catastrophe losses we've experienced this year resulted in lower year-to-date earnings than we expected, so share repurchases in the fourth quarter will likely be lower than the quarterly share repurchases made in the first half of the year.\nTo sum things up, while our third quarter earnings were adversely impacted by elevated catastrophe losses, we're pleased to post another quarter of double-digit premium growth and improved and very strong underlying combined ratio and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our business results going forward. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Segment income for the third quarter was $468 million, with strong underlying underwriting and investment income as well as favorable prior year development in our ongoing book. offset by reserve charges in our runoff book, mostly related to asbestos. We're particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio of 89.7% for the quarter. which was a 30 basis point improvement year-over-year and an all-time best third quarter result.\nThe benefit of earned pricing was offset by normal variability in loss activity all in netting to an excellent result. Net written premiums increased 16% to a record third quarter of $5.1 billion. driven by very strong renewal premium change of 12.9%, historically high retention of 87% and new business of $695 million.\nUnderneath RPC, as you heard from Alan, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the second quarter to 7.9% with all lines other than workers' comp being higher. We're thrilled with these production results and our fields continued superior execution in the marketplace.\nAnd given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases, improvements in terms and conditions. We're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels.\nLastly, we're encouraged that new business was higher than the prior year quarter broadly across the segment. While the comparison of new business to the prior year quarter benefited from a relatively modest prior year result as well as higher pricing on new business this year. We're also pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results.\nAs for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change remained strong at 10.3%. The while retention of 85% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter. New business was up $46 million from the prior year quarter, driven in large part by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. We're also encouraged with the early performance of our new state-of-the-art commercial auto product, which has been rolled out in 12 states.\nIn middle market, renewal premium change remained very strong at 10.6%, while retention remained excellent at 89%. New business was a strong $352 million, we're pleased with the quality of the submission flow from our distribution partners during the quarter and our responsiveness in quoting and closing accounts that align with our appetite. As always, we remain vigilant around risk selection, underwriting and pricing.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond Specialty posted terrific top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income was a record $265 million, up 10% from the very strong prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio was an outstanding 80.7%.\nTurning to the top line. We're pleased to have delivered record net written premiums of over $1 billion. In domestic Management Liability, we again delivered record-level retention of 91% and up 2 points from the third quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve positive renewal premium change. This result reflects the attractive returns of our high-quality book of business.\nRecord Surety net written premiums reflect strong broad-based demand for surety bonds and higher premium from large construction projects. So we're pleased to have once again delivered terrific top and bottom line results this quarter. driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits from our value-added approach and market-leading competitive advantages. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the third quarter segment loss of $193 million was significantly impacted by catastrophe losses. We experienced elevated losses from weather activity, specifically related to wind and hail events. This was another active quarter for severe convective storms across the U.S. There were 19 designated PCS events specifically related to wind, hail and tornado activity in the quarter, nearly twice the 10-year average and the highest number for a third quarter in more than a decade.\nOn a more positive note, the underlying combined ratio of 94.2% improved 5.1 points compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in both automobile and homeowners. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 14%, driven by high teens a [ real ] premium change in both domestic automobile and Homeowners & Other.\nIn automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 103.5%, this was 8.7 points lower than the prior year quarter, which included catastrophe losses resulting from Hurricane Ian. The underlying combined ratio of 100.6% and improved 3.3 points compared to the prior year quarter, driven by the impact of earned pricing in excess of loss trend.\nThe quarter-over-quarter improvement in our results clearly reflects the growing impact of our pricing and non-rate actions. Underlying results in auto are headed in the right direction as the benefit of earned pricing continues to accelerate and as vehicle repair and replacement trends are moderating.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2023, it's important to remember that the fourth quarter auto underlying loss ratio has historically been 6 to 7 points above the average for the first 3 quarters because of winter weather and holiday driving.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio of 116.2% increased 13.9 points due to the catastrophe losses that I mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 88% improved 6.9 points, primarily due to the impact of earned pricing, a benefit from the favorable re-estimation of prior quarters in the current year and a lower expense ratio.\nTurning to production. Our results continue to demonstrate our disciplined market execution in a challenging marketplace. Beginning with domestic Homeowners & Other, renewal premium change of 19.4% was very strong. The lack of growth in policies in force reflects our continued actions to further balance rate adequacy, catastrophe risk and regulatory risk.\nWe expect renewal premium change in homeowners to remain consistent through year-end. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect renewal premium change to remain elevated, but moderate into low double digits as our automatic increase in limit factors returned to more normal levels in line with stabilizing industry estimates of replacement costs.\nIn domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 18.2% increased 2 points compared to the second quarter of 2023. The Auto policies in force declined slightly, reflecting our continued efforts to manage growth while improving profitability. Going forward, we expect renewal premium change in auto to remain very strong but begin to move down from here as more of the book reaches rate adequacy on a written basis.\nI'm proud of the way our team continues to respond to the dynamic environment. We are consistently evolving pricing, segmentation, underwriting and terms and conditions, while managing new business flow to ensure we deploy capacity thoughtfully in the face of market dislocation. At the same time, we're sustaining our investments and capabilities to build our business for the future. With our leading talent, capabilities and strong distribution relationships, we are confident in our ability to generate leading returns over time. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. And operator, we're ready to start questions.",

Welcome to the second quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 20, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our 3 segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In the face of an historic cat quarter, our top and bottom line results demonstrate the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our business model.\nThis quarter, we reported strong underlying results and investment returns as well as net favorable prior year reserve development, which were essentially offset by an historic level of industry-wide catastrophe losses. There were PCS-designated catastrophe events taking place on 88 of the 91 days of the quarter.\nDespite pretax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion, we generated slightly positive core income for the quarter. We are very pleased with the underlying fundamentals of our business. Pretax underlying underwriting income of $781 million for the quarter was up nearly 40%, driven by record net earned premiums of $9.2 billion and a consolidated underlying combined ratio, which improved 1.7 points to an excellent 91.1%. Earned premiums were higher in all 3 of our business segments.\nUnderlying profitability in our Business Insurance segment was particularly strong. The underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points to an excellent 89.4%. Underlying combined ratio in our Bond & Specialty business was higher year-over-year, but at 87.8%, still generated a very attractive return.\nIn our Personal Insurance segment, the underlying combined ratio improved by 2 points, reflecting the actions we have taken to improve profitability.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $594 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting stronger and reliable returns from our fixed income portfolio, and solid returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. Given our confidence in the strength of our business, we returned $633 million of excess capital to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million of share repurchases.\nTurning to production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field, we grew net written premiums by $1.3 billion or 14% to a record $10.3 billion.\nIn Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 18% to $5.2 billion. Renewal premium change in the segment was a record high at 12.8%, driven by renewal rate change, which accelerated 2.5 points sequentially to 7.2%. The renewal premium change we achieved this quarter was broad-based. RPC was double-digit or near double-digit in every line other than workers' compensation, and it was higher sequentially in every line, including workers' compensation.\nEven with strong pricing, retention, an important indicator of marketplace stability, remained very strong at 88%. New business increased 36% to $671 million led by the property line.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, record net written premiums were about even with the prior year quarter. Retention in our management liability business was an excellent 91% and new business increased 11%. Surety net written premiums were also once again strong. Given the attractive returns, we are very pleased with the strong production results in both of our commercial business segments. The growth we're putting on the books is from geographies, products and distribution partners that we know well.\nIn Personal Insurance, top line growth of 13% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was 19.2% in our homeowners and other business and increased to a record high 16.1% in our Auto business.\nAnother quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the rest of the year and into 2024. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to spend a few minutes on what Travelers is doing in an important area for us, artificial intelligence. We subscribe to the view that over time, the impact of AI across the economy is going to be profound. So is the opportunity for Travelers. With our performance transformed mindset and our disciplined framework for assessing our investment priorities, we've been focused for years on responsibly developing differentiating AI capabilities across our 3 innovation priorities, extending our lead in risk expertise, providing great experiences for our customers, agents, brokers and employees and optimizing productivity and efficiency.\nBetween our colleagues who are dedicated to AI specifically and others in enabling disciplines, we have a very significant number of our employees engaged on the objective of making sure that we're leading when it comes to AI.\nAs we've shared before, and as you can see on Slide 23 of the webcast presentation, for some time, we've been steadily increasing our technology spend. This year, we'll spend more than $1.5 billion on technology. As the slide demonstrates, we've also been improving the strategic mix of our tech spend. That includes a meaningful increase in investments to develop or require cutting-edge AI capabilities built on modern cloud technology.\nImportantly, we've done all that while significantly improving our expense ratio in no small part, thanks to the success of our technology investments.\nThe quantity and quality of data are key differentiators when it comes to AI. For more than a decade, we've been investing in data sets, data quality and data accessibility. Between submissions in our commercial businesses and quotes in PI, we intake millions of business opportunities each year. We also take in a just and adjudicate millions of claims. As one of the largest risk control organizations in the industry, we provide risk mitigation to our commercial customers, completing more than 100,000 risk control consultations annually. We capture valuable data from virtually all of those interactions.\nOur data also include decades of curated institutional knowledge in the forms of policies, procedures, guidelines, forensic investigations and so on. All of that creates an excellent foundation for the next iteration of generative AI.\nIn addition to our extensive proprietary data, we've been assembling actionable third-party data for years. In fact, we have more than 2,000 data sets from hundreds of third parties. All in, we believe that we have a significant and hard to replicate data advantage. Given the competitive advantages that will come from deploying AI across the insurance value chain, and the expertise, resources and data required to get there, scale will increasingly be a differentiator in our industry as will the ability to execute complex initiatives effectively and efficiently.\nExpertise, resources, data, scale and execution excellence, all favor Travelers. The potential use cases for AI and our industry are many in varied. We pursue very focused opportunities that are consistent with our innovation priorities and will create meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, all with an eye towards leveraging strategic capabilities across our organization.\nAI capabilities that we currently have in production span the spectrum from those driving efficiency through automation to more advanced generative AI and large language models. More advanced models augment various aspects of our underwriting, claim handling, service delivery and other work. We use intelligent process automation broadly throughout our business to handle hundreds of routine workflows. Automation and AI have been meaningful drivers of our expense ratio improvement over the past 7 years or so.\nA key success driver in insurance is segmenting risk as finely as possible to achieve pricing that is accurately calibrated to the risk. Deep learning models have significantly improved our ability to classify and segment risk in our flow businesses.\nFor example, in Personal Insurance, we leverage proprietary AI and aerial imagery to assess roof and other site-related conditions at the parcel level. Parcel level risk assessment at scale was practically unimaginable until several years ago. And that type of information is very difficult to obtain from the insured with a reliable degree of accuracy.\nIn our select accounts business, we estimate that AI has improved business classification, a critical underwriting input by more than 30%. In our middle market business, we've developed a suite of sophisticated AI models, which facilitate targeted cross-selling, supporting our effort to sell more products to more customers. We're also using AI to better understand our customers and their needs. So this improved customer segmentation, we can better align new product development and generate insights that improve the customer experience, enhancing our industry-leading analytics using machine learning models to deliver sophisticated actuarial insights and to loss cost trends in development, which improve our already strong pricing and product monitoring capabilities.\nOn the most advanced end, we're leveraging generative AI in large language models, and we've been doing so for several years. For example, in our Bond & Specialty business, our proprietary large language models have processed hundreds of thousands of broker submissions as we work toward improving intake time from hours to minutes. This will improve our responsiveness to our customers and distribution partners and contribute to our productivity.\nIn our claim organization, a proprietary large language model ingests legal complaints filed against our insureds and then highlights key liability and coverage issues, assist in routing the cases to the best suited Defense Council and provides risk-related insights that can be incorporated back into our underwriting process.\nWe've also developed and are piloting a Traveler's claim knowledge assistant, a generative AI tool trained on many thousands of pages of proprietary technical source material that was previously only accessible through thousands of different documents. The model provides claim professionals with the ability to easily access accurate actionable information on technical and procedural claim matters, increasing speed, accuracy and consistency in various workflows, including in interactions with our customers and distribution partners.\nSo in terms of AI, we're investing with speed and strategic direction, consistent with our stated objective of delivering industry-leading returns. I've only shared some of what's in flight, and the capabilities that we've developed are in various phases of adoption. The full impact of the capabilities we're developing and others on our road map are still ahead of us.\nTo sum things up, we are very confident in the outlook for our business. We have terrific underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, improving underlying results in our Personal Insurance business and steadily rising investment returns in our fixed income portfolio.\nAs you've heard, we're also investing in impactful new capabilities to advance our ambitious innovation agenda. With that momentum and the best talent in the industry, we are well positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. We're pleased to have generated record levels of earned premium this quarter and an underlying combined ratio of 91.1%, a 170 basis point improvement from last year's strong results. This led to a very strong underlying underwriting gain of $615 million after tax, up $171 million or 39% from the prior year quarter.\nThe expense ratio for the second quarter improved 40 basis points from last year to 28.6%. Once again, benefiting from the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth.\nAs Alan mentioned, the industry experienced a very active cat quarter and our second quarter results include $1.5 billion of pretax catastrophe losses, our second largest ever cat amount for a second quarter. As disclosed in the significant events table in our 10-Q, we had 6 events surpassed the $100 million mark in Q2, the most ever for a single quarter since we began disclosing the table in 2013.\nTurning to prior year reserve development, we had total net favorable development of $60 million pretax. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $101 million was the result of better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years, being more than offset by an increase in some of our other casualty reserves as well as for runoff operations.\nIn Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $119 million was driven by better-than-expected results in management liability and surety. Personal Insurance had $42 million of net favorable PYD driven by homeowners and other. After-tax net investment income of $594 million was in line with the prior year quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than the prior year quarter reflecting both the benefit of higher average yields and higher invested assets.\nReturns in the non-fixed income portfolio were solid, but as expected, were not as strong as the double-digit yield we experienced in the prior year quarter.\nWith interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities by $35 million after tax for the back half of the year. We now expect approximately $570 million after tax in the third quarter and $595 million after tax in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of June 30 are about 140 basis points higher than what's embedded in the portfolio, so fixed income NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and continues to grow.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $2 billion. In late May, we issued $750 million of 30-year debt in order to maintain the debt-to-capital ratio in line with our target range as our premium volume has continued to grow.\nInterest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, and as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.9 billion after tax at March 31 to $4.6 billion after tax at June 30. As we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally did not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity, the quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was $115.45 at quarter end, up 1% from year-end and up 3% from a year ago. We returned $633 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $400 million and dividends of $233 million. We have approximately $6.2 billion of capacity remaining under the share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nSince the significant level of cat losses in late June resulted in lower earnings for the quarter than we had anticipated, we expect the level of share repurchases over the back half of the year to be lower than the level of share repurchases in the first half of the year.\nTurning to the topic of reinsurance. Page 20 of the webcast presentation shows a summary of our July 1 reinsurance placements. While we did see some meaningful price increases on our reinsurance renewals, those increases were broadly in line with the price increases we are obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's little or no impact expected on margins.\nLet me take another moment to highlight a few items on Page 20. First, we renewed our main cat reinsurance program at terms that were generally consistent with the expiring program. Second, we increased the coverage under our Northeast property treaty by fully placing the $850 million layer above the attachment point of $2.5 billion. A year ago, we placed $750 million of that $850 million layer and the attachment point was $2.25 billion. This treaty remains pretty far out on the tail for us.\nFinally, as part of our ongoing management of tail risk exposure for the enterprise and in response to inflation-driven growth and insured values in our Personal Insurance property book, we added a new hurricane cat excess of loss reinsurance program specific to Personal Insurance coastal exposure, providing 50% coverage for the $1 billion layer above an attachment point of $1.75 billion, again, far out on the tail. Any margin impact from this new program will be de minimis, given both the size of our PI property book and the level of price increases we are obtaining on that book.\nTo sum up the quarter, our ability to absorb $1.5 billion of pretax cat losses and still report slightly positive core income for the quarter is a testament to the overall strength of our franchise and the underlying fundamentals of our business. Q2 was another quarter of double-digit premium growth, improved underlying profitability and further improvement in our outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns. With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $402 million of segment income for the second quarter, down from the prior year quarter driven by prior year reserve development and higher cats, as Dan mentioned. Underlying underwriting results continue to be exceptional with underlying underwriting income up more than 50% from the prior year quarter.\nWe're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.4% which improved by 3 points from the prior year quarter. The loss ratio benefited from property losses that were about 1.5 points better than our expectations for the current year quarter. The loss ratio also improved due to earned pricing. The expense ratio remained strong at 30.1%.\nNet written premiums increased 18% to a quarterly record of $5.2 billion, driven by renewal premium change of 12.8%, retention of 88% and new business of $671 million, all record highs. Underneath RPC, renewal rate change accelerated sequentially from the first quarter by 2.5 points to 7.2%. We're thrilled with these production results and the superior execution by our field team in the marketplace.\nIn terms of pricing, we're pleased with our response to the persistent environmental headwinds in both the property and liability lines. In each of our product lines, renewal premium change was higher than the first quarter. And beyond pricing, we continue to improve terms and conditions to ensure we're achieving an appropriate risk/reward trade-off on the business we write.\nAs we always say, we execute in a granular manner, deal by deal, class by class. And to that point, we're thrilled with our execution demonstrated by a record retention of 88% on our very high-quality book of business and a rate that is thoughtfully segmented by return profile.\nNew business as a percentage of the book returned to pre-pandemic levels, led by the property line. We're pleased with new business dollars at an all-time high. And as always, when it comes to new business, we remain focused on risk selection, underwriting, terms and conditions and pricing. We're also very pleased with the impact that our strategic investments are having on our production results.\nAs for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was up 1 point from the first quarter to a strong 10.6% while retention also remained historically high at 84%. New business increased $30 million or 28% from the prior year quarter driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product.\nIn middle market, renewal premium change was up more than 2 points sequentially from the first quarter to a historically high 10.5% with renewal rate change increasing sequentially by 1.5% to 5.9% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention was once again exceptional at 90% while new business was up 32% from the prior year quarter with increases across all account sizes in most markets.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had another strong quarter and continue to execute on the fundamentals to drive profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted strong top and bottom line results for the quarter. Segment income of $230 million was up slightly from the very strong prior year quarter. The combined ratio was a terrific 77.1%. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 87.8% for the quarter. A small number of surety losses drove the roughly 4-point increase in the underlying loss ratio year-over-year.\nAs we've said before, surety losses can be a bit lumpy. Even with the incremental losses this quarter, our returns in the surety line remain excellent.\nTurning to the top line. We delivered record net written premiums this quarter. In domestic management liability, we are pleased that we drove record retention of 91% in the quarter, up 2 points sequentially and 3 points from the second quarter of 2022 while continuing to achieve solid renewal premium change. This result reflects our team's deliberate execution to retain our high-quality book of business in light of the very strong returns.\nWe're also pleased that we increased new business 11% from the prior year quarter. That's a reflection of the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners and a lot of hard work by our team in the field.\nAdditionally, we're pleased to report record surety net written premiums in the quarter. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were once again strong this quarter, driven by our continued underwriting and risk management diligence, excellent execution by our field organization and the benefits from our ongoing strategic investments to extend our market-leading competitive advantages. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the second quarter segment loss of $538 million and a combined ratio of 122% were significantly impacted by catastrophes. While it's not unusual for us to have a loss in the second quarter, given it's typically the quarter with the highest weather-related losses, catastrophe losses this quarter for both us and the industry were significantly elevated compared to historical results.\nNet written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic Automobile and Homeowners & Other. The underlying combined ratio of 94.1% improved 2 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting an improvement in the underlying combined ratio in Homeowners & Other, partially offset by an increase in Automobile.\nIn Automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 108.4% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.5%. The underlying combined ratio increased 1.7 points from the prior year quarter due to higher severity driven by increased vehicle replacement and repair costs, and a mix shift from collision only claims for its claims with bodily injury and third-party property damage, which is more consistent with more cars on the road, leading to more multicar accidents. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio.\nWhile some of the inflationary pressures in Auto are beginning to show signs of easing, they are not improving at the rate we expected. Consequently, we're not yet achieving the written rate adequacy levels we had anticipated. While we continue to make progress and expect to get there in the coming quarters, exactly when will depend on a few things. For example, how quickly inflation comes down, how quickly we can get additional rate through the regulatory process and our actual loss experience.\nIn Homeowners & Other, the second quarter combined ratio of 135.1% increased 17.1 points due to significantly higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 85.2% improved 5.1 points, primarily driven by non-cat weather losses that were lower than in the prior year quarter. Non-cat weather losses in the quarter were also better than our expectations as more events reached our catastrophe threshold.\nTurning to production. Our results continue to demonstrate disciplined market execution of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we remain focused on improving profitability and managing growth in response to continued inflationary pressures in the environment. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 16.1% increased 2.1 points from the first quarter of 2023. We expect renewal premium change to continue to increase from current levels throughout the second half of this year.\nIn domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 19.2% was broadly consistent with the first quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain in the high teens through the end of the year.\nBefore I conclude, I just want to take a minute to thank our claim partners for responding to our customers when it matters most. Behind the aggregate statistics of catastrophe events occurring virtually every day of the quarter, are tens of thousands of individual customers whose homes and vehicles are damaged or destroyed and whose lives are disrupted. In each case, our claim team is responding, helping those customers get their homes repaired and their cars back on the road, continuing to deliver high-quality customer service despite the high volume of claims.\nBoth the loss environment and the Personal Insurance marketplace remain dynamic. We continue to respond to the changing environment with a steadfast focus on execution, quickly addressing changes in loss experience with targeted pricing, underwriting and other non-rate actions, remaining disciplined in writing business that is consistent with our appetite and making thoughtful and impactful investments for the future. We're confident that the actions we've taken and will continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. We're ready to open up for questions.",

Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 19, 2023.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2023 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment presidents: Gregory Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeffrey Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.\nThese factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report a terrific start to the year, including an excellent bottom line result for the quarter, particularly in light of the high level of severe weather activity across the United States, and very strong production in all 3 of our business segments, which produced net written premium growth of 12% for the quarter.\nProfitability and growth in our Business Insurance segment were particularly strong. And as you'll hear from Michael, we're positioned for improved profitability in our Personal lines business. Core income for the quarter was $970 million, or $4.11 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 14.5%. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.9 billion, up 10% compared to the prior-year period, an excellent underlying combined ratio of 90.6% and a onetime tax benefit.\nCatastrophe losses were elevated as the industry experienced the highest number of Q1 PCS catastrophe events since PCS started tracking in the 1950s.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality portfolio generated net investment income of $557 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and positive returns from our non-fixed income portfolio. Our underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet, enabled us to return $680 million of excess capital to shareholders, including $462 million of share repurchases.\nAt the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business as we notched another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives. In light of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared an 8% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1 per share, marking 19 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 8% over that period. The Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.\nTurning to the top line in production. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field. We grew net written premiums by 12% this quarter to a record $9.4 billion with all 3 segments contributing. In Business Insurance, we grew net written premiums by 15% to $5.2 billion. You may recall that we entered into a quota share arrangement with Fidelis for 2023. This contributed about $160 million or around 3.5 percentage points net written premium growth in the segment. Results from the quota share are not reflected in our production statistics.\nRenewal premium change in Business Insurance remained historically high at 9.6%. Per renewal rate change ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter, driven by the property, umbrella and auto lines. Even with continued strong pricing broadly, retention in Business Insurance was very strong at 87%. New business of $639 million was a record and up 17% from the prior-year period.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased slightly from a very strong level in the prior-year quarter with excellent retention of 90% and new business growth of 25% in our management liability business, and a record level of Q1 net written premium in our surety business. Given the attractive returns and the high quality of business in our commercial segments, we are very pleased with strong production results in these businesses.\nIn Personal Insurance, top line growth of 12% was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change increased to 20.2% in our homeowners and other business and a 13.9% in our auto business. Another quarter of terrific production across the board positions us well for the year ahead. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nIn light of the recent disruption in the banking sector, I'd like to share a reminder about how our business differs from those in the headlines. We often talk about the high quality of our investment portfolio, and I'll get back to that. But first, let me say a few words about our prudent management of that portfolio.\nThe banking sector disruption started with an acceleration of liabilities in the form of withdrawals from demand deposit accounts. As we all know, there's no acceleration of our largest liabilities, loss reserves. In other words, there's no such thing as a run on the bank in our business. But the banking episode also highlighted the risk to the equity of an enterprise when the duration of assets and liabilities are mismatched. We manage the duration of our assets relative to our liabilities such that on an economic basis, we've effectively diffused our insurance liabilities.\nIn other words, increases or decreases in interest rates generally have offsetting impacts on the present value of both our investment portfolio and our outstanding insurance liabilities. This essentially boxes the economic impact of changes in interest rates. As we've explained in response to your questions over the years, this is a reason why we didn't reach for yield by increasing duration in the low interest rate environment over the past 1.5 decades.\nIn addition to duration, the bank solvency issues also highlighted the importance of thoughtfully managing liquidity. Quarter in and quarter out, we've consistently generated strong cash flows from operations. Our cash flows from premiums alone over the course of the year are consistently greater than our annual payments for claims and expenses. That was true throughout the 2008 financial crisis and more recently throughout the pandemic.\nWe also have a steady and reliable stream of cash flows from our very high-quality fixed income portfolio. In addition to the periodic interest payments we receive on the bonds we hold, the proceeds from our maturing investment sheet each month provide an additional source of liquidity. Back to the high quality of our investment portfolio, macroeconomic uncertainty reminds us of how important that is and the quality of our holdings and our disciplined focus on risk-adjusted returns distinguish us.\nOur fixed income investments are highly diversified. They have an average credit rating of AA and comprise 93% of our investments. Our alternative investments are also high quality and well diversified. Page 20 of our webcast presentation includes further details.\nTo address another topic that's been in the news lately, Page 21 of the webcast presentation includes information demonstrating the relatively nominal risk we have in our investment portfolio related to commercial real estate. Real estate represents a small percentage of our total invested assets. Our fixed income real estate investments are very high quality and the largest component of our non-fixed income real estate investments is wholly owned properties. The wholly owned properties are carried at their depreciated historical cost. In other words, they were never written up when market values were high and the appraised value of the portfolio is well above book value.\nThe portfolio has also produced a strong free cash flow yield. In short, whether we're talking about underwriting or investing, Travelers is built to manage through uncertain times.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dan, I'll share with you that we just returned from our annual conference with our most significant distribution partners who collectively represent more than half of our premium. We all left with the continued confidence that our relationships with these business leaders and their firms are strong as ever and feeling tremendous support for the strategic initiatives that we have underway. It's a great reminder that our position with distribution sets us apart and is an important competitive advantage. It's hard to replicate.\nTo sum things up, we're off to a great start for the year with another quarter of strong profitability and growth driven by our underwriting and investment expertise. At the same time, we continue to successfully execute on our innovation strategy which has contributed to significantly accelerated premium growth, superior returns and industry low volatility over the past decade. With the best talent in the industry, we remain well positioned for success through a wide range of economic and operating environments and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value over time.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $970 million and core return on equity was 14.5%. Compared to the prior year, this year's first quarter results included a significantly higher level of catastrophe losses and a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. Those unfavorable items were largely offset by higher underlying -- underwriting income including a onetime tax benefit. The tax benefit impacts the income tax line only and thus does not impact the combined ratio or the underlying combined ratio.\nOur first quarter results include $535 million of pretax cat losses, significantly higher than the prior year's benign results and about $160 million above the average of our first quarter cat losses for the past 5 years. Our pretax underlying underwriting gain of $797 million was $131 million higher than the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an improved underlying combined ratio of 90.6%. Results were again very strong in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, while in Personal Insurance, we made significant progress in obtaining price increases that position us to get back to target returns.\nThe first quarter expense ratio of 28.7% was again very strong. Our ongoing investments in strategic initiatives are balanced by our continued focus on productivity and efficiency and strong top line growth, resulting in an expense ratio that, as expected, was broadly consistent with last year's first quarter and full year figures.\nWe reported net favorable prior-year reserve development of $105 million pretax in the first quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $19 million pretax was driven by another quarter of favorable development in workers' comp, largely offset by an increase for umbrella liability coverages and environmental exposure in our runoff book.\nIn Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $58 million pretax was driven by better-than-expected results in both surety and management liability. Personal Insurance recorded $28 million pretax of net favorable PYD, driven by improvement in the homeowners book. After-tax net investment income increased 3% from the prior year quarter to $557 million.\nFixed income NII was higher than in the prior-year quarter, benefiting from both higher fixed income yields and a higher level of invested assets. Returns in our non-fixed income portfolio remained positive but were, as expected, less favorable than in last year's quarter. We are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to $530 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $555 million in the third quarter and then to around $575 million in the fourth quarter.\nRemember, only about 10% of the portfolio turns over each year, so the higher new money rates will take a while to fully impact run rate NII. Regarding the tax line, this quarter included a onetime tax benefit of $211 million with respect to the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847, which addressed the discounting of property casualty loss reserves. And as a reminder, last year's first quarter included a $47 million benefit from the favorable resolution of our most recent federal income tax audit.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. As interest rates decreased during the quarter, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $4.9 billion after tax at year-end to $3.9 billion after tax at March 31.\nRemember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high. And changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our cash flows, statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $116.55 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 4% from a year ago. We returned $680 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, including share repurchases of $462 million and dividends of $218 million. As Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized an 8% increase in the quarterly dividend to $1 per share and also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases on top of the $1.6 billion remaining under the prior authorization.\nLet me wrap up my comments today on a personal note. A few weeks ago, we announced that on June 2, our friend and colleague, Doug Russell, will retire after a 40-plus-year career, about 25 of which have been with Travelers. For the past 5 years or so, Doug has held 2 very important roles, Corporate Controller and Treasurer. Doug is knowledgeable. He is unflappable and he is one of the very nicest people you could ever have the good fortune to know. He's also a great teacher. And in addition to being invaluable to me when I took over the corporate CFO role, Doug has positioned us well for the future. We're fortunate to have 2 highly capable long-time Travelers' employees ready to step in. Paul Munson will take over as Corporate Controller and Larry Mills will take over as Treasurer. Thank you, Doug, for all that you have done for the success of our company as well as for the success of the finance professionals who've had the privilege of working for you and working with you.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to deliver exceptional results with a strong first quarter of 2023 in terms of both top and bottom line results. Segment income of $756 million, was up 13% from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher underlying underwriting income. In addition to higher earned premium and the lower underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting income also benefited from the segment share of the onetime tax benefit that Dan mentioned.\nWe're once again particularly pleased with the quarter's underlying combined ratio of 89.6%, which was more than 2 points better than the prior-year quarter. The improvement was driven by the loss ratio, which benefited from property losses that were lower than a somewhat elevated level in the prior-year quarter and the benefit of earned pricing. The expense ratio was a strong 29.8% and continues to benefit from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency.\nNet written premiums increased 15% to an all-time quarterly high of $5.2 billion, benefiting from historically high renewal premium change and retention as well as record new business levels. As you heard from Alan, the Fidelis quota share also contributed to the higher net written premiums.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.6%, with renewal rate change ticking up sequentially to 4.7% and continued strong exposure growth. Retention of 87% also remained exceptional while new business was up 17% from the first quarter of last year to a record high of $639 million.\nWe're thrilled with these production results and our field superior execution in the marketplace. In terms of pricing, we're pleased to be able to sustain strong levels of renewal premium change to address the persistent environmental headwinds. And given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful price increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're very pleased to continue to produce historically strong retention levels.\nLastly, we are particularly pleased that our ongoing focus on our strategic investments help us drive an increased flow of new business opportunities, and we capitalized on those opportunities by being more responsive in quoting and converting our more quality accounts during the quarter.\nAs for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remained strong at 10%, while retention increased to point to an exceptional 84%. New business increased 16% from the prior-year quarter to $129 million, driven particularly by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product.\nIn Middle Market, renewal premium change was 8.1%, with renewal rate change increasing sequentially to 4.4%, while exposure growth was once again strong at 4.1%. Retention remained exceptional at 89% and new business was up 19% from the prior-year quarter with increases across all account sizes in most markets.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, we're pleased with the impact that our focus on strategic initiatives is having on our production results. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to grow our profitable book while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with a great quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income of $207 million was slightly lower than the prior-year quarter. Pretax income improved slightly as higher levels of net favorable prior-year reserve development and net investment income were mostly offset by losses related to disruption in the banking sector. A lower favorable income tax adjustment in the current quarter more than offset this pretax improvement.\nThe segment combined ratio was an excellent 80% for the quarter. The underlying combined ratio was a solid 86.1% with a 3.9 point increase primarily driven by losses related to a few financial institutions and a higher expense ratio, partially offset by the benefit of earned pricing. Our quality risk selection and disciplined limits management continue to position us well to navigate through uncertain economic conditions.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums were strong and consistent with our exceptional top line in the prior-year quarter, which, as you might recall, grew by over 20%. Domestic management liability, considering our strong returns, we're very pleased that retention continued to be at a near record 90%, a 5-point improvement from the prior-year quarter, and net renewal premium change was solid at 5%.\nWe're also pleased that we increased new business 25% from the prior-year quarter. As Alan mentioned during his opening remarks, we're pleased to have driven a very strong and record level of first quarter surety net written premiums. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, driven by excellent execution, benefits from our ongoing strategic investments, and the market-leading competitive advantages and franchise value that we offer our customers and distribution partners.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, first quarter segment income was $83 million. The combined ratio of 101.5%, increased approximately 6 points from the first quarter of 2022, driven by higher catastrophe losses, primarily related to the significant tornado and hail events in March.\nThe underlying combined ratio of 92.9% was comparable to the prior year as the benefit of earned pricing across all products, lower losses in the homeowners and other product line and a lower expense ratio were offset by elevated losses in the automobile product line. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 12%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners.\nIn automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 104.7% with an underlying combined ratio of 103.4%. The underlying combined ratio increased 4.6 points from the prior year due to increased vehicle replacement and repair costs, higher bodily injury severity and to a lesser extent, higher frequency. These increases were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing as well as the lower expense ratio.\nIn Homeowners & Other, the first quarter combined ratio of 98.5%, increased 7.3 points, primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.7%, improved 4.2 points, reflecting lower losses associated with mild winter temperatures in the Eastern and Central United States as well as the benefit of earned pricing and a lower expense ratio. These benefits were partially offset by elevated loss severity from continued labor and materials price increases.\nAs a reminder for homeowners, we expect the upcoming second quarter to be the seasonally highest quarter for weather-related losses.\nTurning to production. Our results demonstrate the impact of rate and non-rate actions in both lines as we seek to improve profitability and manage growth. In domestic automobile, renewal premium change of 13.9% increased 2.5 points from the fourth quarter of 2022. We expect renewal premium change to be modestly higher than this level throughout the remainder of 2023.\nWe've shared previously that we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states representing the majority of our premium by midyear. While the loss environment is incrementally more challenging, we are adjusting our pricing plan accordingly, and still expect to get there or very close to it. We will continue to pursue rate increases necessary to deliver target returns and the benefits of this increased pricing will earn into our results over time.\nAs we've taken significant pricing actions, retention and growth in auto have continued to moderate as expected. Policies in force declined 1% from year-end 2022. In domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change of 20.2% increased approximately 6 points from the fourth quarter. We expect renewal premium change to remain at this elevated level through the end of the year. In the phase of these increases, retention declined but remained strong. New business written premiums were in line compared to the prior year quarter and policies in force remain consistent relative to year-end 2022.\nIn Personal Insurance, we entered the year with continued focus on disciplined marketplace execution in response to a loss environment that remains challenging. In addition to making more progress in pricing, we continue to implement non-rate actions. Examples include tighter underwriting in both auto and home and improved pricing segmentation and risk selection in property.\nWe're encouraged by the progress we're making towards our goal of achieving target returns. While we have more work to do, we are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will improve profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn the call back to Alan.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. I'd like to add to Dan's recognition of Doug Russell. I met Doug in 2002 during Travelers' IPO. He's been a great friend and a source of endless expertise and insight ever since. Doug, we thank you, and we'll miss you, around this table in particular. And thanks for leaving us in such good hands. Abbe, back to you.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSenior Vice President-Investor Relations, The Travelers Cos., Inc.\n\nThanks, Alan. Okay, we are ready to open up for your questions.",

Welcome to the fourth quarter results teleconference for Travelers. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded January 24, 2023. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.\nThey will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions. Before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements.\nThe company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to report this morning a solid bottom line for the quarter, exceptional results in our commercial businesses with higher full year core income and another quarter of attractive margins and strong growth, continued progress addressing the industry-wide loss pressures impacting the Personal Insurance business. Very strong production in all 3 of our business segments, resulting in consolidated net written premium growth of 10% for the quarter and another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives.\nCore income for the quarter was $810 million or $3.40 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 12.3%. These results include $362 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. Core income benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.8 billion, up 10% compared to the prior year period. Our solid underlying combined ratio of 91.4% reflects very strong performance in both of our commercial segments.\nLooking at the 2 commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88.3% for the quarter. You'll hear from Michael shortly about the progress we're making in Personal Insurance and the road map to improve profitability. For the full year, core income of $3 billion or $12.42 per diluted share benefited from higher core income in our commercial segments that was driven by record net earned premiums and strong profitability, including our best ever underlying combined ratio in Business Insurance.\nOur underwriting and investment results, together with our strong balance sheet enabled us to return nearly $3 billion of excess capital to shareholders, including more than $2 billion of share repurchases. At the same time, we grew adjusted book value per share and made important investments in our business.\nTurning to the top line. Thanks once again to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 10% this quarter to $8.8 billion with all 3 segments contributing. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 11% to $4.4 billion. Renewal premium change remained very strong at an historically high 10.1%. In the property line, which has received a lot of attention [post-in], renewal premium change accelerated month-by-month in the quarter. Even with continued strong pricing across the board, retention in BI reached a record high 88%. As you've heard us say before, strong retention is a sign of a stable and rational pricing environment.\nNew business in the segment of $558 million increased 10% from the prior year period. Given the attractive returns in the segment, we're pleased with the very strong retention of our high-quality book of business and the strong level of new business. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 5% on a constant currency basis, driven by excellent production in our market-leading surety business, where net written premiums were up 18%. Production was also strong in our management liability business, with renewal premium change of 6.3%, retention of 90% and new business up 23% from a year ago.\nIn Personal Insurance, top line growth was driven by higher pricing. Renewal premium change was meaningfully higher both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to address the industry-wide loss pressure. Renewal premium change alone contributed more than $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio over the past year. With another quarter of impressive production in each of our segments, we feel very well positioned for the new year. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nOur 2022 results cap off a decade of strong and consistent performance. We posted a double-digit return on equity in every year over the last decade with the exception of 2017, a difficult CAT year for the industry in which we posted a 9% ROE. In every one of those years, we comfortably covered our cost of equity. And over the last 6 years, we have significantly increased our rate of top line growth. We've accomplished all of this with industry low volatility. Successfully investing in differentiating capabilities has been a significant focus for us and an important contributor to our success. As you can see on Slide 24, over the past 5 years, we have meaningfully increased our overall technology spend. At the same time, through our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency, we have significantly reduced our expense ratio.\nIn addition, we have improved the mix of our technology spend, increasing our spending on strategic initiatives by nearly 70%, while holding routine but necessary expenditures about flat. The consistency of our results also benefit from the diversification of our business across our 3 segments. If we look back at the combined ratio over the last 10 years, in 5 of those years, Personal Insurance outperformed business insurance. In the other 5 years, Business Insurance outperformed Personal Insurance. And our Bond & Specialty business delivered spectacular results in every one of those years.\nThe depth and breadth of our diversified businesses is a key advantage and would be very difficult to replicate. Speaking of our business profile, given the economic instability and geopolitical risk around the world, we feel very good about our concentration in North America, the largest, most advanced and most stable economy in the world, where we have the pole position and plenty of room to grow. With uncertain economic conditions ahead, I'll also note, we have a strong track record of performance through a variety of challenging environments over many years. We've got the experience, the know-how and the capabilities along with an efficient operating model and a rock-solid balance sheet to manage through whatever comes our way.\nTo sum things up, I'm grateful to my more than 30,000 colleagues for all they've accomplished this year and over time. Given our strong foundation, our track record of successful innovation and our ambitious road map, we are very confident in the outlook for Travelers.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was $810 million, a very strong result considering the significant impact of CAT 73, the winter storm that occurred in late December. Core income for the full year was $3 billion. For the quarter, core return on equity was 12.3%, including the 5.9 percentage point adverse impact of CAT 73. For the full year, core ROE was 11.3%. As you heard from Alan, our consistently strong performance has delivered double-digit core ROE in 9 of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6% over that time frame, and our adjusted book value per share has nearly doubled over the past decade.\nFor the quarter, underlying underwriting income of $723 million pretax reflected higher levels of earned premium in all 3 segments and a consolidated underlying combined ratio of 91.4%. Terrific underlying combined ratios in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were offset by results in Personal Insurance. Results in all 3 segments reflected the benefit of earned price that exceeded loss trend. One additional comment on underlying underwriting income. Prior to 2020, the highest level of full year underlying underwriting income we had ever reported was $1.5 billion after tax.\nDespite the significant adverse impact of elevated inflation on profitability in Personal Insurance, 2022 marks the third consecutive year with underlying underwriting income above $2 billion after tax. Simply put, our increased premium volumes and diversified portfolio of businesses are generating underwriting profit dollars at a completely different level than where we were just a few years ago. The fourth quarter expense ratio of 27.9% brings the full year expense ratio of 28.5%, our lowest full year expense ratio ever. As we've discussed previously, improvement in the expense ratio has not been achieved through cutting corners or artificially managing expenses for the short term. Rather, we have made and continue to make significant investments in technology and other strategic initiatives that we believe will drive our continued success. Our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency has improved our operating leverage.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we're very comfortable with an expected full year expense ratio in the range of 28.5% to 29%. Our fourth quarter CAT losses were $459 million pretax. Activity in the quarter was driven by $512 million from the large winter storm in late December, which impacted most of the U.S. as well as Canada. While our losses from this event were significant, but were not outsized relative to our modeled estimates for a storm of this size and intensity.\nTurning to prior year reserve development, we had net favorable development of $185 million pretax on a consolidated basis. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $127 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years, partially offset by increased loss estimates for general liability coverages, primarily umbrella, where year-over-year inflation has resulted in more losses reaching excess layers of coverage. The Bond & Specialty segment saw a net favorable development of $51 million, while in Personal Insurance, we recorded net favorable PYD of $7 million.\nAfter-tax net investment income of $531 million reflected another quarter of improving returns and higher invested assets in the fixed income portfolio and modest returns in the alternative portfolio, which we expected given the downturn in the broader equity markets that occurred during the third quarter. Looking forward to 2023, we expect after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to average about $535 million per quarter with an estimated $515 million in Q1, growing to an estimated $560 million in Q4.\nPage 21 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 CAT Treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate CAT XOL Treaty continues to provide coverage for both single CAT events and the aggregation of losses from multiple CAT events. Consistent with the increase in our annual net written premium volume for property, we increased our retention level to $3.5 billion from the prior $3 billion level. The Treaty provides 100% coverage for the $2 billion layer above the $3.5 billion retention. The per occurrence loss deductible remains unchanged at $100 million. We did not renew the underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL Treaty, which was only 45% placed in 2022. As we've said previously, we believe that a hardening reinsurance market provides a relative advantage for Travelers.\nOur consistently strong underwriting results give us an advantage in terms of reinsurance pricing and capacity. That, combined with the fact that we buy less reinsurance than most of our peers gives us a cost of good sold advantage. We can let that fall to the bottom line or reflected in pricing without compromising our return objectives, making us more competitive for attractive new business opportunities.\nOverall, while property reinsurance pricing was higher when we consider the level of price increase as well as changes in terms and conditions we are obtaining on our direct written business, we do not expect a noticeable impact on our net underlying loss ratio for property. Also related to the overall reinsurance market as well as the E&S market, you'll recall that in 2021, we took a minority ownership stake in Fidelis Effective January 1, 2023, we have separately entered into an agreement with Fidelis, whereby Travelers will take a 20% quota share on policies issued by Fidelis with effective dates in 2023. The market for Fidelis products is probably as favorable as it has been in 20 years or so, and the market was impacted by 9/11, dot-com collapse and Hurricane Katrina.\nThis quota share arrangement allows us to participate in the hard market, while also accelerating our understanding of this marketplace. While strategically valuable and expected to be accretive to earnings, the quota share deal is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results. Our portion of net written premiums from Fidelis is expected to be around $550 million to $600 million for the full year, and those premiums will be reflected within the international results of Business Insurance.\nDetailed terms of the quota share have not been disclosed, but we can share that there is a loss ratio cap to ensure that even a worst case underwriting scenario is boxed to a very manageable impact on Travelers. Turning to capital management. Operating cash flow for the quarter of $1.3 billion was again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion.\nFor the full year, operating cash flow was once again very strong at $6.5 billion, reflecting the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, strong profitability and paid losses that for the full year were once again less than 90% of incurred losses. As we've said previously, we are assuming that this lower level of payment activity is ultimately a timing issue. In establishing our reserves and pricing our products, we assume that elevated severity related to social inflation has not abated at all. Our substantial cash flows give us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio, which increased to $86.7 billion, excluding net unrealized losses at year-end.\nInterest rates increased slightly during the fourth quarter, but spreads narrowed, and accordingly, our net unrealized investment loss decreased from $6.3 billion after tax as of September 30 to $4.9 billion after tax at year-end. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses was $114 at year-end, up 4% from a year ago. We returned $721 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $220 million and share repurchases of $501 million.\nFor the year, we returned $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.1 billion of share repurchases. Overall, we had another very good year with strong top line growth in all 3 business segments, excellent and improved margins in our commercial businesses, our best ever expense ratio and a very strong balance sheet that has us well positioned for whatever economic conditions the future may bring.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding a terrific year in terms of financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. We're firing on all cylinders. Segment income for the quarter was $725 million with an all-in combined ratio of 89.5%, both great results. We're once again particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio, which was also 89.5%, an all-time best fourth quarter result.\nThe underlying loss ratio increased by a little more than 0.5 point as the benefit of earned pricing was more than offset by the comparison to the prior year quarter, which benefited from both a particularly low level of property losses and the favorable impact associated with the pandemic. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was more than offset by a lower expense ratio that benefited from our ongoing strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums for the quarter were up 11% from the prior year quarter to a fourth quarter record of $4.4 billion, benefiting from strong renewal premium change, high retention and an increase in new business levels.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 10.1%, with renewal rechange of 4.5% and record growth in exposure. Retention reached an all-time high at 88%. New business of $558 million was the strongest fourth quarter we've ever produced. At the product level, in addition to what you heard from Alan about pricing in the property line, terms and conditions and the line tightened over the course of the quarter, further improving the price per unit of risk. While not reflected in our production metrics, this improvement in the price per unit of risk will contribute to our profitability over time.\nIn workers' comp, renewal rate change was a little more negative than we've seen in recent quarters, which is a reflection of the strong profitability in the line and the benefit of continued strong exposure growth. Overall, workers' comp renewal premium change was positive in the mid-single-digit range and actually a little higher year-over-year. We're pleased with these strong production results and the excellent execution by our colleagues in the field.\nGiven our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases, together with improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to achieve this historically strong retention levels. The pricing gains we achieved in the quarter reflect our deliberate execution, which balanced the persistent headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment with the improvement in profitability across our portfolio after several years of strong pricing. As always, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to maintain profitable growth.\nAs for the individual businesses, in select, both renewal premium change of 10.8% and retention of 83% were strong. New business was up 6% from the prior year quarter, driven primarily by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product as well as growth in other lines. We're pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of this business over the last couple of years, while continuing to invest for future growth.\nIn middle market, renewal premium change remained historically strong at 8.8%, while retention of 91% reached an all-time best. New business was up 13% from the prior year quarter. As for full year results, segment income of more than $2.5 billion was exceptional, benefiting from record earned premium in our best-ever underlying combined ratio.\nIn addition, the top line of $17.6 billion and full year retention were both record highs, while new business premiums were near in all-time high. These results were driven by the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies. And while delivering these financial and production results, we've also continued to invest in strategic capabilities that will enhance our many competitive advantages, designed to enable us to continue delivering profitable growth over time. For example, during the year, we advanced our already state-of-the-art product and service capabilities by continuing to roll out our BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 46 states as well as launching our new commercial auto product in a handful of states. Both products contain industry-leading segmentation.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress on developing industry-leading user experience capabilities to make it easier and more efficient for our distribution partners and customers to do business with us. In particular, in our middle market business, we advanced our capabilities around digitizing the underwriting transaction for our agents and brokers. And in our Small Commercial segment, we launched our new front-end rate quote and issue interface platform to make it faster and easier for our agents to write business with us, all while maintaining the underwriting discipline and specialization behind the scenes.\nAnd finally, we continued to improve our operating leverage through our relentless focus on productivity and efficiency, as I referenced earlier. I'll note that our full year expense ratio of 29.7% is down more than 2.5 points from the 2016 level. We're proud of these results and the team that produce them.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended a terrific 2022 with another great quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $221 million, up 30% from the prior year quarter, driven by strong and higher earned premium and an exceptionally strong combined ratio, which benefited from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was also strong and improved about 1.5 points from the prior year quarter to a terrific 81.7%, driven by the benefit of earned pricing.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 5%, excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Domestic Surety grew an outstanding 18% in the quarter, driven by an increase in the number of bonds issued and higher average bond premiums. In domestic management liability, given the strong returns, we're very pleased that we increased retention 1 point from last quarter to a near record 90%. That's a 4-point improvement from the prior year quarter.\nRenewal premium change was solid at 6.3%, and we're also pleased that we increased new business 23% from the prior year quarter. Excluding FX, net written premium in our international business contracted modestly from the exceptionally strong fourth quarter of 2021, primarily due to the impact of the significant decline in merger and acquisition activity on our transactional liability book of business.\nFor the full year, Bond & Specialty produced record earned premiums and an outstanding combined ratio of 75.3%, driving segment income above $900 million for the first time ever. So for both the quarter and year, our results were terrific, driven by excellent execution, returns from our ongoing strategic investments in our competitive advantages and the market-leading value proposition that we offer our customers and distribution partners.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance, the fourth quarter loss of $61 million and a combined ratio of 105.3% were negatively impacted by the weather event in late December as well as elevated underlying loss activity in both automobile and homeowners and other. While our results aren't meeting our target returns, we are encouraged by our strong marketplace execution as we continue to respond to the loss environment with both increased pricing and non-rate actions.\nNet written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, driven by double-digit renewal premium change in both domestic automobile and homeowners, reflecting our focus on improving profitability. In automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 111.4%. As a reminder, while there is some seasonality in auto every quarter, the fourth quarter typically has an elevated loss ratio driven by things like holiday driving in Northeast winter weather.\nOver the last 10 years, the fourth quarter underlying loss ratio has been approximately 6 to 7 points above the average for the first 3 quarters. Seasonality aside, the underlying combined ratio of 110.5% increased 6.7 points from the fourth quarter of 2021, primarily related to the continued inflationary impact on vehicle replacement and repair costs, as well as increased claim frequency, which returns to pre-pandemic levels in the quarter and higher bodily injury severity.\nThese loss impacts were partially offset by the growing benefit of earned pricing and a 1 point reduction in the expense ratio. Separately, the current quarter results included a modest impact for the reestimation of prior quarters. We continue to factor our latest view of loss experience into our pricing actions going forward. In Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 99.4%. This was 21.6 points higher relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses that were [13 points, 2 points] higher than the prior year period and a higher underlying combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio of 82.2% increased 8.8 points. This increase was primarily driven by higher loss severity related to continued labor and material price increases as well as higher non-catastrophe weather losses. This loss pressure was partially offset by the current quarter benefit of earned pricing.\nTurning to production. Quarterly results reflect our rate and non-rate actions as we seek to manage growth and improve profitability. In domestic automobile, retention moderated this quarter as renewal premium change increased 3 points from the third quarter to 11.4%. New business written premiums declined 3% compared to the prior year, and policies in force were essentially flat with last quarter as our additional rate and non-rate actions are taking effect.\nIn domestic Homeowners and Other, we achieved renewal premium change of 14.5% in the fourth quarter. The retention remained strong at 84%. Slide 17 provides a graphical representation of renewal premium change in domestic automobile and homeowners and other. We added this view to highlight our progress with respect to renewal premium change over the last several quarters. The magnitude and speed of our pricing actions simultaneously across both lines of business is significant. As Alan mentioned, we have added over $1 billion of written premium to our portfolio in 2022 as a result of the high levels of renewal premium change. The benefits of this increased pricing will continue to earn into our results over time.\nLooking ahead to 2023, renewal premium change in both lines of business will increase above these already very strong levels as we continue to take action to improve profitability. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we expect written pricing in auto to be adequate in states representing the majority of our business by midyear 2023.\nIn 2022, our team met a challenging environment head-on and took action to address rising costs. We are confident that the actions we have taken and will continue to take will drive improved profitability as we move through 2023 and beyond.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks very much, and we're happy to open up for your questions now.",

Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our Third Quarter 2022 Results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment Presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.\nThey will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take your questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.\nAlso in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by acknowledging the devastation and loss of life caused by Hurricanes Ian and Fiona. We're thinking of all those who have been impacted and are supporting the Red Cross' disaster relief efforts.\nIn addition, as always, after events like these, we're focused on taking care of our customers. We're on track to meet our objective of resolving 90% of our property claims arising out of the storms within 30 days. My thanks to all our claim colleagues who are working hard to make that happen. Moving to our results. We're pleased to report this morning a solid bottom line for the quarter, particularly in light of the significant industry-wide catastrophe losses, strong and improved underwriting profitability in our commercial business segments, progress addressing the environmental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry. A meaningful contribution from net investment income, including positive returns from our alternative investment portfolio, notwithstanding the challenging equity market. Very strong production in all 3 of our business segments, resulting in strong growth in net written premiums and another quarter of successful execution on a number of important strategic initiatives.\nCore income for the quarter was $526 million or $2.20 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 7.9%. These results benefited from record net earned premiums of $8.6 billion, up 10% over the prior year quarter and a solid underlying combined ratio of 92.5%. The 9 months core return on equity was 10.9%. Given the challenging environmental issues impacting the personal insurance industry, these consolidated results once again demonstrate the benefit of our diversified portfolio of businesses.\nWe're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results in our commercial businesses. Looking at the 2 commercial segments together, the aggregate BI BSI underlying combined ratio was an excellent 88% for the quarter. As expected, results in Personal Insurance were impacted by elevated severity in both auto and home.\nAs you'll hear from Michael, we're continuing to make progress addressing the environmental loss cost issues. In terms of the catastrophe losses, as I've described before, strategic efforts we have undertaken in recent years have enabled us to more effectively manage our exposure to catastrophes and more efficiently mobilize our claim response.\nAnd while there is always the potential for us to have outsized exposure to an event, those efforts contributed to losses for us from Hurricane Ian, that based on current estimates, are favorable relative to our corresponding market share. That's consistent with our experience over the past 5 years. Our share of the industry's Property cat losses over that period has been meaningfully lower than our corresponding market share. Our capabilities position us well for a trend of increasing frequency and severity of losses from natural catastrophes.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $505 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting higher returns from our fixed income portfolio and positive returns in our nonfixed income portfolio. Our strong operating results over the past few quarters, together with our solid balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 7% over the past year, after making important investments in our business in continuing to return excess capital to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $722 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including $501 million of share repurchases. Turning to the top line, thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 10% this quarter to a record $9.2 billion.\nIn Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 9%. Renewal premium change was very strong at a historically high 10.2% and while pure renewal rate change of 5% was higher than in the first half of the year. Retention remained very strong at 86% and new business increased 9% from the prior year period.\nUnderneath the headline numbers, execution in terms of rate and retention at a segmented level, continue to be exceptional. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 8% and driven by excellent production in both our surety and management liability businesses. Surety net written premiums were up 18%. Management liability premiums were up 4%, driven by renewal premium change of 9%, retention that increased to 89% and 20% growth in new business.\nIn Personal Insurance, renewal premium change was meaningfully higher, both year-over-year and sequentially and as we continue to address the environmental headwinds. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results. Before I turn the call over to Dan, I'd like to comment on a public policy issue.\nHurricane Ian puts a spotlight on the troubled condition of the Florida insurance market. Other states may be headed for similar challenges. As policymakers consider how best to address the availability and affordability of insurance, we would urge them to consider the impacts of the unhealthy tort environment, fraud and abuse by a few that impact too many and regulatory practices that undermine free market principles. I believe those factors are at least as consequential as the weather itself to the industry's ability to provide our communities with effective and efficient ways to manage risk.\nWe're looking forward to being a participant in constructive conversations about solutions in the days ahead. To sum things up, building on our strong results so far this year, we're confident about our outlook. Our commercial lines businesses are generating terrific results. We're achieving meaningful price increases in personal lines. And our high-quality investment portfolio is poised to generate meaningfully higher levels of fixed income NII going forward. When we combine that and the success we've had with our [performative] call to action, we're very confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value over time. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the third quarter was $526 million and core return on equity was 7.9%. On a year-to-date basis, core ROE is a healthy 10.9%. Our after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $478 million was once again very strong. We generated record earned premium and reported an underlying combined ratio of 92.5%. In both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty, the underlying combined ratios were particularly good and improved from the prior year quarter. While in Personal Insurance, the underlying combined ratio was elevated.\nGreg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. The expense ratio for the quarter of 28.1% was our best ever quarterly results, having improved 1.3 points from last year's third quarter. As a reminder, the expense ratio has improved even as we continue to increase our significant investment in strategic initiatives.\nWith the improvement driven by our focus on productivity and efficiency, coupled with strong top line growth. In our earnings call last quarter, we told you that we expected the expense ratio to be around 29% for the full year. And with the year-to-date expense ratio at 28.7%, it looks like we'll do a little better than 29%.\nOur third quarter results include $512 million of pretax catastrophe losses, with $326 million related to Hurricane Ian. We hold ourselves accountable for managing our cat exposures over time, and Ian is another illustration of our industry-leading expertise. As you heard from Alan, based on available industry estimates for Ian, Traveler's share of losses looks to be well below our weighted average market share in the affected states.\nThe investments we've made in talent, technology and sophisticated peril-by-peril modeling are paying off in terms of risk selection, pricing segmentation, risk mitigation and our industry-leading claim response capabilities. Regarding cat losses in reinsurance, on a year-to-date basis through September 30, we've accumulated $1.4 billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $2 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty.\nA couple of additional comments on reinsurance. Based on what we're hearing from the reinsurance community, it sounds like the market is aimed for higher pricing and capacity constraints. In terms of primary carriers, that's going to impact some much more than others. For 2 reasons, we would expect to be less impacted than others.\nFirst, as a disciplined gross line underwriter, we just don't buy that much reinsurance compared to many others; second, we have a long track record of strong underwriting performance, consistently outperforming the industry. The upshot of those factors is that we generally expect to be able to obtain the reinsurance coverage we need at acceptable prices.\nAlso, because we're less reliant on reassurance, we should be less affected by price increases and capacity constraints. With less of an impact on our cost structure, we should have the option to expand our margin advantage or to reflect that cost advantage in our pricing, making us more competitive for attractive new business opportunities.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $20 million pretax in the third quarter. In Business Insurance, net unfavorable PYD of $61 million was driven by a $212 million charge related to our annual asbestos review, largely offset by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years as well as favorable development in property. In Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $63 million was driven by better-than-expected results in Fidelity and Surety as well as the management liability book.\nPersonal Insurance had $18 million of net favorable PYD with modest movements in both auto and home. One additional comment on asbestos. Loss activity and the level of deaths related to mesothelioma did moderate somewhat in the most recent data available for review, but not to the degree we had projected. Nonetheless, the long-term trend is that mesothelioma mortality rates are declining.\nAfter-tax net investment income decreased by 22% from the prior year quarter to $505 million. As expected, returns in our nonfixed income portfolio were below last year's excellent results, although we were pleased that the alternative portfolio generated positive income despite the significant downturn in the broader equity markets. Fixed maturity NII was higher than in the prior year quarter, reflecting both the higher level of invested assets and the impact of higher yields.\nWith interest rates having moved higher during the third quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $500 million after tax in the fourth quarter and approximately $540 million on average per quarter in 2023. With an estimated $515 million in the first quarter, growing to an estimated $570 million in the fourth quarter. New money rates as of September 30 were about 150 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio.\nAnd with rates having moved up again in October, that difference is now around 200 basis points. As it relates to our nonfixed income investments, let me take this opportunity to remind you that results for our private equities, real estate partnerships and hedge funds are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. Since our non-fixed income returns tend to directionally follow the broader equity marks, we expect the downturn experienced by the broader market in the third quarter to impact our fourth quarter results.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $2.5 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than our target levels. And we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of more than $1.4 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads continued to widen during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $3.8 billion after tax at June 30, to $6.3 billion after tax at September 30.\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We regularly hold fixed income investments to maturity, but quality of our fixed income portfolio is, as always, very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on the expected cash flow from those investments, our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $111.90 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 7% from a year ago. We returned $722 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $501 million and dividends of $221 million. We have approximately $2.5 billion of capacity remaining under the most recent share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nTo sum it all up, we had another very good quarter in light of the impact from Ian, with strong premium growth in all 3 segments, terrific underlying underwriting profitability in our commercial businesses and further improvement to our outlook for fixed income NII. All of that, combined with another quarter of progress on important strategic initiatives has us well positioned to continue to grow at attractive returns. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had an excellent quarter with segment income of $471 million. We're particularly pleased with our exceptional underlying combined ratio, which improved to 90% for the quarter. This result is a testament to our execution and focus on achieving our target returns. The underlying loss ratio increased by about 1 point as the benefit of earned pricing was more than offset by the comparison to both the low level of property losses and the favorable impact associated with the pandemic in the prior year quarter.\nThe increase in the underlying loss ratio was more than offset by a lower expense ratio that benefited from our ongoing strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums of $4.4 billion were up 9% over the prior year quarter, with growth in all domestic markets and lines of business. Premiums benefited from strong renewal premium change [and] retention, both of which were once again historically high as well as higher levels of new business.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change of 10.2% was once again exceptionally strong. RPC included renewal rate change of 5%, a tick up from the second quarter and strong exposure growth.\nRetention remained very strong at 86% and new business premium was more than $500 million, up 9% over the prior year. We're pleased with the strong production results and the excellent execution by our colleagues in the field. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect our deliberate execution, which balanced the persistent headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment with the improvement in profitability across our portfolio after several years of strong pricing.\nAs always, we'll continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to maintain profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change remains healthy at 10.6%, while retention of 83% was up 2 points from the prior year quarter. New business was up 8% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In middle market, renewal premium change remained very strong at over 9% while retention was higher year-over-year and sequentially at an excellent 89%.\nNew business premium of $271 million was up 5% over the prior year. To sum up, Business Insurance had another terrific quarter. We're pleased with our execution in driving strong financial results while continuing to invest in the business for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty had an outstanding quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $242 million, up 39% from the prior year quarter, driven by record underlying underwriting income and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development.\nThe underlying combined ratio was a terrific 78.4%, an improvement of 5 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting both the benefit of earned pricing and about a 2-point impact from the favorable reestimation of losses for the first 2 quarters of 2022. Turning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 8% in the quarter to a record high with contributions from all our businesses. Domestic Surety grew an outstanding 18% in the quarter, driven by larger average bond premiums.\nIn domestic management liability renewal premium change remained strong at 9% while we improve retention by 1 point to a terrific 89%. We're also pleased that we increased new business 20% from the prior year quarter as we leveraged the investments we've made and continue to make in our competitive advantages to grow these profitable businesses. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were again terrific this quarter, reflecting continued excellent execution across our business and the value of our market-leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter, Personal Insurance reported a combined ratio of 107.2%, up approximately 2.5 points compared to the prior year quarter, primarily driven by a higher underlying combined ratio. The 4-point increase in the underlying combined ratio reflects the continuing environmental challenge of elevated loss severity in both automobile and homeowners.\nThe loss impacts were partially offset by a 2-point reduction in the expense ratio. For the quarter, catastrophe losses were $285 million and included losses from Hurricane Ian, most of which are Florida automobile losses. Catastrophes were 2 points lower than the prior year quarter, which included Hurricane Ida. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 13%, primarily driven by very strong price increases in both domestic automobile and homeowners and other.\nIn automobile, the third quarter combined ratio was 112.2%, including nearly 8 points of catastrophe losses. The underlying combined ratio was 103.9%, an increase of 6.9 points relative to the prior year quarter. The increase reflects another quarter of elevated vehicle replacement and repair costs, and to a lesser extent, the continued return toward pre-pandemic driving and claim frequency levels.\nOur primary response to these environmental challenges is higher pricing. We are pleased with our progress this quarter, building on our actions to increase rates over the past few quarters. While pricing continues to gain momentum, it will still take some time for rate actions to fully earn into our results. In Homeowners and Other, the third quarter combined ratio was 102.3%, an improvement relative to the third quarter of 2021 as catastrophe losses in property were lower.\nThe underlying combined ratio of 94.9% increased about 1.5 points from the prior year quarter. We continue to experience higher loss severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases in the quarter, but that loss pressure was largely offset by the current quarter benefit of earned pricing, lower non-catastrophe weather losses and a lower expense ratio.\nTurning to quarterly production. We continue to make excellent progress in achieving pricing increases. I'll discuss homeowners and other production first this morning before spending a bit more time on automobile. For domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change increased to 14.1% and retention decreased slightly to 83%, both consistent with our expectations. We expect renewal premium change to continue at these levels for the remainder of 2022.\nLooking ahead to 2023, we expect renewal premium change to increase above these already very strong levels as we implement additional and certain value increases. For domestic automobile, renewal premium change increased to 8.1%, while retention was 83%, also consistent with our expectations. During the quarter, we implemented price increases in 26 states at an average of about 8.5%. We expect that domestic automobile renewal premium change will get into double digits in the fourth quarter and be in the mid-teens throughout 2023.\nWritten pricing should reach adequacy in most states, representing the majority of our business between now and mid-2023, and that pricing will earn into our results over time. In addition to increased pricing, we're also implementing additional nonrate actions, including further tightening underwriting criteria, restricting binding authority for agents in certain states and removing our auto product from comparative raters in California and Florida.\nThese actions will help us manage growth and improve profitability. Personal Insurance has a strong track record of financial performance, demonstrated by our over 40% net written premium growth and 97% combined ratio for the 5-year period from 2017 to 2021. While we and the industry continue to face near-term environmental headwinds, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive returns over time while continuing to build the business for the future. Now I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and we are ready to open up for Q&A.",

Welcome to the second quarter results teleconference for Travelers. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on July 21, 2022.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, CFO; and our 3 segment presidents: Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance, Jeff Klenk of Specialty Insurance and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are pleased to report a very strong second quarter, including an excellent bottom-line result, double-digit top line growth in all 3 segments, strong and improved profitability in our commercial business segment, progress addressing the rental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry, a meaningful contribution from net investment income and another quarter of progress on a number of important strategic initiatives.\nCore income for the quarter was $625 million or $2.50 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 9.3%. These results were driven by record net earned premiums of $8.3 billion, up 9% over the prior year quarter and a solid underlying combined ratio of 92.8% -- environmental issues impacting insurance industry, consolidated results reflect the benefit of our diversified portfolio of businesses.\nFor the 6 months, core -- was ahead of the prior year at $1.66 billion, an excellent first half result. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results for our commercial businesses. Looking at the 2 commercial businesses together, the combined BI-BSI underlying combined ratio of 2.7% for the quarter, an improvement of 1 point from the prior year quarter.\nResults in Personal Insurance were impacted by elevated severity in both auto and home. As you'll hear from Michael, we're on the right track in addressing the environmental issues. Excellent operations together with our balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 8% over the past year after making important investments in our business, turning excess capital to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $725 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including $500 million of share repurchases.\nTurning to the top line, thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners, we grew net written premiums by 11% this quarter to a record $9 billion with, as I mentioned, each of our 3 segments growing double digits.\nIn Business Insurance, net working premiums grew by 10%. Renewal premium change was 10.3%. That's the fourth highest quarterly renewal premium change going back more than 15 years. Renewal premium change included renewal rate change of 4.9%. Both measures moved up from the preceding quarter.\nRetention remained very strong at 86%. We have a high-quality book of business and keeping it as a priority. Also, as we've shared previously, strong retention is a sign of a rational and stable pricing market.\nUnderneath the headline numbers, execution in terms of rate retention at a segmented level was excellent. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 13%, driven by excellent production in both our Surety and Management Liability businesses. Surety net written premiums were up 24%. Management Liability premiums were up 7% and driven by a rental premium change of 8.8%, retention that increased to a very strong 88% and strong new business.\nIn Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12%. We know a premium change was meaningfully higher, both year-over-year and sequentially in auto and homeowners as we continue to execute to improve returns. You'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality portfolio generated net investment income of $595 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and another quarter of strong returns from our nonfixed income portfolio.\nSpeaking of investments, given the potential for a difficult economic environment ahead, we've included on Page 19 of the webcast presentation a slide breaking down the composition of our investment portfolio. Consistent with our long-time focus on risk-adjusted returns, we're underweight compared to most in terms of risk assets as a percentage of shareholders' equity.\nOur investment philosophy has served us well over many years and through many different market cycles. It starts with asset allocation. More than 90% of our $80 billion portfolio is invested in fixed income securities. That sets us apart.\nInside that, we also have relatively high allocation to municipal bonds where the default rate has been meaningfully lower as compared to corporate bonds. Even within munis, we're discriminating. We're invested in only about 1,000 municipal issuers out of an estimated 80,000. Virtually all of our municipal bond holdings are rated AA- or higher.\nOur corporate bond portfolio is curated with the same level of discipline. Virtually all of it is investment grade. And within that, we are meaningful overweight AA and A credits and meaningfully underweight BBB credit.\nDuring times of economic distress, credit quality is key and in the sometimes foreseeable and sometimes unforeseeable lead up to those times, when spreads widen and volatility increases, the market doesn't allow for a graceful repositioning of a portfolio. So we stay true to the strategy that has served us well over decades.\nOur level of actual impairments over a long period of time has been remarkably low. In 2008 and 2009, with the Moody's default percentage reached 2% to 2.5%, our default rate never reached 1%. In the COVID charge turmoil of 2020, when the Moody's default rate at 1%, our portfolio default rate was around 10 basis points.\nAnd given the credit quality of our portfolio, the fact that we hold the vast majority of fixed income investments to maturity, decreases in market value due to rising interest rates as the market is experiencing now have little to no impact on how we run the business or how we view the strength of our capital position.\nIn terms of our investments in alternative asset class, we don't reach for yield. Our private equity portfolio is well diversified across strategies, sectors and general partners. Our own real estate is high quality and entirely unlevered. And we have little in the way of hedge funds and higher risk assets.\nAlthough we see potential short-term headwinds from recent declines in the equity markets, we also see near-term and potentially ongoing tailwinds from higher interest rates that will benefit our returns going forward. You'll hear from Dan shortly about how the recent rise in interest rates positively impacts our outlook for fixed income NII.\nLike everything we do, all starts with our tower. We have a world-class investment team that is responsible for executing on our investment philosophy. Those with position-making authority have worked with us and with each other for an average of around 20 years. That reinforces the long-term perspective we bring to our investment portfolio.\nI'm always grateful for their excellent work. But particularly at times like this, I'm reminded of the wisdom of our approach. It has contributed to a long history of industry-leading returns and industry-low volatility.\nTo sum things up, building on our excellent results in the first half of the year, we're confident about our outlook, benefiting from years of strategic investments as part of our performance transform called action, guided by our decades of experience successfully executing in a variety of macroeconomic conditions and supported by an outlook for improving fixed income returns. We remain well positioned to deliver industry-leading returns and shareholder value over time.\nWith that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the second quarter was $625 million and core return on equity was 9.3%. These results were very strong, especially considering the high level of cat losses, which is typical seasonality for us in the second quarter. While core income declined from the prior year quarter, remember that the prior year quarter included a very benign level of cat losses and record returns from the non-fixed income portfolio.\nOur second quarter results include $746 million of pretax catastrophe losses. And while cats were higher year-over-year, they were not outsized relative to our modeled estimates for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've accumulated $935 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of $2 billion on our property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty.\nOur after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $444 million was down slightly from the prior year quarter. We generated record levels of earned premium and reported an underlying combined ratio of 92.8%. Improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were more than offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in personal insurance. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes.\nAt the same time that we continue to make significant investments in strategic initiatives, the second quarter expense ratio improved 70 basis points from last year to 29% driven by the combination of our focus on productivity and efficiency and strong top line growth. We had been expecting the full year expense ratio to be around 29.5% but now expected to be more like 29% this year, getting down to that level a little sooner than we had expected.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $291 million pretax in the second quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $202 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across a number of accident years and favorable movement in CMP partially offset by an increase in general liability reserves, including for runoff operations.\nIn Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $73 million was driven by better-than-expected results in Fidelity and Surety. Personal Insurance had $16 million of net favorable PYD with modest movement in both auto and home.\nAfter-tax net investment income decreased by 13% from the prior year quarter to $595 million. We were pleased that returns in our nonfixed income portfolio were strong, but as expected, they were less favorable than last year's record quarter. Fixed maturity NII was again higher than in the prior year quarter as the benefit of higher invested assets more than offset the impact of lower average yields during the quarter.\nWith interest rates having moved higher during the second quarter, we are again raising our outlook for fixed income NII including earnings from short-term securities to approximately $470 million after tax in the third quarter and then to $495 million in the fourth quarter.\nNew money rates as of June 30 are about 100 basis points higher than what is embedded in the portfolio. So NII should continue to improve as the portfolio gradually turns over and as the portfolio continues to grow. Recall that results for our private equities, real estate partnerships and hedge funds are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. While not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns directionally follow the broader equity markets, which were down significantly during the second quarter.\nThrough the first half of the year, the S&P 500 was down 21% with about 3/4 of that decline occurring in Q2. Accordingly, we expect that to impact our nonfixed income results next quarter.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.4 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.6 billion. Interest rates increased and spreads continued to widen during the quarter. And as a result, our net unrealized investment loss increased from $1.4 billion after tax at March 31 to $3.8 billion after tax at June 30.\nAs we've discussed in prior quarters, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses generally do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We regularly hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains, as Alan discussed, very high. And changes in unrealized gains and losses have little impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses, was $112.37 at quarter end, up 2.4% from year-end and up 8.2% from a year ago. We returned $725 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of $500 million and dividends of $225 million. We have approximately $3 billion of capacity remaining under the most recent share repurchase authorization from our Board of Directors.\nIt's also worth noting that in June, we early renewed our $1 billion credit facility for a 5-year term. While the size of the facility and the group of participating banks was unchanged, we reduced our annual cost of the facility primarily through lower undrawn pricing while also improving other terms and conditions. In a time of rising borrowing costs and tightening credit terms, our financial strength, strong operating performance and consistent fiscal discipline still enable us to obtain very favorable terms. You can see all the details in our 10-Q.\nSimilarly, during the second quarter, we issued a new 4-year cat bond, providing uninterrupted coverage upon the expiration of our prior cat bonds. The new bond, Long Point Re IV Ltd increases the amount of coverage available to $575 million. The recently expired cat bonds had provided $500 million worth of coverage. Specific terms are shown on Page 20 of the webcast presentation, and we're very pleased with the results.\nHere again, our disciplined underwriting and consistent outperformance in the property line enabled us to increase our coverage and attain a reasonable rate online at a time when some parts of the market are finding reinsurance capacity harder to come by.\nAlso on Page 20 of the webcast presentation, you'll find a summary of our July 1 reinsurance renewals. The structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the expiring program. And while as expected, we did see some price increase. It was in line with the price increases we're obtaining on the direct property premiums we're writing. So there's no adverse impact on margins.\nIt's also worth noting that we increased the coverage under our Northeast property treaty by $150 million to $750 million, part of $850 million, above the same $2.25 billion attachment point.\nSo to sum it up, we had an excellent quarter with double-digit premium growth in all 3 segments, solid underwriting profitability and an improved outlook for fixed income NII, all of which bodes well for our future returns.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance continues to have a strong 2022 with another terrific quarter in terms of both financial results and execution in the marketplace. Second quarter segment income was $666 million, up about 4% from the prior year quarter driven by higher net favorable prior year reserve development and higher underlying underwriting income.\nThe quarter's very strong underlying combined ratio of 92.4% was about 1 point better than the second quarter of 2021 driven by improvement in the expense ratio resulting from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and the benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. The underlying loss ratio was about flat to the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher earned pricing as well as elevated property loss activity in the current quarter.\nNet written premiums were up in all domestic markets and lines of business, reaching $4.4 billion for an increase of 10%. Premiums benefited from strong renewal premium change and retention, both of which were once again historically high.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change of 10.3% was once again exceptionally strong. RPC includes renewal rate change of 4.9%, which was up 0.5 points from the first quarter and exposure growth of almost 6%. Retention was very strong at 86%. New business premium was about $500 million for the quarter.\nWe're pleased with these production results and our strong execution in the marketplace. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of segmented rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to continue to produce historically strong retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio while continuing the price for the persisting headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment.\nAs always, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sub-limits and exclusions to achieve profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was strong at over 9% while retention of 83% was up 3 points from the prior year quarter.\nNew business was up 8% from the prior year quarter driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product. In addition to contributing to growth, the new BOP product is also contributing to improved margins in this business through industry-leading segmentation. Overall for Select, we're pleased with the improvement in profitability levels as well as the continued momentum in new business growth.\nIn Middle Market, renewal premium change remained very strong at over 10% while retention remained historically high at 88%. Underneath the RPC of 10%, renewal rate change of 4.8% was up 0.5 point from the first quarter while exposure growth was nearly 6%.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had a terrific first half of the year. We continued to deliver strong results while investing in capabilities to enhance our data and analytics leadership, digitize the commercial transaction and develop sophisticated and relevant products to drive profitable growth for the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty had a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $228 million, up 22% from the prior year quarter driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development and higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio was an excellent 82.2%, an improvement of 1.2 points from the prior year quarter.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums grew a very strong 13% in the quarter to a record high with contributions from all our businesses. Domestic Surety posted exceptional 24% growth in the quarter driven by larger average bond premiums.\nIn domestic Management Liability, we are pleased that we drove a 2-point improvement in retention while renewal premium change of 8.8% remains strong following 6 straight double-digit quarters. We're also pleased that we increased new business 16% from the prior year quarter.\nSo both top and bottom-line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, reflecting excellent execution across our business and the value of our market-leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter, Personal Insurance reported a combined ratio of 111%. While it's not unusual for us to generate an underwriting loss in the second quarter, it typically has the highest weather-related loss activity, this quarter's results were also impacted by the inflationary pressure that we and the industry have been experiencing for the past few quarters.\nIn total, the combined ratio increased 11.5 points compared to the prior year quarter and included a higher underlying combined ratio, higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior year reserve development. The 5-point increase in the underlying combined ratio reflects elevated loss severity in both automobile and homeowners and other, and in comparison to a low level of automobile losses in the prior year quarter.\nCatastrophe losses were nearly 5 points higher than in the prior year quarter but not out of line with our assumption for second quarter catastrophes. Net written premiums for the quarter grew 12% driven by higher renewal premium changes in both domestic automobile and Homeowners & Other.\nIn automobile, the second quarter combined ratio was 104.3% and the underlying combined ratio was 101.8%, an increase of about 10 points relative to the prior year quarter. The increase reflects elevated vehicle replacement and repair costs. To a lesser extent, the increase is also a result of a comparison to a prior year quarter that still reflected lower loss -- lower claim frequency related to the pandemic.\nOur primary response to the environmental challenge of inflation is higher pricing. We are pleased with our actions to increase rates over the past few quarters and remain confident in our ability to achieve further increases. As we have indicated in past quarters, it will take some time for rate actions to fully earn into our results.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the second quarter combined ratio was 118% and included 29 points of catastrophes primarily from severe wind and hail events across several regions in the U.S. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90.3%, comparable to the prior year quarter. We continue to experience loss severity related to a -- higher loss severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases, but that was largely offset by various items, including a comparison to a prior year quarter that included elevated non-weather losses as well as the current quarter benefits of earned pricing.\nTurning to quarterly production. We continue to make excellent progress in achieving pricing increases. For domestic automobile, renewal premium change was 6.3%, up a full 3 points from the first quarter of 2022. We continue to increase renewal premium changes and expect RPC to reach double digits by the fourth quarter.\nFor domestic homeowners and other, renewal premium change increased about 1.5 points from the first quarter to a record high of 13.5%. The increase in renewal premium change was from both higher insured values and increased rate.\nWhile our primary focus is on improving profitability, we're not distracted from continuing to invest in capabilities to sustain our success. For example, in the quarter, we introduced new artificial intelligence-enabled aerial imagery to enhance our property underwriting and risk selection while simplifying the quoting process for agency customers. This is just one example of how we continue to advance our sophistication and risk expertise as part of our innovation agenda.\nWith our focus on performing -- on both performing and transforming, we remain confident in our ability to improve profitability over time while continuing to build the business for the future.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, and we are ready to open up for Q&A.",

Welcome to the first quarter results teleconference for Travelers. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 19, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin. .\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2022 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 segment Presidents, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.\nBefore I turn the call over, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.\nThese factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release, in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.\nOne more thing before I turn the call over to Alan, I'd like to direct your attention to our updated overview of Travelers' presentation that we posted on the Investors section of our website. There's a lot of terrific background and other content in this document. I would encourage you to take a look at it, whether you're familiar with Travelers or new to our story. And with that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to report excellent results this morning. But before we dive into the quarter, I want to acknowledge the geopolitical crisis and humanitarian nightmare unfolding in Ukraine. Our thoughts and prayers are with those under attack, the millions of refugees seeking lies most basic necessities and the loved ones of those who have lost their lives.\nTurning now to our results. We're off to a terrific start for the year with an excellent bottom line results, growth in all 3 segments, strong and improved profitability in our commercial business segments, progress addressing the environmental headwinds facing the personal insurance industry and another quarter of progress on a number of important strategic initiatives.\nCore income for the quarter was $1 billion or $4.22 per diluted share, generating core return on equity of 15.5%. These results were driven by net earned premiums of $8 billion, up 9% over the prior year quarter and an excellent combined ratio of 91.3%. We're particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying results in our commercial businesses.\nLooking at the 2 commercial segments together. The combined BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was 90.2% for the quarter, an improvement of nearly 2 points from the prior year quarter. Underwriting results in Personal Insurance were impacted by auto loss frequency returning to more normal levels as miles driven has increased as well as elevated severity in auto and property.\nAgainst this challenging backdrop of environmental headwinds, PI results for the quarter were nonetheless solid, with a 95.3% all-in combined ratio. Turning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $539 million after tax for the quarter, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and strong returns from our non-fixed income portfolio.\nAs you'll hear from Dan shortly, the recent rise in interest rates positively impacts our outlook for fixed income NII. Our excellent operating results, together with our solid balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 11% over the past year, and that's after making important investments in our business and returning excess capital to shareholders.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $773 million of excess capital to our shareholders, including nearly $560 million of share repurchases. In light of our strong financial position and confidence in the outlook for our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a 6% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.93 per share, marking 18 consecutive years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate, 9%, over that period.\nTurning to the top line. Thanks to excellent execution by our colleagues in the field and the strong franchise value we offer to our customers and distribution partners. We grew net written premiums by 11% this quarter to a record $8.4 billion. Each of our 3 segments made strong contributions. In Business Insurance, renewal premium change was 9.1%, remaining near all-time highs. At the same time, retention of 87% was an all-time high. We have a very high-quality book of business and keeping it as a priority.\nAlso as we've shared previously, strong retentions are a sign of a rational and stable pricing market. Underneath the headline numbers, execution at a segmented level is excellent with higher retentions of our best business and more rate in those segments that need it. New business levels were also strong, up about 17% over the prior year quarter. All in, BI net written premiums grew 9%.\nIn Bond & Specialty Insurance, net written premiums increased by 22%, driven by strong production in both Management Liability and Surety. In Management Liability, renewal premium change was up 12%, while retention remained high and new business was up 12%. In Surety, production was terrific with net written premiums up 29%. Notwithstanding some severity pressure from the inflationary environment, we're pleased to see continued written margin expansion in both of our commercial businesses, which, of course, will earn in over time.\nIn Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 12%. Renewal premium change -- renewal premium change increased in both auto and homeowners as we execute to improve margins. As we expected, retention in new business growth moderated a little bit in response. We'll hear more shortly from Greg, Jeff and Michael about our segment results.\nNotwithstanding our terrific results and an economy that, in many respects, feels pretty good at the moment, there's a fair amount to pay attention to in terms of the macroeconomic outlook for the world in general and our industry in particular. There's a wide range of views on the outlook for economic growth and headline inflation is at a 40-year high.\nGeopolitical risk is at a decade high as were ranges in Eastern Europe, tensions rise elsewhere, and the world nationalizes reversing a trend of globalization. Between the plaintiffs bar, regulatory uncertainty and weather severity, loss costs are as challenging as ever to predict. The global pandemic reminds us of the risk of unknown unknowns.\nAnd the one thing we know for sure is that the pace of technological change is accelerating. Travelers is built for this environment. For starters, a culture of unmatched underwriting and investment discipline positions us for nearly any environment. That's been the foundation of our success through the 2008 financial crisis, the most severe natural and man-made catastrophes like 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, a major inflection in liability loss cost trends, the pandemic and now the war in Ukraine.\nThrough all the twist and turns foreseeable and otherwise, we've consistently delivered industry-leading returns at industry low volatility. We didn't exactly predict any of those events, but managing our business for long-term success of carefully balancing risk and reward on both sides of the balance sheet positioned us to successfully manage through all of them.\nIn terms of the economic outlook, if the economy continues to grow, we'll benefit from higher insured exposures, as you've seen in our results over the past few quarters. If we head into a recession, we're very well positioned having made significant progress and improving productivity and efficiency in recent years. In terms of higher inflation, there are several things to keep in mind.\nFirst, with respect to our fixed income portfolio, we would expect to benefit from higher net investment income as higher inflation is typically accompanied by higher interest rates. Second, on the underwriting side, we have a favorable business mix. Our domestic commercial GL and workers comp lines account for about 1/4 of our premiums, both have an audit mechanism for retroactive premium adjustment.\nAnd as we discussed, higher exposures, particularly from wages and sales, contribute to improved margins. The short-tail personal insurance lines and commercial property account for almost half of our premiums. In short-tail lines, we can identify and price for the impact of inflation reasonably quickly, and the reserves on the balance sheet are significantly less exposed to changes in loss inflation.\nFinally, we take into account the inflationary environment and the related uncertainties when we establish our loss picks and set our balance sheet reserves. When assessing inflation, we're generally cautious, especially during periods of elevated uncertainty. We're also well positioned in terms of geopolitical risk. We're primarily U.S.-based with more than 95% of our premiums coming from North America. And we have a focused international footprint with strong partnerships that provide us with the ability to place our customers' business all over the world.\nConsequently, our business is, to a significant degree, insulated from the heightened geopolitical risk environment. With our leading franchise in the U.S., we have the pole position in the largest, most advanced and most stable economy in the world. Given the size of the U.S. economy, even a modest rate of growth, generates substantial growth in dollar terms and therefore, substantial growth opportunities for Travelers.\nWith our footprint, we have opportunities to continue growing through geographies, products, classes of business and distribution partners that we've known and understood for decades. And given our concentration as a primary insurer in Middle Market, there are meaningful barriers to entry.\nImportantly, within the largest insurance market in the world, our business also benefits from significant diversification. We offer 9 major lines of insurance to personal and commercial customers. Our portfolio is balanced across these lines of business and further diversified across regions by distribution partner and by class and customer size.\nIn this business, the one constant is the loss costs are going to change. What's important is having the ability to quickly identify and react to the changes, and we do. We have an advantage in terms of the quantity and quality of our data and the sophistication of our analytics. We spent decades fostering a culture that knows how to balance the art and science of underwriting. We have a strong orientation towards risk-adjusted returns, and we have an incredibly tight feedback loop among our underwriting, claim and actuarial disciplines.\nAll of that contributed to our early recognition of social inflation, positioning us to respond early in terms of underwriting and claims handling strategies. We've been similarly forward leaning and developing underwriting and claims strategies to address weather severity. As we've discussed a few times, over the last 5 years, we've outperformed our market share in terms of cat losses.\nAnother thing that's crystal clear is the rapid pace of change in the world. While the current conditions require us to be laser focused on the here and now, and we are, the dramatic pace of change, together with our scale, industry leadership, deep domain expertise and talent advantage presents us with the opportunity to lead in transforming the way business is done. We have a well-defined innovation strategy and have demonstrated success over that past half dozen years or so in innovating with desired outcomes, growth, industry-leading returns and industry low volatility.\nIn short, we feel very well positioned for continued success no matter what environment comes our way. In the meantime, we're innovating on top of the foundation of excellence to transform our business to competitive advantages that are relevant, differentiating and difficult to replicate. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $1.04 billion, up from $699 million in the prior year quarter, and core return on equity was 15.5%. The increase in core income resulted primarily from a lower level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development and strong but lower returns in our non-fixed income portfolio. .\nUnderlying underwriting income was strong in both periods. Our first quarter results include $160 million of pretax cat losses, much lower than last year's record high first quarter of $835 million pretax. Our after-tax underlying underwriting gain of $580 million was consistent with the prior year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined ratio of 91.2%.\nImprovements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty were more than offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes. The first quarter expense ratio improved in all 3 segments, with the consolidated expense ratio of 29%, nearly a full point below last year's 29.9%. We continue to make significant investments in strategic initiatives, while the combination of a strategic focus on expense discipline and strong top line growth, delivered a lower expense ratio.\nAs we indicated in our fourth quarter earnings call, there will inevitably be some variation in any given quarter. We're still planning for a full year expense ratio for 2022 of around 29.5%. And we're on a path towards a full year expense ratio of around 29% in the next year or 2.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had total net favorable development of $153 million pretax in the first quarter. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $113 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp and also includes an environmental charge of $45 million.\nIn Bond & Specialty, net favorable PYD of $35 million was driven by better-than-expected results in the surety book. Personal Insurance experienced $5 million of net favorable PYD with modest activity in both auto and home. After-tax net investment income decreased by 9% from the prior year quarter to $539 million.\nReturns in our non-fixed income portfolio were strong, but as expected, were less favorable than we experienced in last year's quarter. Fixed maturity NII was higher than in the prior year quarter, as the benefit of higher invested assets more than offset the impact of lower fixed income yields. With the recent increase in interest rates, we are raising our outlook for fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, to approximately $440 million after tax in the second quarter, growing to approximately $460 million in the third quarter and then to $480 million in the fourth quarter.\nRemember, only about 9% of the portfolio turns over each year, so the higher new money rates will take a while to fully impact run rate NII. Recall that results for our private equities, hedge funds and real estate partnerships are generally reported to us on a 1-quarter lag. While not perfectly correlated, our non-fixed income returns directionally follow the broader equity markets, which were generally down during the first quarter.\nAccordingly, we expect that to be reflected in our non-fixed income results next quarter. Regarding reinsurance, as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty for 2022 and providing aggregate coverage of $225 million, part of $500 million of losses above an aggregate retention of $2 billion.\nThrough March 31, a we've accumulated $175 million of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter benefited from the favorable completion of an income tax audit for 2017 and 2018, which resulted in the release of $47 million of tax accruals related to those years.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.3 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion. As interest rates increased and spreads widened during the quarter, we moved from a net unrealized investment gain of $2.4 billion after tax at year-end to a net unrealized investment loss of $1.4 billion after tax at March 31.\nRemember, the changes in unrealized investment gains and losses do not impact how we manage our investment portfolio. We generally hold fixed income investments to maturity. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains very high and changes in unrealized gains and losses have little or no impact on our statutory surplus or regulatory capital requirements. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $104.19 at quarter end, up 2% from year-end and up 11% from a year ago. We returned $773 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising share repurchases of $559 million and dividends of $214 million.\nAnd as Alan mentioned earlier, our Board authorized a 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.93 per share. Sticking with the topic of capital management, you're likely aware that Standard & Poor's has proposed changes to its capital adequacy model. Without final guidance and the actual proposed models from S&P, it would be premature to draw a conclusion as to the potential impact. What I can say is that, as always, we are most interested in our own view of the appropriate level of capital to ensure our financial resilience.\nAs we have consistently demonstrated, including with our excellent results in 2021 and the first quarter of 2022, our disciplined approach to risk selection, asset management, prudent reserving and thoughtful capital management come together to deliver profitable growth while ensuring that we have the financial strength to navigate even the most challenging of circumstances.\nWhile we believe it's important to remain very well capitalized and continued growth in the business will require higher levels of capital going forward, we will not maintain a level of capital beyond what we consider to be appropriate simply to obtain a certain rating level.\nFinally, as related to the hostilities in Ukraine, we don't have any direct exposure to Ukraine or the Russian Federation in our investment portfolio. And given the current scope of hostilities, our insurance exposures in the impacted areas are not significant. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of business insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance is off to a terrific start in 2022 with an exceptionally strong first quarter. Segment income of $669 million was well over double the first quarter of 2021, driven by lower catastrophes and higher underlying underwriting income. The quarter's underlying combined ratio of 91.8% was almost 2 points better than the first quarter of 2021. The loss ratio improved by about 1 point, driven by higher earned pricing, despite elevated severity, reflecting the inflationary environment. .\nThe expense ratio also improved by about 1 point, resulting from the combination of the leverage from higher earned premiums and the benefits of our strategic focus on productivity and efficiency. Net written premiums increased 9% to an all-time quarterly high of $4.5 billion, benefiting from historically high renewal premium change and retention as well as an increase in new business. All lines of business were up over the prior year quarter.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change of 9.1% included renewal rate change of 4.4% and at an all-time high for exposure growth of 4.9%, reflecting continued improvement in our customers' outlook for their businesses. Retention of 87% was also a record high. And finally, new business of $544 million was up 17% from the first quarter of last year, driven by our success with large accounts in Middle Market as well as our continued success with our innovative BOP 2.0 product in Select.\nWe're pleased with these production results and our superior execution in the marketplace. Given our high-quality book as well as several years of meaningful rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions, we're thrilled to have produced record retention levels. The rate gains we achieved in the quarter reflect deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio and through the benefit of higher exposures.\nRate in workers' comp was a little more negative than we've seen over the past year, which is consistent with the strong profitability of the life. Having said that, overall renewal premium change in the workers' comp line was well in the positive territory, as exposure growth was at the highest level we've seen since 2006.\nGiven the headwinds and uncertainty in the current environment, we will continue to execute our granular pricing, careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions to achieve profitable growth. As for the individual businesses, in Select, renewal premium change was a strong 9%, while retention of 83% ticked up 1 point sequentially and was up 4 points from the prior year quarter.\nNew business was up 16% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our BOP 2.0 product, as I mentioned earlier. With improved margins in this business, we're pleased with the higher retention levels and continued momentum in new business growth. In Middle Market, renewal premium change remained strong at 8.8%, while retention reached an all-time high of 89%.\nNew business was up 20% from the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by our success with large accounts, as I mentioned earlier. To sum up, Business Insurance had a great start to the year. We continue to improve the profitability of the block while investing in capabilities to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty started the year with a terrific quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Segment income was $217 million, up 58% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income, lower cat losses and a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. .\nThe underlying combined ratio of 82.2% improved by 2 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends. Also, the prior year quarter had about 1 point or so from some large cyber loss activity that didn't recur.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums grew an outstanding 22% in the quarter with strong contributions from all our businesses. In domestic Management Liability, renewal premium change remained in double digits and improved by a little more than 1 point from the fourth quarter. Retention remains strong, despite the impact of our ongoing strategy to nonrenewed cyber accounts that do not meet our minimum cybersecurity protocols, including multifactor authentication.\nThat change in our underwriting is having a meaningfully favorable impact on cyber claim frequency. We expect to complete the execution of this strategy across our renewal portfolio by the end of the second quarter. Notably, domestic Management Liability new business increased 12% from the prior year quarter. We were also pleased with the strong production this quarter from our domestic surety and international businesses. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, reflecting both excellent execution across our business and the value of our market-leading products and services to our customers and distribution partners. And now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Personal Insurance began 2022 with solid profitability in the context of an ongoing challenging environment. First quarter segment income was $225 million, down $89 million from the prior year quarter, as lower underlying underwriting margins and lower favorable prior year reserve development were partially offset by lower catastrophes. The total combined ratio was 95.3% for the first quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 92.8%, which was 7.4 points higher than the prior year quarter.\nThis increase was driven by higher losses in both automobile and homeowners, which I will discuss in further detail in a moment. Partly offsetting this increase was a reduction in our underwriting expense ratio, which continues to reflect the benefit from higher earned premiums.\nNet written premiums for the quarter were up 12% and included higher renewal premium changes in both automobile and homeowners. In Automobile, the first quarter combined ratio was 99.3%, an increase of 17.5 points compared to a prior year quarter that reflected low loss activity due to the pandemic. In the current year quarter, Automobile loss levels increased due to a combination of coin frequency returning to more normal levels and higher loss severity as vehicle and replacement and repair costs remained elevated.\nDuring the first quarter, we increased rates in 23 states in response at an average rate of approximately 7%. Rate actions in additional states are scheduled to take effect in the coming months and quarters. As we indicated last quarter, although it will take time for these rate actions to earn into our results, we remain confident we're on track to address the near-term profit challenges.\nIn Homeowners & Other, the first quarter combined ratio improved by 8 points from the prior year quarter to 91.2%, primarily driven by 17 points of lower catastrophes. As Dan mentioned, the prior year quarter had elevated catastrophe losses from winter storms and freeze events. Results for last year's first quarter also included higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 86.9%, was 3 points higher than the prior year quarter, as we continued to see higher severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases.\nWe will continue to seek increased pricing and response. As a reminder, for Homeowners, we expect the upcoming second quarter to be the seasonally highest quarter for weather-related loss levels. Turning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both Automobile and Homeowners. For domestic Automobile, retention was strong, and as we expected, down slightly to 84% as renewal premium change increased by about 2 points from the prior quarter to 3.1%.\nWe expect renewal premium changes will continue to accelerate in each of the next 3 quarters and approach double digits by the end of the year. In domestic Homeowners and Other, retention was 84% and renewal premium change was 12.3%. The increase in RPC was primarily due to increased insured values in response to the inflationary environment. Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a minute to address the important issue of increasing motor vehicle fatalities.\nMore than 46,000 people lost their lives on U.S. roads in 2021, the highest total in more than 30 years, a grim reminder of the human cost of the increasing frequency and severity of auto accidents. Most research points to higher speeds and increased distraction as the most prominent drivers of the rise in fatalities. Recent data published by Mobile Telematics, the partner that helps power our IntelliDrive program, showed that phone-related distractions in February of this year increased to the highest level they have ever recorded.\nOur own IntelliDrive data are aligned with this result. Further, the most recent addition of the Travelers risk index continues to show evidence of higher levels of distracted driving among those surveys. In light of these observations and given April is distracted driving awareness month, I wanted to highlight a couple of ways Travelers is working to make a difference. In partnership with the Travelers Institute, we continue to support our every Second Matters initiative, which empowers drivers, passengers, cyclists and pedestrians to speak up, set positive examples and play an active role in changing roadway behaviors to help prevent injuries and save lives.\nAdditionally, the inclusion of distraction as a rating variable in our IntelliDrive offering shows some promise in terms of changing behavior. We've seen a reduction in distracted driving events for drivers enrolled since introducing this variable. Of course, we all play a role in keeping our roads as safe as possible. These are just a couple of examples of how we're raising awareness and trying to make a difference.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Abbe, I'd like to welcome the Trove team to Travelers. We were pleased to be able to acquire technology assets and hire a team of talented people from Trove earlier this year. We look forward to applying their expertise and capabilities to meet our customers where they are, give them what they need and serve them how they want. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael. And operator, we are ready to open up for Q&A.",

Welcome to the fourth quarter results teleconference for Travelers. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being on January 20, 2022. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Abbe Goldstein, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Goldstein, you may begin.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2021 results. We released our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at travelers.com under the Investors section.\nSpeaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Dan Frey, Chief Financial Officer; and our Greek segment President, Greg Toczydlowski of Business Insurance; Jeff Klenk of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Michael Klein of Personal Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. and will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.\nBefore I turn the call over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast presentation. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described under forward-looking statements in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.\nWe do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.\n\nAlan David Schnitzer\n\nChairman & CEO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Abbe. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. For the quarter and full year, we are very pleased to report excellent bottom line results as well as successful top line growth. We attribute these results to our strong franchise value and excellent execution day in and day out in every aspect of our business. At the same time, we're forcing ahead on strategic initiatives designed to position Travelers for continued success.\nCore income for the quarter was $1.3 billion or $5.20 per diluted share generating core return on equity of 19.8%. These results benefited from strong underlying underwriting income, driven by record net earned premiums of $8 billion and a very strong underlying combined ratio of 88.7%. That brings full year core income to $3.5 billion or $13.94 per diluted share and full year core return on equity to 13.7%. Our full year core income includes record underlying underwriting profit, $2.9 billion pretax. Catastrophe losses that were once again favorable compared to our market share, more than $0.5 billion of favorable pretax prior year reserve development and outstanding investment returns. In short, we're firing on all cylinders.\nWe are particularly pleased with the continued strong underlying fundamentals in our commercial businesses, where we are seeing the margin expansion we anticipated. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved by almost 4 points year-over-year in Business Insurance and almost 2 points in Bond & Specialty Insurance.\nLooking at the 2 commercial segments together, the combined BI, BSI underlying combined ratio was 90.4% for 2021, a significant improvement from 94.1% in the prior year. Underlying results in Personal Insurance were impacted by other loss frequency recurring to more normal levels as miles driven has increased and, to a lesser extent, elevated severity in both auto and property. Nonetheless, with a 96.5% all-in combined ratio, PI results for the year were solid. Our consolidated results demonstrate the value of our diversified group of businesses.\nTurning to investments. Our high-quality investment portfolio generated net investment income of $624 million after tax for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year, reflecting reliable results from our fixed income portfolio and another quarter of terrific returns from our nonfixed income portfolio. Our very strong operating results, together with our solid balance sheet, enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 10% during the year. After making important investments in our business and returning $3.1 billion of excess capital to shareholders including $2.2 billion of share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $801 million of our stock.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums grew 10% to $8 billion. Each of our 3 segments again contributed meaningfully to the top line growth. In Business Insurance, net written premiums grew by 9% with renewal premium change of 9.2%, near an all-time high. At the same time, retention was higher. As we've shared before, strong retention is an important indicator of continued stability in the marketplace. New business levels were up 16%. Renewal rate change in business insurance was down about 1 point sequentially. Exposure growth was about 4.5 points, continuing an improving trend and reaching its highest level in 15 years. That's a very encouraging sign, both in terms of economic activity and its contribution to written margin expansion. Excluding the workers' comp product line, renewal rate change in BI for the quarter was nearly 7% and historically strong result. Rate in workers' comp was a little more negative than we've seen over the past year, which is consistent with the strong profitability of the line. Overall renewal premium change to no workers' comp line was positive as exposure growth was meaningfully positive about as high as we've seen in a few years. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, average hourly earnings rose at a nearly 6% annualized rate over the past 6 months, up from about between 0.5% in the first 6 months of the year. Wage inflation is a benefit in terms of margin contribution. Bond & Specialty Insurance Insurance, net written premiums increased by 13%, driven by strong renewal premium change of 10.9% in our management liability business, and continued strong retention. In both of our commercial business segments, written margins continue to expand as written pricing outpaces estimated loss trend and we expect that to continue for a while.\nIn Personal Insurance, net written premiums increased by 10%. Renewal premium change in auto improved by more than 1 point. Renewal premium change in homeowners remained strong at 8.7%. Policies in force in both auto and homeowners increased to record levels.\nThe innovation and technology investments we've been making over the past number of years have had a meaningful impact on our 2021 results, and we're confident that ongoing and planned initiatives will continue to drive successful top and bottom line results going forward. Our scale, profitability and cash flow support our ability to invest well over $1 billion annually on technology. By way of example, we're digitizing the value chain leveraging cloud technology, leaning into artificial intelligence for everything from simple automation to deep learning, tapping into new data sources and build an increasingly accurate predictive models. With meaningful opportunities to transform the way business is done, scale is going to be an increasingly important differentiator. Through our focus on optimizing productivity and efficiency we have been able to meaningfully increase our overall technology spend over the last 5 years, while at the same time, significantly reducing our expense ratio. Importantly, over that period, we have improved the mix of our technology spend.\nWe have increased our spending on strategic technology initiatives by 50% while reducing routine but necessary expenditures. In 2021, our leading claim organization completed a strategic 3-year plan we call right touch. That effort resulted in more than $125 million of annual run rate savings, which is reflected in our results. In addition to creating efficiencies for us, investments in digital capabilities over the past few years have enabled us to improve the customer experience. Our timing was good. Pre-pandemic, we anticipated a higher rate of digital adoption. And when the pandemic accelerated the trend we were prepared to meet the need. We are now using virtual claim handling capabilities on a significant majority of both auto appraisals and windtail claims without the need for inspection by a travelers claim professional. We are also handling significantly more water claims virtually as compared to pre-pandemic levels. In other words, we're delivering great experiences for our customers and a more efficient outcome for our shareholders.\nThroughout Travelers, we see a lot of benefit and opportunity from artificial intelligence. We've shared in recent quarters the success we've had in deploying aerial imagery coupled with proprietary deep machine learning to accelerate damage assessment and claim resolution in the wake of catastrophes. In the recent Colorado wildfire, we were able to serve some customers before they even had a chance to return to their homes. In severe wind events, our latest model can identify the extent of exterior property damage with a high degree of accuracy. These are some of the capabilities we use to meet our objective closing 90% of all claims to rising out of catastrophe events within 30 days and exclusively with Travelers claim professionals instead of also relying on independent adjusters. Resolving claims quickly and to Travelers employees, again, it's about delivering great experiences for our customers and a more efficient outcome for our shareholders. Other initiatives across the company leverage technology, data and models to support decision-making. We have more than 60 million data records related to businesses, individuals and distributors, including virtually every business in the U.S. These records are curated into well-designed proprietary data products. We leverage this with more than 2,000 external data sets including high-resolution aerial imagery covering substantially all property exposures in the United States. All of this data fuels our more than 1,000 advanced analytical models. Our models support risk selection and segmentation, pricing, reserving, claim response and more. Our tech data and analytics advantage is significant and hard to replicate. We deploy these capabilities across the value chain from customer acquisition to underwriting to claim handlers. For example, understanding the size, condition and geometry of a roof can be significant to segmenting risk. Most homeowners understandably wouldn't note that had a hip roof or a gable group level 1 sizer condition. So it's hard to get accurate information due to the application process. We've developed and trained AI to evaluate those roofing characteristics using aerial imagery and are integrating that intelligence into our underwriting segmentation and pricing. Powering all of this is our exceptional workforce. We start with world-class expertise in traditional insurance-related disciplines and enhance that with leading computer data and industrial engineers, design professionals, geophysicists, behavioral scientists AI experts, robotics, urologists, specialized health care professionals and so on. It takes all 30,000 of our Travelers colleagues to deliver the financial performance and strategic achievements we're reporting today, and I'm grateful to them all.\nTo sum it up, we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and the year with cutting-edge expertise and risk and risk management, complemented by the strength we've built digital excellence and innovation. We are well positioned to identify and execute on the most promising opportunities in our industry. By extending our advantage in risk expertise, delivering industry-leading experiences and continuing to improve productivity and efficiency, we will continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value over time.\nAnd with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.\n\nDaniel Stephen Frey\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Alan. Core income for the fourth quarter was a terrific $1.289 billion, which brings the full year results to $3.522 billion. For the quarter, core return on equity was 19.8% and for the full year, core ROE was 13.7%. Our strong and consistent performance has resulted in double-digit core ROE in 9 of the past 10 years, averaging 12.6% over that time frame. We have consistently delivered a meaningful margin over both 10-year treasury and our cost of capital, and we've done so with industry low volatility. Underlying underwriting income was a very strong $867 million pretax, reflecting increased levels of earned premium in all 3 segments and an excellent underlying combined ratio of 88.7%. As was the case in the third quarter, improvements in the underlying combined ratio in both Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance were offset by an increase in the underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty results both reflected the benefit of earned price that continues to exceed loss trends.\nThe higher underlying combined ratio in personal insurance resulted from the comparison to unusually low auto losses related to the pandemic in last year's quarter as well as higher severity in this year's quarter. Greg, Jeff and Michael will provide more detail on each segment's results in a few minutes.\nThe fourth quarter expense ratio improved in all 3 segments and the consolidated expense ratio of 28.5% for the quarter brings the full year expense ratio to a historically low 29.4%. Even as we make significant investments in initiatives that we believe will drive our continued success, our ongoing focus on productivity and efficiency drove a 50 basis point improvement in this share's expense ratio, which is now more than 200 basis points lower than it was just 5 years ago. As we continue to grow the business and maintain our focus on productivity and efficiency, we expect to remain in this mid-29% range in the near term and then gradually move down to around 29% over the next couple of years. Of course, there will be variability in any given quarter, but on a full year basis, that is the path we're on.\nOur fourth quarter cat losses were $36 million pretax. In this year's fourth quarter, we recognized recoveries of $255 million from the Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty. A $221 million benefit for the quarter's cat losses and a $34 million benefit to underlying losses. The cat benefits by segment was $109 million in Business Insurance, $108 million in Personal Insurance and the remainder in Bond & Specialty Insurance. The underlying benefit by segment was $10 million in Business Insurance and $24 million in Personal Insurance.\nTurning to prior year reserve development. We had net favorable development of $95 million pretax on a consolidated basis. In Business Insurance, net favorable PYD of $74 million was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp across multiple accident years. The Bond & Specialty segment saw a net favorable development of $24 million, while in Personal Insurance, modest favorable PYD in homeowners and other was offset by modest unfavorable development in auto, with the net result to PI being $3 million unfavorable. After-tax net investment income of $624 million reflected another quarter of very strong returns in the non-fixed income portfolio and fixed income results that were modestly better than our expectations.\nLooking forward to 2022, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, will be between $430 million and $440 million per quarter, modestly higher than in 2021 as the benefit of expected growth in invested assets will be partially offset by a lower average yield on the portfolio given the continued low interest rate environment. Although interest rates have moved up somewhat recently, we still expect that new purchase yields will be lower than the yields on the bonds rang off.\nPage 20 of the webcast presentation provides information about our January 1 cat treaty renewals. Our long-standing corporate cat XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and the aggregation of losses from multiple cat events. While the treaty renewed on terms that were generally in line with the expiring treaty providing coverage for the $2 billion layer above the unchanged $3 billion retention, we increased our coverage in the $2 billion layer from 75% to 90% thus increasing the amount of coverage available from $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. The 2022 renewal of the underlying Property Aggregate Catastrophe XOL Treaty resulted in placing 45% of the coverage layer. The treaty provides aggregate coverage of $225 million for the $500 million of losses above our aggregate retention of $2 billion. The per event deductible has increased from $5 million in 2021 to $10 million for 2022. Hurricane, wildfire and earthquake events once again have a $250 million per occurrence cap.\nTurning to capital management. Operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.7 billion were again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.5 billion.\nFor the full year, operating cash flow exceeded $7 billion for our strongest year ever reflecting the benefit of continued increases in premium volume, strong profitability and lower-than-normal overall claim payouts as courtroom and other settlement activity remained below historical levels. As we've said previously, we are assuming that this lower level of payment activity is ultimately a timing issue. When establishing our reserves and when pricing our products, we assume that elevated severity related to social inflation has not abated at all. Our substantial cash flow gives us the flexibility to continue to make important investments in our business, return excess capital to our shareholders and grow our investment portfolio, which increased to $87 billion at year-end 2021. We've added an impressive $15 billion or more than 20% to our investment portfolio in just the past 3 years. Interest rates increased modestly during the fourth quarter, and accordingly, our net unrealized investment gain decreased from $2.7 billion after tax as of September 30 to $2.4 billion after tax at year-end.\nAdjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, was $109.76 at year-end, a healthy 10% increase from a year ago. We returned more than $1 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter, comprising dividends of $216 million and share repurchases of $801 million. For the year, we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.2 billion of share repurchases.\nOverall, we had an excellent year with accelerating top line growth, strong and improved margins in our commercial businesses and improved expense ratio and a balance sheet that positions us very well for the future.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business Insurance.\n\nGregory Cheshire Toczydlowski\n\nExecutive VP & President of Business Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Dan. Business Insurance had another strong quarter, rounding out a terrific year with respect to financial results, execution in the marketplace and progress on our strategic initiatives. Segment income for the quarter was $867 million, up more than $150 million from the fourth quarter of 2020 driven primarily by higher underlying underwriting income and net investment income. We're once again particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 89.8%, which improved by 3.8 points from the fourth quarter of 2020. A little more than 1.5 points of the improvement was from earned pricing that continued to exceed the loss cost trends. Another 0.5 point came from the improvement in the expense ratio. The remaining approximately 1.5 points resulted from a combination of a lower level of property losses than we expected and a favorable impact associated with the pandemic.\nNet written premiums for the quarter were up 9% from the prior year quarter, benefiting from strong renewal premium change high retention and an increase in new business levels. We're very pleased with these outstanding financial results for the quarter and more broadly for the full year.\nBefore turning to production, let me provide a little color on the full year results to put the quarter in context. The top line of $16.1 billion was an all-time high. Segment income of $2.4 billion and the underlying combined ratio of 91.7% were both excellent. These results were driven by the successful execution of our thoughtful and deliberate strategies, and we're well positioned for continued profitable growth.\nTurning to domestic production for the quarter. Renewal premium change was once again historically high at 9.2%, while retention remained exceptional at 85%. New business of $505 million was up 16% from the fourth quarter of last year, driven by our success with large accounts in middle market. The 9.2% renewal premium change was up 1 point from the fourth quarter of last year, with renewal rate change of 5.2% and continued improvement in exposure growth to levels we haven't seen in more than a decade. The 5.2% renewal rate was down a bit sequentially, similar to the trends we saw in the first 3 quarters.\nThe rate gains we achieved reflect our deliberate execution given the significant improvements in profitability across the portfolio after several years of meaningful rate increases and improvements in terms and conditions. Written pricing, including the portion of exposure that behaves like rate remains in excess of loss trend. So all other things equal, margins will continue to improve as this price earns in. Given social and other inflation, the frequency and severity of weather-related loss activity and the persisting low interest rate environment, we will continue to see pricing gains to further improve the profitability of our business. As always, our execution in terms of rate and retention will be granular at the account or class level. In addition to our granular price execution, we also remain focused on careful management of deductibles, attachment points, limits, sublimits and exclusions, which also contribute to an increase in the price per unit of rest. As for the individual businesses, in select, renewal premium change was a strong 9.4% while retention was 82%.\nNew business was up 12% from the prior year quarter, driven by the continued success of our new BOP 2.0 product, which is now live in 44 states. As a reminder, BOP 2.0 is our completely redesigned state-of-the-art product which includes industry-leading segmentation and a fast, easy quoting experience. Looking back on the year for Select, we're pleased with the progress we've made in improving the profitability of this business. while continuing to invest for future growth.\nIn middle market, renewal premium change remained strong at 8.8%, while retention was once again historically high at 87%. New business was up 25% from the prior year quarter, driven predominantly by our success with large accounts, as I mentioned earlier.\nTo sum up, Business Insurance had a great fourth quarter and full year. We continue to improve the profitability of the book while investing in digital assets, analytics and industry-leading expertise to enhance our position as the undeniable choice for the customer and an indispensable partner for our agents and brokers.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\n\nJeffrey Peter Klenk\n\nExecutive VP and President of Bond & Specialty Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty ended a strong year with another terrific quarter. Segment income was $170 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter, driven by higher underlying underwriting income. The underlying combined ratio of 83.3% improved by 1.7 points from the prior year quarter, reflecting or pricing that exceeded loss cost trends and a lower expense ratio.\nTurning to the top line. Net written premiums grew a very strong 13% in the quarter with contributions from all our businesses. In domestic management liability, we achieved double-digit renewal premium change for the fifth consecutive quarter at a level of just modestly below our record high third quarter.\nRetention was higher sequentially and remained strong despite the impact of our strategy to nonrenewed cyber accounts that do not meet our minimum cyber hygiene protocols. Early indications are that those underwriting actions are having a meaningful favorable impact on the frequency of cyber claims we're seeing. Domestic surety posted solid growth in the fourth quarter reflecting our market-leading position and continued investments in providing meaningful value-added products and services to our customers.\nOur international businesses again posted excellent growth, reflecting strong management liability, retention and rate. So both top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty were terrific this quarter, capping off a great year. and demonstrating the strong value proposition we offer to our customers and distribution partners and excellent execution across our businesses.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Michael.\n\nMichael Frederick Klein\n\nExecutive VP & President of Personal Insurance, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. In Personal Insurance for the fourth quarter, segment income was $327 million, and our combined ratio was 91.1%, both solid results in the context of a challenging environment. We were pleased that our top line momentum continued in the quarter with net written premium up 10%.\nIn automobile, the fourth quarter combined ratio was 104.1%, an increase of 18 points compared to the prior year quarter, which reflected unusually low loss activity due to the pandemic. Automobile loss levels increased mainly due to miles driven and claim frequency effectively returning to pre-pandemic levels and to a lesser extent, higher loss severity as vehicle replacement and repair costs remained elevated. These profitability challenges are environmental, and we anticipate that they will persist into 2022. In response, we began implementing rate increases. Rate increases have taken effect in 11 states since August.\nWe anticipate additional increases in approximately 25 states throughout the first quarter, with more actions planned in subsequent quarters. As we indicated last quarter, although it will take time for these rate actions to earn into our results, we remain confident we are on track to address the near-term profit challenges and continue to profitably grow our book over time.\nIn Homeowners and Other, the fourth quarter combined ratio improved by 4 points from the prior year quarter to 77.8% despite the fact that we continue to see higher severity related to a combination of labor and material price increases. As a reminder, for homeowners, we expect the fourth quarter to be the seasonally lowest quarter for loss levels. So notwithstanding the relatively low fourth quarter combined ratio, the homeowners product line continues to experience elevated weather and nonweather loss activity, and we will continue to seek rate in response. In addition, we are increasing insured values to align with labor and materials inflation which will further contribute to higher renewal premium changes in the coming quarters.\nTurning to production. We were very pleased to deliver another strong quarter in both auto and home. Domestic automobile policies in force grew 6% to a record level, driven by strong retention at 85%, while new business growth slowed to 4%. Renewal premium change improved from the prior quarter to 1.2% as the impact of our recent rate actions started to take effect. Renewal premium change accelerated during the quarter, and we expect it to accelerate further over the next several quarters. Domestic Homeowners and other delivered another excellent quarter with policies in force up 7%, also to a record level driven by retention of 85% and renewal premium change of 8.7%. New business levels were strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. As I mentioned, we expect higher renewal premium changes going into 2022.\nOur Personal Insurance success continues to benefit from ongoing investments to modernize our suite of products, expand our distribution partnerships and leverage the power of technology. One notable example was highlighted in our press release last week regarding the introduction of IntelliDrive Plus in 3 states. IntelliDrive Plus builds on our existing IntelliDrive capabilities by capturing mileage in addition to driving behavior, demonstrating our continued investment in telematics solutions to offer customers even more options to personalize their insurance. Reflecting on the full year, we are pleased with our personal insurance results which includes segment income of $760 million, a combined ratio of 96.5%, 10% net premium growth and record policies in force in both product lines.\nIn closing, while we face some environmental headwinds in the near term, we remain confident in our ability to execute in the face of these challenges and are well positioned to profitably grow our business over time. On behalf of Greg, Jeff and myself, I'd like to thank our distribution partners and our teams for a successful 2021.\nNow I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.\n\nAbbe F. Goldstein\n\nSVP of IR, The Travelers Companies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Michael, and we're ready to open up for your questions.",

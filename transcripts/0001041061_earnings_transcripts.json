Brands 2025 Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Sammy, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand over to your host, Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatthew Robert Morris\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. On our call are Chris Turner, our CEO; Ranjith Roy, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from Chris and Roy will open the call to questions.\nPlease note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors discussed in our SEC filings. Please refer to today's release and filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease note that during today's call, system sales and operating profit growth will exclude the impact of foreign currency. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. We would like to make you aware that our fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 4, with the comment all on the same day.\nFinally, I want to express my appreciation to those investors who have willingly shared their perspectives on our strategy and communication. Your thoughts are important to us. I will make myself available to listen to your views as well as share those with our management teams.\nNow I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Chris Turner.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. With this being our first call since David's retirement, I want to recognize his exceptional leadership over the past 5 years as CEO and his many strategic contributions throughout his remarkable 36-year career at Yum!. David will continue to serve as a trusted adviser through next year. On behalf of our team members, employees and franchise partners, I want to sincerely thank David for the lasting impact and strong foundation he's built as we carry Yum! into the future.\nAs I take on the role of CEO, I spent the last few months meeting many of Yum!'s stakeholders, including many of our leaders, Board members and largest franchise partners to better understand where Yum! is leading the industry and where Yum! has even greater potential. I've spent time in our restaurants, serving our consumers and listening to team members and general managers.\nFinally, I've met with many of our top shareholders to hear how Yum! can unlock even more value. Speaking with our incredible team has reinforced how important a strong culture and performance mindset are to driving robust results. Yum! invest meaningfully in our talent and gives employees opportunities to work across functions and brands, providing Yum! with the most experienced and tested leaders in the industry.\nCombining the best leaders with the world's most loved, trusted and connected restaurant brands is a winning formula. It's no surprise that few companies are executing at our level with Taco Bell delivering industry-leading 7% same-store sales growth and KFC on track to add nearly 3,000 new restaurants on a gross basis around the world, which would set a new record for annual gross development for the brand. It is also clear there is a consistent theme that success in our industry depends on anticipating and adapting to changing consumer needs. That's a tremendous opportunity for a company like Yum! that already benefits from scale, talent and the ability to innovate.\nWith this in mind, I see 3 areas where I'll focus additional energy to raise the bar on our growth. First, we're a consumer-first business, and we must stay as relevant to the next generation of consumers as we are to our core. Second, franchisees are the lifeblood of our system, and we can do more to leverage our global scale to strengthen their store level economics. Third, Yum! has pursued a differentiated technology strategy that gives us unmatched operational agility and control. I want to extend those advantages across more restaurants to benefit consumers, franchise partners and team members alike.\nTo this end, I recently announced a series of leadership changes. These included expanding the role of Taco Bell's CEO, Sean Trasvont, to include that of Yum! Chief Consumer Officer, with responsibilities that will include oversight of Colider, Yum!'s in-house consumer insights agency. Jim Dauch, Global Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Pizza Hut, was promoted to Yum! Brands Chief Digital and Technology Officer and President of Byte by Yum. Ranjith Roy, who goes by Roy, Yum!'s Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer, was promoted to Chief Financial Officer. Roy had previously spent more than 15 years with Goldman Sachs leading investment banking relationships for restaurants, food and tech businesses.\nWe also intend to add a Chief Scale Officer to Yum!'s leadership team, who will focus on leveraging Yum! scale to maximize franchise returns and drive stronger restaurant profitability. We also announced this morning that we have commenced the process to explore strategic options for the Pizza Hut brand. Our objective is to maximize value for Yum! and position Pizza Hut and its franchise partners for greater success.\nPizza Hut holds key structural advantages, strong brand equity, experienced franchise partners and meaningful scale, which give it a unique opportunity to reclaim the leading position in the highly fragmented pizza market. We believe a different approach, including, but not limited to, a sale of the business would allow Pizza Hut to realize its full potential.\nMore broadly, I'm encouraging the brand teams to play more offense through bold actions, particularly when we see opportunities to accelerate development. In that spirit, we announced our plans to complete the acquisition of 128 Taco Bell restaurants located across the Southeast U.S. in the fourth quarter. Buyout opportunities of this scale are unusual to come by in the Taco Bell system.\nThis acquisition provides our team with an opportunity to improve and accelerate Taco Bell profitability, expand strategic leadership within the Taco Bell system and unlock significant unit development in the region. Of course, this acquisition provides immediate and significant EBITDA growth at an attractive multiple in the context of the Taco Bell system. I want to reiterate that there is no change in strategy regarding our asset-light model.\nNow let me turn to our third quarter results. Yum! delivered another strong quarter with system sales up 5% and core operating profit up 7%. Between KFC and Taco Bell, we've delivered 5% unit growth, 7% system sales growth and 11% segment operating income growth. At KFC, which represents 53% of our divisional operating profit, we delivered 14% core operating profit growth, driven by 6% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth.\nSeveral KFC international markets are delivering exceptional results, including the U.K. market, with same-store sales up 9% on 6% transaction growth; and South Africa, delivering 7% same-store sales growth on record use engagement. Several markets like South Korea and Brazil posted double-digit transaction growth within the quarter.\nTurning to the U.S., which represents 12% of our KFC global system sales. We have taken bold steps over the last 18 months to reengineer our strategy, bolster our talent and pilot new approaches. The new President of KFC U.S. Katherine Tan Golsby has been driving KFC's comeback plan with new marketing tactics and products focused on increasing consumer relevance, which have led to a 2% growth in same-store sales this quarter. There is still a long journey ahead, but we're pleased with Q3's momentum.\nAs a separate plank in the strategy, we're excited about the continued progress to refine and thoughtfully expand the Sassy pilot in the Southeast region. Let me briefly touch on KFC's unit development, which remain broad-based and energized by strong franchise engagement.\nI recently made a trip to Italy to visit our new franchisee where I saw firsthand how critical having the right 3C partner is in driving powerful change. Since joining our system in 2023, our franchisee, COB, has doubled the number of stores and improved AUVs to $2 million. I was pleased to be there when the team unveiled its Italian flagship restaurant featuring 2 floors in Rome, with prime real estate between the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain.\nSimilarly, our new franchise partner in South Korea is delivering unbelievable results. That team reported the third consecutive quarter of double-digit sales and traffic growth, and is set to have 5x the net new unit growth they had in 2024. Our strongest partners are expanding into new and adjacent markets as is the case in Brazil, one of KFC's largest underpenetrated growth market.\nOur highly capable 850 unit Latin American partner, Juan Carlos Serono, is building commissaries and piloting more efficient asset formats, laying the foundation for sustainable scale, growth ahead.\nFinally, I recently returned from China, where our largest partner, Yum! China, runs the most efficient and advanced restaurant operation in the world, leading to significant market share wins over the competition. Overall, KFC's development pipeline remains robust. White space remains abundant and our well-capitalized, capable and committed franchise partners remain growth hungry.\nAt Taco Bell, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit, same-store sales grew 7%, reflecting continued progress on the journey laid out at the Taco Bell Consumer Day to drive $3 million average unit volumes by 2030. Innovation, distinctive value offerings and digital engagement drove this remarkable performance.\nIn the U.S. Taco Bell introduced innovation-led buzz like the Tony Hawk and Bad Birdie collaborations, compelling value like the $3 Grilled state Brito, and expanded its beverage platform with the launch of Refresco's and Baja Blast midnight.\nDigital mix hit another record and digital sales grew 28% year-over-year. Next year, the U.S. team will add more weeks of crispy chicken, fries and beverages to expand everyday occasions, balanced with a refreshed cravings value menu and elevated guest experience.\nTurning to Taco Bell International, same-store sales growth accelerated again with momentum building as the team executes against its magic formula and strategic priorities laid out at the Taco Bell Consumer Day in March. This quarter, the team expanded to 2 new markets, Greece and Ireland.\nDuring my trip to Europe, I stopped to visit our largest international Taco Bell franchise partner, Ignacio Mora Feger, and his amazing Taco Bell Spain team. I saw firsthand how the team keeps building relevance and scale.\nShifting now to our goal of building the world's most trusted brands. Stepping into the role of CEO has been both humbling and energizing. I couldn't be more excited to start this next chapter of Yum!'s growth with a renewed focus on what makes us extraordinary led by our people and our culture. Our commitment to trust and connection extends beyond our restaurants. It's reflected in how we show up in our communities.\nIn September, we celebrated Community Impact Month. Employees at all 3 of our U.S. campuses volunteered to help more than 15,000 people in communities across the United States. Our teams bought childhood hunger, packing more than 6,000 weekend meals for kids who need the most, donated blood with the American Red Cross, prepared food with local food banks and packed hygiene and laundry kits for those in need. Hundreds of volunteers touch thousands of lives. That's the power of Yum!, serving up good everywhere there's a KFC, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and the Habit Burger and Grip.\n1 month end as CEO, and I'm inspired by the commitment to excellence across our system, from our franchise partners to our restaurant teams and leaders. Together, we are building on Yum!'s solid foundation to continue delivering strong, sustainable growth and going forward, we will be laser-focused on accelerating growth around the world, backed by our 2 biggest brands, KFC and Taco Bell.\nWith the dedication of our people, power of our brands and a clear strategic vision, I am confident that we are entering an exciting new chapter of growth and long-term value creation for Yum! and our stakeholders around the world.\nWith that, Roy, over to you.\n\nRanjith Roy\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our results today and to connect with many of you in the months ahead. It is an honor to transition to the CFO role, having served as Yum!'s Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer. My connection with Yum! goes back more than 15 years. I partnered with Chris during my time at Goldman Sachs, where I was Yum!'s strategic adviser. And prior to Chris, I partnered with David Gibbs, Greg Creed and David Novak during their tenures, giving me a deep appreciation for Yum!'s enduring brands, franchise partners and talent.\nPrior to joining Yum! during my time as CFO at Gold Belly, I guided the company from being a tech start-up to being a capital-efficient high-growth retailer, reinforcing my belief in the power of evolution. It's an energizing time to step into this role as Yum! strengthens its position as the global franchisor of choice. The QSR industry is evolving rapidly, scale and technology are defining success around the world, and these shifts play directly into Yum!'s strength. I look forward to continue working with Chris to advance our strategic priorities and drive sustainable growth for our franchisees and shareholders.\nI'll start with third quarter results before discussing Yum!'s balance sheet and liquidity position, the Taco Bell store acquisition and guidance for the year. During the third quarter, we grew system sales 5%, with 3% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth. Digital sales are growing quickly across our markets, with Yum! reaching $10 billion in digital sales and digital mix of approximately 60%.\nOn restaurant level margins, Taco Bell U.S. delivered 23.9% margins ,50 basis points higher year-over-year despite a 1 percentage point headwind from double-digit beef inflation. Taco Bell's restaurant margins benefited from strong top line growth fueled by among many factors, the expansion of Taco Bell's category entry points like Crispy Chicken and Refrescas.\nBeef inflation will remain a headwind through year-end, though we take some comfort and big prices declining 10% since exiting the third quarter. For KFC, the team delivered 13.7% restaurant-level margins. 120 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by significant improvements in both KFC U.K. and KFC U.S. margins.\nMoving on to expenses, ex special G&A was $268 million, up 7% year-over-year as we lapped lower incentive compensation accruals in the third quarter of last year. Reported G&A of $282 million included $14 million of special expenses. And finally, third quarter core operating profit grew 7%, leading to ex special EPS of $1.58, up 15% year-over-year.\nMoving to development. We opened 1,131 gross new units globally, a Q3 record with KFC opening 760 units or a store every 3 hours. KFC's momentum remained broad-based and energized by strong franchise engagement. China, India, Thailand, South Korea and Mexico led the way each demonstrating the strength of our lay book and the scalability of our brand. Overall, KFC's development pipeline remains robust. White space remains abundant and our well-capitalized, capable and committed franchise partners remaining growth hungry.\nAt Taco Bell, development accelerated this quarter with 74 gross unit openings, well above Q3 levels of last year. Taco Bell International continued to build momentum, adding 27 gross new units and successfully launching 2 new markets, Greece and Ireland. On the back of accelerating sales, we remain on track to deliver 100 international net new units this year, reflecting energized franchise partners, compelling brand marketing and improving unit level economics around the world. Early development plans for next year offer promising signs of further unit growth.\nAt Pizza Hut, we built 289 gross units this quarter. We delivered gross builds across 31 countries, with strength in China, the U.S. and India. We've been pleased with Pizza Hut's gross unit openings as the brand is a leader in new builds within the pizza category globally in all but 1 quarter over the last 4 years. However, gross bills have been partially offset by elevated closures through Q3, largely isolated to a reduction in footprint in a small number of markets, including Turkey. These closures were largely tied to specific franchisee matters impacting operational execution.\nTurning to technology. as we continue to work on making our restaurants more connected to drive growth and operational excellence across the Yum! system. Jim Dash, our new Chief Digital and Technology Officer, will help accelerate the next phase of our transformation, but our focus remains the same, building the industry's leading restaurant technology platform that enhances guest experience, simplifies operations and strengthen franchisee economics built around easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nI'll provide a brief update on the progress across these 3 pillars. Within easy experiences, we're creating more frictionless engaging consumer journeys across our brands. At KFC, global digital sales mix reached 63%, supported by kiosk adoption and aggregator partnerships. Bite Commerce, our scalable and global web and mobile app ordering platform continue to unlock the creativity of our digital marketing teams by enabling viral promotions or daily drops that drive high transaction velocity, such as Pizza Huts $2 personal pan Tuesday offer this quarter.\nBiteCommerce expanded to Pizza Hut, Canada, Kuwait and France this quarter, building on earlier launches in Pizza Hut, U.K., Mexico and Peru. Finally, Bite Connect, a product that streamlines order and menu integration with third-party delivery partners has expanded to KFC U.S. Taco Bell U.S. will add this service next year.\nUnder easy operations, we are simplifying restaurant operations and giving teams better tools to deliver fast, accurate and friendly service. Bite Coach, which delivers AI recommendations to our store managers, was deployed to an additional 4,000 KFC restaurants internationally this quarter, bringing the total to more than 28,000 restaurants across the Yum! system. Beginning next year, we'll add further AI capabilities to Bite Coach to provide restaurant general managers, individualized guidance to help improve store level performance based on inputs from a combination of operations, consumer feedback and store audit data.\nWithin Easy Insights, our data and analytics capabilities are providing better visibility and faster, more actionable insights across brands. In addition to building more AI capabilities into the BiTE ecosystem for our franchisees, consumers and restaurant general managers, we are also excited about using AI at the enterprise level to build Bite in a more efficient manner. Currently, 1/3 of our developers are regularly using AI developer tools and realizing significant productivity gains. By early 2020, substantially all of our BiTE software developers will be using AI tools to write better, safer and more efficient code for the BiTE platform.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged, maximize shareholder value through strategic investments in our business, maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet, offer a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders.\nNet capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $73 million, reflecting $21 million in refranchising proceeds and $94 million in gross capital expenditures. We expect our net leverage ratio to end the year at approximately 4x, consistent with our commitment to hold leverage at approximately 4x.\nAs announced in September, we completed successfully a $1.5 billion issuance of Taco Bell senior secured notes with a weighted average coupon of just under 5%. Proceeds were used to repay 2026 debt maturities and to prefund our Taco Bell acquisition.\nDuring the quarter, we repurchased approximately 244,000 shares for a total of $36 million, bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $372 million. As Chris shared, similar to the successful KFC U.K. acquisition last year, we saw an exciting opportunity to invest in the business and acquire 128 Taco Bell U.S. stores in the fourth quarter. The total cash outlay is expected to be approximately $670 million, largely financed with cash on hand.\nIn 2026, we expect the stores we're acquiring to contribute approximately $70 million in incremental EBITDA and add 1 point to Yum!'s operating profit growth after the impact of depreciation and amortization, including reacquired franchise rights. Due to timing and modest transition costs, we don't expect this deal to contribute to core operating profit in 2025. Additionally, the Taco Bell team can step up U.S. equity development in this market beginning in 2027.\nOver the long term, we anticipate profit growth for this estate to exceed Yum!'s long-term growth algorithm. As Chris mentioned, while retaining our asset-light strategy, we are investing where we see outsized strategic benefits and financial returns.\nNow let me share our latest outlook for the balance of the year. As you heard from Chris, both KFC and Taco Bell are taking share from our competition. We expect KFC to achieve record gross unit openings on a full year basis and Taco Bell to deliver strong international development.\nAt Taco Bell U.S., despite the impact of beef inflation, we expect our full year restaurant level margins to fall within our guidance at 24%, with global reported margins landing slightly below the U.S. level.\nWe expect Q4 ex special G&A to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage rate year-over-year, finishing the year in line with our full year guidance. To summarize, KFC and Taco Bell, which make up roughly 90% of our divisional operating profit continued to perform exceptionally well with sales momentum that has continued into Q4. Together, we expect these brands to be on track or ahead of our original full year plan for unit growth, sales growth and core operating profit growth.\nThis performance is further backed by a strong execution of BiTE and disciplined G&A management across the enterprise. Below the line, we expect full year interest expense to land in the range of $505 million to $515 million, incorporating the impact of our recent debt issuance. Lastly, at current rates, we expect FX to represent approximately a $15 million tailwind to reported operating profit in Q4.\nFinally, turning to our Pizza Hut Division. We remain focused on strengthening business performance. That said, as we prepare the business for a potential transaction, our Q4 results may see some impact from actions involving isolated franchisee situations, taking this and Pizza Hut's year-to-date performance into account. Full year 2025 Yum! performance may land slightly below our algorithm. We will record expenses tied to the strategic options review as a special item, since this is an active process, we will not be providing further comments on the status of our review.\nIn closing, we remain focused on continuing to deliver relevant value, distinctive innovation and rapid digital transformation. The combination that keeps us resilient regardless of macro conditions. We are confident in the strength of our strategies, the agility of our franchisees and the power of our business model to drive sustainable growth over the long-term.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take questions."

Brands 2025 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Sammy, and I'll be coordinating your call today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand over to our host, Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead, Matt.\n\nMatthew Robert Morris\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.

This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. We would like to make you aware our third quarter earnings will be released on November 4 with a conference call on the same day.\nNow I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we dive into this quarter's results, I want to acknowledge that this will be my final earnings call as CEO before I officially pass the baton to Chris on October 1. As one of the biggest champions of our brands and having personally recruited Chris to Yum! many years ago, I am thrilled that the Board unanimously elected Chris as our next CEO, yet again demonstrating the strength of Yum!'s internal talent. I couldn't think of a better person to lead this company. To ensure a seamless transition, I will serve as an adviser until the end of 2026.\nNow turning to the second quarter results. I'm proud that Yum! Brands delivered another strong quarter in a tough consumer environment. System sales grew 4%, driven by strong unit growth at KFC International and persistent market share gains at Taco Bell U.S. with both businesses delivering positive transaction growth. Yum! delivered 386 net new units, including 871 gross openings, reflecting the enduring appeal of our brands and the strength of our diversified system.\nThis quarter, Yum! achieved a new digital sales milestone with digital mix reaching 57%, 7 percentage points higher year-over-year. Notably, KFC's digital sales grew 22% and mix climbed to over 60%. Digital sales growth is undeniably due to the continued expansion of digital channels and the global rollout of Byte in which we made additional progress in international deployments and new service offerings across our U.S. portfolio. We also made strides with expanding AI-driven personalized one-to-one advertising for which having a high digital mix will become a massive strategic advantage.\nI'll now discuss the strategic drivers that underline our commitment to being the most loved, deeply connected and always trusted brands for consumers around the world. Afterwards, Chris will provide a deep dive on our second quarter results, balance sheet position and capital strategy, followed by our current outlook for 2025.\nStarting with KFC. KFC contributes 52% of Yum!'s divisional operating profit with KFC International accounting for 85% of our international operating profit. KFC International grew same-store sales 3% driven by strong performance in key markets, including South Africa, Spain, Canada, Japan and the U.K.\nEven with a solid overall top line performance, we have opportunities to improve performance in underperforming regions such as the U.S. and parts of Europe, where challenges stem from gaps in value perception, inconsistent consumer experience and innovation that has not fully resonated with consumers. As a first step, KFC U.S. recently introduced the Kentucky Fried comeback campaign aimed at striking the right balance between innovative, relevant products and strong consumer value.\nIn Europe, the teams are focused on delivering distinctive product offerings and meaningful partnership activations that resonate with local consumers, along with tailoring individual and snacking occasions in the EUR 3 to EUR 5 price range.\nOn March 1, Scott Mezvinsky assumed the role of KFC's CEO, bringing fresh energy and a clear vision for the brand's next chapter. Scott has articulated a compelling strategy focused on energizing the brand, enhancing its cultural relevance and deepening consumer engagement worldwide leaning on his findings at Taco Bell. A key pillar of this approach involves modernizing the brand to attract younger consumers, in part by leveraging local standout innovations like the Korean barbecue chicken sandwich inspired by Squid Game in Spain, a product the team has recently introduced in select additional European markets as part of ongoing efforts to learn and scale regional successes.\nScott is encouraging boldness and creativity in innovation and marketing. As an example, the United Kingdom elevated KFC's visibility and appeal with a younger audience through successful launches, such as the Dirty Louisiana Burger and strategic cultural partnerships like Limitless Live, the U.K.'s largest free music event, leading to a 5% increase in same-store sales.\nMoving to Taco Bell, which accounts for 37% of our divisional operating profit, with Taco Bell U.S. accounting for 82% of Yum!'s U.S. profit. Taco Bell delivered 4% same-store sales growth outpacing the limited service category in the U.S. by 4 percentage points. I'm thrilled that the progress Taco Bell made to elevate and broaden its menu with new occasions, including its focus on crispy chicken and an expanded beverage lineup.\nThis quarter, Taco Bell reintroduced crispy nuggets, and unleashed full flavor and full-size versions of Crispy Chicken in the innovative new items to start Q3, such as the Crispy Chicken Taco and Crispy Chicken Burrito. The success of growing our chicken sales layer is undeniable with total chicken sales up over 50% in 2 years. We expect the momentum in chicken to continue as Crispy Chicken becomes a permanent platform in 2026, while the momentum behind new occasions will continue with shredded beef later this year.\nAs for beverages, the team has bold ambitions to make beverages as iconic as their food, aiming for $5 billion in total system sales by 2030. At the very start of Q3, they took a significant step with the release of a nationwide lineup of flavorful Refresca and announced plans to expand its innovative beverage concept, Live Mas Cafe. Despite executing an unprecedented level of limited time offer innovation, Taco Bell's order accuracy has improved and maintained exceptional drive-through performance in the U.S. Internationally, Taco Bell's momentum remained robust. Same-store sales being 5% in Europe with double-digit increases in Canada and India.\nMoving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for 11% of Yum!'s divisional operating profit. In the U.S., innovation with Cheesy Bites and Ranch Lovers Flights mixed well with existing consumers but an insufficient value message amid a competitive value landscape resulted in transaction softness. The team has learned from this and going forward, the U.S. team is establishing compelling value propositions including the recent launch of Wing Wednesday and Tuesday's $2 personal pan pizza.\nFollowing the recent new mobile app launch this year, the team plans to double down on mobile app acquisitions to start the third quarter. Internationally, Pizza Hut grew same-store sales 2% driven by the Middle East recovery, positive transaction growth in the U.K. and strong performance in South Asia.\nHabit Burger and Grilled year-over-year system sales trends in Q2 declined 1% consistent with the trend observed in Q2 last year. The decline reflects continued softness in consumer demand with some impacts associated with the recent events in the L.A. area. The team improved its value offering through compelling weekly offers to our CharClub members and the launch of [indiscernible] Habit meal deals in June in select markets priced at $6, $8 and $10. Encouragingly, this emphasis on brand right abundant value lifted sales starting in June, and that positive momentum has continued into July.\nLooking ahead, I'm optimistic that increased marketing investments will further support sales momentum and build on the traction we're already seeing. In fact, recently for the second year in a row, Habit has been ranked the #1 best burger and #1 best side for our Tempura Green Beans and now it's been named the #1 best fast casual restaurant by USA Today's 10 Best Readers Choice Awards.\nWe continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with bold strategic initiatives to keep us ahead of the competition and future-proof our business. At Taco Bell, Live Mas Cafe is part of the team's bold bet to go after the $25 billion beverage category in the U.S. and will bring a new layer of hospitality and culinary creativity to the brand. The cafe was inspired by Gen Z's love for curated, customizable drinks and offers over 30 signature beverages from churro chillers and specialty coffees to Refresca and Dirty Mountain Dew Baja Blast Dream Sodas.\nWith a Live Más Cafe, our test store has seen a significant increase in transactions while more beverage users are visiting the cafe and choosing to dine in. The team announced last month that they will expand Live Mas Cafe within existing Taco Bell restaurants to 30 locations across Southern California and Texas by year-end.\nIn the U.S., we are moving forward with plans to expand our one unit test of sauce. We will open several additional test units by end of year near our existing Orlando location. We continue to be encouraged that weekly sales have averaged materially higher than the preexisting KFC since opening and that we're connecting with a younger demographic as 1/3 of sauce consumers are under age 30. We have a lot of learning ahead of us, and we are eager to leverage the invaluable consumer insights relevant for our larger KFC U.S. system.\nIn the connected pillar, our progress continues to accelerate leading us to become the world's most connected restaurant platform. Digital sales now total a record portion of our system sales. In Taco Bell U.S., 41% of our orders are digital, fueled by loyalty offers and unique digital activations like Mike's Hot Honey Tuesday Drop and Feed the Beat Record Club Box. Taco Bell's unique activations helped grow active loyalty consumers nearly 45% year-over-year.\nAcross the organization, AI is supercharging our marketing. Over 200 million AI-generated communications have been sent this year, delivering up to 5x incrementality compared to traditional approaches. This is not just marketing evolution, it's a revolution and we're only getting started. In addition, as our systems become more connected, we're finding more opportunities to strengthen our operations. For instance, this quarter, we completed the conversion to a more advanced voice of the consumer product that helps aggregate consumer reviews from social channels and third-party delivery platforms and allows us to integrate such insights into Byte Coach to deliver more effective operations routines to restaurant general managers.\nCorporate citizenship and sustainability play a key role in ensuring our brands remain trusted everywhere we operate. We recently issued our 2024 Global Citizenship and Sustainability Report, which highlights our efforts across our people, food and planet pillars. Highlights from the report include achieving 89% of Yum! approved suppliers being certified or on the path to global food safety initiative recognized certification.\nYum! also now sources 94% cage-free eggs across 25,000 restaurants, including in the U.S. and Western Europe. Additionally, we reduced emissions by 25% on an absolute basis for company-owned restaurants and corporate offices since 2019. These are just a few examples of how we are future-proofing the world's largest restaurant company. Congratulations to the teams around the world who are driving this important sustainability work every day. Your efforts are making a real impact on our business and our bottom line.\nI'd also like to highlight a few programs that Yum! and our brands invest in that help people by building careers, connections and strong communities. Pizza Hut Sri Lanka's equal slice for every one program offers up to 6 months of training for use to gain restaurant skills and certification before joining the workforce. In Thailand, KFC's bucket search helps you through [indiscernible] school regain confidence, explore vocations and return to education. This program has impacted the lives of hundreds of young people since 2023. I'm immensely proud of the work that is being done around the globe to ensure Yum! Brands is positively impacting the markets where we operate and the people who live there.\nTo close, I want to extend my deepest thanks to our restaurant teams, franchisees and support centers across the globe. Despite the challenges we faced in the second quarter, driven in part by softer consumer sentiment, our results stand as a powerful testament to the strength of our global brands and the dedication of our people. I'll share more final thoughts after Q&A.\nReflecting on my nearly 4 decades at Yum!, including the past 6 years as CEO, it has truly been an incredible journey. I've had the privilege of working alongside the best talent and franchisees in the industry and feel the same way about the analyst and investor community. Your partnership, insights and long-term perspective have pushed us to become a better company, better positioned for sustained long-term success.\nWe've expanded our iconic brands by opening an additional 22,000 stores. And together, we've navigated both challenges and milestones in our shared commitment to building a culture rooted in growth, purpose and performance. We've built industry-leading digital capabilities we once thought unimaginable and dramatically accelerated the pace of unit development. As I look ahead, I couldn't be more confident that Yum! is well positioned to continue to deliver sustainable growth and long-term value for our shareholders. Thank you.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, David, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying how truly honored and excited I am to step into the role of CEO of this incredible organization. David recruited me in the Yum! and while I'm deeply grateful for that, I'm even more grateful for the way he has led. Over the past 6 years, he has guided our system through a global pandemic geopolitical instability and inflationary pressures unlike anything we've seen in recent memory. And through it all, together with our teams and franchisees, he has delivered, transforming our digital capabilities reigniting development and laying a strong foundation for the future. I'm thankful he will continue advising me and the company as we turn the page to Yum!'s next chapter.\nLet me now turn to our second quarter financial results. We achieved solid system sales growth of 4%, driven by 3% unit growth and 2% same-store sales despite the tough consumer backdrop. Digital sales grew an astonishing 18%, thanks to our ongoing expansion of digital channels and bike deployments, pushing our digital mix to a record 57% or up 2 points from last quarter. Total restaurant-level margins were 16.3%, down roughly 150 basis points year-over-year due to an unfavorable commodity lap at Taco Bell and KFC's higher mix of overall restaurant profit from our newly acquired U.K. stores.\nSince our acquisition of 216 restaurants in the U.K. last year, we've been very pleased with the progress we're making on improving the margins in those restaurants where sales performance has been ahead of our projections. However, this quarter still reflects the anticipated negative impact of those stores on year-over-year company margins.\nEx-special G&A expense was $274 million, up $18 million or 7% year-over-year. This level of expense was in line with our plan and included lapping lower incentive comp from Q2 last year. Reported G&A was $302 million and includes $28 million in special expense, primarily relating to our ongoing resource optimization program and recent office consolidation. Franchise and property expense increased $16 million, driven by incremental spend tied to our global franchise convention that we hold every 2 years, as well as lapping prior year bad debt recoveries at KFC.\nLastly, Yum!'s core operating profit increased 2% to $646 million. Second quarter ex special EPS was $1.44, up 7% year-over-year. Reported EPS was $1.33.\nMoving to development. We opened 871 gross new units in the quarter, largely consistent with Q2 of last year and translating to 386 net new units. At KFC, we opened 566 gross new units across 58 countries, fueled by China, India and Japan. We feel good about the development momentum with the long-term global white space remaining highly attractive, particularly in Europe and East Asia where the opportunity is vast.\nAt Pizza Hut, we opened 254 gross new units across 32 countries with growth led by China, the U.S. and India. Pizza Huts openings were just ahead of last year's Q2 pace. Taco Bell delivered a notable acceleration this quarter, opening 50 gross new restaurants or twice the number in Q1. 18 of those openings were in international markets across 9 countries. The team remains on track to meet its commitment of 100 international net new units this year, led by unit growth in the U.K. and Spain as well as planned entry into several new markets.\nI'll now discuss our connected brand strategy that continues to revolutionize digital and technology across our system, strengthening operations, enhancing consumer experiences and unlocking new insights. As one example of the power of Byte, let me share with you a new tool we've developed, which we call Byte Connect. Byte Connect is Yum!'s menu and order integration platform for third-party delivery providers which launched in Q2 and is now scaling across our Pizza Hut U.S. system, saving our franchisees significant cost. This service is typically provided to restaurant companies at a significant cost per order by a third party, but we are able to offer it to our franchisees using the bite stack at a more affordable price. This platform serves as the essential infrastructure for all our brands to better support our sizable third-party delivery business.\nByte! Connect reduces order cancellation and is priced at a discount relative to similar capabilities in the market. Byte Connect is a great example of the power of the Byte platform. We are able to build innovative new capabilities like Byte Connect and scale them quickly to all brands leveraging the common technology chassis provided by Byte.\nEqually as exciting is how AI is accelerating our innovation time line. By leveraging developer AI tools, we reduced the time of Byte Connect ideation to national launch from an estimated 9 months down to 3 months. Another key aspect to our connected strategy is our industry partnerships. Our current voice AI solution now in 600 restaurants continues to enhance our team member and consumer experience and is outperforming everyone in the industry.\nThat said, we are always looking to raise the bar. The partnership we announced last quarter with NVIDIA plays a key role in our Byte strategy as we collaborate on cutting-edge models and technology. We have exciting plans for the next 6 months, including expanding our internally developed voice AI solution developed on the NVIDIA stack to our first drive-thru restaurant in Q3.\nNow let me highlight the significant strides across our easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights coach. Starting with our easy experiences pillar, which is focused on making consumer interactions more seamless. We've continued the expansion of Byte Commerce, scaling our web and app ordering platform to Pizza Hut, Canada and Mexico this quarter while preparing for 2 additional Pizza Hut markets by year-end.\nEarly results from Pizza Hut Mexico are strong. The market is seeing nearly 40% month-over-month app transaction growth since the launch of Byte Commerce in Q2. Within easy operations, we're focused on simplifying the restaurant team member experience through solutions like Byte Kitchen and Fleet, Byte Coach and Byte Inventory, more than 30,000 restaurants now have AI informing restaurant manager decisions.\nFor Byte Coach, we've rolled out additional AI features, including dynamic routines, which incorporates feedback from a wider catchment of consumer reviews to inform store-specific routines. The significant adoption of Byte Coach across our system provides us with a scale platform to deliver AI recommendations that take the guesswork out of running a restaurant to our RGMs and team members. As David mentioned, Byte Coach is now powering operational excellence across nearly all Pizza Hut stores globally, excluding China.\nLastly, within our easy insights pillar, we're harnessing our powerful data ecosystem to drive smarter, faster decisions across the organization. As part of our AI-driven personalization strategy, we launched a proprietary consumer insights product tailored for international markets this quarter in Pizza Hut U.K. This platform will enhance the consumer journey by offering more relevant personalized item suggestions directly within the cart. We plan to expand this offering to 3 additional markets by year-end.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $54 million, reflecting $17 million in refranchising proceeds and $71 million in gross capital expenditures. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 740,000 shares for a total of $108 million bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $336 million. This reflects our commitment to returning excess capital alongside a prudent approach to credit facility utilization while we plan the refinancing of our 2026 debt maturity over the coming months.\nOur net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.8x. As I've previously shared, subject to market conditions, after the refinancing, we expect to maintain a net leverage ratio of approximately 4x over the medium term by issuing incremental debt as our business grows.\nOverall, our capital priorities remain unchanged. We continue to focus on maximizing shareholder value through strategic investments in the business, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nNow let me share our latest outlook for the balance of the year. The global operating environment remains dynamic and complex. Our teams are staying agile with their marketing playbooks and leveraging key strengths, including digital capabilities and operational scale. At Taco Bell U.S., which represents over 80% of our U.S. operating profit, we're on track to deliver 24% to 25% restaurant level margins.\nDevelopment trends are encouraging across the portfolio. While there's no observable impact to our development pipelines we are expecting inflation pressures across several key building products sourced from Mexico and Canada. Fortunately, 90% of Yum!'s development occurs outside the U.S., unlike many of our competitors. So our exposure to the impact of tariffs on the business is limited and with industry-leading margins, Taco Bell is not expecting a material change to paybacks. In fact, we expect to meet or exceed the total number of gross builds from last year for all brands, leading us to 4% unit growth or 5% excluding the Turkey market exit.\nMoving to G&A. We expect G&A, ex special and ex FX, will land at the high end of our previously guided mid-single-digit increase due to one-off expenses related to an accelerated CEO transition and KFC's headquarter consolidation. In Q3, we expect G&A to increase double digits owing to lapping the significantly reduced incentive comp booked in Q3 last year, with Q4 G&A growing near the low end of our full year guide.\nSubject to market conditions, we do expect refranchising gains will help offset some, but not all of those expenses. While this reduces some contingency in our profit guide, we still expect to achieve 8% core operating profit growth, excluding the 53rd week this year with Q4 in double digits, in part due to easing compares related to our elevated bad debt last year. Below the line, we expect interest expense to land between $500 million and $520 million, excluding the interest from any incremental debt. Finally, on FX, at current spot rates, we expect a $20 million tailwind to GAAP operating profit for the remainder of the year.\nTo close, I am incredibly proud of how our teams are navigating this dynamic environment, staying fast, consumer-focused and forward-looking. Our second quarter results reflect strong development momentum, continued growth in digital sales and healthy same-store sales increases driven by rising traffic in our twin growth engines.\nAs I prepare to step into the role of CEO, I'm spending time with our leaders and teams, Board members and franchise partners and rolling out my sleeves in restaurants alongside our amazing frontline teams to reflect on our strengths and where we can raise the bar. Throughout this process, I've become even more energized by the possibilities ahead and by the privilege of leading this world-class organization, home to iconic brands and incredibly talented people. I'm confident that together, we'll build on our momentum and shape an even stronger future for Yum!.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

We would like to make you aware our second quarter earnings will be released on August 5, with the conference call on the same day. Now I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to report that we delivered a strong first quarter with core operating profit up 8%, fueled by exceptional results from our twin growth engines, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International. The success evident in the performance of these 2 businesses reflect significant and durable competitive advantages, including the operational advantage provided by our AI-powered digital platform, Byte by Yum. Our ability to quickly integrate new technology that leverages Yum!'s vast proprietary data sets into our digital ecosystem, along with an ability to scale and grow with highly capable 3C partners is an enormous competitive advantage in the global restaurant space.\nEarlier this quarter, I announced my intention to retire next year after what will be a 37-year career with the company. I reached this decision after much reflection in recognition of the great work that has been done over the last year to set up the business for long-term success. With the business in a position of strength, this feels like the right time for a transition, and having a year to identify a successor ensures we can do so thoughtfully and seamlessly. I'll be working closely with the Board to ensure a smooth leadership transition. That said, I couldn't be more excited about the direction of the business and the momentum we're seeing across our key growth engines to start the year.\nLet's start with our twin growth engines. First, Taco Bell U.S. delivered a staggering 9% increase in same-store sales, an impressive achievement, especially against the backdrop of soft industry trends. Notably, this quarter, Taco Bell saw a significant expansion in consumer penetration, reflecting our efforts to elevate our positioning and broaden our relevance, which helped us to grow traffic low single digits. Taco Bell's digital momentum is also accelerating. Byte by Yum! has reduced system limitations, empowering Taco Bell's world-class advertising team to push creative boundaries. One area in marketing with enormous potential is the expansion of AI-driven decisioning to enable personalized experiences for consumers. For example, we are testing the use of these tools to enable us to deliver one-to-one communication to our consumers. Recall at the Taco Bell Consumer Day, the team shared that they expect to generate over $225,000 in additional per store sales by 2030, or an approximate 10% increase to AUVs through expanded digital channels and loyalty membership. What truly sets Taco Bell U.S. apart, however, is its unique ability to deliver compelling value while improving store level margins, a rare combination in the industry.\nThis winning combo helped drive an astounding 16% increase in operating profit for the quarter. With such a stark contrast in performance versus the industry, it's no wonder Taco Bell was once again named the #1 franchise by Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 for the fifth consecutive year. This honor reflects Taco Bell's brand strength, loyal consumer base and the confidence of our franchise partners.\nOur other twin growth engine, KFC International, also earned top honors for the second consecutive year as Entrepreneur Magazine's fastest-growing international franchise. Additionally, with 524 growth openings across 50-plus countries, KFC International outpaced its first quarter development plan. KFC International posted accelerating same-store sales and strong gains in brand perception, driven by bold investments in value, craveworthy new offerings and distinctive media and innovative partnerships. Globally, KFC International achieved low single-digit traffic growth, including in markets like China, which delivered its ninth consecutive quarter of traffic growth.\nThis quarter also highlighted strong progress in the bold initiatives designed to meet the next generation of consumers and add new layers of growth. At Taco Bell, our first Live Mas Cafe, a specialty beverage concept featuring drink flight chillers, Agua Refresca, coffees and more alongside the classic menu launched in December and is off to a phenomenal start. The test location has experienced a 40% sales lift, with guests purchasing over 300 specialty beverages daily on average. Energized by this strong performance, we are planning a rapid expansion this year. Look for an exciting update on Liv Mas Cafe from Taco Bell in the coming weeks.\nWe piloted Quench by KFC in 38 restaurants in the U.K., the first KFC market to experience our innovative entry into the fast-growing specialty beverage category. A globally led initiative born from insights by Collider Labs, Yum! strategy branding and innovation consultancy. Quench features 10 handcrafted drinks across 4 specialty drink categories, lemonades, refreshers, shakes and ice coffees. Early results have been promising, with participating restaurants seeing growth in both transactions and beverage sales, outperforming previous specialty drink offers. Building on this momentum, we have expanded the pilot to Australia, where results are already exceeding forecast and driving incremental traffic. Plans are in motion to scale to additional markets in the coming months.\nIn the U.S., our bold new concept, [indiscernible], is exceeding expectations. Sales are more than double the U.S. system average, placing this [indiscernible] location among the top 15 locations in the KFC U.S. system. We're planning a phased expansion to at least 20, stores targeting sites that allow us to unlock marketing synergies through geographic proximity.\nI'll now discuss the strategic drivers that underline our commitment to being the most loved, deeply connected and always trusted brands for consumers around the world. Afterwards, Chris will provide a deep dive on our first quarter results, balance sheet position and capital strategy, followed by our outlook for the balance of 2025.\nStarting with our loved pillar and our brands that champion consumer experiences. The KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our divisional operating profit, grew system sales by 5%, driven by 6% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Internationally, we reset core value across several markets while modernizing the brand through menu upgrades and breakthrough innovation, including the DoubleDown Zinger in the U.K., Crispy non in France and Zinger Nachos in Australia. Sustained investment in the value layer improved our net value score by 7 points versus our largest competitor.\nRelevant partnerships and new media strategies also drove a 2-point gain in brand perception among younger consumers globally. A number of markets experienced meaningful momentum including Canada, where same-store sales accelerated to 6%, reflecting strong consumer engagement following a collaboration with Mike's [indiscernible]. Korea delivered 13% same-store sales growth and double-digit transaction gains, fueled by expanded lunch and snacking options and higher delivery sales. Africa recorded 8% same-store sales growth, supported by improving consumer sentiment and effective value-led promotions. U.S. performance was driven by a double value promotion, $5 bowls and the $10 Tuesday bucket, leading to low single-digit transaction growth.\nTaco Bell, which accounts for 37% of our divisional operating profit, delivered an exceptional quarter with system sales up 11%, fueled by impressive same-store sales growth of 9%. Top line performance was driven by low single-digit traffic increases across all income cohorts. The brand generated strong buzz with the success of its crispy chicken nuggets, milk bar churros, cheesy dipping burritos and steak and Queso crunch wrap sliders. The $5, $7 and $9 Luxe boxes offered compelling value with a $9 Lux cravings box featuring rotating limited time innovation. Taco Bell also expanded category entry points with bold offerings like Caliente Cantina chicken and steak nacho fries. We've now seen multiple quarters of rapid adoption in digital with mix reaching 42% and sales growing 37% year-over-year.\nIn March, Taco Bell hosted both its Consumer Day and Live Mas Live events, spotlighting the brand's bold innovation and powerful fan connection. At Consumer Day, the team unveiled the ambitious global R-I-N-G, Ring the Bell strategy, outlining a compelling long-term vision to drive sales, improve margins, expand its footprint and accelerate digital growth. Live Mas Live brought together top social media influencers and die hard Taco Bell fans for an immersive celebration of the brand's boldest new menu innovations and experiences. The event buzzed with excitement, blending exclusive tastings, live entertainment and behind the scenes access to what's next for Taco Bell, including exclusive limited edition [indiscernible] collaboration and awards for its most loyal supporters.\nPizza Hut, which represents 12% of our divisional operating profit, had system sales declined 3% in Q1. The decline in system sales was primarily attributable to disappointing same-store sales performance in the U.S. Excluding the U.S., same-store sales were positive for the quarter, with meaningful improvements across Asia, Europe and the Middle East. In the U.S., sales started soft in January and improved through February and March, with the last few weeks showing sequential gains in revenue and transaction growth. The U.S. business faced an intense competitive environment. To drive momentum, Pizza Hut U.S. leaned into group occasions with its stuffed crust and wings promotion and ultimate hot bundle both of which increased check and attracted new users. During the Super Bowl, the ultimate hot bundle helped deliver Pizza Hut's highest-ever digital sales per restaurant.\nLooking ahead, Pizza Hut U.S. will focus on its 3D strategy, distinctive offerings for group occasions, dependable everyday value through platforms such as the $7 deal levers and disruptive innovation to gain share in a competitive market. Habit Burger and Grill System sales growth was flat this quarter. Tempura Avocado Wedge is launched this quarter and became 1 of the brand's highest performing side LTOs in recent history. This quarter, Habit shifted its marketing to focus on brand fame, including an amplified social media presence and the Super Bowl placement that drove 10 million total impressions. Looking ahead, Habit is in the early stages of expanding local restaurant marketing through on-the-ground field teams. Strong same-store sales growth in Florida, Washington and New Jersey reinforced our confidence in the brand's long-term growth potential and the impact of market-specific engagement.\nMoving to our connected pillar, we're advancing our ability to serve every consumer everywhere at any time. Earlier this year, we announced Byte by Yum!, our proprietary suite of AI-powered Software-as-a-Service products designed to deliver integrated seamless technology across our restaurants. This strategic investment is delivering results, with digital sales up 12% year-over-year. As mentioned previously, Pizza Hut U.S. achieved its highest Super Bowl sales ever, with every digital order processed through Byte Commerce marking a major milestone in our digital transformation. This success highlights the scalability and reliability of our platform.\nWe're also seeing stronger consumer engagement, including a $4.5 million quarter-over-quarter increase in KFC loyalty members. At Taco Bell, active loyalty membership grew 45% year-over-year, fueled by unique experiences like build-your-own Luxe box and the Spring Break Fan Favorite Boat.\nLooking ahead, we're excited about our new partnership with NVIDIA, which will accelerate the development of innovative AI technologies across Yum! worldwide. Chris will share more about this shortly.\nThe cornerstone of Yum! Brands is our unrivaled culture and talent, and I would like to congratulate 2 executives who are taking on larger leadership roles. Meg Ferran, who was previously GM of KFC U.K. and Ireland, was promoted to the position of President of Taco Bell North America effective February 10; and Katherine Tan Galeski, formerly the CMO and DCO for KFC U.S., became President of KFC U.S. effective April 1. I am confident Meg and Catherine will help lead these storied brands to even greater success.\nSpeaking of the talent in the Yum! system, we recently witnessed the company's collaborative culture in action with nearly 1,000 people attended our global franchise convention in Australia. The 4-day Summit was attended by world-class franchisees from all over the globe with some traveling more than 10,000 miles to attend. The power of each brand in Yum! collectively was on display, demonstrating the advantages our system has in driving profitable growth for franchisees and Yum! alike. This strong sense of unity and shared purpose among our global franchise partners is also reflected in the way the company integrates responsibility and community impact into its core values. Those efforts were recognized by the conference board, which presented the company with its corporate responsibility award on April 23. The award celebrates organizations that have fully embedded responsible business practices into their core strategies, driving business efficiencies and creating long-term value.\nTo wrap up, I'm thrilled with our first quarter results, which clearly demonstrate the strength of the Taco Bell brand and the momentum in KFC. Our recent investments in KFC to enhance our value proposition, modernize our brand and update our menu are delivering sustainable improvements in top line trends. I left our global franchise convention knowing Yum! is simply one of the best positioned QSRs with an unbelievable international franchise base that is more than ever committed to grow their portfolios and capitalize on the strong financial returns offered by our brands.\nFor investors and as a long-term shareholder, myself, the bold initiatives we're taking that will give us a leading edge in all markets is an aspect to our story that can't be ignored, and I look forward to sharing the continued progress in that pursuit and unlocking the multiple unique levers for profitable growth.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our first quarter financial results, our balance sheet and capital strategy and our outlook for 2025. As David mentioned, we are off to a good start in 2025, with momentum in our top line, impressive growth in digital mix and strong profit flow-through to the bottom line. First quarter system sales grew 5%, driven by 3% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. Ex special G&A expenses were $274 million, up 3% year-over-year. Reported G&A was $302 million and includes $24 million in special expenses related to our resource optimization program that is unlocking efficiency in the organization, along with investments related to our brand headquarter's consolidation.\nYum!'s core operating profit was $586 million, up 8%, highlighting the strength of our global multi-brand portfolio. Delivering 8% core operating profit is a strong result in a complex consumer environment, driven by the contributions of our twin growth engines. Taco Bell delivered 16% core operating profit growth, led by double-digit system sales growth and strong profit flow-through on flat G&A. KFC grew operating profit 9%, driven by 5% system sales growth and lower G&A, a good example of the impact of the strategic actions we've taken to remove duplicative work across the system.\nAt Pizza Hut, first quarter operating profit growth was negatively impacted by 7 percentage points or approximately $6 million due to expenses associated with transitioning stores from 4 franchise entities to new ownership, and by 3 percentage points due to timing of technology spending within franchise, advertising and other services expenses.\nOne important driver of Yum!'s overall performance is our store-level margin performance, particularly for our largest equity estate, Taco Bell. Taco Bell's magic formula allows it to deliver category-leading value while also maintaining industry-leading margins. The expansion of Taco Bell's Luxe Cravings box lineup at $5, $7 and $9 price points delivered exceptional value across income levels, with the $5 Luxe box becoming a massive win with low-income consumers.\nAs we announced at [indiscernible] Live, we expect Taco Bell U.S. full year margins to come in at 24% to 25%. At Habit, restaurant-level margin performance was commendable, with an impressive 310-basis-point improvement year-over-year despite meaningful labor headwinds in California. Another factor supporting store-level margins across all brands is the acceleration in digital sales. At Taco Bell, digital mix reached 42%, while Habit expanded digital mix 10 points driven by kiosk sales increasing to 17% of mix, up from 10% last year.\nFirst quarter ex special EPS was $1.30. Reported EPS was $0.90, including an unfavorable tax impact of $0.33 relating to a tax reserve in a foreign jurisdiction.\nFinally, in general, our business has minimal supply chain-related tariff risk as most markets source within their country or with countries where there is not currently tariff risk. As a result, we expect tariffs to have an immaterial impact on our system-wide supply chain. Our global scale offers our system advantages to drive supply chain efficiencies, and our expert teams are partnering with suppliers and franchisees on the limited items where there is potential impact.\nNow on to development. While Q1 development reflects previously signaled and planned closures, including in Turkey and across Pizza Hut, Unit development in the first quarter was in line with our forecast, and we are on track to deliver 5% unit growth, excluding Turkey this year. Our development engine remains healthy with 751 new stores opened in Q1, roughly in line with Q1 last year across 68 countries. KFC led the way with 528 openings, the second highest for a first quarter in their history, driven by growth in China, India, Japan and Thailand. Globally, KFC offers highly attractive paybacks with the global average below 5 years and even stronger paybacks in markets like China, Thailand and the Middle East.\nPizza Hut delivered solid development with 198 new units across 34 markets, while Taco Bell added 24 gross units. Taco Bell's net unit development in Q1 reflects planned phasing, closures in Malaysia and the closure of remaining restaurants in China's Tier 2 cities. As announced at Taco Bell Consumer Day in March, the team is on track to deliver 100 international net new units this year, with growth strongest in the U.K., Spain and India.\nLastly, Habit continues to improve its store level paybacks and is exploring opportunities to capitalize on lower cost conversions from fast casual brands, closing stores in its core markets.\nAs a reminder, the termination of our franchise agreement in Turkey resulted in 537 closures, 283 KFC locations and 254 Pizza Hut locations. As shared on our last call, the Pizza Hut team also accelerated planned closures or engaged with franchise partners to strengthen our system, specifically in markets such as Chile, the U.K. and the U.S. Notably, in the U.S. and U.K., we facilitated a transfer of more than 200 stores to more capable franchise partners.\nIn Latin America, recently, the Serono Group signed a binding agreement for majority ownership in a joint venture with IMC, our KFC franchisee in Brazil. The Serano Group is 1 of our world-class 3C partners who started with their first KFC store in Ecuador and now manages nearly 800 stores across 6 countries in Latin America. Over the past 3 years, they've opened 183 new stores, leveraging a sophisticated supply chain that includes in-house commissaries and chicken processing facilities. We believe this strategic deal paves the way for accelerated unit growth in a large and underpenetrated market.\nAs David mentioned, earlier this month, we hosted our Global Franchise Convention in Sydney, Australia, bringing together franchisees from around the world. The energy and enthusiasm were unmistakable. Over several days, we aligned on brand strategy, covering everything from world-class development capabilities to cutting-edge marketing analytics, while showcasing the power of our global network and the competitive advantage that comes from sharing best practices across markets. We also celebrated franchise partners who delivered outstanding results, underscoring the strength of our system. The chance to speak with so many of our franchisees made it clear that sentiment in the Yum! system is strong with many eager to grow their portfolios and helped to reinforce one of Yum!'s greatest advantages, a network of strong corporate-minded franchise partners who see opportunity and are willing to invest even in times of macro volatility.\nI'll now discuss our connected brand strategy that continues to revolutionize digital and technology across our system, strengthening operations, enhancing consumer experiences and unlocking new insights. Byte by Yum, with emphasis on both foundational and AI-driven capabilities, was showcased extensively at the franchise convention and our D&T leaders engaged in meaningful one-on-one conversations with our largest and most strategic franchisees, deepening relationships and reinforcing our shared vision for growth. We held in-depth product demonstrations for our Byte platform and highlighted some of the unique innovations only possible with an integrated technology stack. As a result of this, we have overwhelming interest from our franchisees in adopting Byte in the restaurants. Completing the rollout of Byte and our U.S. brands remains a top priority in 2025. But given the level of interest, we're beginning to work with our international franchisees on how we can scale Byte into their markets in an accelerated fashion over the coming years.\nWe are also thrilled to announce our partnership with NVIDIA this quarter, a milestone that enables us to accelerate the development and deployment of cutting-edge AI technology solutions across our system. We're focusing on 3 key areas of the business; voice automated drive-thru and call center operations to deliver more natural and seamless ordering experiences for our consumers, computer vision technology to enhance back of house and drive through efficiency through real-time analytics, and advanced restaurant intelligence to equip general managers with personalized action plans that drive operational excellence. These innovations will enhance operational performance, support our teams and elevate the guest experience across our brands. We believe AI will become the new operating system of restaurants and our partnership with NVIDIA positions Yum! at the forefront of that revolution.\nNow let me highlight the significant strides across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. Starting with our Easy Experience this pillar, where we prioritize delivering frictionless consumer experiences. This quarter, Pizza Hut U.K. powered by the launch of our Byte Commerce platform achieved impressive digital momentum with a 67% year-over-year increase in mobile app transactions. In 2025, we're set to scale Byte Commerce to 4 new Pizza Hut international markets and introduce AI-powered personalization to drive higher average order value and accelerate transaction growth. KFC is also making strong progress in this area with kiosks, now representing its largest digital sales channel, accounting for nearly 50% of all digital sales, excluding China, highlighting the growing consumer preference for this convenient ordering option.\nTurning to our Easy Operations pillar, where we're focused on optimizing operations to support and empower our team members. In Q1, we expanded Byte Restaurant Coach to an additional 5,000 stores. The Byte Coach's digital routine tools and training have enabled more proactive, consistent and scalable performance management across our restaurants. At Taco Bell U.S., we onboarded an additional 1,500 restaurants to Byte's back-of-house platform, bringing the total stores live to 3,000. This continued momentum reflects strong operator engagement and meaningful progress toward building a fully connected kitchen ecosystem that drives efficiency and data informed decision-making.\nLastly, under our Easy Insights pillar, we're leveraging data to drive smarter, more informed decision-making. Our U.S. brands are harnessing our powerful data engine and first of its kind cross-brand consumer data platform to deliver personalized marketing campaigns, which, for our first test through the e-mail channel, delivered 2x the improvement in consumer engagement compared to traditional e-mail marketing. Since the end of last year, we've expanded AI-driven marketing use cases across our brands, further embedding intelligence into how we engage and convert consumers.\nThese advancements are driving smarter targeting, increased efficiency and stronger returns on our digital marketing investments.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $56 million, reflecting $15 million in refranchising proceeds and $71 million in gross capital expenditures. Throughout the quarter, we repurchased approximately 1.56 million shares for a total of $228 million. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 3.9x.\nSubsequent to quarter end, we took advantage of a favorable window of interest rate volatility to enter into a new 3-year interest rate hedge, reducing our exposure to interest rate risk on $1.5 billion of variable rate debt for which hedges had recently expired. As a result, we expect $10 million in interest rate savings versus our planned interest expense for 2025, which had contemplated higher interest rates on net debt.\nAs I shared on the last call, subject to market conditions, we expect to maintain our net leverage ratio at approximately 4x over the medium term by issuing incremental debt subject to market conditions as our business grows. Overall, our capital priorities remain unchanged and focused on maximizing shareholder value through strategic investments in the business, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nNow let me share our latest outlook for the full year. 2025 is shaping up to be a complex year to navigate given economic uncertainty and geopolitical challenges. However, we believe this is another year that will demonstrate the resilience of our business model.\nIn the U.S., Taco Bell, which represents approximately 80% of our U.S. profit, is incredibly well positioned to navigate this environment as the value leader with an opportunity to take share from higher-priced competitors. Its robust innovation pipeline, including the return of crispy chicken nuggets in Q2, reinforces our view.\nInternationally, we are seeing that KFC, which represents 85% of our international profits, is recovering from the Middle East conflict and gaining momentum around the world. More broadly, the strength of our diversified portfolio of 4 brands and more than 155 countries, combined with our well-capitalized 3C partners allows us to manage country-specific challenges and continue investing through uncertainty. Given these advantages and after a strong Q1 performance, we remain confident in our plan to deliver 8% core operating profit growth this year, excluding the lap of the benefit of the 53rd week in 2024.\nAs for the shape of the profit growth this year, in Q2, we expect to experience lower profit growth, in part due to onetime expenses such as our global franchise convention. As a result, we expect second half operating profit growth to be higher than the first half, landing us on algorithm for the full year.\nFinally, on FX, with the U.S. dollar's recent move lower, at current spot rates, we expect a $10 million tailwind to GAAP operating profit for the remainder of the year.\nTo close, while the near-term macro environment remains uncertain, our leaders at Yum! are focused on the long-term opportunity, the vast under-penetrated white space around the globe. We're making significant progress toward becoming a more efficient, adaptable and data-driven organization, and in a challenging consumer environment, we remain energized by the momentum behind bold initiatives like Live Mas Cafe, Sauce and Quench, each offering distinct avenues to grow our top line and expand market share. Our 98% franchise structure, global footprint and consistent cash generation give us flexibility and confidence no matter the near-term noise. With that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Direct requests can be made by contacting the Investor Relations team.\nNow I'll turn it over to David.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm incredibly proud of what Yum! Brands accomplished this past year. Despite industry-wide challenges, we continued to deliver strong results, underscoring the resilience of our business model, the power of our iconic brands and the strength of our world-class franchise partners.\nOur momentum is clear. We achieved remarkable milestones generating over 50% of our system sales through digital channels surpassing 60,000 total units globally with more than 30,000 at KFC alone and generating more than $1 billion in core operating profit from the Taco Bell division for the first time ever.\nTaco Bell U.S. delivered an incredibly strong year and one that significantly outperformed the industry, showing clearly that Taco Bell is a category of one brand. Our financial results reflect the strength of our business with full year core operating profit growth of 8%, reinforcing the power of our growth strategy and the durability of our business. One of the biggest drivers of our success and a major unlock for our future is our proprietary technology platform.\nIn 2024, we accelerated our technology transformation by integrating our digital and technology teams into a unified global team. Additionally, we are thrilled today to introduce Bite by Yum!, our comprehensive collection of proprietary Software-as-a-Service products that enables our restaurants to deliver faster, more seamless experiences for consumers while streamlining operations and empowering teams.\nIntegrating our best-in-class yet previously disparate solutions into a comprehensive, easy-to-deploy solution will help accelerate platform adoption. KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell U.S. all currently operate on our Bite digital ordering platform and 25,000 Yum! restaurants across the world are using at least 1 Bite by Yum! product.\nAs we continue to raise the bar in digital convenience and engagement, we are seeing clear results, our digital sales grew approximately 15% in 2024, and we're just getting started. With the strength of our brands, the power of our technology and the dedication of our franchisees and teams, we are well positioned for another year of strong growth ahead.\nI'll now discuss the strategic drivers that underline our commitment to being the most loved, deeply connected and always trusted brands for consumers around the world. Afterwards, Chris will provide a deep dive on our fourth quarter results, balance sheet position and capital strategy, followed by our outlook for 2025.\nStarting with our loved pillar and our brands that champion consumer experiences. We're pleased to report that our twin growth engines, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, delivered 7% system sales growth and 14% core operating profit growth in the fourth quarter. These 2 businesses, which represent approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit, continue to be powerful drivers of our long-term success.\nAt KFC, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit, units grew 7%, driving system sales growth of 3% for the full year despite a 2% decline in same-store sales. In the fourth quarter, same-store sales were flat year-over-year with international same-store sales improving to plus 1% and sequential momentum building throughout the quarter. We're especially encouraged by strong recoveries in the Middle East, where same-store sales experienced significant growth and robust performance in Africa, Latin America and Canada, all of which saw a mid- to high single-digit same-store sales growth.\nIn Africa, comps rose 9%, driven primarily by increased traffic, as the team successfully executed a multipronged marketing approach emphasizing boneless and core abundant value offerings while also expanding beverage sales.\nLatin America's strategy, leaning into everyday value and disruptive promotions, broadens its consumer reach and increased frequency, driving a 6% year-over-year same-store sales increase in Q4. We also saw notable quarter-over-quarter momentum in several key markets, including a 5-point improvement across our Asia business, excluding China.\nLooking ahead to 2025, we remain focused on deepening market penetration by expanding relevant product offerings, including tenders, nuggets, twisters and sandwiches while enhancing our value perception. This will involve refining pricing strategies and identifying key category pricing threshold to ensure we remain at the top of the consumers' consideration.\nTurning to Taco Bell, which accounts for 37% of our divisional operating profit. The brand continued its strong momentum in 2024, with full year system sales up 6% fueled by exceptional same-store sales growth. Taco Bell not only gained dollar share of total industry spend, but also increased consumer frequency across all income segments, reinforcing its broad consumer appeal.\nThis momentum carried into the fourth quarter with same-store sales rising 5% year-over-year, outpacing the U.S. industry by 5 percentage points, driven by the successful execution of Taco Bell's magic formula. The decades platform, which brought back 5 of the brand's most in-demand nostalgic menu items, generated strong product innovation, brand excitement and exclusive merchandise for loyalty members.\nThe team also underscored value leadership with the $7 Luxe box, one of the most compelling value offerings in the industry. At Taco Bell International, same-store sales grew 3% in Q4, marking the strongest quarter of the year. Several key markets, including the U.K., Spain and India, saw notable sales lifts after successfully refocusing on brand buzz and disruptive value promotions to drive transactions.\nTaco Bell's consistent market outperformance, innovative product pipeline and strategic value positioning set the stage for continued strong growth in 2025.\nTurning to Pizza Hut, which represents 13% of our divisional operating profit. Full year system sales declined 1%, including 2% net new unit growth. In the fourth quarter, same-store sales growth improved 300 basis points sequentially. We saw a standout performance in India from successfully driving brand buzz and consumer engagement with innovative, limited time offerings like the Momo Mia pizza, while also leveraging aggressive value deals to boost frequency and trial.\nIn the U.S., sales remained under pressure due to more value competition across both the QSR industry and the pizza category. We've seen that everyday value offerings such as the $7 deal lovers, effectively drive repeat visits from existing consumers. However, to attract lighter lapsed consumers, we must lean further into disruptive and distinctive value promotions.\nLooking ahead to 2025, our focus will be on striking the right balance between everyday value and disruptive campaigns to engage a broader consumer base. Additionally, we are committed to enhancing the digital experience with improvements to our app platform that will elevate engagement and bring value to the forefront of the consumer journey with Pizza Hut.\nWith the right mix of innovation, value and digital improvements, we are confident in our ability to strengthen Pizza Hut's relative brand positioning and reinvigorate top line momentum.\nAt Habit Burger and Grill, full year system sales grew 1%, driven by unit growth. Encouragingly, same-store sales trends improved in the fourth quarter fueled by a successful marketing campaign highlighting Habit's recognition as the #1 burger in America by USA TODAY Reader's Choice. The team will continue to leverage this momentum, emphasizing its suite of award-winning menu items including the Double Char Burger and #1 ranked side\nBeyond top line growth, we are pleased to see operational efficiencies translating into improved profitability. The ongoing labor productivity initiatives launched in 2024 have driven notable improvements in labor throughput, allowing us to reduce restaurant labor expense as a percentage of sales by 150 basis points despite higher labor rates in California. As a result, restaurant-level margins reached 10% in 2024, a 150 basis points higher year-over-year. This progress underscores our commitment to enhancing operational efficiency, strengthening brand equity and positioning Habit Burger for a sustained growth in the year ahead.\nAs we embrace a bolder, more creative approach to innovation, we are taking decisive steps to elevate the consumer experience and meet the evolving preferences of the next-generation consumer. At KFC in December, we opened by KFC, a flavor-forward test concept restaurant in Orlando designed for the next generation of boneless chicken lovers.\nThe menu features tenders and sandwiches paired with 11 irresistible sauces complemented by a diverse 11 beverage lineup, including teas, freezes and refreshers. Early engagement has been promising, reinforcing our belief in potential to drive sales and enhance brand relevance.\nAt Taco Bell, we are testing Live Más Cafe, an in-store beverage-focused cafe featuring specialty drinks like chillers Agua Refresca, coffees and more. Consumer response has been strong with the cafe concept driving meaningful incremental sales. These innovations reflect our commitment to staying ahead of consumer trends, enhancing brand differentiation and creating new avenues for growth.\nWhile these are only 1 unit pilots today, we plan to expand both test concepts this year to better understand their long-term growth potential and role in our portfolio.\nMoving to our connected pillar. We're advancing our ability to serve every consumer everywhere at any time. The strong momentum in digital sales in 2024 is a testament to targeted brand initiatives, loyalty conversion strategies and continued deployment of our proprietary tech platform.\nYum! Digital sales grew approximately 15% to over $30 billion, underscoring the impact of our digital-first approach. At KFC, excluding China, digital sales surged more than 20%, driven by expanded kiosk adoption. With more than 50% of stores outside China equipped with kiosks at year-end 2024, our teams are focused on reaching 70% penetration by 2026.\nAs digital engagement grows, so does our loyalty opportunity. At KFC, we are scaling our global loyalty program now live in 14 markets and early data is promising. Loyalty members show a 12% increase in visit frequency after joining. Loyalty remains a high potential growth area. And in 2025, we will sharpen our focus on optimizing program effectiveness.\nThis includes expanding the adoption of loyalty technology across our portfolio, ensuring we continue to deepen consumer engagement and drive repeat visits through personalized data-driven experiences. At Yum!, we take great pride in our unrivaled culture and talent, including our deep bench of amazing leaders.\nI'd like to start by congratulating Scott Masvinski, who will assume the role of KFC Division CEO on March 1. Scott started 20 years ago as an analyst at KFC U.S. and has had multiple positions at both KFC and Yum!, including key market leadership roles with KFC around the globe and is currently the President of Taco Bell.\nScott's innovative approach and strategic vision has significantly contributed to the success of Taco Bell, and I have full confidence that his leadership will drive KFC to new heights. I would also like to recognize and thank [indiscernible] for his years of service and the tremendous impact he made at KFC. [indiscernible] exemplifies what it means to lead with heart, smart and courage and how these qualities can drive performance. Under his leadership, KFC experienced remarkable growth.\nAs part of our commitment to fostering trust with consumers, communities and partners, we continue to look for new ways to make our packaging reusable, recyclable or compostable. KFC US, Taco Bell and Habit recently participated in the Petaluma reusable cup pilot, which was a strategic opportunity for Yum! to better understand the feasibility of reusable.\nIn addition, Pizza Hut completed the first 2 of 3 phases of its initiative to increase pizza box recycling. This project aims to educate consumers about recycling pizza boxes and encourage positive changes in their behavior. Although the pilot is currently limited to 1 market, we hope that proactive communication about recycling will inspire positive consumer action. Before handing it over to Chris, I want to emphasize that delivering 8% core operating profit growth in a challenging year for the QSR industry, while navigating discrete sales headwinds in select global markets, is a testament to the resilience of our business model, the power of our brands and the world-class talent we have leading our businesses around the globe.\nLooking ahead to 2025 and beyond, we are more confident than ever in our ability to create long-term value leveraging these core competencies. We are taking bold, decisive actions to evolve our organization, positioning ourselves to capitalize on next-generation growth opportunities. At the same time, our investments in 2024 involving technology innovation and operational effectiveness will make us more agile and resilient to ensure we emerge even stronger in the next phase of our journey.\nEverything we do at Yum! is anchored in our mission to grow iconic restaurant brands loved by consumers connected through teamwork, technology and our global scale and trusted everywhere we operate. We are privileged to steward a portfolio of world-class globally recognized brands backed by a high-margin, recurring free cash flow business model operated by best-in-class franchisees that fuels long-term growth and delivers compounding shareholder value.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David. And good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our 2024 financial results, our balance sheet and capital strategy and our outlook for the upcoming year.\nStarting with the fourth quarter. System-wide sales grew 5%, driven by 5% net new unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Our top line trends strengthened in the fourth quarter fueled by our twin growth engines as well as improvements in Taco Bell International and Pizza Hut International.\nTaco Bell's very impressive performance in the U.S. outpaced the market significantly. At KFC International, a sharper focus on digital engagement, everyday value platforms and disruptive value offers led to a 2-point sequential acceleration in same-store sales growth in markets outside of the Middle East, Indonesia and Malaysia.\nIn the Middle East, KFC saw a strong recovery in transactions with traffic showing strong growth and same-store sales increasing by a notable percentage. By December, transactions had largely rebounded to pre-conflict levels.\nIn China, KFC continued to expand its market share, with these gains further accelerating in the fourth quarter. We remain highly confident in our long-term potential in China, supported by our strong partnership with Yum! China, the largest and most capable restaurant operator in the world.\nTurning to our cost line items. Ex special G&A expenses were $319 million, reflecting a 7% year-over-year decline. Reported G&A included a $27 million special expense related to our resource optimization project and costs for our German acquisition and Turkey termination.\nRestaurant-level margins improved by 20 basis points year-over-year to 17.6%, reflecting strong gains at both Habit and Taco Bell. As a result, core operating profit grew 12% due to higher restaurant level margins and lower G&A spend. Ex special EPS for the fourth quarter was $1.52.\nMoving to our full year results. We achieved 5% net new unit growth in line with our long-term aspirations. Same-store sales declined 1% for the year, impacted by broader global consumer sentiment, particularly in markets affected by the Middle East conflict.\nEx special G&A was $1.1 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Through our resource optimization program, we aim to drive greater efficiencies, enhanced collaboration across the organization and eliminate duplicative work across brands. As a result, we removed approximately $25 million in G&A expenditures in 2024, translating to $50 million on an annual basis, some of which we flowed to the bottom line and some we reinvested into organizational capabilities that drive future growth.\nAs we transition to a more streamlined digital and technology organization with increased productivity and as we continue to deploy our capabilities across our system, we're bending the curve on the net P&L impact of our digital and technology investments.\nShifting to restaurant profitability. Total restaurant level margins stood at 16.8% with Taco Bell achieving 24.3%, its second highest full year margin rate behind 2020. Habit restaurant level margins improved to 10%, rising 150 basis points year-over-year and over 500 basis points relative to 2022. Notably, despite higher labor rates in California, Habit's labor costs, as a percentage of company sales, decreased 150 basis points year-over-year, thanks to strategic labor model enhancements and process optimization.\nAs a result of these moves and the hard work of our teams, we achieved core operating profit growth of 8%, a strong result given the macroeconomic challenges. This reflects the resilience of our multi-brand global franchise business model. Our effective tax rate ended the year at 23.5%, outside of our previously communicated range of 21% to 23% due to higher tax expense on the gain realized when we sold our investment in Debyani in 2024. This profit growth drove a 4% increase in EPS and to $5.39, excluding special items and the 53rd week impact, but including a higher year-over-year tax rate impact of $0.19 as well as an additional $0.18 headwind due to the combined impacts of year-over-year Debyani net investment losses and current year foreign currency translation headwinds.\nMoving on to our robust development engine. We opened over 1,800 new units in Q4 and more than 4,500 for the year, reinforcing the strong investment appeal of our brands and the high confidence of our franchise partners and the long-term growth potential of our brands.\nKFC led the way, opening a record nearly 2,900 new units this year across 97 countries with 16 markets opening 25 or more stores. This year, the brand saw its highest ever store openings with record builds in China, South Africa, Japan, the Philippines, Italy and Chile.\nAt Pizza Hut, the team opened 512 units in Q4 and 1,280 for the year, driven by expansion in China, India, Saudi Arabia and Canada. In line with our modernization efforts, Pizza Hut introduced a new U.S. restaurant design concept in November, replicating elements of its successful digital-forward model from international markets. This format aligns with evolving consumer expectations by featuring an open kitchen, self-access pickup cabinets and a digital drive-thru with a streamlined menu of high-demand items.\nTaco Bell continued its expansion, adding 347 new units, including 234 in the U.S. and 113 internationally.\nTurning to the Middle East, specifically, the resilience of our business in the region is evidenced by the fact that we opened 171 new stores in 2024 across our KFC and Pizza Hut brands, excluding Turkey, thanks primarily to our largest partner in that region, Americana.\nOn a net new unit basis globally, in total, we delivered 1,301 net new units in the quarter and 2,757 for the year, reflecting the strength of our gross openings, partly offset by an uptick in closures of primarily low volume, low royalty stores tied to underperforming markets. Nothing is more important than maintaining high standards and protecting the reputation of our brands.\nIn this regard, last month, we terminated our franchise agreements in Turkey and reacquired the master franchise rights for Germany, which will result in the removal of 284 KFC and 254 Pizza Hut stores in Turkey from our unit count in Q1. From time to time, we removed franchisees from our system when they cannot meet our standards. In those situations, the closing units are typically well below our system average AUVs.\nAs a result, and as was the case with Turkey, the financial impact is typically not significant to our ongoing financial performance from such terminations. These transitions create long-term opportunities for new growth-minded franchise partners, and we are actively searching for the right 3C franchise partner to reopen the Turkey market and drive future success. As a reminder, we had a similar situation in Saudi Arabia in 2020, and that market is now seeing strong growth.\nI'll now discuss our connected brand strategy that continues to revolutionize digital and technology across our system, strengthening operations, enhancing consumer experiences and unlocking new insights.\nThrough Bite, we are making significant strides across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars, paving the way for a more connected, data-driven and efficient future. We continue to focus on delivering frictionless consumer experiences under our Easy Experiences pillar. In 2024, we made excellent progress deploying our Bite digital ordering platform, formerly the Yum! Commerce platform.\nTaco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut in the U.S. are all now powered by our Bite digital ordering products with Pizza Hut U.S. substantially completing its transition in Q4. We also migrated 3 Pizza Hut international markets, including the U.K., on to the Bite digital ordering platform in 2024. In the U.K., the platform facilitated over 50% digital transaction growth on the app channel and drove faster processing times than the previous system.\nIn 2025, we plan to expand our Bite digital ordering platform to 5 additional markets, while introducing AI-driven personalization and our omnichannel loyalty software. The Bite digital ordering platform and its seamless connection with our Bite restaurant technologies, make it easier for consumers to place digital orders while reducing complexity for our team members.\nWithin Easy Operations, we empower franchisees with our best-in-class Bite restaurant management platform to enhance efficiency and optimize operations. In 2024, we more than doubled the number of stores using Bite's Restaurant Coach mobile app, formerly Super App, to over 20,000 KFC and Pizza Hut locations across 120 countries. This mobile app simplifies routine audits and operations and is the scale platform we will use to deliver AI-driven recommendations to our team members.\nMeanwhile, our Bite kitchen and delivery system, formerly Dragontail, is now live in over 8,000 restaurants across multiple markets with full implementation planned for KFC U.S. and Pizza Hut U.S. in 2025 and continued expansion globally.\nAt Taco Bell U.S., we continue to launch our Bite back-of-house technology, formerly tracks restaurant management system, and reached over 1,500 restaurants in 2024 with plans to scale it across the entire system in 2025.\nLastly, I'll discuss our Easy Insights pillar. Our AI and data-driven approach is redefining how we engage with consumers. Our rich hub of transactional detail is combined with operations data, guest experience data and consumer data to power our AI strategies.\nOne area we continue to be excited about is AI-driven marketing to enable hyperpersonalized messaging and experiences. Already, our U.S. brands are leveraging AI to execute targeted campaigns with early tests on e-mail promotions resulting in a doubling of consumer engagement compared to traditional approaches.\nThis breakthrough is just the beginning. We expect to scale AI-driven personalization across all brands and digital channels, creating more relevant and engaging consumer interactions. With Bite's rapidly expanding capabilities, we are building an intelligent integrated digital platform that strengthens our brands, enhances consumer experiences and empowers our franchisees.\nAs we scale these innovations, we are confident they will drive long-term growth, deeper consumer connections and a more efficient operating model across our global system. The future is digital, and we are leading the way.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for 2024 totaled $208 million, reflecting $49 million in refranchising proceeds and $257 million in gross capital expenditures.\nIn line with our commitment to deliver shareholder value, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.71 per share. Throughout the year, we repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares for a total of $440 million. Combining dividends and share buybacks, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders in 2024. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.0x, with our debt balance remaining largely unchanged.\nGiven our continued confidence in Yum!'s future trajectory and that our leverage has drifted lower by a full turn, we plan to deliver materially higher capital returns going forward than in the past 2 years. Specifically, and subject to market conditions, we expect to stop deleveraging and maintain our net leverage ratio at approximately 4x over the medium term by issuing incremental debt as our business grows. Overall, our capital priorities remain unchanged and focus on maximizing shareholder value through strategic investments in the business, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to shareholders.\nLooking ahead to 2025, we remain confident in our long-term growth trajectory while acknowledging some near-term headwinds. Our Q1 unit growth will reflect the 538 units exited in Turkey. We will also, in Q1, move forward with expediting closures of a number of Pizza Hut restaurants in a few markets, resulting in an incremental 200 closures. Despite the resulting decline in our unit count during the first quarter relative to the end of 2024, we expect full year unit growth in 2025 to reach at least 4% or 5% when excluding the onetime Turkey-related closures.\nAs always, our unit growth is more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We anticipate same-store sales performance will improve in many markets supported by stronger value perception scores and an ongoing sales recovery in markets affected by the Middle East conflict, and we anticipate another strong year of sales performance at Taco Bell U.S. We expect G&A to increase by a low single-digit percentage, excluding the headwind from the reset of below target incentive compensation experienced in 2024. Including this onetime headwind and assuming an on-target bonus expense, we expect G&A to increase by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2025. We are pleased to share that this G&A profile, coupled with the previously mentioned unit and sales growth drivers, leads us to plan another very strong year of core operating profit growth, delivering on our long-term algorithm target of 8%.\nTurning to items impacting net income. Excluding the impact of the previously mentioned potential incremental debt issuances, we expect interest expense to fall between $500 million and $520 million. Regarding our expected tax rate, we, like other multinationals, are seeing ongoing increases in foreign income tax rates and are increasing our forecasted range for taxes to 22% to 24%.\nIn summary, we are optimistic about the year ahead with strong brand momentum across our portfolio as we enter 2025.\nAs Matt mentioned, we're thrilled to host Taco Bell's Consumer Day in New York City on March 4, where we will showcase Taco Bell Live Más LIVE and unveil the brand's ambitious growth plan. originally scheduled for an earlier date, we decided to reschedule this event to prioritize the safety and well-being of Los Angeles residents affected by the devastating California wildfires and to avoid distracting from the ongoing recovery and rebuilding efforts in that community.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Lauren, and I will be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Morris\n\nCEO, Stewart Information Services Corp.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following the remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statement in the earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and the relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency.\nAs a reminder, several of the Yum! Brands business units report on a period calendar basis including all U.S. and Canada brands, KFC U.K. and KFC Australia. When forecasting 2024, please keep in mind this year will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for those entities. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback.\nWe would like to make you aware of the upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Our third quarter earnings will be released on November 5 with the conference call on the same day. Finally, on our last call, we shared the timing for our talk about consumer date originally planned for December of this year. We are finalizing a revised date for early next year. Please stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Despite continued challenging operating environment, I'm pleased Yum! was able to deliver 10% growth in core operating profit this quarter, thanks to our team's strong execution and progress on the initiatives laid out on our last call. While we take comfort in improving global trends and still expect the first quarter warrant the low for same-store sales growth, significant volatility remains, and we recognize sales in some markets are not where we want them to be.\nThe impacts from the Middle East conflict, in addition to a more cost-conscious consumer, have presented headwinds to same-store sales. Despite these tougher waters, we are confident we will deliver on profit growth in line with our long-term algorithm for 2024 and are set up for continued strong growth in 2025. Fortunately, we are well positioned to navigate these consumer headwinds given the strength of our brands and reputations for value no matter the environment.\nNonetheless, ensuring we provide consumers affordable options has been an area of greater focus for us since last year with all of our brands having offered disruptive deals and introduced or reintroduced the track of everyday value with examples in the U.S. such as KFC's Taste of KFC deals, Pizza Hut's $7 Deal Lovers and Taco Bell's Cravings Value Menu. As a result, our brands experienced improving trends relative to the first quarter in the U.S. market, and we continue to refine our offerings in international markets to recapture similar momentum.\nThe second quarter offered signs of improving fundamentals. For example, at Taco Bell, we've begun to see sensitivities to check management stabilize to improve from Q1 into Q2, and have witnessed year-over-year check growth led by items per transaction. Internationally, KFC markets excluding China, that we believe were not impacted materially by the Middle East conflict, reported an encouraging mid-single-digit increase in same-store sales.\nAcross our system, our 2024 commodity inflation has come in lower than we expected heading into the year, helping our franchise partners navigate recent sales volatility. Furthermore, momentum in the critical and strategic areas of our business remains strong. This includes robust increases in digital sales, progress leveraging our scale, continued deployment of our proprietary technology ecosystem and efficiency improvements in our cost structure from efforts underway in the next phase of our journey to be a leading global digital restaurant company.\nOur twin growth engines, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, helped Yum! deliver 3% system sales growth driven by market share gains at Taco Bell U.S. and strong unit growth at KFC International. Combined, these two powerful business units delivered 7% operating profit growth.\nAt an individual level, unmatched innovation fueled Taco Bell U.S.' 7% increase in system sales with Cantina Chicken performing above our expectations. Taco Bell is a clear standout in today's environment, not only achieving same-store sales growth well ahead of the QSR category, but delivering restaurant-level margins near a record high. In addition, Taco Bell's same-store sales grew mid-single digits across all income cohorts, proving that craveable innovation even at a higher price point wins with today's consumers.\nAt KFC International, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, same-store sales showed strong improvement on a 2-year trend, and unit growth in the quarter was an impressive 9% year-over-year as franchisees take advantage of strong paybacks. I know from experience, this powerful brand is not constrained by expansion opportunity, but rather its growth and success are tied closely with having the right franchise partner. This is why we are very intentional about who we choose to allow into our system.\nFor example, our new franchise partner in South Korea took over in April 2023 and has drastically improved performance with same-store sales up 17% this quarter. In that vein, the KFC team is tirelessly working to give our franchisees the tools to succeed, including furthering the expansion of Super App and the KFC global loyalty program, which is now live in 14 markets.\nNow I'll discuss our relevant, easy and distinctive brands or R.E.D for short, followed by our unrivaled culture and talent and good growth strategy. Chris will provide an update on our second quarter results, followed by our bold restaurant development, unmatched operating capabilities and balance sheet position and capital strategy.\nBeginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit, we grew system sales 2% led by 8% unit growth. Our same-store sales were down 3%, largely on account of scattered pockets of weakness in a number of markets relating to the Middle East conflict and underperformance in the U.S. market. This quarter, we did not see any improvement in the most directly impacted markets. If Q2 trends hold, the pressure on same-store sales growth for the set of directly impacted markets will begin to abate as we lap the prior year's sales impact beginning in November.\nBeyond the most significantly impacted markets of the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, we've seen sales impacts from the Middle East conflict surface in several other markets based on store performance comparisons across neighborhoods.\nIn other parts of the world, we witnessed trends improved from the first quarter, including Canada and Central and Eastern Europe, while South Africa's transactions began to improve during the quarter.\nAnother exciting development in the quarter was Yum China celebrating its 200th K Coffee, which consists of an adjacent storefront that is part of an existing KFC, allowing a reduced investment and lower operating costs from sharing KFC kitchen facilities. The Yum China team has averaged one new K Coffee per day since the beginning of 2024. While these do not count as new units in our system, they are a driver of future same-store sales growth. This quarter, we acquired 216 KFC restaurants in the U.K. and Ireland, and we have started to optimize restaurant operations there. Lastly, KFC digital sales, excluding China grew nearly 20% with an impressive 40% growth in kiosk sales.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 37% of our divisional operating profit. U.S. same-store sales grew 5%, outpacing the U.S. QSR industry by a wide margin. Taco Bell executed its winning formula this quarter through introducing a variety of compelling innovations such as the Cheez-It and secret [ Aardvark Fries ]. The second quarter often reflected sales contribution from the Cantina Chicken menu, our foray into an elevated chicken offering and a new platform to innovate around. Since the platform launch, Taco Bell's chicken sales mix has increased 10 points with nearly 1 in 4 orders, including a Chicken Cantina item.\nAnother part of the team's winning formula is digital in which digital sales continue to grow at a breakneck pace. In Q2, Taco Bell's loyalty sales were up over 30%.\nAt Taco Bell International, the team is working on building brand relevance. It is still early days in many markets and trends remain volatile but we remain confident in the long-term opportunity. A restored emphasis on value has forced our teams to be creative with a limited national marketing budget. In more mature markets within Europe, which accounts for over 40% of Taco Bell International system sales, we saw encouraging signs of improvement with the introduction of value offers.\nNext, I'll discuss our Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales [ were flat ] this quarter and units expanded 3% year-over-year. International same-store sales remained negative in part because of a stalled recovery in Malaysia and Indonesia. We're encouraged Pizza Hut same-store sales -- have improved 4 points from last quarter with progressing trends in the U.S. and encouraging recoveries in Thailand and Hong Kong.\nAround the world, our team is actively expanding [ My Hut Box ] introducing [ Melts ], including most recently in India and Thailand. Both platforms lift underdeveloped dayparts, expand individual meal occasions and provide attractive price points to our consumers. Since joining Pizza Hut as CEO in 2021, Aaron Powell has assembled an amazing team and is providing strong leadership to drive efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity and align the brand to consumer trends. In the U.S., momentum accelerated throughout the quarter with an increase in weekly per restaurant average transactions attributable to a number of value-based promotions and the launch of My Hut Box.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, second quarter system sales declined 1%. Habit's restaurant count increased 5% year-over-year as a result of new regulations in Habit's home market of California that have raised the cost to business, Habit's leadership team has been focused on protecting profitability to remain competitive. Those efforts led to a comprehensive store level labor optimization effort, which contributed to an impressive 520 basis point expansion of restaurant level margins from the first quarter despite a double-digit increase in restaurant level labor rates in California stores.\nSame-store sales growth remained suppressed, but we're encouraged by the improvement from first quarter trends despite a more challenged regional backdrop. Subsequent to quarter end, I was pleased to learn Habit's Double Charred Burger, reigned supreme in USA TODAY's 10 Best Readers' Choice Award for Best Quick Service Burger, landing the #1 spot and beating out all other QSR and better burger competitors.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, start with our people pillar. One of Yum!'s hallmarks is our people-first culture, which drives recruitment of amazing talent and also builds a deep bench of leaders within the organization. I'm excited about the great work going on at Pizza Hut from a talent perspective, where we recently welcomed [ Karl Laredo ] as the brand's U.S. President. Karl is a seasoned marketing leader with deep experience in delivering impressive results at some of the world's largest and best-known brands. We also welcomed former PepsiCo Executive, [ Calin Thornton ] as Global Chief Brand Officer, leading the Pizza Hut division's global brand strategy and marketing, including harnessing the power of engaging consumer connections across physical and digital touch points.\nIt is also rewarding to see leaders from Yum!'s deep bench of talent assume bigger roles. [ Melissa Freebay ] recently joined Pizza Hut U.S. as Chief Marketing Officer, after spending 27 years at Taco Bell in various finance, marketing, insights and brand strategy positions.\nIn addition to recruiting and promoting talent and professionals, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company in powerful forums such as KFC's annual global marketing planning meeting. KFC gathered marketing leaders, franchise partners and vendors from around the world to share best practices and consumer insights to keep our iconic brand R.E.D, discuss innovative strategies and sale of delicious products from various markets.\nMoving on to the planet pillar of our Good Growth strategy. We are making progress on our global goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 with a focus on renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and ongoing collaboration with our food suppliers. For example, KFC has reduced emissions by focusing on key areas such as cooking and holding systems, refrigeration and cooling and lighting while Pizza Hut and Taco Bell are collaborating with partners to reduce on-farm emission and encourage sustainable practices.\nIn terms of packaging, we are making progress against our global goals with many markets eliminating unnecessary plastic items like straws, cup lids, stirrers and cutlery. And finally, we're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve by continuing to unlock opportunities. As an example, in Thailand, KFC partnered with nonprofit and the Thai government to launch the country's first-ever flexible learning curriculum to help students who dropped out of school, gain critical job and entrepreneurial skills.\nTo wrap up before handing over to Chris, we are pleased our second quarter built to a 10% growth in core operating profit despite system sales pressures. While our teams work to prove system sales trends, we are confident the investments we are making in tandem to be more agile, resilient and stronger as part of the next phase in our technology journey will lead to a promising year in 2025. All these efforts underscore our commitment to be the franchisor of choice and deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology services to our partners.\nI'm excited about our plans to harness the power of AI, including the expansion of drive-through Voice AI technology with plans to roll this capability out to hundreds of Taco Bell U.S. stores by year-end in addition to testing with KFC in an international market. We are hard at work driving the next phase of our technology journey to unlock future growth by strengthening our business resilience and ensuring we deliver exceptional shareholder value in the years ahead.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers, our balance sheet and capital strategy and provide an update on our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nBeginning with our second quarter results. System sales grew 3%, driven by 5% unit growth. Consumer sentiment relating to the conflict in the Middle East continued to pressure system sales growth in the quarter. The recovery trajectory we observed in Q1 for the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia, flattened in Q2. And while hard to precisely quantify, we continue to observe conflict-related impacts in a broader set of markets. Despite these pressures, Yum! delivered an impressive 10% core operating profit growth reflecting the resilience of our scale, multi-brand business model, the increasing benefits of our digital and technology strategy and the expert management of the business by our leaders around the globe.\nA prime example of factors underpinning our resilience was profitability in our 488 company-owned Taco Bell stores in the U.S., our single largest estate of company-owned stores representing approximately half of our total global company-owned store revenue. Store level margins were 25.6% with mature stores achieving over 27%, reflecting the strength of the Taco Bell business model and its magic formula, which enables the brand to simultaneously deliver an outstanding consumer experience, tremendous consumer value and exceptional store-level margins for our franchisees and Yum! Importantly, Taco Bell operations leaders are taking advantage of the continued growth in digital sales mix which is now 35% to further digitally enable our operations in ways that not only improve consumer -- experiences, but also improve labor productivity.\nAnother contributor to profit growth was improved expense leverage. As we shared in January, we expected throughout the year to see the benefits of our ongoing resource optimization program, which strategically leverages our scale to free up general and administrative expense for reinvestment in future growth drivers such as AI, which will benefit both Yum! and our franchisees in addition to some beneficial onetime G&A expense overlaps. Second quarter ex-special G&A expense was $256 million, down [ 9% ] year-over-year. Reported G&A was $281 million, reflecting $25 million of special expense related to our resource optimization program. We expect to generate additional savings on an ex-special basis from the resource optimization program in the second half of the year.\nReported operating profit increased 6% as foreign currency translation continued to be a headwind with a $12 million negative impact in the quarter. Historically, given our global footprint, foreign currency translation has at times been a significant tailwind to our reported operating profit and at other times, a headwind. Since interest rates in the U.S. began to rise in Q1 2022, our current annual operating profit reflects a headwind of nearly $180 million in foreign currency, equivalent to roughly 1 year of operating profit growth under our long-term growth algorithm during that period.\nSecond quarter ex-special EPS was $1.35, reflecting a $0.20 negative impact from a higher year-over-year tax rate and lower year-over-year investment gains. Additionally, foreign currency translation unfavorably impacted Q2 EPS by $0.03.\nMoving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. Yum! opened 894 units, the second highest number of Q2 gross openings in Yum!'s history, leading to our unit count expanding 5% year-over-year, contributing 4 points to total system sales growth. In the quarter, we transferred certain rights related to the trademarks of the [ Gino's Pizza and Telepizza ] brands in Latin America to our local franchisee, enabling our teams in Latin America to focus exclusively on driving growth in the Pizza Hut brand. As a result, we removed 120 low volume and low royalty rate units associated with those brands from our store base in exchange for nominal compensation. Excluding the impact of this transfer, our unit growth was 6%. Our growth remains diversified across brands and countries with 195 brand country combinations contributing growth during the last 12 months.\nMoving to brand-specific development. In the KFC division, we opened 598 units across 57 countries. This brings our year-to-date gross openings in KFC to 1,107 units, a new all-time record for KFC for the first half of the year. China, India, Thailand and Japan led development. Over the last year, we've seen positive development trends in South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil. In the quarter, we closed on the transaction to purchase 216 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, one of our highest average annual unit volume markets. Our total equity estate at KFC is now 434 stores, the majority of which are located in the U.K. market.\nThe Pizza Hut division opened 236 units across 30 countries. Pizza Hut's year-over-year unit growth is trending higher from this time last year for several of our largest markets, including China and Japan, which is offsetting closures in the U.S. and the conflict-related slowing of development in Indonesia and Malaysia.\nAt Taco Bell, we opened 56 units this quarter, including 17 new units in our international markets across 10 countries. Our U.S. gross openings are running higher year-over-year for the first half, and we expect international store growth to pick up in the second half of the year. Excluding China, Taco Bell international unit count was up 7% year-over-year.\nMoving to our digital and technology initiatives. You will recall that on our last earnings call, David and I discussed our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company. The first phase of this journey is focused on acquiring, building and scaling a comprehensive suite of owned platforms that enable ownership of our data, control of the digital ecosystem, speed of innovation and cost advantages through scale leverage. Within this phase, we are accelerating deployment of our foundational platforms, such as the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform, Dragontail, Super App and our Global Data Hub. In the next phase, we are focused on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through AI and leveraging our extensive data assets.\nData is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities.\nLet me now discuss additional digital and technology accomplishments for Q2 across our easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights pillars. I will begin with our easy experience pillar, focused on providing frictionless experiences to our consumers. As you recall, last quarter, we discussed plans to expand drive-through Voice AI technology to more Taco Bell stores. I'm excited to announce that given our encouraging early results, the team has accelerated the rollout. And as of today, we now have this technology operational in over 100 Taco Bell stores. We plan to scale the technology to several hundred stores by year-end, while the pilot test is underway in KFC Australia. In our tests, we have witnessed consistent consumer experiences and higher team member productivity. This technology leverages digital menu boards, which will be a Taco Bell brand standard in 2025 and Yum!'s proprietary point-of-sale system, Poseidon.\nOn the e-commerce front, we have made significant progress in implementing the Yum! Commerce platform at Pizza Hut U.S. We are currently transitioning to this platform at Pizza Hut in the U.K., which will be the second international Pizza Hut market to operate on the Yum! Commerce platform to Pizza Hut Canada next in line.\nNext, I'll discuss our easy operations pillar, where we continue to deploy our world-class technology to provide our franchisees and team members with the capabilities to operate their stores more effectively and efficiently. We have fully deployed our Poseidon point-of-sale system within Taco Bell U.S. and are in the early stages of incorporating this system into the KFC U.S. estate. With respect to Dragontail, our AI-enabled restaurant management system, we plan to have the system rolled out to nearly the entire Pizza Hut U.S. system by year-end. As an example of Dragontail's impact, in the first 1,000 Pizza Hut U.S. stores to implement the technology, we have measured a 7% increase in overall consumer satisfaction due to hotter and fresher pizzas leading to improved consumer frequency. Finally, we are in the process of scaling -- our restaurant General Manager support app at Pizza Hut U.S., and we plan to achieve the 10,000 store milestone across KFC globally by year-end.\nLastly, I'll discuss our easy insights pillar. We deepened our AI pursuits this quarter, taking steps to unlock the benefits of our R.E.D 360 database and engage with an innovative start-up in the AI-driven personalization space to leverage our massive first-party data assets. This partnership covers the application and integration of a deep learning AI approach known as reinforcement learning, which we expect to be broadly and easily scalable across brands. This partnership will focus on our basic CRM channels and in the future, may extend to our other consumer sales and communications channels, for instance, paid media.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value and include investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $50 million in gross CapEx and $19 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. We have a strong balance sheet and no debt maturities until 2026.\nDuring the second quarter, we are pleased to have resumed share repurchases by buying back $50 million in our stock, which for context is the same value of shares repurchased during the entire year of 2023. Going forward, absent any attractive investment opportunities like our recent acquisition of KFC U.K. restaurants, we plan to continue to return excess cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases.\nFinally, I'll discuss our outlook on the balance of 2024. We remain on track to achieve 5% unit growth for the full year despite the extended impact of the Middle East conflict. On a global basis, our planned number of gross unit openings for the full year is expected to be similar to our number of gross openings in 2023. We should also note some certainty on the future path in the Middle East markets. For example, there are approximately 210 restaurants currently temporarily closed across the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. While there are plans in place to reopen some of those restaurants starting later this month and throughout the second half of the year, there is risk that some could close permanently pending the future trajectory of the conflict impact. These stores have not been producing royalties while temporarily closed, but our reported unit count would be negatively impacted if these stores were to permanently close.\nWith respect to company store profitability, we expect full year Taco Bell company-operated store margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nRegarding G&A. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex-special G&A expense to be lower on a year-over-year basis by a low single-digit percentage. As for sequencing, Q3 G&A will be higher year-over-year as we lap last year's recovery of cyber-related insurance proceeds and as we incur costs relating to our Global Leadership Summit. Finally, despite updating our balance of year sales outlook to reflect the continued softness we're seeing tied to the Middle East conflict, we remain confident that we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth on a full year basis excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nI'm very proud of the work our teams continue to do to position Yum! as a resilient growth business going forward and to further cement Yum! as the global franchisor of choice. We are making incredible strides toward our distinctive digital and technology ambitions, our 50% plus digital sales mix and our continued rollout of distinctive digital and AI technologies are testaments to that pursuit.\nIn markets around the world, we have the privilege of working with outstanding 3C that is capable, well-capitalized and committed franchisees who want to grow with our system and our iconic brands.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc. 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Nadia, and I'll be coordinating the call today. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now hand over to your host, Matt Morris, Head of Investor Relations to begin. Matt, please go ahead.\n\nMatt Morris\n\nCEO, Stewart Information Services Corp.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and the relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. On our last earnings call, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC franchise restaurants in U.K. and Ireland. The transaction closed on April 29. As a reminder, several of Yum! Brands business units report on a period calendar basis, including all U.S. and Canada brands, KFC U.K. and KFC Australia. For business units that report on a period basis, first quarter same-store sales growth excludes the benefit from the additional day of sales owing to Leap Day. When forecasting 2024, please keep in mind this year will include an extra week in the fourth quarter for those entities. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of the IR website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. We would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Our second quarter earnings will be released on August 6 with the conference call on the same day. Finally, please mark your calendars for an in-person Taco Bell Consumer Day on December 10 at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, California. Stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to report that Yum! grew core operating profit 6% this quarter despite a challenging operating environment, demonstrating the resilience of our business. As we communicated last earnings, 1Q should represent our most challenging sales quarter this year as we work through tough year ago laps returned to a more normal inflationary environment and navigated discrete consumer demand pressures. While the impacts from the Middle East conflict have been scattered and difficult to measure, we've begun to see improvement in the most impacted markets.\nTaco Bell U.S. outperformed the industry on same-store sales and delivered industry-leading margins, while 1Q unit openings at KFC International set us up for a strong unit growth story in 2024. We continue to make significant progress scaling our proprietary digital and AI-powered platforms and are excited by plans to accelerate deployment. Digital sales continued an upward trajectory approaching $8 billion and were up 11% year-over-year. Through continued kiosk deployment, greater adoption of click-and-collect and stable third-party aggregator sales, digital mix improved 5 points and, for the first time ever, represented over 50% of system sales in Q1. We now have $30 billion in annualized digital sales, which by itself would represent one of the largest restaurant companies in the world.\nOverall, despite a more challenged operating environment, we have reached impressive new milestones and remain on track to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm target of at least 8% core operating profit growth for the full year.\nNow I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and Good Growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our first quarter results, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development, Unmatched Operating Capabilities and balance sheet position.\nStarting with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our divisional operating profit. KFC grew system sales 4% this quarter, owing to an 8% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. The same-store sales pressure was partially attributable to impacts from the conflict in the Middle East, which have begun to ease, and we expect a 2-year trend for KFC International overall to accelerate in the same quarter. We saw strong top line growth in other parts of the world including Latin America, Africa and Greater Asia. System sales in Latin America grew 22% on the heels of a strong marketing calendar and continued success of the KFC original nugget. In Africa, system sales grew 11%, thanks to 5% same-store sales growth driven by product innovation and 6% net new unit growth. In Greater Asia where system sales grew 8%, we recently partnered with a new franchisee in Korea, who is driving transaction growth with a calendar focused on core, value and expanding consumer access, which resulted in a 26% growth in same-store sales. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were pressured from unfavorable weather events and chicken value promotions from QSR competitors.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit and 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit. System sales at Taco Bell U.S. grew 4%, led by 2% same-store sales growth and a strong outcome on top of last year's 9% same sales growth. Sales improved throughout the quarter after difficult weather events in January. Taco Bell focused on key levers within its magic formula to drive growth, including building brand buzz, providing value to our consumers and expanding into new category entry points. We know that when we execute on this magic formula, Taco Bell puts itself at the center of the cultural conversation.\nThere was no better example of this than the Live Mas live event Taco Bell held in Las Vegas to share its upcoming innovation calendar, an industry-first event. Of course, it was not surprising that Fast Company named Taco Bell the Most Innovative Company in Dining and #8 overall. Early in the quarter, the team launched a new cravings value menu and ended the quarter with a successful launch of the Chicken Cantina menu. The cravings value menu features industry-leading value with 10 items priced under dollars providing consumers with craveable everyday value offering. Nearly 1/3 of transactions contain an item off the cravings value menu and, when purchased, 80% have at least one other item added, translating to a nearly 10% check uplift compared to noncravings value menu.\nThe impressive performance of such product launches is compounded by Taco Bell's ability to deliver industry-leading margins on top of a great consumer experience. At Taco Bell International, system sales grew 6% this quarter. The team is focused on building brand category awareness globally. This included markets such as Canada and Latin America where the team elevated the core menu and launched the Chicken Cantina menu to expand their consumer base.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit. During the first quarter, system sales declined 4% with 5% unit growth and a 7% decline in same-store sales. The year-over-year growth rate in same-store sales was suppressed from difficult year ago lapse and the ongoing impact from the conflict in the Middle East. The team continued to focus on the individual meal occasion this quarter with the India market launching the Melts platform. At Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 6% as we lapped the launch of Melts and Big New Yorker Pizza. However, the 2-year trend was positive and improved from last quarter.\nLastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, for the first quarter, system sales declined 2% with 6% unit growth. Margin trends improved throughout the quarter with a combination of initiatives leading to a 60 basis point improvement in store level margins year-over-year.\nNow I'll turn to our Good Growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. Effective June 1, Alex Barsk will join KFC Global as the new Chief Financial Officer. Alex is joining from Pizza Hut, where she most recently served as global CFO. Alex joined Pizza Hut in 2015 and has held several leadership roles across strategy, finance, development and supply chain. Alex's transition is another great example of Yum! leveraging its talent across brands to help share unique learnings and experiences.\nTo round out our people pillar, I'd like to congratulate and thank Yum!'s Senior Vice President of Finance, Corporate Controller and my friend, Dave Russell, who recently celebrated his 25th anniversary at Yum! with today marking his [ 100th ] quarterly earnings announcement. Dave has been with the company since 1999, always serving as a trusted leader who brings his deep knowledge and analytical perspective to our finance and accounting function. Thank you, Dave, for your dedication to our growth over the last 25 years, and I look forward to your continued partnership in the future.\nBefore I hand it over to Chris, I would like to share a few thoughts on the future of our digital and technology strategy given we achieved an important milestone this quarter with more than half of our sales coming from digital. You'll recall that the first phase of our journey to become the leading global digital restaurant company began in earnest in 2019. That first phase focused on building or acquiring a comprehensive suite of owned platforms, spanning Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights and accelerating deployment of those platforms across our brands and markets. While we still have further to go in deploying these platforms, we have achieved critical mass in several areas.\nTaco Bell U.S., one of our twin growth engines, has achieved the most extensive deployment of key platforms, including the Poseidon POS system, the Yum! e-commerce platform and the [ AIM ] inventory management platform. Our other primary growth engine, KFC International, has been accelerating the rollout of those same platforms and is our leader in deploying in-store kiosk technology. Pizza Hut, of course, has been our leader in deploying Dragontail to thousands of restaurants around the globe. Behind the scenes, our global data hub houses data generated from these platforms.\nThe deployment of our capabilities in this first phase of our journey has driven the dramatic increase in our digital sales from approximately 20% in 2019 to over 50% now. The impact of this growth has been significant. To share just a couple of examples of impact, our consumers enjoy more convenient and frictionless experiences, leading to high frequency and check sizes. Our franchisees enjoy significant productivity benefits as their team members no longer spend time taking orders and payments for half of all transactions, leading to stronger unit economics. We believe we are still only scratching the surface of the full value creation potential of our capabilities.\nWhile the first phase of work in deploying our platforms will continue, given the critical mass we have achieved, we have initiated a second parallel phase in our technology journey. This second phase will focus on maximizing the value creation potential of our platforms through the acceleration of AI capabilities in combination with fully leveraging the immense data assets we now own. With our platform-driven approach, we can now more easily integrate AI capabilities across our digital ecosystem. We currently have more than 40 AI initiatives in progress across the company spanning marketing, operations, insights, engineering and our internal back-office functions.\nWhile many of these initiatives will remain confidential for now, one example that we have shared publicly is voice AI to enhance our consumer experience. We've been testing this capability at the drive-thru in 5 Taco Bell stores in California. We are expanding that test to 30 stores in Q2 based on positive consumer feedback. Another example is our piloting of AI-powered technology in our SuperApp restaurant general manager support tool, making it even easier and faster for managers to access critical operational information to make better decisions. Of course, our Dragontail platform was the first AI-enabled next-gen restaurant operational system to enhance the consumer and team member experience in a multichannel fulfillment environment.\nAs an example of how we are elevating the use of our data assets, in Q1, we launched the R.E.D. 360 U.S. Consumer Data Insights system. As of Q1, both Pizza Hut U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. have integrated into the system and KFC U.S. will integrate in the second quarter. This system allows us to leverage insights into consumer behavior across our brands in the U.S. After full deployment, R.E.D. 360 will be the first scaled cross-brand U.S. restaurant consumer data engine in the quick service industry and will pave the way for unique insights and personalization opportunities on digital and social channels.\nFor those who may have missed it, Joe Park, our Chief Digital and Technology Officer, was recently interviewed in The Wall Street Journal, bringing to life many of these plans as we become more focused on pursuing AI and data-driven innovation. As we do all of this, we are also continually innovating how our technology teams work internally to better leverage our scale so that we can continue to bend the curve on the net investment impact of these digital and technology initiatives.\nTo sum it up, we are excited about having ramped up this second phase in our journey and are doubling down and pursuing the ultimate goal of our digital and technology strategy, which is to better serve our franchisees, providing them with more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology while simultaneously delighting consumers and maximizing Yum! shareholders' returns. We will continue to provide updates on both phases of our journey on future calls, organized around our easy capability framework.\nIn closing, as I look back over the quarter, I'm proud of our teams and their ability to navigate any environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet any consumers' needs. Our resilient business model, coupled with our strategy to leverage our technology platforms on a global scale, gives me confidence we will continue to improve both franchisee and Yum! economics. Looking ahead, our initiatives to become an even more nimble and data-driven organization are underway, and I'm excited for the shareholder value we will create.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nStarting with our results. First quarter system sales grew by 2% driven by 6% unit growth. As we communicated on our last call, we expected the first quarter to be our most challenged from a same-store sales perspective due to prior year lapse, a return to a more normal inflationary environment and discrete consumer demand pressures, including markets impacted by the Middle East conflict. We believe the markets most impacted by the conflict collectively created a low single-digit headwind on Yum!'s overall Q1 same-store sales. Despite these challenges, I'm pleased to report Yum! delivered 6% core operating profit growth exceeding our internal plan and demonstrating the resilience of our profit model.\nFirst quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $265 million, down 4% year-over-year, a continuation of the G&A momentum we had in the fourth quarter. Reported G&A was $286 million and includes $21 million in special expense related to ongoing resource optimization, which we expect to generate additional savings in the second half. Reported operating profit included a 2-point impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation. First quarter ex special EPS was $1.15, which includes negative after-tax impacts of $0.08 from investment losses and $0.03 from foreign currency translation.\nAs a reminder, we shared on our last call the intent to purchase 218 KFC U.K. and Ireland stores. We're excited to report we officially closed this acquisition at the end of April. These stores have average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins. We expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchisees.\nNow let me share greater detail on our first quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened over 800 units in the first quarter. We reached the incredible milestone of opening KFC's 30,000th restaurant globally. As the #1 brand on Entrepreneur Magazine's Top Global Franchise rankings, KFC continues to demonstrate strong desirability among global franchisees with a new store opening every 3 hours. We continue to see an incremental store opportunity of 50,000 KFCs over the long term. Across the global system, the outlook for development in 2024 is strong. We expect to continue to open units in a broad range of markets, which last year included over 100 markets, and to cross the 60,000 unit milestone. Further solidifying Yum!'s position as the world's leading multi-brand restaurant franchisor.\nThere are several reasons we remain confident in these trends. First, we entered 2024 with broad-based development momentum. In Q1, we grew units across 81 brand-country combinations. Second, we have large, committed franchisees who have entered into more unit development commitments for 2024 than in each of the prior 2 years. Approximately 80% of 2024 exceeded new builds for KFC outside of China are part of development commitments. Third, the development white space remains massive. We have just 6% of the global QSR market. China is a prolific developer and serves only 1/3 of the China population. In India, which is the fastest-growing global economy, KFC and Pizza Hut have been the fastest and third fastest-growing QSR chains, respectively, since 2019.\nFinally, our brands unit economics remain attractive across key markets where scale and first-mover advantages put our franchisees in a position of strength. Scale leads to unique advantages including access to alternative financing solutions, dedicated development teams and in-depth market knowledge. Scale also offers operating advantages. For instance, our largest partner, Yum China, has AI-enabled digital tools to allow its restaurant general managers to oversee multiple restaurants, creating unmatched savings that can be passed to consumers.\nThe Serrano Group based in Latin America and Ramcar based in the Philippines run their own poultry processing facilities in addition to distribution capabilities, giving them cost and reliability advantages. At a brand level, KFC has food innovation kitchens in Canada, the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean, United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia, South Africa, India and Singapore. Perhaps underappreciated, our global innovation capabilities are real sources of differentiation.\nMoving now to the digital and technology front. Recall that our vision is to empower our franchisees with leading-edge technology solutions with advantaged economics. As David put it, we want to deliver more, better, faster, cheaper and safer technology to our franchise partners. We are advantaged by owning important foundational platforms such as our Poseidon POS system, Yum! e-commerce, Dragontail, SuperApp and our global data hub, and the impact of these platforms will grow exponentially as we deploy more of them to more stores. Data is becoming a crucial differentiator, enabling us and our franchisees to generate better insights and make better decisions.\nOn this front, quick service restaurants will benefit disproportionately because of the high frequency nature of our consumer visits, which results in more data. Within quick service, a few characteristics will separate us from our competitors, including our multi-brand portfolio, our scale and global footprint, our ownership of key platforms and the increasing integration between our platforms. We will leverage our data for insights and to drive more effective marketing and loyalty engagement, and we will deploy advanced AI tools to all aspects of our business. As we leverage our scale more and more in these areas, we can be faster, cheaper and safer through consistency and standardization across our environment.\nLet me now discuss the digital and technology accomplishments for Q1 across our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. Beginning with our Easy Experiences pillar. We continued to onboard Pizza Hut U.S. to the Yum! e-commerce platform with a full cutover planned by Q3, followed by 3 Pizza Hut international markets by year-end. For Taco Bell U.S., where the Yum! Commerce platform is fully operational, we have accelerated viral promotions and have seen Taco Bell's digital ordering capacity increase tenfold relative to the legacy system.\nWithin Easy Operations, the expansion of our world-class technology products and platforms continued. We expanded Poseidon to 1,800 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, bringing our total to over 7,000 restaurants. We onboarded over 500 Pizza Hut restaurants onto the Dragontail AI platform, bringing our system total to over 7,000 restaurants. In the near future, we plan to nationally roll out Dragontail's kitchen display system and Poseidon to our KFC U.S. restaurants. Finally, our custom-built SuperApp, which provides smart, automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in nearly 9,500 Pizza Hut and KFC restaurants with significant expansion plans underway for KFC.\nFor the third pillar of our Easy strategy, Easy Insights, KFC and Pizza Hut have continued to scale a new experienced management program allowing the brands to draw insights from an expanded source of consumer reviews across digital channels, including third-party aggregators and social media in addition to guest survey responses. KFC is now live in 10,000 restaurants and has seen a fivefold increase in per-store data point. Pizza Hut expanded this service to 7,000 restaurants across more than 50 countries.\nTalking about all of the tremendous advancements underway excites me about the future. This work will be vital as we embark on further innovation behind voice AI, restaurant automation and better leveraging our loyalty programs.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Net capital expenditures for the quarter were $38 million, reflecting $49 million in gross CapEx and $11 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.1x. In the quarter, we sold our minority investment in Devyani for $104 million, representing a $73 million increase in value since acquisition. Our cash balance ended at $652 million, reflecting proceeds from the Devyani investment sale and modest accumulation in cash to finance the KFC U.K. acquisition.\nWith the KFC U.K. deal behind us, our cash balance will return to a normalized rate of around $400 million, excluding the unrepatriated Devyani proceeds. Thereafter, with no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we plan to use our excess free cash flow primarily to fund share repurchases, absent accretive investments we choose to make. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and returning excess cash to our shareholders.\nSubsequent to the quarter end, we renewed our pro rata credit facility, including our revolving credit facility and Term Loan A. We were pleased to renew the $2 billion facility with the same pricing and terms that we achieved in 2021 while also increasing the revolver from $1.25 billion to $1.5 billion.\nNow let me discuss our latest outlook on full year 2024. We are confident that 2024 will showcase a strong unit development story at or above 5% unit growth, led by KFC International as franchisees capitalize on our brand's attractive paybacks. In the U.S., Taco Bell continues to balance core everyday value to cater to a more discerning consumer across income groups with premium innovation to attract new consumers. We expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Excluding the 53rd week, we now expect ex special G&A to be flat to down slightly for the year, including incremental G&A associated with the KFC U.K. acquisition. Finally, we are confident we will deliver at least 8% core operating profit growth excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nTo close, I am incredibly proud of the progress we have made over the last few years in the areas to which we dedicated our focus and internal resources. Our team continues to manage through industry challenges to position us for a strong year and deliver our long-term operating profit plan, reinforcing the [ brilliance ] of our business, strength of our talent and commitment to our shareholders. Going forward, we are moving to solidify ourselves as the multi-brand franchisor of choice through a more efficient adaptable, data-driven organization. We are only in the early innings of unlocking the value of our unmatched data, which will help power our aspirations and deliver sustained above-market shareholder returns.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Finally, please mark your calendars for an in-person Taco Bell Consumer Day in December at Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, California. Stay tuned for more details and invitations to follow.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I discuss our results, I want to express our continued concern for those impacted by the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. We continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our franchisees and employees in the region.\nTurning to 2023. It was a remarkable year for Yum! Brands as we cross the $60 billion system sales threshold and exceeded all [indiscernible] of our long-term growth algorithm. Despite facing numerous challenges around the world, our incredible teams delivered another exceptional year of growth across our business.\nWe set an industry development record for the third straight year. We made massive strides in scaling our proprietary digital and AI-driven ecosystem, and we continue to build a talent base that I believe is the best in the industry.\nWe delivered 6% unit growth, 10% system sales growth and 12% core operating profit growth. We enter 2024 having opened just shy of 10,000 net new restaurants over the past 3 years and are well on our way to reaching 60,000 restaurants this year. This growth would not be possible were not for our world-class franchise partners, who continue to deploy their own capital based on their confidence to invest behind the long-term potential of our brand.\nAlong with the record-breaking success we've had on development, our digital strategy has helped propel top line results and improve bottom line profits. Digital sales approached $30 billion in 2023, up 22% year-over-year with mix now exceeding 45%.\nAt the same time, we have accelerated the deployment of our proprietary technologies to optimize back-of-house operations and make it easier to run our restaurants. In doing so, we are equipping our franchise partners with distinctive capabilities that differentiate them from the competition, especially in emerging markets.\nI'll now share some more details on the fourth quarter specifically. During the quarter, top line sales were impacted by the conflict in the Middle East region, with varying degrees of impact across markets in the Middle East, Malaysia and Indonesia. This represented a low single-digit headwind to Yum!'s overall fourth quarter same-store sales growth. This trend has continued into the first quarter, and we expect the sales impact to decrease over the course of 2024.\nKey to our growth is the performance of our twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which account for approximately 70% of Yum! system sales and roughly 80% of Yum!'s division operating profit. In 2023, KFC International opened nearly 2,700 new restaurants, reaching 10% growth with restaurants opened across 96 countries. More than 80% of unit growth came from our 15 publicly traded franchisees. Entering 2024, I have strong confidence in the durability of KFC's global expansion for which we continue to see an incremental 50,000 restaurant opportunity over the long term.\nOn a global basis, Taco Bell crossed the $15 billion system sales milestone this year, reflecting the growing scale of this powerhouse brand. Turning to Taco Bell U.S., which contributes more than 75% of our U.S. divisional operating profit, the brand maintained its 2-year same-store sales trend in the fourth quarter, outperforming the QSR industry. Taco Bell continued to deliver industry-leading margins at 24% this year while at the same time, leading the QSR industry in several key value perception indicators.\nNow I'll discuss our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands or R.E.D. for short, followed by our Unrivaled Culture and Talent and good growth strategy. Chris will then provide an update on our fourth quarter results and balance sheet position, followed by our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability.\nStarting with the KFC division, which accounts for 50% of our divisional operating profit and will soon cross the incredible milestone of 30,000 units. For the year, system sales grew 12% with 8% unit growth and 7% same-store sales growth.\nFor the quarter, KFC achieved 7% system sales growth [indiscernible] to 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East.\nKFC China grew system sales by an impressive 20% during the quarter. We had several other standout markets this quarter, including 16% system sales growth in Latin America and 13% system sales growth in both Africa and Thailand.\nIn Latin America, we targeted new consumers and dayparts using compelling value offers, and we expanded our KFC original nugget. In Africa, the team boosted its breakfast daypart with new beverages, including signature coffees at a great price.\nThe Thailand market saw strong transaction growth driven by smart value offering across all dayparts. At KFC U.S., same-store sales were flat this quarter with trends on a 2-year basis remaining consistent from the prior quarter.\nIn Q1, the team has planned a range of exciting initiatives, including the smash potato bowl, the first bowl innovation since 2019, and the rollout of KFC's first loyalty rewards program.\nMoving on to Taco Bell division, which represents 36% of our divisional operating profit. At Taco Bell U.S., fourth quarter same-store sales grew 3% and 15% on a 2-year basis, outperforming the QSR industry by 3 points.\nTaco Bell U.S. faced tough laps early in the quarter but finished the year strong with comps up over 5% in the final period. The quarter included a record digital sales mix, which reached 31%, up 7 points year-over-year.\nGrowth in kiosk sales was a large driver with in-store kiosk sales mix increasing 15 points from Q4 last year. Optimizing our digital channels is also contributing to growth in Taco Bell's loyalty program with active loyalty users growing 17% in 2023.\nThe team plans to bring exciting enhancements to the loyalty program in the second half of 2024 to capitalize on digital engagement and provide an easier experience for customers to earn and redeem points. While not surprising, I'm always proud to see our incredible Taco Bell team's efforts being recognized with Entrepreneur Magazine naming the brand the #1 franchisor for the fourth year running and with Nation Restaurant News crowning Taco Bell the 2023 brand icon.\nWith an unprecedented range of exciting innovations launching this year, including at least one new product every 5 weeks, twice the rate of 2023, I'm confident Taco Bell will remain a brand icon for years to come.\nAt Taco Bell International, we delivered 14% unit growth this year. The majority of this growth was contributed by our big 4 scaled markets, including Spain, which opened 19 new units this year and is on track to reach 150 units in Q1.\nAs we enter 2024, we will work with our franchise partners in these markets to build brand and category awareness with Mexican food, particularly in Europe and Asia, leading into fan favorites and expanding offerings. Additionally, we are working on scaling and entering new markets that will enable a broader base from which to grow.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which comprises 15% of our divisional operating profit and will soon eclipse 20,000 units. In Q4, system sales grew 1% with 4% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales. Sales trends decelerated during the quarter in several markets as a result of the conflict in the Middle East. For the full year, system sales grew 5%, including 4% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth.\nAt Pizza Hut International, same-store sales were flat for the quarter. The team continues to roll out Melts across the globe to build the individual eater occasion. Strength in the aggregator channel continues to be a bright spot across several markets, including Canada and Latin America.\nBuy One, Get One deals coupled with aggregator promotions drove transaction growth in Canada during the quarter. In Latin America, the promotion of our own digital channels in Brazil combined with the New York-style pizza helped boost sales for that market.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., same-store sales declined 4% for the quarter while growing 1% for the full year. The Melts launch and the promotion of the Detroit-style pizza in the prior year contributed to a difficult lap this quarter.\nPizza Hut U.S. will face another challenging lap in Q1 as same-store sales increased 8% last year, reflecting full quarter of sales from the Melts platform and the Big New Yorker. However, we expect performance trends on a 2-year basis to improve in the first quarter.\nIn Q1, the team will launch 2 limited-time offers, including hot honey pizza and wings, a perfect pairing for fans to enjoy in the run-up to the Super Bowl. In the months ahead, the team will be announcing some exciting innovations to the Melts platform.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill for the full year, system sales grew 6% led by 8% unit growth. Reflecting on 2023, Habit's new leadership team focused on improving all elements of Habit's operations, including expediting a robust kiosk rollout, implementing a sales-driven labor optimization model and harnessing Yum!'s co-op purchasing group to lower procurement costs and rationalize SKUs. As a result of these efforts, the team achieved a 380 basis point increase in full year store level margins despite softness in sales.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We take great pride in developing our talent and ensuring we have a strong bench to drive performance. And we were thrilled to be recognized in Time Magazine's inaugural list of the Best Companies for Future Leaders with Yum! ranking an impressive 32nd among U.S. companies.\nThe strength of our talent is evident through Sean Tresvant's official transition to Taco Bell division CEO on January 1. Sean joined Yum! in 2022 and is a visionary business leader with a proven track record of driving transformative brand building through his previous role as the Taco Bell Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. I'd like to again congratulate Sean as he takes the helm at Taco Bell. And I'm confident he and the rest of the team will continue to successfully deliver the brand's long-term global growth strategy.\nI'd also be remiss if we didn't take another opportunity to recognize Mark King for everything he did as Taco Bell division CEO to set the brand up for future success, including handpicking Sean as his successor and ensuring that Taco Bell would be in more than capable hand. On behalf of the entire Yum! system, I want to thank Mark for his people-first leadership that drove strong results, inspired restless creativity and solidified Taco Bell's unique brand identity that makes it an undisputed global icon.\nAdditionally, Pizza Hut Global Chief Technology Officer, Joe Park, will be moving into the Yum! Chief Digital and Technology Officer role currently held by Clay Johnson, who will continue as a senior adviser. I want to thank Clay for his incredible leadership joining Yum! in 2019, including developing our digital and technology capabilities from the ground up and establishing Yum! as a clear leader in technology in global QSR.\nSince joining Yum!, Joe formed our first-ever long-range innovation team before moving on to Pizza Hut, our most digital brand, where he partnered with our global operations and technology leaders to deliver new levels of ease to our customers and improved unit economics for our franchisees. I'm confident he is the perfect person to lead us into the next chapter on our digital and technology journey.\nMoving on to the planet pillar of our good growth strategy. In 2023, we remain focused on efforts under our priority areas of greenhouse gas reduction and sustainable packaging. We've made progress on our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 through investments in renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our restaurants and through ongoing commitments with our food suppliers.\nIn terms of packaging, we are increasing our global use of more widely recyclable plastics in our consumer packaging. And we continue to remove plastic packaging in the form of bags and cutlery in addition to eliminating styrofoam.\nOur continued progress in sustainability has been underscored by several recent recognition, including being named to the 2024 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the eighth consecutive year and being listed by Newsweek as one of America's Most Responsible Companies for 2024.\nBefore I wrap, I want to pay tribute to our incredible partners, Yum China. In December, my team and I traveled to Shanghai to meet with CEO, Joey Wat, and her executive team. That trip reinforced our view that Yum China is without question the world's most capable restaurant operator. They enable rapid growth and structural cost efficiencies through their dynamic development capabilities and their robust in-house supply chain.\nOur team sampled amazing new menu items in their innovation kitchen. We saw firsthand the digital capabilities that enable Yum China to engage with an astounding 470 million members in its loyalty program. These advantages enable consistent paybacks of 2 to 3 years in KFC and Pizza Hut despite evolving market conditions, further testament to their clear competitive advantages in the market.\nAs I look back over the last year, the unique advantages of our diversified system shone through. While the business takes persistent inflation across the globe and navigated shifts in consumer sentiment coming from regional conflicts, we responded with a focused determination to execute our growth plan, including growing units in 110 countries, meaningfully scaling our technology systems, deepening collaboration across our brands and delivering both sales and profits well above our long-term growth algorithm.\nWe're confident 2024 will be another banner year with a number of exciting sales-driving opportunities such as enhancing the range of protein offerings at Taco Bell, expanding new category entry points and significantly boosting the impact of our loyalty program. With a world-class team, globally iconic brands, industry-leading franchisees and a relentless appetite for growth, the future is brighter than ever. And I am confident that we will continue to maximize value for our shareholders.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nAs David mentioned, 2023 was an exceptional year with Yum! exceeding all components of our long-term growth algorithm. Full year same-store sales grew a very robust 6%. We opened 4,754 gross new units, equivalent of 13 restaurants a day or one restaurant roughly every 2 hours. KFC set a brand development record opening over 2,700 new units, 97 different countries.\nI also want to extend congratulations to the Yum China team, who crossed 10,000 KFC restaurants this quarter with nearly 40% of those restaurants built in the last 3 years.\nTurning to our results. Full year system sales grew 10% with fourth quarter system sales up 5%, led by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Yum!'s twin growth engines, KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., grew system sales 12% this year.\nFourth quarter ex special general and administrative expenses were $344 million, down 4% year-over-year due to strict cost control. Reported G&A was $353 million for the quarter, including $9 million in special expense related to an ongoing resource optimization project. For the full year, ex special general and administrative expenses were $1.17 billion.\nCore operating profit grew 8% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. Reported operating profit includes a negligible impact in the quarter from foreign currency translation and a $49 million headwind for the full year. Our ex special tax rate was 26% in the quarter and slightly under 21% for the full year.\nFourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.26, a decline year-over-year, stemming from a $0.23 headwind from [indiscernible] in our quarterly tax rate that drove our effective tax rate above our guided range in 2023 and below our guided range in 2022. Full year ex special EPS was $5.17, a 14% increase year-over-year.\nNow let me share some greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. Yum! opened just shy of 1,900 units in the fourth quarter with approximately 87% of that growth coming from our international markets. The KFC division was the largest driver, finishing the year with units up 8%. China, India, Thailand, South Africa and Spain drove KFC's development this year and were part of a group of 15 countries that grew unit count by more than 25 restaurants.\nIn December, we were pleased to announce that we signed an agreement to acquire 218 KFC restaurants from our largest franchisee in the U.K. This is an exciting opportunity for us to purchase restaurants with average unit volumes above $2 million and healthy store level cash margins in a market where we have an exceptional local management team who run our existing KFC U.K. equity store base.\nWe expect the addition of these units to provide approximately $40 million of incremental EBITDA in the 12 months after acquisition, while the benefit to our operating profit will be largely offset over the next several years due to depreciation and amortization, including amortization of reacquired franchise rights, which will be reflected in store level margins post acquisition. We anticipate this transaction to close during the second quarter.\nAt Pizza Hut, the division opened 575 units for the quarter and nearly 1,600 units for the year, a record for the brand. There were 73 markets that contributed to the brand's development. China, India, Turkey, Japan and Canada led Pizza Hut's growth internationally with more than 900 units opened across those countries.\nThe Taco Bell division opened 201 units in Q4 and 417 units for the full year. In the U.S., unit development was also on fire with 244 gross new units.\nOur longer-term growth engines that include Habit and Taco Bell International opened 208 units on a combined basis and grew unit count by 12%. We finished 2023 with unit growth occurring in 110 countries. We now have units in 293 brand country combinations, providing an unmatched level of diversity geographically as well as in consumer preference with lean brands in the chicken, pizza and Mexican categories. Looking ahead, we expect development in 2024 to continue at a robust pace.\nIn the first half, KFC will reach an incredible 30,000 units, and Pizza Hut will top 20,000 units. At KFC, we entered 2024 with more development commitments than last year. We recently returned from an inspiring visit to China in December, and we're reminded of the incredible runway for KFC's growth in the market, where Yum China has over 10,000 KFC restaurants yet served only 1/3 of the population.\nTaco Bell International will continue to expand their footprint, though the growth rate will temporarily slow as the brand looks to stabilize same-store sales performance in emerging markets and partner with franchisees to optimize site selection, leveraging KFC and Pizza Hut market-mapping data.\nMoving on to our Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth driver, which I'll speak to through the lens of our digital strategy, involving our Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights pillars. 2023 was a landmark year for successfully scaling our suite of proprietary technologies across our global restaurant base.\nBeginning with our Easy Experiences pillar, we have successfully deployed our Yum! Commerce Platform to KFC U.S. and Taco Bell U.S. and are continuing to onboard the Pizza Hut U.S. system. Looking ahead, we will start to deploy this platform to 2 Pizza Hut International markets in the first half of 2024.\nKiosks remain an important priority in delivering a consistent customer experience, driving ticket uplift and streamlining our restaurant operations. Globally, we've increased our kiosk penetration in KFC restaurants by 70% over the past year outside of China. We ended the year with kiosks in approximately 500 KFC U.S. restaurants, a huge step-up from nearly 0 only 2 quarters before. Our KFC Latin America markets also began the rollout of kiosks using our proprietary TikTok platform this year and plan to triple the restaurant count in 2024.\nWithin Easy Operations, this quarter, we continued to fire on all cylinders, significantly expanding the rollout of our world-class technology products and platforms. Poseidon, our proprietary point-of-sale system, which was expanded to an additional 1,700 Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, resulting in 5,000 restaurants having been onboarded this year.\nWe also ramped up the deployment of our Dragontail AI platform with an additional 1,000 locations onboarded this quarter and over 4,000 new restaurants added for the full year. We now have Dragontail in place in nearly 7,000 restaurants across Pizza Hut and KFC.\nOur 2024 rollout will include launching Dragontail in nearly 6,000 more restaurants, further evidence of our ability to scale software globally at a rapid pace. Our AI-driven automated inventory management system is now being used in 90% of our KFC U.S. locations and roughly half of our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants, driving more seamless and more accurate inventory ordering processes for our restaurant managers. More than 3,000 additional restaurants across KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut will be onboarded to the automated inventory management system in 2024.\nFinally, our custom-built super app, which provides smart automated routine management tools for our restaurant managers, is now used in over 8,500 Pizza Hut restaurants globally. And KFC has plans to roll this out to approximately 6,000 restaurants in 2024.\nFor the third pillar of our easy strategy, Easy Insights, we are fully leveraging our unique global scale to bring new insights and enable even smarter and quicker decision-making. This year, we expanded the reach of our Yum! Global Data Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics.\nIn 2024, our Easy Insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms, including personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations and dynamic restaurant routines for general managers.\nStepping back, it's incredibly encouraging to see this digital ecosystem come to life in our restaurants. By the end of 2024, we are likely to have our Taco Bell U.S. restaurants operating substantially all of these key technologies through the Yum! ecosystem. From the Poseidon point-of-sale system to the Yum! Commerce Platform, our automated inventory management software, and the tracks restaurant management application, truly a power brand powered by world-class technology.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 4.2x, down from 5x last year. As we had previously shared, we had planned for our net leverage ratio to drift lower during 2023 based on pausing new debt financing, paying our $279 million revolver balance in Q1 and retiring a $325 million bond maturity in Q4.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $103 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $225 million, reflecting $60 million in refranchising proceeds and $285 million in gross CapEx.\nFor the full year, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares totaling $50 million. With the November bond maturity behind us and no significant debt maturities in 2024 or 2025, we will return to using our excess free cash flow to fund the share repurchases and any accretive investments we choose to make, for example, the U.K. KFC acquisition.\nIn addition, we were pleased to recently announce an 11% increase to the dividend. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash.\nFinally, let me shed some light on how 2024 is shaping up. Despite a more challenging operating environment, including the impact of the conflict in the Middle East, we expect to deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. This includes core operating profit growth to be at least 8%, excluding the benefit of the 53rd week.\nWe have a strong unit development pipeline, thanks to attractive and reliable paybacks and growth-minded franchisees, which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver strong system sales growth. For the shape of the year, we expect top line trends in Q1 to be the most challenged with same-store sales trends improving sequentially as [indiscernible] and a range of sales-driving initiatives take hold.\nWe expect full year Taco Bell company operated margins to be in the range of 23% to 24%. We anticipate flat ex special G&A growth as we manage spend across the organization. Remember that G&A can vary due to the nature of our performance-based compensation plan. Lastly, we expect our full year tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%.\nTo close, I am incredibly proud of our performance this year. Sales trends became a little more challenging in the second half and yet we delivered profit growth above our algorithm as our teams quickly adjusted marketing calendars to meet demand and kept a strict focus on managing costs.\nIt is our team's relentless focus to stay vigilant on all areas of the business that gives me confidence we will deliver our long-term growth algorithm in 2024. The unbeatable combination of our iconic brands, best-in-class franchisees and resilient business model will enable us to deliver growth and shareholder value creation for years to come.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our third quarter results, I'd like to express our deep concern for those affected by the ongoing violence in Israel and Gaza. The safety of our people in the region is our utmost priority. And in addition to staying in close contact with our local team members and franchisees, our franchise restaurants in the region are only open when it is safe for staff and customers. Yum! is supporting affected employees and contributing to humanitarian organizations that are providing critical aid. Our heartfelt wish is for the safety and well-being of innocent civilians and families in the region impacted by this conflict.\nTurning to our third quarter results, which once again reflect our ability to grow our iconic brands globally through our Recipe for Good growth. I'm proud to share that we delivered 10% system sales growth, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. We set a Q3 record on unit development, opening an incredible 1,130 gross new units in the quarter. Our digital sales growth remains on fire with sales up more than 20% year-over-year and digital sales setting a record by exceeding $7 billion.\nOur third quarter core operating profit grew an impressive 16%. KFC International and Taco Bell U.S., which collectively contribute approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit, fueled this quarter's growth. Together, these twin growth engines delivered a remarkable 13% system sales growth in the quarter.\nKFC International has the most units among quick-service restaurants in 60 countries and has been adding more absolute units than any other retail brand in the world since 2021. Of course, Taco Bell U.S. is in a class of its own in the domestic QSR category as a culturally iconic brand and clear leader in value perception with the most crave-worthy food in the industry. Taco Bell has unmatched menu flexibility, exceptional pricing power, industry-leading unit economics and world-class franchise partners. Both businesses are performing at extremely high levels and have ambitious plans to accelerate their growth to even greater heights.\nNow let me discuss the quarter's results in greater detail through the lens of two of our growth drivers: Relevant, easy and distinctive or R.E.D brands, and unrivaled culture and talent. R.E.D brands are the cornerstone of our strategy and the way we bring this to life continues to evolve as consumers' behaviors shift and new trends are established. Over the past quarter, we have made significant progress in three specific initiatives: Building sales layers through new category entry points, leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal. Our brand teams are galvanized around these three focus areas, and we are highly encouraged by the results these areas are driving in our divisions which I will now highlight.\nStarting with the KFC division, which grew system sales 12% this quarter, driven by 8% unit growth and 6% same-store sales growth. While much of KFC's recent momentum has been led by emerging markets, this quarter, we saw a broad-based strength across a more diverse group of geographies, further proof of our ability to win in any macro environment. A few markets with standout same-store sales growth performance include Africa at 9% growth, Australia with 9% growth and Latin America and Caribbean at 8%.\nKFC hand-breaded original recipe nuggets are a global innovation platform and represent a new category entry point to attract individuals and families. After a successful launch in the U.S., we expanded nuggets to our Latin America and Caribbean market this quarter and saw incredible consumer reception that helped drive significant sales. The team plans to expand the offering to several more places around the world.\nKFC Africa delivered their 11th consecutive quarter of same-store sales growth with a combination of abundant value offers, strong e-commerce sales and the relaunch of their breakfast campaign driving this quarter's performance.\nFinally, I want to highlight our KFC Australia business as they continue to deliver fantastic performance with kiosk sales growing more than 90% compared to last year and the advent of a highly personalized value campaign that drove significant owned channel sales.\nThe KFC global team is -- great progress in expanding its loyalty program around the world, including in the U.S. where we soon expect to launch KFC Rewards.\nNext, I'll discuss our Taco Bell division, which delivered 11% system sales growth in Q3, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. At Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 11% with an impressive 8% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. The Taco Bell team leveraged its magic formula that encompasses a balanced set of commercial strategies, including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, [ mock ] occasions and digital initiatives to grow transactions during the quarter. They delivered unparalleled value with the return of fan favorites like the $5 box, an amazing platform at a compelling price point.\nThough Taco Bell featured a great value promotion in the quarter, value purchases remained within range of the brand's intended 10% mix target. This, combined with exciting innovation and brand buzz, helped the brand maintain its industry-leading margins of 24%.\nA key component of the magic formula is [ mass ] occasions, the brand's personal expression of building new category entry points. One such example is the growth in chicken offerings, which the team plans to further expand with the launch of its Cantina menu. We're excited about the impact these new menu items will have -- roll out these offerings in 2024.\nAnother component of this brand's success is digital, which includes loyalty. While a Taco Bell loyalty customer already spends 40% more per year than a traditional customer, the consumer feedback we've received indicates that we can do an even better job at creating more obvious and exciting ways to both earn and redeem rewards.\nStarting next year, Taco Bell will enhance its loyalty program and provide easier access across channels to earn and redeem points. Additionally, members will enjoy more exclusive experiences, including more digital innovation, early access to new products and loyalty enabled and experiences. Eventually, the team will integrate its loyalty program with digital menu boards to create an even more personalized experience.\nTaco Bell International delivered 16% system sales growth driven by 23% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. A key contributor to Taco Bell's international business has been robust digital sales, which increased nearly 45% year-over-year this quarter.\nThe global Taco Tuesday campaign that launched in June continued to drive customer engagement around the globe, bringing greater brand awareness and equity with consumers. The international markets are focused on amplifying National Taco Day and providing consumers with both craveable food and -- value.\nTurning to the Pizza Hut division, which grew system sales 4% driven by 4% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. International same-store sales grew 2%, driven by transaction growth in China, continued momentum in Melts and more strategically activating aggregator partnerships in international markets. Same-store sales results in the U.S. were flat as Pizza Hut leaned into its long-term strategy to build new category entry points through individual meal occasions with products like Melts and wings.\nThis quarter, Pizza Hut U.S. teamed up with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to relaunch our big New Yorker pizza and deliver pizzas into the New York subway stations, leading to over 1 billion media impressions. As we head into the fourth quarter, the Pizza Hut U.S. team launched a late night initiative, strategically expanding operating hours in more than 1,000 restaurants to give consumers even more ways to access the brand.\nTo wrap up with the Habit Burger Grill, system sales grew 4%, driven by 8% unit growth. The new Habit leadership team is settling in well and has placed a distinct focus on building strong unit level economics to set the brand up for long-term success. Of note, the team is developing a new cost-effective packaging range designed for off-premise occasions, along with a new prototype store to optimize CapEx and preopening costs.\nThe Habit is set to launch its first everyday value platform in November called Simple Craft after a successful test this quarter. We have tremendous confidence in the long-term prospects of this brand and are encouraged by the improvements that the team is making to deliver success in the future.\nNow I'll turn to our good growth strategy, starting with our people pillar. We've held powerful forms this quarter, supporting our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver including a leadership development conference for underrepresented talent and a new program aimed at preparing high potential female talent to be part of the next generation of senior leadership.\nIn addition, we're furthering our culture of collaboration and building capability across our company. Recently, a cross-brand group of leaders gathered for the first R.E.D innovation experience in our innovation lab, where they learned design thinking and real-time problem-solving through new age innovation techniques.\nWe're also making a meaningful impact in the communities we serve through our global unlocking opportunity initiative to create more equality. For example, in the U.K., KFC partnered with a nonprofit with the goal of having 1/3 of its new hires be at risk youth. In Sri Lanka, Pizza Hut is investing in the development of 30 vocational and technical training facilities to prepare youth for careers in the QSR industry.\nIn terms of our planet pillar and our focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we're educating suppliers through the supplier leadership and climate transition, a consortium of multinational companies created to accelerate climate action in the supply chain. Many of Yum!'s poultry, beef and dairy suppliers in key markets have joined this program or already have emissions reduction goals. These are just a few of the examples of the great work of our teams, earning us recognition like Newsweek's 2023 America's Greenest companies.\nOverall, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter and year-to-date. Our strategy is clear and the emphasis we are placing on building sales layers through new category entry points, leveraging technology to drive brand loyalty and delivering exciting value offers to broaden appeal is going to drive our business forward even faster.\nAs we conclude our internal annual operating plan views and look forward to 2024, it's clear we have the very best teams in place and are perfectly set up to capture an even greater share of a growing global QSR market and deliver compelling shareholder value going forward.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers followed by an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy.\nI'll begin by discussing our strong results for Q3. We achieved 10% system sales growth driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Our digital sales channels continue to grow with digital sales setting another record this quarter, exceeding $7 billion, an increase of more than 20% year-over-year. Core operating profit grew an impressive 16%.\nTaco Bell delivered another quarter of exceptional performance, achieving 24% restaurant-level margins while simultaneously driving transaction growth.\nGlobal ex-special, general and administrative expenses were $263 million lower than expected in part due to timing, with some expenses shifting into the fourth quarter. Our ex-special tax rate of 19% was lower year-over-year. Lastly, our EPS, excluding special items, was $1.44 per share. Ex-special EPS was positively impacted by $0.05 of unrealized investment gains related to our investment in Devyani.\nI'd now like to give a little bit of color on the remainder of the year. We're proud to say that we continue to expect that our results will land well above our long-term growth algorithm for the full year, including achieving low double-digit core operating profit growth. On the fourth quarter specifically, we now expect an operating loss at Habit of approximately $10 million, largely driven by restaurant asset impairment charges which will be higher than we had initially expected due to anticipated impacts from the California Assembly Bill 1228, previously referred to as the FAST Act. Even with the previously mentioned timing shift of G&A expenses, we still expect fourth quarter G&A to be slightly lower year-over-year.\nMoving to reported operating profit. We now expect foreign currency translation to represent a $45 million to $55 million headwind on a full year basis. Finally, we expect our ex-special full year tax rate to land at approximately 20%.\nNext, I'll cover our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. We are on track to finish 2023 with net new unit development similar to the record-breaking performances of the last 2 years. This quarter's 6% growth in unit count led by a Q3 record of 1,130 gross new openings across 65 countries reflects the continued success of our multiyear effort to accelerate development across our brands.\nBy now, you've seen the announcement at Yum China's recent investor conference, raising their unit growth expectations for our brands in China. This announcement highlights continued strong returns on new restaurant development in our brands in combination with the best-in-class development capabilities that Yum China leadership team have built in the market.\nMore broadly, we continue to see excitement for our brands all around the world. As an example, in Vietnam, a market with a high population but relatively low Yum! restaurant penetration, our unit count increased by over 40 units versus last year, reflecting 16% growth. In total, this quarter, KFC achieved 8% unit growth, including 664 gross new units, a Q3 record for the brand. This was led by Yum China, along with our franchisees in India, Sapphire and Devyani, and IS Holdings in Turkey.\nAt Pizza Hut, we opened 383 gross new units with more than 30 markets contributing to this growth. Our Taco Bell division opened 74 gross new units, led by the U.S., China and India.\nIn the midst of a higher interest rate environment, our world-class 3C franchise partners are stepping up and investing to grow share. One of those exceptional franchisees is the Serrano Group, our partner for KFC in multiple countries in Latin America. In just the past 3 years, the Serrano Group has opened over 100 net new units, quadrupling their store count from the past 10 years and building world-class assets that reflect how dynamic and tech forward our brand is in this region.\nBuilding a network of growth-minded franchise partners is no easy task. It requires persistent effort to identify and engage with like-minded partners to consistently deliver on brand standards, growth ambitions and mutually shared financial objectives, all of which add up to long-term profitable growth for all parties and competitive advantage for our brands.\nWhile we focus on having the right partners, we also work to ensure we have the right restaurant formats and economic models in place. All of our brands are laser-focused on delivering industry-leading franchisee returns by continuously optimizing new store CapEx as well as maintaining a flexible portfolio of formats that meet the unique needs of each trade zone in which we operate.\nTaco Bell's newest small box design, Go Mobile 2.0, now open in El Paso, Texas, builds on the original Go Mobile concept. This new design leverages digital capabilities to create more touch points for consumers to order and pick up in a seamless manner.\nMoving on to our unmatched operating capability growth driver. We continue to focus on delivering a seamless digital experience for our consumers, enabling easier operations for our team members and harnessing our expansive data to make fast and informed decisions. We frame up this approach through three lenses: Easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nWithin easy experiences, we successfully rolled out the Yum! Commerce platform to the Taco Bell system last quarter and are in the process of rolling the platform out to the Pizza Hut U.S. system, transitioning our brands on to Yum! owned platforms allows us to scale new capabilities at a rapid pace and build out an ecosystem of proprietary platforms that are designed to work together in a secure and seamless fashion.\nOur primary focus is to deliver leading-edge capabilities to our franchisees with advantaged economics, and our franchisees continue to co-invest with us as we develop and roll out our solutions.\nOne exciting area of growth is the implementation of in-store kiosks. We now have kiosks in nearly 40% of KFC stores outside of China. All of our Taco Bell U.S. locations, excluding licensed stores and almost 70% of our -- locations. Looking forward, for our KFC stores outside of China, we expect to drive a 20-point increase in our kiosk penetration next year on the way to reaching the vast majority of stores by the end of 2026.\nKiosks not only drive a higher check compared to our traditional front counter, but also drive higher margins through operational efficiencies and generate new opportunities to leverage customer data and create personalized ordering experiences.\nWithin easy operations, we're on track to have our recommended ordering technology, which we're calling AIM, or automated inventory management, rolled out across our KFC U.S. system by year-end. As a reminder, this is an in-house developed AI module that predicts and suggests the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. We now have AIM in place at over 7,000 U.S. restaurants, including 2,700 KFC U.S. restaurants added over the past quarter.\nThere is also great momentum behind the Dragontail rollout. We have deployed Dragontail, an AI-driven production and delivery sequencing platform, to nearly 1,400 Pizza Hut U.S. stores as of the end of the quarter, and are on track to have Dragontail deployed to around 8,000 restaurants globally by year-end, further proof of our unique ability to scale Yum! owned technologies around the world.\nWe have made significant progress in 2023, building, testing and refining our proprietary technology platforms. In 2024, we will further scale these platforms and continue to realize the value of our owned tech ecosystem.\nFinally, we are excited about the new technologies. Our R.E.D innovation team is in the early stages of piloting in restaurants to support our franchisees and free up team member time to allow them to focus even more on delivering world-class customer experiences.\nFirst, we are testing a voice-enabled AI drive-thru platform in a couple of our restaurants in California that elevates the drive-thru experience, increases speed, productivity and efficiencies and generates automated upsell recommendations.\nSecond, we have developed a proprietary automated drinks fulfillment system that frees up team member time and increases drive-thru speed and accuracy. We've designed these technologies to integrate seamlessly with our proprietary -- point-of-sale platform, and we look forward to continuing to test, refine and pilot these capabilities.\nWrapping up with our easy insights pillar. I'm very excited by the progress we have made in building the infrastructure and engineering capabilities required to harness the power of our global data assets. We continue to expand the Yum! Global Data Hub, which captures the vast majority of global transaction-level sales data and other key operational and customer metrics. We believe this centralized hub is a key asset and differentiator for Yum! as we develop leading AI capabilities.\nIn 2024, our easy insights team will develop and test new AI-driven capabilities that pull from the global data hub and integrate into our own technology platforms. Some examples of these AI-driven capabilities include personalized upsell recommendations for customers ordering on our digital platforms, intelligent menu pricing recommendations and dynamic restaurant routines for restaurant general managers.\nFinally, we will begin activating our U.S. cross-brand customer data platform in Q4 and throughout 2024. This cross-brand platform gives us unprecedented visibility into the ordering behaviors of millions of customers across our four brands and will also be a breakthrough source of learnings for Collider, the high impact boutique insights consultancy that we acquired in 2015.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and capital strategy. As a reminder, our capital priorities remain unchanged: Invest in the business for the long term, maintain a resilient balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and maximize shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydown and share repurchases.\nNet capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, reflecting $57 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.4x. Furthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average maturity of 6 years and our greater than 90% fixed debt ratio remains highly attractive in the current market environment.\nTo wrap up, we're very proud of the results in this quarter. We are on a clear path to achieving double-digit core operating profit growth for the full year. We continue to strengthen our position as the global franchisor of choice, a testament to the success of our business strategies and industry-leading talent. We're proud of our incredible continued momentum on unit development and are excited as we further accelerate our tech deployments and AI initiatives to meet the demands of consumers both today and tomorrow.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Day last December, we shared our long-term vision for Yum! to deliver accelerated global growth. I'm proud to say that our second quarter results are further evidence of our ability to execute against this vision. Two of them differentiated capabilities, our Bold Restaurant Development engine, including 1,025 gross new units in the current quarter; and our distinctive digital capabilities, which drove record digital sales, fueled the second quarter's 13% growth in system sales.\nI'm especially pleased to report that based on our strong year-to-date results and the continued momentum we see in our business, we expect to deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm.\nI'll start with a few high-level thoughts on our second quarter results before sharing some additional details through the lens of the Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands and Unrivaled Culture and Talent pillars of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. Chris will then provide some additional color on our second quarter results, followed by an update on our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth pillars.\nFor the second quarter, we delivered same-store sales growth of 9% and unit growth of 6% with KFC setting the pace with a remarkable 19% system sales growth on the foundation of our industry-leading development momentum, distinctive marketing campaigns and relevant new product layers, such as the launch of original recipe hand breaded chicken nuggets here in the U.S. And as I'm sure you've all heard, Taco Bell, in partnership with another global icon, LeBron James, successfully liberated Taco Tuesday in a way no other brand could mimic. As we also discussed in December, our Recipe for Good Growth strategy will be powered by digital and technology. Our distinctive digital capabilities, which enable easier experiences and greater access to our iconic brands, continues to unlock incremental sales through higher spend and frequency as well as incremental profitability for our system.\nOn that note, I'm pleased to report another quarter of double-digit growth, resulting in $7 billion in digital sales, representing over 45% of our global system sales.\nTurning back to our Recipe for Good Growth and our iconic R.E.D. brands, let me start with the KFC division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profits. Second quarter system sales growth of 19% was driven by 13% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. Widespread transaction growth and a strong recovery in our China market, as Yum China detailed in the results earlier this week, powered our same-store sales growth.\nHowever, even outside of China, KFC Global same-store sales growth was up an impressive 10% in the quarter. KFC represents our largest digital business globally on a dollar basis and showed continued momentum with strong year-over-year growth in both digital sales and mix.\nAmong KFC's emerging markets, I'd like to highlight our Middle East team for the work they did to drive system sales with a focus on their core menu and new snacking product offerings and the South Africa team for their efforts to grow the breakfast layer through a bold marketing campaign with Trevor Noah. Thanks to unlocking additional customer use occasions, compelling value offerings and continued digital growth, both markets posted strong same-store sales growth.\nAmong our developed markets, Western Europe led the way with strong results in check and transactions by balancing disruptive value and core menu items.\nTurning to KFC U.S. Same-store sales grew 5%, improving sequentially with the combination of product innovation and an Always On value strategy. Building on first quarter momentum behind Wraps, KFC U.S. launched hand breaded original recipe chicken nuggets to expand its off-the-bone chicken offerings, leveraging the learnings from our significant off-the-bone business at KFC International. This product innovation was met with an immediate positive consumer reaction resulting in over 100 million nuggets sold in the first 8 weeks after launch. These boneless offerings appeal to younger and new KFC customers and build upon an already well-established sales layer following the successful launch of the chicken sandwich in 2021.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 35% of our global divisional operating profit and roughly 75% of our U.S. divisional operating process. Once again, I'm thrilled to share more external recognition of Taco Bell's brand power and relevance with the brand's inclusion on the Time 100 List of the World's Most Influential Companies. This category of one brand remains ever relevant by pushing boundaries and introducing and reintroducing exciting and craveable menu items and always being part of the cultural moment and conversation.\nCongrats to the entire Taco Bell team and our incredible franchisees for yet another well-deserved honor.\nFor the second quarter, Taco Bell's global system sales grew 7%, led by 4% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Taco Bell continues to execute its magic growth formula through a balanced set of commercial strategies, including building brand buzz, unparalleled value, Mas occasions and digital initiatives.\nThis quarter, the team launched a campaign to liberate Taco Tuesday in a first-ever global Taco Tuesday campaign spanning 19 markets in partnership with a true global icon, LeBron James. The campaign created massive brand buzz with engagement and mentions in 1 week for Taco Tuesday liberation surpassing the entirety of the highly successful Mexican pizza relaunch last year.\nOther promotions in the quarter contributing to Taco Bell's winning Magic Growth formula include both our $5 Cravings Trio and Deluxe Build Your Own Cravings box that helps sustain our strong consumer value proposition and maintain over 25% margins.\nIn addition, an expansion of trading hours with strong growth at both the breakfast and late night dayparts helped Taco Bell's second quarter results.\nFinally, the team continues to create incremental demand for their digital channels. In the U.S., digital sales increased almost 35% year-over-year with kiosks now deployed in 100% of Taco Bell stores.\nTaking all of this into account, it is no surprise Taco Bell continues to be a leader in value perception while also delivering amazing unit economics.\nFor Taco Bell International, system sales grew 18% driven by development momentum. The global Taco Tuesday campaign, which launched in June and will continue through the third quarter, leverages Taco Bell's U.S. cultural leadership, building brand equity and consumer awareness with a consistent look and feel around the world.\nI also want to highlight Taco Bell's continued progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy that included raising $20 million so far this year through its roundup fundraiser. Throughout the quarter, the Taco Bell Foundation donated these funds to over 400 nonprofits and nearly 1,000 Live Mas scholarships.\nNext, I'll discuss the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 14% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 7% for the quarter, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Pizza Hut International grew system sales 11%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nThe individual occasion continued to be a growth driver largely on incremental transaction growth from the Melts platform, which in the U.S. has proven to be a self-sustaining layer at an attractive entry price point. Since launching in the U.S. late last year, Melts has now reached 35 markets, up significantly from the 11 markets in the first quarter now in over half of our global store base.\nMelts is delivering encouraging early results alongside My Box, our other international individual occasion product offering. Our team is focused on providing distinctive value offerings across markets such as the Super Limo Abundant value deal in the UAE and the national pizza party promotion in Australia.\nPizza Hut U.S. grew system sales 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. In the U.S., we introduced new labor profile to our Melts platform, providing yet another reason for customers to order from Pizza Hut.\nThe Habit Burger Grill division grew system sales 9% on 7% unit growth. The Habit team continues to lean into its menu strategy of Culinary Forward limited time offerings highlighting its craft brand positioning through their elevated craveable offering. We continue to expand access points for our customers with the rollout of kiosks, now in over 60% of stores. An average kiosk sales see 10% higher checks compared with front counter sales, an excellent profit flow-through, yet another proof point of the value from converting to digital sales.\nMoving to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver, which continues to be the foundation of our success. To start, I'd like to recognize Taco Bell Division CEO, Mark King, who will retire at the end of the year. As we celebrate the legacy that Mark will leave at Taco Bell, we're thrilled that Sean Tresvant will become the CEO of the Taco Bell Division effective January 2024. Sean joined Taco Bell's Chief Brand Officer 2 years ago and earlier this year, expanded his role to Global Chief Brand and Strategy Officer. With Sean's clear vision and strong track record of driving transformative R.E.D. innovation I'm confident that Taco Bell will continue to successfully execute its long-term global growth strategy.\nThis is a great reminder of how people are truly at the center of everything we do, which is also reinforced in our global Citizenship & Sustainability Report, which was published last month. The report outlines our strategic investments in socially responsible growth, risk management and sustainable stewardship of our 3 priority pillars of people, food and planet. I'd like to take a moment to highlight work on key issues across each pillar, including the quality packaging and carbon reduction.\nWe remain committed to our purpose of unlocking opportunity in part through our $100 million commitment over 5 years that we announced in 2020 to knock down barriers to equity inclusion, education and entrepreneurship around the world. Through our Unlocking Opportunity initiative, we have funded and activated more than 30 social impact programs in 11 countries enabling markets to develop localized programs to deliver meaningful change in communities where we operate.\nWe also continued to make progress towards achieving vendor parity and leadership roles by 2030 with 43% of global leadership roles held by women in 2022. These are just 2 examples of the great progress we've made and of how Yum!'s commitment to its people first culture has never been stronger.\nIn addition, we continue to make progress around sustainable packaging, building upon our harmonized cross-brand packaging policy that was introduced last year. Furthermore, we've had great success as we march toward our climate goals to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 50% by 2030. To date, our teams have achieved a 57% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at corporate restaurants and offices, coupled with a 28% reduction at franchise restaurants.\nReflecting on the first half of the year, our teams have put forward an impressive set of results. And looking forward, the picture we see for the second half of the year will be similarly strong. Our confidence comes from our Recipe for Good Growth strategy and the fact that category leaders, Taco Bell U.S. and KFC International, drive 80% of Yum!'s divisional operating profit. The vast majority of our U.S. operating profit is driven by Taco Bell, a leading brand in both cultural relevancy and affordability, while globally, KFC is positioned with unmatched scale advantages and growth-minded franchise partners eager to capitalize on opportunities in their markets and widen their competitive moat.\nIn an uncertain environment, we know that consumers make decisions with value in mind. The good news is that our brands have always stood for tremendous value in addition to convenience, experience and craveable food. This is a winning combination that will continue to differentiate us from our competitors. And when coupled with our Recipe for Good Growth strategy, I am confident that we can continue to deliver on our long-term vision for accelerated global growth in 2023 and beyond.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our second quarter financial results and our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers before turning to our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our second quarter results. We delivered 13% system sales growth driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Digital sales improved at all 4 of our brands with total digital sales up nearly 30% year-over-year. Core operating profit for the quarter grew 12%. Taco Bell store level margins were an impressive 25% and 6%. We continue to expect full year Taco Bell company-operated margins to be similar to margins in 2022 and Taco Bell's ability to deliver such strong margin performance despite mid-single-digit inflation once again demonstrates the power and resilience of their business model and preserves their compelling unit economics, which remain near an all-time high.\nFor Habit, company-operated margins improved to 11%, thanks to better leverage of Yum!'s purchasing scale as well as efforts to improve store level labor productivity. We're encouraged with the margin improvement progress at Habit and we'll continue to invest in the long-term growth of the business.\nAnd as a result, we expect a small operating loss for the division this year. Ex special general and administrative expenses were $280 million, in line with our expectations. The ex special tax rate for the quarter was 18%.\nFinally, our second quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.41 per share. Second quarter EPS was positively impacted by unrealized investment gains of $0.09 relating to our investment in Devyani, offset by a negative foreign currency translation impact of $0.05.\nGiven our strong first half results and continuing momentum into the second half of the year, I'm happy to report that we expect on a full year basis to over deliver on all components of our long-term growth algorithm. We expect full year 2023 core operating profit to grow low double digits, which is ahead of our long-term guidance of at least 8%.\nWe expect second half G&A expenses to be modestly higher relative to our initial plan, primarily attributable to above-target incentive compensation accruals resulting from our strong performance and which we began recording in Q2.\nAs a reminder, employee incentive compensation is tied to internal performance targets linked to components of our long-term growth algorithm. The accrual we booked throughout the year can go up or down depending on our performance.\nConsistent with our prior G&A guidance, we still expect our year-over-year G&A growth to be lower in the second half of the year. Balance of year, we expect the third quarter year-over-year G&A growth rate to look similar to the growth rate in the first half, followed by a year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, we faced a $44 million foreign currency headwind year-to-date, and our current forecast is for little to no FX impact to reported operating profit in the balance of the year.\nNow moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. We opened 1,025 gross new units during the quarter, contributing to 6% unit growth. We are encouraged by the excitement among our growth-ready franchise partners who see broad consumer appeal for our brands and enormous white space opportunity in their markets and who are enthusiastic about Yum!'s unmatched operating capabilities.\nWe continue to expect that the benefits of our scale and the health of our franchise system will allow us to further widen our development advantage relative to the industry. As you've heard me say before, the Yum! system is made up of world-class franchise partners who are truly 3C: committed, capable and well capitalized.\nAs a result, we expect 2023 will be another incredible year of development, similar to 2021 and 2022, which were both industry record-setting years.\nLet me share a few highlights of our unit development in the quarter, beginning with the KFC Division, which opened 600 gross new units. Yum China's development momentum reaccelerated with 375 gross new units opened this quarter, putting their year-to-date development ahead of last year's pace. The remainder of KFC's unit growth was widespread across markets led by India the Middle East and Asia.\nAs for the Pizza Hut Division, the team opened 357 gross new units, led by China, India, Spain, Turkey and the U.S. with each opening at least 20 units. In June, the Flynn Restaurant Group announced its first international expansion with an agreement to acquire Pizza Hut Australia, which owns approximately 260 Pizza Hut units. This is a great example of a 3C partner eager to grow within our system.\nFor those unfamiliar with the Flynn Restaurant Group, they are the largest franchise operator in the U.S. restaurant industry with roughly 2,400 restaurants, including nearly 300 Taco Bells and nearly 1,000 Pizza Huts. For some perspective, in 2022, Flynn accounted for roughly 20% of the Pizza Hut U.S. new builds, and their overall same-store sales growth significantly outperformed the rest of the U.S. system.\nTaco Bell development remains on track for another record-setting year with 63 gross new units, including 27 in international markets across 8 countries.\nTotaling it all up Yum!'s first half unit development reflects nearly 1,800 gross new units, a fantastic result that demonstrates the resilience of Yum!'s development engine despite a more challenging macro environment.\nNext, I'll turn to our unmatched operating capabilities that contribute to our position as the global franchisor of choice. This includes our distinctive digital strategy to unlock improved customer experiences that lead to faster sales growth and better store level margins.\nWith that, let me discuss the 3 pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences pillar, this quarter, the KFC U.S. team leveraged the Yum! commerce platform, which was first launched with KFC U.S. in 2021 to enable a Diablo IV limited-time promotion in partnership with Activision Blizzard and offered customers exclusive in-game rewards in exchange for KFC purchases.\nBy leveraging our in-house technology, we were able to build the necessary infrastructure and integrations to support this exciting gaming promotion in a matter of weeks. Previously, the process would have taken months with significant third-party expense. This quarter, we achieved a significant milestone in expanding the Yum! commerce platform as Taco Bell U.S. migrated its digital traffic onto the platform. All of Taco Bell's web, mobile and delivery-as-a-service digital transactions are now processed through this platform. Additionally, Pizza Hut Peru became the first international market to begin using the Yum! commerce platform this quarter.\nWe will continue to migrate additional brands and markets to the Yum! commerce platform over the coming quarters. including Pizza Hut U.S. throughout 2023 and several international markets.\nWithin the Easy Operations pillar, we continue to expand adoption of both recommended ordering and our Yum! point-of-sale system. As you may recall, recommended ordering is an AI machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of each product a restaurant general manager should order. Recommended ordering was deployed in another 800 stores this quarter and is now live in over 4,400 KFC and Taco Bell U.S. stores.\nOur Yum! next-generation cloud-first point of sale system improves operational efficiencies and enhances team member effectiveness. Taco Bell U.S. is leading this rollout, having deployed this system to 1,000 stores this quarter and targeting 5,000 stores by year-end.\nFinally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we are advancing our digital strategy and using a new customer data platform solution to provide a unified view of customers across our U.S. brands and third-party aggregators. This will enable us to improve digital experiences for our customers and ultimately increase customer frequency. Eventually, this and other internal programs will provide the infrastructure to unlock personalized marketing, joint branding and future automation. This is the latest step in our vision to one day achieve 100% of sales powered by digital.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. As a reminder, our strategy is to enable growth while maximizing shareholder value. In doing that, our capital priorities remain unchanged: investing in the business for the long term, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, paying a competitive dividend and maximizing shareholder value by returning excess capital through debt paydown and share repurchases.\nNet capital expenditures for the quarter were $34 million, reflecting $60 million in gross CapEx and $26 million in refranchising proceeds. Our net leverage ratio declined to 4.7x, reflecting our previously stated intention to allow net leverage to drift modestly lower this year.\nKeep in mind, we have an upcoming bond maturity of $325 million in November of this year, our only maturity until 2026.\nFurthermore, our current outstanding debt has a weighted average remaining term of 6 years. And our greater than 90% fixed floating ratio is attractive in the current market environment. We paid down $164 million on our revolver, leaving a minimal balance at the end of the quarter.\nWe continue to evaluate the best use of our excess capital, and at current interest rates, we believe funding our upcoming debt maturity before share repurchases best optimizes shareholder value.\nTo round out our prepared remarks, I'm incredibly pleased with our strong year-to-date results and continued momentum, giving us confidence we will deliver full year 2023 results well above our long-term growth algorithm. Our brand teams and franchise operators remain vigilant in the pursuit to maximize performance, and in turn, deliver exceptional shareholder value.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands Earnings Conference Call. My name is Bruno, and I'll be the operator of today. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand over to your host, Jodi Dyer, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter of 2022, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. For the purpose of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted both our worldwide unit growth and worldwide system sales growth by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and, thus, do not impact same-store sales results for the first quarter.\nAll GAAP figures reported continue to include the impacts of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business.\nAdditionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nAs a reminder, in April, we completed the exit of the Russia market by selling the KFC business in Russia to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik brand. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our second quarter earnings will be released on August 2, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nPresident, Chief Financial Officer & Chief Operating Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results provide further proof of the power of our portfolio of iconic brands. Both the diverse nature of our global footprint and the advantages of our business model enable us to thrive in any environment.\nOur incredible teams and franchise partners delivered another strong quarter with 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. A strong set of commercial strategies that balance compelling value and craveable, distinctive products fueled our first quarter sales momentum.\nWe continue to execute on our digital strategy to create more seamless, personalized experiences to drive greater customer engagement and easier access to our brands. These efforts resulted in broad-based acceleration in digital sales growth, leading to a record quarter for both digital system sales of nearly $7 billion and a digital sales mix that exceeded 45%.\nImportantly, our core operating profit grew 11% in the first quarter, including a 1 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits, giving us great confidence in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm this year.\nBefore I discuss our first quarter results, I wanted to provide an update on Russia. In April, we announced the completion of our sale of the KFC Russia business to Smart Service Ltd., including all Russian KFC restaurants operating systems, master franchise rights and the trademark for the Rostik's brand. As part of the sale and purchase agreement, Smart Service has agreed to retain our company employees in Russia. With the completion of this transaction, we have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nNow I'll discuss our first quarter results through the lens of our Recipe for Good Growth framework. I'll begin by talking about our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or R.E.D. for short, and our Unrivaled Culture & Talent. Chris will then share the details of our first quarter financial results before discussing our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capabilities.\nFirst, let's discuss our iconic R.E.D. brands, beginning with the KFC Division, which represents 50% of our divisional operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 15%, driven by 9% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth, reflecting broad-based strength. Globally, KFC is consistently executing its winning recipe of menu innovation, disruptive value, expanding category use occasions and doubling down on digital initiatives.\nWe were pleased to see strong year-over-year growth in our KFC China business. As usual, Joey Wat and her team did a great job navigating the complex operating environment as consumers became more mobile in the quarter and KFC was there to meet their needs.\nAdditionally, our International, ex China same-store sales, grew 11%, fueled by strong transaction and check growth. We attribute this exceptional performance to strong value offerings, the continued return of dine-in traffic, digital initiatives and strategic third-party partnerships. We've seen sustained momentum across many of our emerging markets, including Latin America and the Middle East. Additionally, we've seen renewed strength in many European markets where the team is promoting value at several price points to appeal to a broader customer base while innovating around our core menu offerings.\nThe focus at KFC U.S. is targeting new audiences and category use occasions by using relevant value and product innovation, as demonstrated with the introduction of boneless offerings, including the return of the DoubleDown sandwich and launch of 2 for $5 wraps in the first quarter and the national launch of the much-anticipated chicken nuggets early in the second quarter.\nMoving on to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 34% of our divisional operating profit. Before I get to results for the quarter, I want to highlight that Mark King was recently named the 2023 Restaurant Business Leader of the Year for the incredible progress Taco Bell has made, growing the brand while expanding unit economics and strengthening relationships with franchisees under his leadership. Seeing our world-class talent recognized more broadly across our industry gives all of us at Yum! great pride.\nTaco Bell first quarter system sales grew 12%, led by 8% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. These incredible results build on years of sustained top line strength as the team executes on its consistent growth formula, which leverages the combination of brand buzz with unparalleled value offerings, [ buzz ] occasions and digital initiatives.\nThis quarter, Taco Bell created customer buzz around craveable product offerings that included the Crispy Melt Taco and the Grilled Cheese Burrito while still providing everyday value through $2 Burritos on the Cravings Value Menu. Strong demand for the Grilled Cheese Burrito is a fantastic example that proves Taco Bell can win in the big burrito category and participate in higher price points while maintaining value leadership.\nTaco Bell U.S. is leaning into its digital initiatives to drive customer engagement, with year-over-year digital sales up approximately 60%, leading to an 8-point improvement in its digital mix.\nTaco Bell recently launched delivery-as-a-service through its mobile app to create easier access for our customers to get our craveable products. Additionally, the team also continues to make progress against our Recipe for Good Growth strategy with the ongoing condition of their packaging suite to more recycle-ready options.\nTaco Bell International grew system sales 25% in the quarter, driven by continued development momentum and strong value proposition through core menu innovation offerings.\nNext, I'll discuss the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 17% of our divisional operating profit. System sales grew 10% for the quarter, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 3% unit growth. Same-store sales growth accelerated sequentially from the fourth quarter, driven by China and continued strength in the U.S.\nPizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, grew system sales 10%, led by 5% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nFollowing the successful launch of Melts in the U.S., the team launched this breakthrough product in 10 additional markets, including the U.K., Canada and several markets in Latin America. I'd like to recognize our global pizza team for their collaborative efforts to scale this winning innovation quickly. Our markets not only shared consumer insights and product innovation at unprecedented speed, but the operations team also used augmented reality to expedite training of our international team members through our intelligent coaching app.\nPizza Hut U.S., which represents 8% of our divisional operating profit, achieved 10% system sales growth with 8% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. Melts, in combination with the Big New Yorker in the quarter, helped to drive positive transaction growth by attracting new and repeat customers. The team continues to expand strategic partnerships and is now integrated with the 3 major food aggregators in the U.S. We view aggregator marketplaces as an additional channel to provide customers greater access to our brand, while also attracting an incremental customer.\nThe Habit Burger Grill Division grew system sales 8% with 8% -- the Habit team continues to focus on expanding its abilities through mobile app user base and partnering with third-party aggregators.\nBefore moving on to our Unrivaled Culture & Talent, I want to take a moment to thank [ Russ Bendel ] and celebrate his accomplished career in the restaurant industry as he plans to retire next month. Russ' passion for restaurants has always shined through and anyone who knows Russ knows that what he really values above all else is people. Everyone is a friend to Russ, and he is loved by all who have had the privilege to work beside him, whether in a kitchen or an office.\nWe recently announced that Russ's successor is former KFC Global Division CFO, Shannon Hennessy. Shannon is an exceptional leader, and we're excited to have her drive the next chapter of growth for Habit and continue Russ' focus on people.\nMore broadly on our Unrivaled Culture & Talent growth driver, we've held powerful forums this year that galvanized our franchisees and top talent around our Recipe for Good Growth. In February, we hosted our 11th International Franchise Convention in Singapore, bringing together our global brand leadership teams and many of our 1,500 franchisees from around the world. Having attended this convention for many years, I've never seen this level of unity and enthusiasm for growth, particularly as it relates to development and broad strategic alignment with our franchise community. Our franchisees are some of the most growth-minded entrepreneurs in the world, and the international franchise convention was an opportunity to learn from, recognize and celebrate each other's achievements.\nOur partnership with our franchisees is as strong as it's ever been. We are strategically aligned to keep our iconic brands R.E.D. and our global growth momentum strong by leveraging the investments we've made in consumer insights, our digital ecosystem, innovative technologies and data analytics.\nAdditionally, we are focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while promoting equity inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. We were proud that many of our leaders, including myself, participated in the Women's Foodservice Forum as we focus on elevating all voices and achieving gender parity globally by 2030.\nWe also announced the launch of Franchise Fast Start, the program funded by Lafayette Square to provide lending support to expand Yum! franchise ownership in underserved communities in the U.S.\nAs a result of our efforts, we've recently been named to Newsweek's America's Greatest Workplaces for Women and Forbes America's Best Employers for Diversity List.\nTo wrap up, I'm always thrilled to start the year with fantastic momentum, especially when the strength is broad-based across our global portfolio. I remain confident in our ability to navigate any economic environment as our brands stand for unmatched value and convenience, providing a range of products and price points to meet all customers' needs. We are poised to maintain our robust sales momentum given our pipeline of R.E.D. product innovation, accelerating digital sales, strengthening operational execution and compelling value across our global portfolio of iconic brands.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers followed by our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our first quarter results, which reflects strong fundamental performance across all of our core financial metrics. We delivered 13% system sales growth driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Core operating profit growth for the quarter came in at 11%, which includes a 1 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits. Reported operating profit includes a $27 million negative impact from foreign currency translation. We expect foreign currency translation to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind to second quarter operating profit.\nOur digital sales accelerated across our 3 global brands, leading to a record quarter with nearly $7 billion in digital sales. We are confident our digital strategies are working, considering we reached a new high in our digital sales mix, exceeding 45% this quarter.\nTaco Bell store level margins were 22%, flat year-over-year, ex special, general and administrative expenses were $278 million, in line with our expectations. As we previously mentioned, we expect our year-over-year G&A growth will be higher in the first half of the year.\nThe ex special tax rate for the quarter was 19%. Our first quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.06, roughly flat over the prior year. First quarter EPS was negatively impacted by unrealized investment losses of $0.07 relating to our investment in Devyani and foreign currency translation impact of $0.08.\nAs David mentioned, we completed the sale of our Russia business last month. Beginning in the second quarter, the Russia business will no longer be reported in our GAAP results, including franchise revenue and G&A. For modeling purposes, KFC Russia's quarterly franchisee fee revenue and G&A have averaged approximately $20 million and $5 million, respectively, over the last few quarters.\nWe are pleased to see inflationary pressures, staffing challenges and supply chain disruptions abate in the U.S. as we return to a more normalized operating environment. While we've seen similar trends in some international markets, there are others where our franchisees continue to face outsized inflationary pressures. We continue to partner with our franchisees to protect restaurant-level profitability while ensuring we maintain strong relative value for our customers. We're encouraged by trends in commodity inflation and labor availability as both bode well for the health of our franchise system, which is the foundation of our industry-leading development engine.\nNow moving on to Bold Restaurant Development. we opened 746 gross new units during the quarter. Full year 2023 is shaping up to be another incredible year of development, similar to 2021 and 2022. But it's important to note the quarterly cadence of development will be weighted more heavily towards the second half of the year.\nAs we've said before, we have great line of sight into our development pipeline, with over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized road-ready franchise partners.\nLet me share a few highlights of our diverse development drivers, beginning with the KFC Division, which opened 385 gross units this quarter. China, India and our Latin America markets led the charge this quarter, with each opening more than 20 units. I'd like to recognize our KFC team in the Philippines for their efforts to drive our [ good growth solar ] panels to build more sustainable restaurants.\nAs for the Pizza Hut Division, the team opened 271 gross units this quarter, including the China, India and Turkey markets each opening more than 20 units. As we had anticipated, we exited our Pakistan Pizza Hut franchise partner and closed all 77 stores in the market. We are committed to partnering with capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees. In some instances, the best thing for our brands and business in the long term is to exit a market and reopen with the right 3C franchise partner, which is exactly what we plan to do in this situation.\nTurning to Taco Bell. The team opened 79 gross units in Q1. The Taco Bell team continues to leverage unique store designs to enhance both the digital and drive-through experience for our customers.\nTaco Bell International is off to a record-breaking start, with 46 units opened this quarter, and Taco Bell China becoming our fourth international market to cross the 100-unit threshold, along with Spain, the U.K. and India. These top 4 markets accounted for 60% of new builds this quarter, illustrating the power and scale to drive accelerated growth.\nIn summary, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our industry-leading development momentum.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights.\nFirst, our commitment as a franchise-first organization and unmatched operating capabilities are contributing to our position as the global franchisor of choice. We mentioned on our fourth quarter earnings call that Taco Bell was ranked #1 in Entrepreneur Magazine's Franchise 500 ranking in North America. Building on that recognition, this last week, Entrepreneur Magazine announced its [ 2023 top ] global [indiscernible] largest brands made the top 5, led by KFC in the #1 spot.\nMoving on to the pillars of our digital strategy. Beginning with the Easy Experiences pillar, we continued to enhance our digital ordering capabilities and launched new ordering channels. In fact, Tictuk completed its single largest market deployment for chat ordering to date this quarter.\nCustomers are now able to order KFC across 1,000 stores in South Africa using WhatsApp. Early results in the market show this new ordering channel is sticky, with more than 40% of users placing multiple orders in the first 90 days after launch.\nWithin the Easy Operations pillar, Dragontail launched in over 1,000 [ orders ] across KFC and Pizza Hut this quarter, led by the Pizza Hut U.S. system, which doubled its store count to reach approximately 1,000 restaurants in total. Additionally, KFC Canada launched nearly 400 restaurants on the platform.\nRestaurants that implement Dragontail consistently see improvements in product quality and customer satisfaction scores as the order sequencing algorithm and driver dispatch capabilities ensure customers' favorite Yum! products arrive hot and fresh.\nAdditionally, the first quarter marked an exciting collaboration milestone for our restaurant technology teams. The core platform that powers Hut [ but ], Pizza Huts Coach in your pocket application that supports over 20,000 Pizza Hut managers in 85 countries will now be managed centrally by Yum! digital and technology. This shift allows us to scale mobile-first technology for our restaurant managers more quickly across our brands and ensures continued product enhancement and future AI-based innovation under the Yum! Super App banner.\nFinally, for our Easy Insights pillar, we rolled out recommended ordering to nearly 600 additional stores and are live in over 3,600 stores in KFC and Taco Bell U.S. Recommended ordering is an AI module that recommends the quantity of product a restaurant manager should order each week. It reduces the time restaurant managers spend ordering product, improves forecast accuracy and reduces waste and time-consuming off-cycle orders and cross-store transfers. At Taco Bell, we have seen a 70% reduction in off-cycle orders and store transfers which frees up our managers to focus on delivering great guest experiences.\nLastly, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a resilient balance sheet, offer a competitive dividend and continuously evaluate the optimal use of our excess cash. We constantly revisit the allocation of our capital to optimize shareholder returns.\nOur net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 4.9x. As a reminder, we expect our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower this year.\nOur net capital expenditures for the quarter were $57 million, reflecting $5 million in refranchising proceeds and $62 million in gross CapEx.\nAs it relates to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at an average share price of $129 per share, totaling approximately $50 million.\nTo close, we're incredibly pleased with our results for the quarter. With a great start to the year, we're confident in delivering on our long-term growth algorithm in 2023. Our relevant and iconic brands consistently demonstrate that they are uniquely positioned to thrive in any macro environment and create lasting shareholder value.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

    "content": "Q4 2022 Yum! Brands Inc Earnings Call\n\nQ4 2022 Yum! Brands Inc Earnings Call\n\nYUMNYSEFEB 8, 8:15 AM\n\nOperator\n\nHello, everyone, and welcome to the Yum! Brands, Inc. 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Charlie and I'll be coordinating the call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Gavin, please go ahead.\n\nGavin Felder\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is on maternity leave. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, please note that this call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this call and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings release and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures, definitions and reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics used on today's call.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Please also note the following financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics.\nFor the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base. This negatively impacted our worldwide unit growth by 2 percentage points and our worldwide system sales growth for both the fourth quarter and the full year by 2 percentage points. These units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus did not impact same-store sales results for the fourth quarter or full year.\nAll GAAP figures reported continue to include the impact of Russia operations for KFC for the full quarter and year, and for Pizza Hut prior to our transfer of that business to a local operator in the second quarter. These GAAP figures primarily include royalty revenues from continued franchise operations and G&A to support our Russia business. Additionally, our GAAP G&A includes expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business.\nAs a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments in which they are earned subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected those net operating profits as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Looking ahead, our first quarter earnings will be released on May 3, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. 2022 truly was a landmark year for Yum!. In spite of the challenges from significant spikes in commodity inflation and pockets of labor shortages, our world-class teams and franchisees partnered together to deliver another year of amazing growth.\nWe achieved record-breaking industry development, opening 4,560 gross units that translated to nearly 3,100 net new units, beating our prior record set just last year and ending the year with over 55,000 restaurants globally. For the full year, system sales were up 8% and core operating profit was up 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nPerhaps the most impressive performance came from Taco Bell, finishing 2022 with same-store sales growth of 8%. Taco Bell also bucked the industry trend on margins, holding company operated margins flat from last year despite elevated industry-wide cost pressure. KFC International delivered a record year, opening approximately 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units, translating to 9% unit growth. Combined, these 2 parts of the business account for approximately 80% of our divisional operating profit.\nWe finished the year on a high note with system sales growth of 10% in Q4, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth, contributing to 22% core operating profit growth, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nSuch incredible performance under highly challenging conditions underscores the tremendous confidence I have that even after a remarkable 25 years of growth as a public company, our best days are clearly ahead of us.\nBefore I discuss our 2022 results in detail, I wanted to give a brief update on our planned exit from Russia. As mentioned during our Q3 call, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. We expect the transaction to close following satisfaction of all closing conditions. Following the closing, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nI also want to acknowledge the devastating impact of the earthquake that happened earlier this week, affecting our teams in Turkey. Our people remain our #1 priority, and I want to recognize the effort from our franchisee, Ilkem Sahin, as he and his team worked to prioritize people's safety as they navigate through this tragedy.\nAs we shared at our recent Investor Day, our strategy is guided by our Recipe for Good Growth. And today, we will discuss our 2022 results through the lens of that framework. I will talk about 2 of our growth drivers: namely our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our efforts to drive the good agenda across our brands and our business. Chris will then share the details of our fourth quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capabilities growth drivers.\nI'll start by discussing our iconic R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 49% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2022 system sales grew 9%, driven by 7% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 system sales for KFC increased 10%, thanks to 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Results were unfavorably impacted by COVID-related challenges in China. Excluding China, our KFC business continues to grow at an unbelievable pace with same-store sales growing 9% in the quarter, driven in part by our world-class franchisees and continued impressive momentum in our emerging markets.\nAt KFC's International business, which represents 44% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 11%. Several markets showed stellar results. In Japan, for example, KFC is synonymous with the Christmas holiday family meal. And this year, Japan system sales over the Christmas period grew 16% year-over-year. Africa drove double-digit same-store sales growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from several customer-facing digital initiatives. To build on that success, our South Africa team will continue to roll out kiosks with a goal of installing them in 95% of our stores by 2023.\nMoving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 35% of our divisional operating profit. On a global basis, full year system sales grew 11%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. This team continues to deliver industry-leading results, and coupled with the incredible array of talent in place and our strong franchisee partnerships, it should be no surprise that Taco Bell earned the top spot on Entrepreneur magazine's Franchise 500 Ranking for the third year running.\nMoving on to our fourth quarter results. Taco Bell U.S. grew system sales 14%, underpinned by an exceptional 11% same-store sales growth. The powerful momentum from previous quarters continued with the relaunch of the cult classic Mexican Pizza for which we provided early access to our loyalty members. We ended the year with around 45 million Mexican Pizzas sold, an impressive number considering they were only available for 4 months of the year.\nWe also made encouraging progress in our breakfast layer, building on high-profile branding partnerships such as Doja Cat in Q1 and Davante Adams in Q3. Taco Bell brought in Pete Davidson to help drive consumer buzz for breakfast. This led to 9% transaction growth for the daypart. Overall, Taco Bell did a terrific job this quarter at balancing both ends of the consumer spectrum by featuring premium products that our consumers crave, such as the Grilled Cheese Burrito with sharply priced items like Nacho Fries.\nAt Taco Bell International, Q4 system sales grew 23%, driven by 29% unit growth and 4% same-store sales growth. Q4 closed a truly breakthrough year for our international business, which has now crossed the 1,000-unit mark. To put this speed into some historical context, Taco Bell International has built 40% of its current estate within the last 2 years. It wasn't just our development engine on fire this year, many of our markets reached double-digit same-store sales growth in 2022, including some of our largest markets with India, up 33%; Thailand, up 36%; and Spain, up 20%.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit, our full year system sales grew 3%, led by 4% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth. Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 9% of our divisional operating profit, achieved system sales growth of 4%, driven by 6% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales in the fourth quarter. Results were heavily impacted by the ongoing COVID-related challenges in China. Ex-China, our same-store sales remained healthy, growing 4%.\nSeveral markets showed noticeable strength, including Japan, where same-store sales grew 10%, owing to a strong holiday performance and recent product launch of Tuscani pasta bowls that featured a local flavored twist. At Pizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our divisional operating profit, Q4 system sales grew 5%, driven by 4% same-store sales growth and flat unit growth. The strength in the quarter was driven by a combination of factors that included new advertising to highlight both premium and value offerings, growth partnerships with aggregators and the success of the new Melts product. Melts over-indexed to predinner time frames and individual occasion tickets and helped to recover the lower household income base due to its strong value proposition. Lastly, 5 distinct national marketing campaigns on Uber Eats and DoorDash helped aggregator transactions grow 30% in the quarter.\nLastly, at the Habit Burger Grill, the team continues to make progress on setting up the business for long-term growth. Habit's burgeoning digital channel finished the year strong with digital mix ending at 35%, a truly impressive level after only launching in 2020. I'm pleased to share that Habit is now 18% franchised, which is up 5 points from last year. With $2 million average unit volumes and a compelling growth strategy, I'm confident in the long-term growth of our newest brand.\nAnd now on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent Growth drivers. Our hallmark at Yum! continues to be our people first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. Highlights in 2022 included bringing our top 250 leaders from around the world together for a Global Leadership Summit and celebrating the important role our world-class talent has played as we marked our 25th anniversary as a publicly traded company.\nInternally, we continued to promote talent naming a President of the Habit Burger Grill and a new President of KFC U.S. Externally, we attracted top talent, welcoming a new Global Chief Brand Officer for Taco Bell, a new Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer for Pizza Hut and a new Chief Corporate Affairs Officer for Yum!.\nWhen it comes to all the good we do, we released our 2021 Recipe for Good report during the year, detailing our strong progress around our 3 priority areas. With our science-based targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 46% by 2030, we decreased emissions against our 2019 baseline by approximately 24% for company-owned buildings and our corporate restaurants, while our franchisees decreased emissions by 20%.\nRegarding better packaging, we published a new global harmonized packaging policy with a focus on eliminating unnecessary packaging, shifting to more sustainable materials and supporting better recovery and recycling systems. We increased the number of women in senior leadership globally to 42%, which keeps us on track to achieve gender parity and leadership globally by 2030 in alignment with Paradigm for Parity.\nWe were pleased Yum! received industry-leading rankings on the carbon disclosure project and inclusion on the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America, the 2023 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and Newsweek's list for America's Most Responsible Companies and America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity.\nTo wrap up, I'm thrilled with our 2022 performance, particularly given many of the unpredictable obstacles our team had to navigate. Our results continue to reflect a resilient, diversified business and the strength of our portfolio, led by our iconic brands. I'm confident we will continue to execute with superior performance and deliver industry-leading growth, all of which will help to maximize value to our shareholders.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy. As David mentioned, 2022 was a year of huge milestones for Yum!. The resilience and winning mindset shown by our teams around the world helped us open a record-breaking 4,560 gross units or 3,076 net new units on a full year basis. These development numbers put full year unit growth at 6%. System sales for the year grew 8%, driven by strong international same-store sales growth for KFC and another stellar performance from Taco Bell. Full year core operating profit grew 6%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year.\nFourth quarter system sales growth of 10% was in line with the update we shared at our Investor Day, driven by 6% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth. Core operating profit grew 22%, which includes a 2-point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Reported operating profit included a negative $42 million foreign currency translation impact in the fourth quarter and a negative $118 million impact to the full year.\nEx special general and administrative expenses came in at $357 million and approximately $1.1 billion for the full year. Taco Bell store level margins were 23%, flat year-over-year. Taco Bell paid additional discretionary bonuses to its store-level employees, given the strong performance for the year, which impacted quarterly margins by approximately 50 basis points. Taco Bell's full year store level margin was 24%, near the upper end of its 23% to 24% historical pre-COVID margin range.\nFourth quarter ex special EPS was $1.31, a 29% increase versus the prior year. EPS growth was positively impacted by core operating profit growth of 22% and a lower current year tax rate. This was partially offset by the year-over-year impact of a current year mark-to-market loss on our equity investment in a franchisee in India, lapping a prior year gain as well as the aforementioned negative impact of foreign currency. The ex special tax rate in the quarter was 12%, due in large part to the release of a valuation allowance associated with deferred tax assets that we now believe we will be able to utilize. Our full year ex special tax rate was 21%, in line with our full year expectations of 21% to 23%.\nNow let me share greater detail on our fourth quarter unit growth in the context of our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 1,830 gross new units, resulting in 4,560 gross units opened for the full year or the equivalent of more than 1 new restaurant every 2 hours. Nearly 90% of new store openings in 2022 occurred outside the United States across 112 countries, proof that our diversified development engine is stronger than ever.\nStarting with KFC, the team opened 997 gross new units in the fourth quarter with China, India and Thailand leading the charge. The Pizza Hut division had incredible development results, opening 571 gross new units in Q4 with 5 countries contributing more than 25 units, namely India, Indonesia, Canada, China and Turkey. The Taco Bell division opened 253 gross new units in Q4 and 496 restaurants for the full year. In fact, Taco Bell U.S. opened 250 gross new units this year, the second highest annual amount ever.\nFor 2022, Taco Bell International set a record with 246 gross new units, exceeding the prior record of 179 units set last year. I'm thrilled to report we crossed the 1,000 Taco Bell unit threshold internationally and we soon expect to have 4 countries that have over 100 units with China joining Spain, India and the U.K.\nLastly, Habit added 33 gross new units in 2022, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 10%. This level of growth, which includes a significant number of company-owned units create some short-term noise in company-owned restaurant margins due to the inclusion of preopening expenses and the depressed margins that are normal during the initial months of operations before new stores reach maturity. Average margins for Habit stores opened more than a year remain much stronger than our overall reported Habit company store margin.\nTo finish with development, as we head into 2023, we remain confident that we will maintain our strong momentum. We exited 2022 with record site registrations for new units at Taco Bell U.S., and we have over 80% of 2023 planned units at KFC and Pizza Hut outside of China committed with well-capitalized, growth-ready franchise partners.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering seamless customer experiences through proprietary technology and dedicated operational programs.\nIn 2022, we expanded the rollout of Tictuk, our conversational commerce and e-commerce platform across our network and finished the year with Tictuk in over 3,200 stores across 49 markets. We processed millions of digital orders in 2022 with Tictuk continuing to prove it can bring in incremental customers and drive digital sales. This is evidenced by the chat ordering launch in KFC Mexico where more than 90% of users who transacted on the chat channel had previously not placed a digital order on other channels. We plan to roll out Tictuk to more than 1,000 new stores in 2023, including its white label e-commerce platform, which went live in Pizza Hut Chile and Taco Bell Canada in Q4 2022.\nMoving on to our Easy Operations pillar, which centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. The rollout of Dragontail is ramping up in Pizza Hut U.S. with over 450 stores onboarded by the end of 2022 and plans to reach up to 1,000 stores by the end of Q1. Globally, we expect to have Dragontail in over 7,000 stores by the end of 2023. At Pizza Hut U.S., we have completed the integration of 2 major aggregator channels into our point-of-sale system. And at Taco Bell U.S., we have fully integrated our delivery as a service partner into our store's technology system. These integrations are important in helping our team members process delivery orders with new levels of ease.\nLastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. I want to highlight 2 key initiatives that our Yum! decision sciences team have been working on, namely Recommended Ordering and Cook Schedule. Recommended Ordering is an artificial intelligence, machine learning module that predicts and recommends the quantity of product for a restaurant manager to order each week with the goal of reducing product waste and intra-store transfers of inventory. The product has been rolled out to 3,000 U.S. stores across Taco Bell and KFC. Cook Schedule is a similar module that helps predict the correct amount of food and timing to cook product to accurately meet demand. The team is working primarily with KFC on this initiative with plans to pilot in an international market soon.\nFinally, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the year at 5x, including a small balance on our revolving credit facility that was used to support share repurchases in the fourth quarter. We will enter 2023 with no significant maturities until 2026 and approximately 94% of our debt fixed, excluding our revolving credit facility balance. I will reiterate that our capital priorities are guided by maximizing shareholder value. This includes investing in the business, maintaining a resilient balance sheet, offering a competitive dividend and continuously evaluating the optimal use of our excess cash. To that end, I am also pleased to announce that this week, our Board of Directors approved an increased quarterly dividend of $0.605.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $99 million. Our net capital expenditures for the year came in at $206 million, reflecting $73 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $279 million in gross CapEx. With regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 4.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $119 per share, totaling approximately $486 million.\nFor the full year, we repurchased 10 million shares at an average price of $119 per share and totaling $1.2 billion. Overall, we are extremely pleased with these results given the complexities our teams faced. Navigating such challenges with industry-leading performance affirms the confidence we have to deliver our recently raised long-term growth algorithm of 5% unit growth, 7% system sales growth and at least 8% core operating profit growth.\nLooking to 2023, we wanted to provide a few guardrails for modeling purposes. First, we expect to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm with healthy unit growth momentum continuing into 2023. We expect Taco Bell company operated margins to be in line with full year 2022 margins, and we expect our 2023 G&A to be approximately $1.15 billion, in line with the guidance provided at Investor Day. In terms of the shape for the year, the year-over-year growth in G&A will be highest in the first half, largely owing to the timing of our G&A expense plan across the year.\nBased on rate expectations as of today, we expect our interest expense to be up approximately 10% year-over-year and for our leverage ratio to drift modestly lower in 2023. Finally, we expect our full year tax rate to be 21% to 23%.\nTo close, we are extremely proud of the performance of our brands over the past year and look forward with excitement to deliver another year of compelling growth and shareholder value in 2023.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc. 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Drew, and I'll be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI'm now going to hand over to Gavin Felder, Chief Strategy Officer and Interim Head of Investor Relations, to begin. Please go ahead.\n\nGavin Felder\n\nChief Strategy Officer, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I will be covering for Jodi Dyer while she is out on maternity leave.\nOn our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC.\nIn addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used on today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures. Please note that during today's call, all system sales growth and operating profit growth results exclude the impact of foreign currency.\nNext, I'll provide an update on the financial reporting treatment related to our exit from Russia. As a reminder, as of the beginning of the second quarter, we elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. This negatively impacted our third quarter unit growth by 2 percentage points and our system sales growth by 3 percentage points.\nAdditionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus do not impact same-store sales results for the third quarter. For the purposes of this call, all references to system sales growth and unit growth results for the quarter are adjusted to remove our Russia business from the prior year base.\nWe continue to include Russia in GAAP measures for KFC, including royalty revenue and expenses to support the Russia business and expenses incurred relating to the transfer of ownership of the business. As a result of our decision to exit our Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segments subsequent to the start of the conflict to corporate and unallocated and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense line.\nFor more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website. We are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.\nWe would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. We will be hosting an Investor Day in person on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. The event will also be webcast via our website at investors.yum.com. Fourth quarter earnings will be released on February 8, 2023, with the conference call on the same day.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gavin, and good morning, everyone. Our strong top line momentum this quarter highlights clear demand for our iconic brands. We delivered 10% system sales growth underpinned by 5% same-store sales growth and 6% unit growth.\nWhile the broader macro environment evolves, our brands continue to thrive by being distinctive, creating excitement for consumers and by delivering exceptional value and convenience. The investments we have made in areas such as consumer insights, marketing analytics and new technology platforms allow us to act with pace and confidence to meet the needs of consumers around the world.\nI'm particularly thrilled about the performance of the KFC and Taco Bell division that were both standout performers this quarter. KFC did an excellent job in driving transaction growth through its omnichannel approach, leading to a sequential improvement in comps from the prior quarter. Taco Bell is winning, thanks to its ability to generate and amplify standout moments in culture and translate the resulting top line growth into impressive restaurant-level margins.\nI'm also excited to share that we opened a total of 979 gross units across 74 countries, proof that our development engine is powerful and diversified. As these results show, our committed and well-capitalized franchise partners are seizing opportunities to invest in the growth of our brands for the long term.\nNext, I want to provide an update on our Russian business. As Gavin mentioned, we have a signed purchase agreement to transfer ownership of our Russian KFC restaurants, operating system and master franchise rights to an existing KFC Russia franchisee. Following the completion of the transaction, we will have ceased our corporate presence in Russia.\nI want to say that I'm incredibly proud of how our local teams have managed through this extremely difficult time and prioritized the safety of our people in the region. Our #1 priority is our people, and they will always be at the center of every decision we make.\nNow I'll talk about 2 of our growth drivers, our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or R.E.D. for short, and our unrivaled culture and talent. Then I'll provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our third quarter financial results before discussing our Bold Restaurant Development and unmatched operating capabilities growth drivers.\nFirst, I'll discuss our R.E.D. brands. Beginning with the KFC division, which accounts for 51% of our operating cost. System sales grew 12%, underpinned by 7% same-store sales growth and 7% unit growth. As these results prove, this business can perform well in a multitude of environments, even as certain pockets of the global portfolio experience heightened macro pressures.\nAt KFC's International business, which represents 46% of our operating profit, our system sales grew 14%, driven by an 8% increase in same-store sales. This represents a significant acceleration from the 1% same-store sales growth in the second quarter.\nWe saw notable strength in the Middle East, India and Africa, thanks to momentum across our digital channels and a focus on operations and value. Our Middle East market is truly on fire, where system sales grew an impressive 46% with strength across all channels, including a ramp-up in the use of kiosks and Click and Collect.\nOur India market saw system sales grow 45% during the quarter, with customers enjoying the convenience-driven 7-minute Express takeaway guarantee. In Africa, where system sales grew 31%, the team is focused on providing an easy and convenient digital experience for consumers. They've done an outstanding job rebranding their Click and Collect channel as well as rolling out kiosks across the market to drive sales, underpinned by compelling sharing offers like the All In One Feast.\nAt KFC U.S., we brought back our famous $5 Mac & Cheese Bowls as a value-oriented item this quarter. The reboot of this much-loved product helps drive a positive 2% same-store sales comp. Additionally, for a limited time, we launched a $6 2-piece drum and thigh combo, which has driven positive results in a meaningful, sequential improvement in transactions.\nMoving on to our Taco Bell division, which represents 34% of our operating profit. We saw extremely strong momentum with system sales growing 9%, led by 6% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth.\nAt Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 8% for the quarter, underpinned by a 7% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. The brand is bringing to life its one-of-a-kind menu through creative innovation in a way that only Taco Bell can. This was most evident with the team adding products to its $2 cravings menu such as the Cheesy Double Beef Burrito, while innovating with premium offers like the Grilled Cheese Burrito.\nTaco Bell is a brand that is truly relevant, easy and distinctive with a unique ability to stand for value in the current economic environment, yet have a broad enough range to appeal to consumers across every demographic. As we enter the fourth quarter, we're even more excited about the momentum in Taco Bell U.S. with the relaunch of the Mexican Pizza, which occurred in mid-September.\nAt Taco Bell International, system sales grew 26%, driven by 30% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. In the third quarter, 5 markets delivered double-digit system sales growth, marking another milestone in Taco Bell's international expansion journey. Year-to-date, we've opened 111 net new units, almost double the number opened at this point last year. We're driving scale in key markets, helping our franchisees leverage their size to optimize marketing spend, expand development capabilities and gain local sourcing efficiencies.\nNext, at the Pizza Hut division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit. Our system sales grew 5%, led by 5% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. At Pizza Hut International, which accounts for 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 6%, underpinned by 8% unit growth and 2% same-store sales growth.\nAcross our markets, we are focused on finding ways to expand our reach to become a more everyday brand. For example, as a leading everyday value offering, the Pizza Hut India team launched a Fun Flavor pizza costing roughly $1.\nMore broadly, the My Box value platform is proving to be a key traffic driver through innovation and giving customers the option to customize with new entrees and side items. The platform helps us lean in on the individual meal and lunch occasions, and it's now live in over 50 countries. I'm also pleased to say that our emerging markets are seeing a recovery in traffic and demand as we lap the impact of COVID.\nPizza Hut U.S., which accounts for 7% of our operating profit, saw system sales grow 2%, driven by 1% same-store sales growth. A key focus for this business has been to provide our customers with the ability to access our brands wherever they are. As part of this initiative, we continue to partner with third-party aggregators and integrate them into our POS systems, with 90% of our system using at least one third-party marketplace.\nIn addition, we are working to ensure we have the right value offerings to meet consumer demand and maintain franchisee profitability. This effort led to the introduction of items such as the $6.99 medium 1-topping pairs deal and the return of the Big Dinner Box as an abundant family value offering.\nLastly at The Habit Burger Grill. Same-store sales trends on a 3-year basis have sequentially improved since the second quarter. Additionally, we continued to see consumers download our mobile app, leading to a 10% increase in app downloads since last quarter. Digital sales at The Habit now account for 33% of mix. The team is making good progress growing new sales channels and forming direct relationships with our customers.\nMoving on to our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. As we've mentioned on previous calls, we have been celebrating our 25th anniversary as a publicly-traded company in various forms throughout this year. I'd like to acknowledge the important role our unique people-first culture and world-class talent have played in our success over the last 25 years.\nOur culture, which is focused on recognition and collaboration, is a key differentiator across our portfolio of iconic brands. It continues to drive retention and recruitment of amazing leaders who are developing others, growing their careers and ensuring the continued strong performance and success of our brand. I'm proud of Yum!'s deep bench of outstanding leaders and how our commitment to growing our people from within has driven a healthy increase in promotions and new opportunities for our teams. Our culture continues to attract top external talents as well. We recently welcomed former Mars Inc. executive, Allyson Park, to our global leadership team as Yum!'s Chief Corporate Affairs Officer, overseeing communications and public policy as well as our ESG strategy, an area of increased importance as we continue driving our Recipe for Good.\nAt Pizza Hut, we welcomed former Starbucks executive Shannon Garcia as the brand's Global Chief Operating and Transformation Officer, a role that will evolve the way in which the brand works with its markets to add value and operate with a digital-first mindset. These are just 2 examples of the incredible talent that our culture enables us to attract from outside and within our industry.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we continue to invest in critical work that's focused on our 3 priority areas of people, food and planet. I'm proud of our commitment and the progress we're making on the execution of our ESG agenda.\nFor example, when it comes to our climate efforts, we moved Yum!'s U.S. offices as well as all of our company-owned restaurants to renewable electricity. We're now conducting a global study on renewable energy markets to identify low-carbon solutions at our restaurants worldwide.\nAnd in August, Pizza Hut U.S. announced an exciting partnership with Dairy Farmers of America on an innovative farm-level sustainability project to provide participating farmers with the technology and data needed to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. With iconic brands and unmatched scale, I truly believe that we're in a unique position to make a significant impact in the areas we are prioritizing.\nTo wrap up, I'm excited about the momentum in the business that we demonstrated this quarter. The power and resilience of our brands was clear as we continue to prove we can perform well in any environment. With our diversified global scale, world-class franchise partners and unmatched operating capabilities, I am more confident than ever in the future success of our business.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, followed by our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with our third quarter financial results. System sales grew 10%, with broad-based strength evident across our portfolio. Same-store sales grew 5% while units grew 6%. Core operating profit grew 8%, which includes a 3 point headwind from the removal of Russia profits this year. Ex special, general and administrative expenses came in at $259 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022.\nImpressively, our Taco Bell store-level margins were 24%, trending above third quarter last year and above pre-COVID levels. With respect to reported operating profit, FX had a negative $39 million impact and we now expect a full year FX headwind of approximately $100 million.\nThird quarter EPS, excluding special items, was $1.09, an 11% decrease versus the prior year. In addition to a 3 percentage point impact from forgone operating profits in Russia, EPS growth was also negatively impacted by 9 percentage points from the aforementioned FX, 9 percentage points owing to a higher tax rate and 6 percentage points from lower year-over-year unrealized gain associated with our investment in Devyani.\nOur ex special tax rate this quarter was higher than usual at just under 27%, largely due to adjustments recorded in the quarter associated with prior year taxes. Given these adjustments, we now expect our full year tax rate to land between 23% and 24%.\nOverall, given the same strength of our global business, we continue to expect to grow core operating profit in the mid-single-digit range for the full year. As we mentioned on the past 2 quarterly calls, were it not for the loss of Russian profits, we would expect core operating profit growth to be high single digits this year, in line with our long-term growth outlook.\nNow let me share some more detail on unit growth and our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. This quarter, we opened 979 gross new units with encouraging momentum across our brand portfolio. At KFC, we opened 485 gross new units with China, India, the Middle East and Thailand leading the charge. Our Pizza Hut International division saw incredible development progress this quarter, opening 344 gross new units, setting a third quarter development record. This puts Pizza Hut International's year-to-date gross openings at 879 units, which is 280 units ahead of this time last year. China, India and Turkey led Pizza Hut development, with each market adding more than 30 gross new units.\nThe Taco Bell division opened 98 gross new units this quarter, led by strong international development, achieving a Q3 record of over 50 gross new units. For Taco Bell International, I'm excited to share that this quarter, both the India and U.K. markets, joined Spain in the ranks of countries that now exceed 100 units.\nWhile Taco Bell U.S. development remains robust, we expect international development to lead Taco Bell's unit growth this year.\nDespite the uneven macro pressures across our markets, our development remains strong as our franchisees use market disruptions as opportunities to grow. We are partnering closely with our franchisees to navigate challenges in the supply chain and higher construction costs. We are leveraging both our sourcing expertise and scale to secure equipment and realize favorable pricing on key items. Our teams are highly focused on balancing long-term profitability for our franchisees and offering value for our customers. With the power of our well-capitalized and committed franchise system and the unique global scale we have at Yum!, we remain confident in our ability to grow in any economic environment.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities and the 3 pillars of our digital strategy: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. I'll start with an update on our Easy Experiences pillar, which focuses on delivering exceptional customer experiences through technology and dedicated operational programs.\nQSR magazine ranked Taco Bell and KFC in the top 3 for fastest drive-thru times in the U.S. In fact, Taco Bell drive-thru times were 9 seconds faster year-over-year.\nKFC division kiosk sales also stood out this quarter with a more than 40% increase in sales year-over-year and 6% system sales mix, an impressive result considering that only 15% of KFC restaurants currently have kiosks.\nWe are also encouraged that the Tictuk platform is expanding beyond chat ordering with its e-commerce engine, with a front- and back-end website and mobile app that is serving some of our smaller international countries. We recently went live with Tictuk's e-commerce engine in KFC Mexico and saw an increase in conversion rates post launch. We expect Tictuk's e-commerce engine will be live in 18 countries by year-end.\nMoving on to our Easy Operations pillar that centers on the team member and franchise partner experience. We completed the integration of our second delivery aggregator into the Pizza Hut U.S. system this quarter, building on our initiative to partner with third-party aggregators and provide our customers with more options to access our brands.\nFurther adoption of third-party aggregators for delivery as a service has also helped ensure that we can meet customer expectations during peak delivery hours and save valuable time for our team members, who can then spend more time elevating the customer experience.\nAdditionally, the global rollout of Dragontail's smart kitchen management and driver tracking system continues to progress at an impressive rate.\nLastly, I'll cover our Easy Insights pillar, which leverages the power of data and analytics to allow our teams to make smarter decisions. Kvantum, the marketing analytics company we acquired last year, continues to roll out to markets around the world. We are now leveraging Kvantum's media optimization platform across nearly 60 brand-country combinations, covering more than 60% of our system sales. Notably, Pizza Hut Australia has seen a double-digit increase in return on media spend after deploying Kvantum's advanced media mix analytics platform. Our brand teams are also using Kvantum's expanded suite of tools in areas such as customer analytics, pricing optimization and market intelligence.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our net leverage ratio ended the quarter at 5x despite the exclusion of our Russia business. Though capital markets continue to adjust to higher interest rates, we are proud of the work our treasury team has done to put us in the enviable position of having no significant maturities over the next 3 years and approximately 94% of our debt fixed.\nAs we've said before, our capital priorities remain consistent: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and returning the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.\nOur capital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $51 million. Our full year expectation for net capital expenditures is now approximately $200 million, reflecting $50 million in refranchising proceeds and roughly $250 million in gross CapEx.\nWith regard to our share buyback program, we repurchased 1.4 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $116 per share, totaling approximately $157 million.\nAdditionally, during September, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of up to $2 billion through June 30, 2024, that will take effect upon exhaustion of the current authorization.\nTo close, I'm excited about the continued growth we saw this quarter and the momentum in our diversified development across the portfolio. This once again shows that our iconic brands and world-class franchise partners are well positioned to navigate any economic environment.\nBefore wrapping up, I'd like to remind everyone that our Investor Day is taking place in person at the New York Stock Exchange on December 13. We look forward to seeing you then.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands 2022 Second Quarter Earnings Call. My name is Seb, and I will be the operator for your call today. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand the floor over to Jodi Dyer, VP, Investor Relations.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVP of IR, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions. .\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements.

During the second quarter, we completed the transfer of the Pizza Hut business to a local operator who has initiated the process of rebranding to a non-Yum! concept.\nGiven the transfer of Pizza Hut and our progress for the full exit from Russia for KFC, we have elected to remove the Russia business from key performance metrics. Specifically, 1,165 units in Russia and their associated system sales were removed from our total unit count and total system sales, respectively, as of the beginning of the second quarter. This negatively impacted our reported second quarter unit growth by 2 percentage points and our reported system sales growth, excluding foreign currency, by 2 percentage points.\nAdditionally, these units were removed from our same-store sales calculations and thus, do not impact our same-store sales results for the second quarter. However, we continue to include Russia and GAAP measures in the second quarter for Pizza Hut prior to the date of transfer and for KFC for the entire second quarter, including royalty revenue and all expenses to support the business and onetime expenses related to the transfer of ownership of the business.\nAs a result of our decision to exit the Russia business, we have reclassed net operating profits from the operating segment subsequent to the start of the conflict to our corporate and unallocated segment and reflected as a special item within the other income and expense line.

Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. Third quarter earnings will be released on November 2, 2022, with the conference call on the same day.\nFinally, as a reminder, we'll be hosting an in-person Yum! Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. Please stay tuned for more details.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results are a testament to the resilience of our iconic brands and the power of our highly franchised business in this complex operating environment. System sales grew 5% after adjusting for the exclusion of our Russia business, driven by sustained development momentum. We opened 781 gross new units in the quarter with broad-based contributions from each of our brands.\nAdditionally, we delivered positive same-store sales growth while lapping last year's growth of 23%, the strongest quarter of same-store sales growth in Yum!'s history.\nWe're pleased with the continued growth in our digital business with sales of nearly $6 billion, fueled by the adoption of our global platforms and capabilities. Our unmatched global scale and digital capabilities are key differentiators in the restaurant industry, and these competitive advantages enable us to thrive in any environment.\nI'll now share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum China shared on its earnings call last week, COVID-related restrictions continued throughout the quarter, significantly impacting second quarter results. However, trends outside of China remains strong. Our consolidated same-store sales, excluding China, grew 6% for the quarter. Despite a complex consumer landscape in the U.S., Taco Bell U.S. is not yet out of the park with 8% same-store sales growth. The team achieved these results through exceptional execution of a well-balanced marketing agenda that sustained the brand buzz, distinctive product news and compelling value offerings and that was all supported by operational improvements and a focus on elevating the digital experience.\nAdditionally, emerging markets, excluding China, continued to recover to pre-COVID levels, driven by the reopening of dining rooms and growth in our digital business. In fact, same-store sales growth for emerging markets, excluding China, was up 22%, a 4-point acceleration from the prior quarter. We remain confident that we are well positioned to win in this environment given our iconic brands that customers love, strong consumer value proposition, scale advantages, expanded digital access and sophisticated franchise partners with unmatched operating capability.\nBefore I provide an update on our growth drivers, I'd like to share an update on our ongoing process to exit Russia. Last month, we shared that we completed the transfer of ownership of our Pizza Hut business in Russia to a local operator who has initiated the process of rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept.\nAs for our KFC restaurants in Russia, we are in advanced stages of transferring ownership, operating systems and master franchise rights, including the network of franchise restaurants to a local operator who will be responsible for rebranding locations to a non-Yum! concept. Upon the completion of this process, we will have fully exited from Russia.\nOur franchisees and team members in Ukraine continue to demonstrate incredible fortitude through this conflict. And I'm proud to report that nearly all of our stores in Ukraine have reopened to serve the people of Ukraine while ensuring the safety of our team members.\nNow I'll talk about 2 of our growth drivers, our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands, or RED for short, and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll provide an update on our Recipe for Good. Chris will share the details of our second quarter financial results, including an update on our capital strategy before providing an update on our unmatched operating capabilities and bold restaurant development growth driver.\nLet me begin with our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive Brands. Our KFC Division, which accounts for 49% of our operating profit grew system sales 1% this quarter, driven by 3% unit growth and a 1% decline in same-store sales. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia, KFC Division system sales growth was 4%, with 7% unit growth. Continued sales weakness in China contributed to significant year-over-year pressure in the quarter. Excluding China, our same-store sales grew 7%.\nSo China remains difficult to forecast, pressures gradually improved throughout the quarter. However, as Yum China said last week, given the recurrence of COVID outbreaks, the sales recovery will likely be nonlinear and uneven.\nIt's been well noted that many developed markets experienced increasing macro pressures and headwinds to consumer spending this quarter. In addition, the U.S. and U.K. markets faced tough compares due to government stimulus last year. While KFC U.S. face difficult laps from stimulus and the successful launch of the chicken sandwich platform, we're pleased to share that same-store sales growth improved sequentially throughout the quarter.\nHowever, the macro pressures were not felt consistently across all developed markets in our portfolio. For example, Australia grew system sales 7% as same-store sales growth doubled from the prior quarter. This strong demand has followed the introduction of modern menu, which highlights our uniquely craveable products and contemporary value offers.\nTurning to our emerging markets, which delivered remarkable results in the quarter. I'd like to highlight India, the Middle East and Latin America. In India, where system sales grew 103%, the team continued to advance their digital ecosystem and provide consumers with disruptive value offering. System sales grew 41% in the Middle East driven by accelerating digital sales that grew approximately 70% year-over-year even as dine-in sales continue to recover.\nThe launch of Click & Collect functionalities including QR code ordering via the KFC app and several of our Middle East markets helped drive these results. The Latin America market achieved 32% system sales growth, propelled by a well-balanced marketing strategy, including a focus on product innovation and dedication to value offerings while advancing digital capabilities following the launch of the KFC mobile app and kiosks. Our diverse global portfolio is one of the many reasons we have great confidence we're well positioned in the current environment.\nTurning to our Taco Bell Division, which accounts for 36% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, driven by 4% unit growth and 8% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell continues to fire on all cylinders as evidenced by the broad-based strength of its second quarter results. For Taco Bell U.S., system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% same-store sales growth and 2% unit growth. Taco Bell remains a culture leader in the industry, successfully executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to Live Más through innovative marketing campaigns, buzzworthy brand news, distinctive products and strong value offering. Despite significant inflation, Taco Bell maintained restaurant margins by leveraging its pricing power for premium products and craveable LTOs, while still providing consumers with everyday value through a broad range of price points such as those items featured on the Cravings Value Menu.\nThe return of the Mexican Pizza as an LTO this quarter is a prime demonstration of these strengths. Taco Bell's most loyal fans were granted early access, increasing the average loyalty registrations 15x during the 2 days of early access and fueling 10% growth in loyalty members in the quarter.\nDemand for the Mexican Pizza was 7x previous levels, reaching over 20 million pizzas sold nationwide, with some stores selling out within a week, creating a sustained positive halo for the brand. Given the overwhelmingly positive reaction from our customers, we're excited to bring back the Mexican Pizza in the fall, when it will become a permanent fixture on the menu.\nAt Taco Bell International, system sales grew 31%, owing to 27% unit growth and 9% same-store sales growth. 5 of our 7 European markets saw double-digit same-store sales growth, thanks to the balanced execution of everyday value and disruptive value while also continuing to grow brand awareness. Taco Bell International is building on its development momentum and now meaningfully contributes to the division's total unit growth.\nMoving on to the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 15% of our operating profit. Q2 system sales were flat, driven by 4% unit growth and a 3% same-store sales decline. At Pizza Hut International, which represents 8% of our operating profit, system sales grew 3%, led by 7% unit growth and a 2% decline in same-store sales.\nAs I mentioned before, COVID lockdowns in China led to sales softness in the quarter. Excluding China, Pizza Hut International same-store sales grew 6%.\nI'd like to highlight 2 of our leading markets for the quarter, India and Latin America. India system sales grew 79%, a 35-point acceleration from the prior quarter, driven by further recovery in dine-in sales and home meal replacement strength. System sales grew 18% in the Middle East, where the team has successfully executed a balanced strategy of offering everyday value and customized products, with particular success from the My Box offering. My Box offers a compelling entry price point that is well positioned to serve the individual eater and lunch occasion and is now live in nearly 50 markets.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 3%, driven by flat unit growth and a 4% decline in same-store sales, driven in large part by continued operational challenges in our delivery business. We made progress expanding system-wide adoption of third-party delivery as a service to help address our delivery driver capacity constraints to meet consumer demand. As of the end of Q2, approximately 55% of our U.S. locations have implemented delivery as a service, up from 40% at the beginning of the quarter.\nAdditionally, we're leaning into our aggregator partnerships by joining third-party marketplaces, so our consumers can access our craveable food wherever they shop. As of the end of Q2, roughly 70% of eligible stores have opted into using at least 1 aggregator marketplace, up from approximately 45% at the beginning of Q2. Finally, the team shifted promotional focus towards compelling value to address the needs of the consumer.\nLastly, the Habit Burger Grill grew system sales 10%, driven by 15% unit growth and 4% same-store sales decline. During National Burger Month, Habit provided exclusive offers through its mobile app, resulting in a 10% increase in mobile app installed, while also highlighting its culinary-inspired innovation, which included the Spicy Green Beans, a spicy twist on its signature tempura-battered green beans.\nMoving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We continue to see growth of our unrivaled talent with Tarun Lal being named President of KFC U.S. and Shannon Hennessy taking on a new role as President of the Habit Burger Grill. Tarun is a prime example of growth from within, joining our organization 25 years ago and serving in various leadership positions. He is not only a best-in-class operator known for driving breakthrough results, he's also a driver of our culture. I'm confident Tarun's leadership and winning partnership mindset with our franchisees, will be an asset as we drive the next chapter of growth for the KFC U.S. business.\nShannon joined Yum! a few years ago as a KFC Global CFO and immediately hit the ground running. She has a unique ability to work across functions and bring people together to solve problems, drive change and deliver meaningful results for our business. She's also a standout culture leader with a commitment to growing talent and to advancing equity inclusion and belonging.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we recently published our Annual Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report, which highlights our strategic investments in socially responsible growth and stewardship of our people, food and impact on the planet. The report includes updates on our key commitments, including our social purpose and how we've awarded more than $50 million in grants to nearly 30 social impact programs globally. This is accomplished through Yum's! unlocking opportunity initiative, that champions equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurship for frontline restaurant teams and communities around the world. It reinforces our industry-leading commitment to food safety as well as our efforts to respond to customers' evolving preferences and improve the nutritional value of our menu items.\nFinally, the report also highlights our environmental commitments, including our Science Based Targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 as well as a newly harmonized packaging policy across our brands that commits to moving all consumer-facing plastic packaging to be reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025.\nTo wrap up, our performance continues to demonstrate the power of our unmatched global scale in a challenging operating environment. Thanks to the advantages of our unrivaled talent, global development capabilities and expanding technology platforms and capabilities, our iconic brands continue to drive consistent growth. Our best-in-class teams and franchise partners are committed to serving up the most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands in the world.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability growth drivers and our capital strategy.\nI'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial results. Adjusting last year for the exclusion of Russia in our reported results, system sales grew 5%, underpinned by 6% unit growth and 1% same-store sales growth. Despite more severe inflation this quarter, our teams achieved strong performance, demonstrating the resilience of Yum!'s business model.\nAs you may recall, we shared during our last earnings call that Q2 core operating profit growth would look similar to Q1, given continued softness in China, a full quarter impact from lost Russia profits and a headwind from normalized G&A spend in comparison to 2021. I'm pleased to report that we exceeded our previous guidance, with core operating profit down 1% for the quarter, owing to outperformance at the Taco Bell Division. Ex special, general and administrative expenses were $252 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022, consistent with our previous guidance. Despite double-digit labor and commodity inflation in the U.S., Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins of 26% were in line year-over-year and 200 basis points ahead of the pre-COVID Q2 2019 margins. This is a testament to the brand's pricing power and the operational efficiencies the team continues to achieve both contributing to best-in-class unit economics.\nThe FX impact to reported operating profit was $23 million, nearly double our expectations shared on our first quarter earnings call. We now expect the full year FX headwind to reported operating profit to be approximately $70 million to $90 million and expect similar amounts in Q3 and Q4 as those reported in Q2.\nFinally, EPS, excluding special items, was $1.05, a 9% decrease year-over-year. However, there was a $0.13 impact to EPS driven by items that are nonoperating in nature, including higher foreign currency exchange, an increase in our effective tax rate and a decrease in the value of our investment in Devyani International Limited.\nI'm pleased to report that given the strength across our diversified portfolio, we are reiterating our fiscal 2022 guidance that we shared on our first quarter earnings call. As a reminder, other than core operating profit growth due to the removal of Russia profits, we expect to deliver on all parts of the long-term growth algorithm this year. With this impact, we anticipate full year core operating profit growth of mid-single digits.\nAnd as we previously mentioned, that profit growth is weighted to the second half of the year, especially the fourth quarter, largely owing to timing of G&A expense in comparison to 2021.\nNext, I'll discuss our unmatched operating capabilities through the lens of our digital strategy, easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nFirst, I'll provide an update on our efforts to create easy experiences for our customers. This quarter, Taco Bell franchisee, Border Foods, owned and operated by the Engler family, opened one of the most revolutionary restaurant formats in the industry's history, Taco Bell Defy. Taco Bell Defy features one of the most innovative drive-thru experiences yet. It's a first-of-its-kind 2-story restaurant design, featuring a proprietary vertical list to transport iconic, craveable Taco Bell menu items straight from the kitchen to pans. This is on top of unique digital check-in screens for mobile orders that enable a differentiated, fun and seamless experience for consumers.\nTaco Bell Defy boast many features that could show up in future Taco Bell restaurants given it is a hit with consumers and performing well.\nAt KFC Africa, the team doubled kiosk penetration in its store footprint, with significant commitments to further deploy across the majority of the system by year-end. Kiosks served to modernize our assets, improve customer experience and drive greater insights into customer behavior.\nAdditionally, we continue to deploy Tictuk's chat and e-commerce products across our global portfolio and surpassed 2,400 stores in 43 markets this quarter, serving KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.\nEarlier in the year, Pizza Hut Germany launched its new e-commerce website, fully powered by Tictuk. Germany has seen impressive early results, including a 15% increase in conversion rate and a EUR 2 increase in average ticket when compared to previous performance on aggregator platforms in the market. We are seeing similar success stories across the markets where it Tictuk is live.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our efforts to enhance the team member experience as part of our easy operations initiative. Pizza Hut International reached 25 markets using the Dragontail system, bringing global adoption of this platform to 28 markets across both KFC and Pizza Hut brands.\nWe also made significant progress during the quarter in the rollout of digital order pickup shelves, including adding shelves at 100 more Habit Burger Grill stores. Approximately 2/3 of our Habit Burger Grill stores are now equipped with pickup shelves. Taco Bell also has joined our other brands in the U.S. to deploy pickup shelves, which are now fully deployed across company-operated stores with plans to roll out across the rest of the system by early 2023.\nExpanding options and ease for off-premise consumption improves the customer, delivery driver and team member experience.\nFinally, I'll discuss our efforts around easy insights. Our data and analytics experts, along with Kvantum, the AI-based marketing analytics team we acquired last year, continue to scale a Kvantum media optimization tool, while also developing additional AI and machine learning products that drive performance for Yum! and our franchisees. As an example, they are currently partnering with Taco Bell and KFC U.S. to test and deploy an inventory management tool that helps our restaurant managers more accurately forecast food and supplies. The tool is driven by our cutting-edge demand forecasting platform. Based on encouraging early results, we plan to scale this platform throughout the remainder of the year.\nMoving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. We sustained our robust development momentum this quarter. At KFC, we opened over 400 gross new units, reaching nearly 1,000 gross new units opened year-to-date. China, India and the Middle East led development this quarter, each opening more than 40 gross new units. It's worth noting that the year-to-date development pace is attributable to a broad contribution from our emerging markets outside of China.\nAt Pizza Hut, we opened nearly 300 gross new units, leading to over 600 gross new units opened year-to-date. The Pizza Hut Division remains on pace to set another development record this year with significant contributions from India, China and Indonesia.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, Taco Bell International Development outpaced Taco Bell U.S. development, opening 46 net new restaurants in Q2 and 67 year-to-date. For the first time, full year Taco Bell International development is on pace to surpass U.S. development this year.\nOur broad-based development continues to be driven by healthy unit economics, significant white space and our world-class franchise partners who are committed to growth. This global development momentum, coupled with the visibility we have into our development pipeline, gives us line of sight to deliver unit growth within our long-term growth algorithm range of 4% to 5%.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our balance sheet and liquidity position. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $412 million, excluding restricted cash.\nOn April 1, we closed on a new $1 billion, 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. The majority of the proceeds were used to call our $600 million, 7.75% YBI bond due in 2025. We closed the quarter in line with our net leverage target of 5x. We have a well-positioned capital structure and debt guideline for a high inflation environment, considering approximately 94% of our debt is fixed with no significant maturities for the next 3 years.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter, net of refranchising proceeds, were $38 million. Our full year expectation for $250 million in net capital expenditures remains unchanged, now reflecting $65 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $315 million in gross CapEx.\nWith respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares at an average share price of $118 per share, totaling approximately $150 million.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with the resilience of our performance in the quarter. The structural advantages of our globally diversified, highly franchised business model and our unmatched scale uniquely position us to navigate complex and uncertain macro environments with incredible stability. I remain confident that our global portfolio provides investors a high-quality, defensive growth opportunity with visibility into consistent compounding returns.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

My name is Ruby, and I will be your moderator for today's call. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to our host, Jodi Dyer, VP of Investor Relations, to begin.\n\nJodi Dyer\n\nVP of IR and CFO of Digital & Technology, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On our call today are David Gibbs, our CEO; Chris Turner, our CFO; and Dave Russell, our Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller. Following remarks from David and Chris, we'll open the call to questions.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that this conference call includes forward-looking statements that are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements. All forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this announcement and should be considered in conjunction with the cautionary statements in our earnings release and the risk factors included in our filings with the SEC. In addition, please refer to our earnings releases and relevant sections of our filings with the SEC to find disclosures and definitions of non-GAAP financial measures and other metrics that may be used in today's call as well as reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease note that during today's call, all system sales and operating profit results exclude the impact of foreign currency. Additionally, as it relates to our Russia business, our operating results for the first quarter continue to reflect revenues and expenses related to Russia within their historical financial statement line items and operating segments. However, we have reclassed net operating profit attributable to Russia for the month of March that had not yet been redirected to humanitarian efforts as of the end of the quarter from the operating segments in which it was earned to our corporate and unallocated segment. Those operating profits have been reflected within other income/expense and reflected as a special item. David and Chris will provide additional context in their prepared remarks. For more information on our reporting calendar for each market, please visit the Financial Reports section of our website.\nWe are broadcasting this conference call via our website. This call is also being recorded and will be available for playback. Please be advised that if you ask a question, it will be included in both our live conference and in any future use of the recording.\nWe would like to make you aware of upcoming Yum! investor events and the following. Disclosures pertaining to outstanding debt in our restricted group capital structure will be provided at the time of our Form 10-Q filing. Second quarter earnings will be released on August 3, 2022, with a conference call on the same day. Finally, we will be hosting an in-person Yum! Brands Investor Day on Tuesday, December 13, 2022, at the New York Stock Exchange. Stay tuned for more details.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. David Gibbs.\n\nDavid W. Gibbs\n\nCEO & Director, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jodi, and good morning, everyone. Before I go over our first quarter results, I'd like to begin by sharing an update on our business in Russia and Ukraine.\nAs a company that puts people first in every decision, I'm incredibly proud that we have made the safety and well-being of all those impacted by the tragedy in Ukraine as the top priority. I want to personally thank our many dedicated team members and franchisees working hard to navigate through this deadly conflict and manage our business in the most complex and challenging geopolitical environment in recent history. I'm proud of how our people in the surrounding regions have banded together and are doing everything possible to support impacted Ukrainian refugees, team members and franchisees, some of whom have overcome incredible challenges and have reopened a number of stores to serve food in communities where it is safe.\nAdditionally, the Yum! Brands Foundation made a donation to the Red Cross to support those affected by the crisis. We activated the Yum! Disaster Relief Fund to support Ukrainian franchise employees and are matching employee donations to organizations providing relief in Ukraine, including UNICEF, the Red Cross, the World Food Programme and the International Rescue Committee.\nWe previously announced the suspension of all investment and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations. In addition to these actions, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators while, in the interim, we continue to redirect any profits from Russia operations to humanitarian aid. This is not a decision we take lightly, and I know that it will be a complicated process to execute these transactions. We will update you on this process during our second quarter earnings call. Chris will provide more details around the financial impact from Russia on the quarter.\nI'll now discuss our first quarter results, which illustrate the resiliency of our highly franchised diversified growth model. Our first quarter system sales growth of 8%, driven by both unit development and same-store sales growth, is a testament to our iconic brands and the unmatched operating capabilities of our world-class franchise partners. We set a first quarter development record, opening nearly 1,000 gross units, supported by positive unit growth at each of our brands. Our continued same-store sales momentum was fueled by our brands executing our Recipe for Growth strategy by providing relevant value, access via new channels, distinctive products and a strong brand voice, all supported by our digital and delivery capabilities.\nOur digital channels continue to accelerate with digital sales of approximately $6 billion, a new first quarter record, reflecting an increase of 15% year-over-year. Importantly, we set a new digital mix record, now exceeding 40%. In this complex and highly inflationary operating environment, we and our franchisees remain focused on maintaining long-term profitability by leveraging our scale and strategic pricing actions while still offering our customers convenience and value. The many competitive advantages of our unrivaled talent, our sophisticated franchise system and the power of our business model give me great confidence that we are well prepared to navigate these complexities and deliver robust global growth.\nLet me share a few global trends from the quarter. As Yum China shared on its first quarter earnings call last night, COVID-related lockdowns impacted restaurant operations and depressed sales in that market, temporarily delaying an eventual recovery. However, our results outside of China remains strong. In fact, excluding China, both our KFC Division and Pizza Hut International same-store sales were up 10%, which would result in consolidated Yum! same-store sales excluding China of 6% for the quarter.\nWe're pleased with the continued momentum in our developed markets as they lap strong results from last year, and we're excited about the continued resurgence of emerging markets, with same-store sales excluding China of positive 18% for the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the global consumer recovery underpinned by returning consumer mobility, creating a tailwind for our on-premise dining while we sustain our off-premise business.\nNext, I'll discuss 2 of the 4 Recipe for Growth drivers: Our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands or RED for short; and our Unrivaled Culture and Talent. Then I'll discuss the progress we've made on our Recipe for Good.\nTurning to our first growth pillar: our Relevant, Easy and Distinctive brands. Starting with the KFC Division, which represents 51% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 9%, driven by 8% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth.\nTo illustrate the strength of the KFC brand around the world, I thought I'd highlight a few markets that showed meaningful improvement in the quarter, specifically the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. Our Middle East market delivered 40% system sales growth, fueled by robust transaction growth. Our marketing teams led with a healthy balance of new products with the launch of the Messy Burger as well as innovative value-focused flavory items such as the Twister Blaze. These items drove both value perception and new customer acquisition. Additionally, the team's focus on meeting the needs of our customers through digital and off-premise channel growth while the dine-in business bounces back fueled our strong results.\nLatin America is another standout market. This quarter, system sales grew 34%, thanks to our team hitting on all fronts. All countries in the market deployed a balanced marketing calendar focused on value to drive velocity and transaction while taste campaigns continued to build brand strength. This came to life for consumers in January with the Genius Menu value ladder that's helping recover the individual occasion. In March, the Latin American market launched the Kentucky Fried Chicken sandwich for the first time, which drove over 10% growth in the sandwich category.\nAnother market worth highlighting is our Africa business, which has been incredibly resilient as system sales grew 25%. Results were fueled by a continued traffic recovery, leading to transaction growth ahead of pre-COVID levels, a sign our value-driven strategy that offers successful price points resonated well with customers.\nFinally, in the U.S., our KFC team is working hard to maximize convenience for the customer and focusing marketing efforts on creating greater awareness of our off-premise channels, including Quick Pick-up services and our white label delivery offering. The incremental sales layers we've built over the past 2 years, including our digital ordering channels and the chicken sandwich platform, contributed to top line growth this quarter in the face of a difficult operating environment. Additionally, we offered Beyond Fried Chicken in the quarter, which elevated the brand and boosted relevance, resulting in more media impressions than any other product launch in the brand's history. A consistent theme across each of these 4 markets is the continued growth of digital transaction and the ability to execute an omnichannel strategy.\nMoving to the Taco Bell Division, which represents 32% of our operating profit. First quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 5% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. Taco Bell U.S. system sales grew 7%, driven by 2% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth.\nI thought I'd start by celebrating Taco Bell's 60th anniversary as a brand. Given the brand's role as a culture leader in the industry, it's easy to forget its experience and heritage, all of which makes us even more confident in the brand's ability to navigate any economic environment. Taco Bell is executing on its strategy to inspire and enable the world to live más by remaining relevant, easy and distinctive to its customers.\nOn the relevance front, Taco Bell continued to champion customer value with new offerings to meet all occasions, including the introduction of $2 burritos on the new Cravings Value Menu, adding to Taco Bell's existing $1 menu offering. The combination of Taco Bell's new Cravings Value Menu with its box and combo offerings positions Taco Bell well to serve the needs of all customers.\nBeyond value, Taco Bell was actively marketing craveable distinctive foods, from its limited-time crispy chicken wings to the return of our fan favorite Nacho Fries. Additionally, the return to the Super Bowl with Doja Cat marked the distinctive cultural moment in the quarter. We're building on this cultural moment with a long anticipated and much celebrated upcoming return of the Mexican Pizza, which Doja Cat announced in April.\nTaco Bell International system sales grew 37%, driven by 26% unit growth and 12% same-store sales growth. We continue to build brand momentum in multiple markets, including the U.K., Spain and India. Our new strategy to reach scale in a few key markets has driven brand awareness, thereby improving new unit returns that lead to accelerated growth.\nNext, the Pizza Hut Division, which accounts for 18% of our operating profit, saw first quarter system sales grow 3%, driven by 5% unit growth and flat same-store sales growth.\nAt Pizza Hut International, which represents 11% of our operating profit, system sales grew 10%, underpinned by 7% unit growth and 5% same-store sales growth. We opened 283 gross units, setting a Q1 record. With further easing in COVID restrictions, we saw strong contributions from India and Latin America, where system sales were up 44% and 18%, respectively.\nAt Pizza Hut U.S., which represents 7% of our operating profit, system sales declined 6% for the quarter, attributable to a 6% decline in same-store sales and flat unit growth. While consumer demand remains strong, sales softness in the quarter stems from our delivery channel where capacity constraints limited our ability to meet demand. This was driven by staffing challenges, mainly from delivery driver shortages that have been felt across the industry. The team is prioritizing restaurant operations, including a focus on improving staffing levels, restoring operating hours, increasing online ordering availability and more effectively leveraging the use of our overflow call centers.\nAdditionally, in early Q2, we completed the integration of delivery as a service into our point-of-sale system. This is leading to accelerated system adoption, allowing us to leverage third-party aggregators to augment our own delivery drivers. Another action item we're taking is expanding customer access to the Pizza Hut brand via aggregator marketplace. We are excited about the potential incremental growth from aggregator marketplaces based on outperformance we're seeing from existing franchisees using this channel.\nLastly, at The Habit Burger Grill, first quarter system sales grew 17%, driven by 13% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth. To streamline restaurant operations for team members this quarter, we promoted operationally easy to execute customer favorites such as our Patty Melt and the Santa Barbara Charburger. We continued to lean into digital-only promotions and saw a strong response to our delivery and app-only campaigns in the quarter that ultimately drove an increase in app downloads and active app users. Even as consumer mobility improved in the first quarter, our digital sales across multiple channels increased sequentially, continuing to demonstrate the stickiness of these ordering options.\nMoving on to our Unrivaled Culture and Talent growth driver. We kicked off the celebration of our 25th year as a publicly traded company with several powerful forums that galvanized our top talent around engagement and development. For the first time in 5 years, we brought our top 250 leaders from around the world together for our Global Leadership Summit. Our technology leaders at the summit made up the largest functional group, which speaks to the investments we've made in differentiated technology capabilities and growth-oriented functions. We also showcased the progress our brands have made putting our Recipe for Good priorities at the center of our future growth, not only with less carbon and less packaging and waste but also by making equity and inclusion come alive across every aspect of our business, from our talent to our brand marketing to our suppliers and franchisees.\nAdditionally, we were proud to take many of our aspiring leaders to the Women's Foodservice Forum, where our Chief Operating Officer and Chief People Office, Tracy Skeans, serves as chair. It was wonderful to see Yum! so prominently represented in a forum dedicated to growing women in our industry, something truly important to us as we're increasing the number of women in senior leadership globally and are on track to achieve gender parity in leadership by 2025. Finally, a group of our diverse leaders gathered in Washington, D.C. to discuss how we inspire and advance equity, inclusion and belonging across all levels of our organization.\nWhen it comes to our Recipe for Good, we invest in critical work that's focused on our 3 priority areas of people, food and planet. Just last month and as part of our larger climate strategy, Yum! joined the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition global consortium, which was created to accelerate climate action throughout supply chain. Our climate work has started to take shape in markets such as KFC U.K., where they have partnered with the University of Liverpool to develop a road map to achieve net zero carbon and zero waste.\nTo wrap up, this continues to be an incredibly challenging operating environment but my confidence in our future remains high given the resilience of our iconic brands across our global diversified portfolio. Our unmatched global scale provides us unique competitive advantages, including our sophisticated supply chains with cross-brand purchasing power, strong marketing and consumer insights, expanding digital and technology capabilities and our capable, committed and well-capitalized franchisees that are willing to invest in the long-term growth of the business. This quarter's results continue to demonstrate the power and sustainability of our business model while we continue to deliver lasting value for our stakeholders for years to come.\nWith that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our financial results, our Bold Restaurant Development and Unmatched Operating Capability growth drivers, and our solid balance sheet and liquidity position.\nI'll start by discussing our financial results. Our first quarter system sales grew 8%, driven by 6% unit growth and 3% same-store sales growth, reflecting our continued global momentum. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, a Q1 record for Yum!. Core operating profit decreased 5% for the quarter, including a negative impact from Russia of 1%. Ex special, general and administrative expenses were $252 million, tracking in line with our expectations for $1.1 billion of G&A expense for fiscal 2022 and a return to our normal quarterly cadence. Despite inflationary headwinds, we maintained company-owned restaurant margins of approximately 22% at Taco Bell, in line with Q1 2019 pre-COVID margins. Finally, EPS excluding special items was $1.05, representing a 1% decrease year-over-year.\nNext, I'll address the impact to our first quarter results from the Russia conflict in Ukraine. We previously announced the suspension of all investments and restaurant development efforts in Russia as well as operations of company-owned KFC restaurants and that we are finalizing an agreement with our Pizza Hut master franchisee to suspend all restaurant operations in that brand. In addition to these actions, we pledged to redirect profits from operations in Russia to humanitarian aid.\nOur core operating profits in Russia declined versus the first quarter of last year, negatively impacting our Yum! core operating profit growth by 1 percentage point. Finally, as David previously shared, we have begun a process aimed at transferring ownership to local operators. We will plan to provide additional updates on the process on our next earnings call.\nGiven the rapidly evolving operating environment, we wanted to provide our latest thoughts on full year results and the shape of the year. We remain confident in the strength of our business and our ability to achieve our long-term growth algorithm in future years. In 2022, the underlying momentum of the business gives us confidence that we can still deliver on the same-store sales, unit growth and system sales aspects of our long-term growth algorithm. Were it not for the loss of Russia profits, we would deliver on all elements of our long-term growth algorithm in 2022.\nHowever, losing 3% of full year core operating profit from the exclusion of Russia profits puts us outside of our high single-digit core operating profit range this year, with our current forecast closer to mid-single-digit core operating profit growth. With strength in many key markets, continued emerging market recovery and strong development momentum, our teams will continue to strive to overdeliver against our current forecast. We'll keep you updated as the year progresses.\nAs a reminder, given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend in 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect our G&A expense to remain a headwind to Q2 core operating profit growth and a tailwind to second half core operating profit growth. Additionally, we expect continued softness in China and a full quarter impact from the exclusion of Russia profits. Therefore, we now expect Q2 core operating profit trends to be similar to Q1, and we remain on track with our prior expectations for high-teens core operating profit growth in the second half of the year.\nWhile our system sales and operating profit results shared during today's call excluded the impact of foreign currency, we wanted to provide a brief update on the impact in the quarter and the anticipated impact on both our second quarter and full year results. For Q1, our reported operating profit was unfavorably impacted by $14 million due to foreign currency translation. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to reduce second quarter reported operating profit by approximately $12 million to $14 million and reflect a headwind to full year reported operating profit of approximately $30 million to $45 million. This is directional guidance as rates will likely change as we move through the year.\nMoving on to our Bold Restaurant Development growth driver. I'm excited to share that we had another quarter with each of our brands reporting strong positive unit growth. During the quarter, we opened 997 gross units, resulting in 628 net new units, a Q1 development record for Yum!, contributing to 6% unit growth over the last 12 months. We wouldn't be able to achieve these record-breaking results without broad-based contributions from multiple markets across each of our brands.\nIn fact, we had over 500 gross units and 261 net new units opened outside of China, contributing to 5% unit growth in the rest of world year-over-year. Both KFC Division and Pizza Hut International delivered another exceptional development quarter with 587 and 283 gross units opened, respectively. While Yum China continues to be our lead developer, there were significant contributions from each of these brands in India, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America. Taco Bell remains on track for another record development year with growth in next-gen assets in the U.S. and additional markets reaching scale internationally.\nOn that front, we're excited to share that Yum China has committed to expanding the Taco Bell brand, which will allow even more people to live más as we build our brand identity globally and grow our footprint in that market. To that end, we now expect to have 3 more markets to cross the critically important scale threshold of 100 units by the end of 2022, joining Spain, which reached that milestone in 2021.\nThe global development landscape is increasingly complex. But the sophistication, scale and capabilities of our teams and franchisees provide competitive advantages that allowed us to deliver yet another quarter of record unit openings. The visibility into our development pipeline remains strong.\nNow I'll discuss our Unmatched Operating Capability and the 3 key elements we're leaning into: Easy Experiences, Easy Operations and Easy Insights. Before I provide an update across our Easy pillars, I want to comment briefly on our global supply chain. Our supply chain teams continued doing an amazing job building supply chain contingencies and acting as needed to secure product availability, including restaurant equipment, which is necessary for new store openings. Additionally, I'm proud of how our sourcing teams are leveraging our scale and cross-brand purchasing power to help our franchisees and equity stores manage costs in this highly inflationary environment as an important lever in maintaining long-term profitability. This scale combined with our operating experience and learnings from exposure to over 155 markets around the world create a unique competitive advantage for us as we navigate these inflationary pressures.\nStarting with Easy Experiences. With continued reopening trends in markets around the globe, a frictionless experience remains front and center for the consumer. With that in mind, we are constantly adding new convenient ways for our customers to access our brands.\nKFC U.S. and The Habit Burger Grill have made digital ordering even easier. Customers can now order via the app and pick up their food from a specific cubby or shelf within the restaurant. This enables a quicker and more seamless experience that eliminates the need to wait in line at the counter or in the drive-thru. Quick Pick-up is fully deployed across the KFC U.S. system, and roughly 1/3 Of the Habit stores currently have dedicated pickup shelves, with plans to expand more broadly in the coming months.\nIn addition, Taco Bell U.S. recently launched a similar program in their equity stores and will continue to deploy it across their systems more broadly in the coming quarters. Both delivery and early tests of Quick Pick-up continue to free up drive-thru capacity for the Taco Bell system, which helped fuel their ninth consecutive quarter of average drive-thru times under 4 minutes, with a sequential improvement from their fourth quarter drive-thru speed. Internationally, we have exciting projects in early stages, including our KFC Australia business, which is piloting a drone delivery program that gets our finger-licking good products to our customers' home or office in less than 15 minutes on average from when it's ordered.\nNext, I'll move on to Easy Operations, in which we are focused on streamlining operations for our team members and franchisees. We are installing a new kitchen display system and smart hub and leveraging our cloud-based point-of-sale system in our Taco Bell locations with the goal of modernizing the employee experience and providing more digital capabilities within our restaurants. These systems separate out delivery orders from standard drive-thru orders, allowing for improved visibility and execution in the restaurant by our team members. At KFC U.S., we're improving back-of-house operations by expanding our Mobile Manager, a back-of-house suite of applications which simplifies ordering, inventory management and digital order fulfillment, enabling our team members to spend more time focusing on the customer experience.\nPizza Hut continues to make progress putting technology in the hands of its team members through continued global expansion of Dragontail, HutBot and the 360 Coach platforms. Given the driver staffing challenges we're experiencing in the Pizza Hut U.S. business, we're piloting the Dragontail platform in over 100 of our U.S. stores to improve the efficiency of our delivery network. We're excited by the early results, and the platform is working as we hoped given the outstanding performance we've seen in other markets around the world. We're in conversations with our franchisees to expand this cutting-edge platform across the U.S. system.\nThird, I'll discuss Easy Insights, in which we focus on using data and analytics to drive more effective marketing and leverage our insights to enhance the customer and team member experience. At Taco Bell U.S., we continue to experiment with new and innovative ways to engage with our consumers through LTO programs such as the Taco Lover's Pass, which helped fuel growth in loyalty memberships during the quarter and which drove customer frequency.\nKvantum continues to scale its media mix marketing tool, which was recently used in several Pizza Hut International markets to drive incremental sales with a more efficient use of marketing spend. Additionally, we continue to build targeted artificial intelligence and machine learning-based tools, including an exciting new pricing tool that is being piloted in select international markets.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our strong balance sheet and liquidity position. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $365 million excluding restricted cash. On April 1, we called our $600 million 7.75% YBI bonds due in 2025. The repayment was funded by the issuance of a new $1 billion 5.375% YBI bond due in 2032. We were especially pleased with the strong demand and execution in light of the rate environment and volatility in the financial markets. With the recent bond offering, which closed subsequent to the quarter, our consolidated net leverage is roughly in line with our target of 5x. Our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return the remaining excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases.\nCapital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, during the quarter were $18 million. We continue to expect net capital expenditures of approximately $250 million for the full year, reflecting roughly $100 million in refranchising proceeds and up to $350 million of gross CapEx. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 3.4 million shares at an average share price of $121 per share, totaling approximately $407 million.\nIn closing, I'm pleased with the results of the quarter. We opened a record number of units for the first quarter, driving impressive system sales growth. We remain committed to advancing our digital and technology capabilities, leading to enhancements in both the team member and customer experience. And I'm confident in our team's and franchisees' ability to win in a dynamic and complex global landscape.\nWith that, operator, we are ready to take any questions."

Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jody, and good morning, everyone. As we reflect on 2021, I couldn't be prouder of the collective accomplishments of our world-class franchise partners and collaboration of our global teams, guided by our recipe for growth and good. While the last 2 years have been the most challenging operating environment we've ever navigated, we exit 2021 stronger than ever with over 53,000 global restaurants.\nCompared to 2019, we've nearly doubled our digital business. System sales have grown over $5.5 billion, and operating profit has grown over $200 million. Additionally, since 2019, we've added another iconic brand and closed on 3 technology acquisitions. All while launching our global unlocking opportunity initiative with a $100 million commitment over 5 years investing in equity and inclusion, education and entrepreneurial, the cornerstones of our Recipe for Good.\nIn 2021, we opened 3,057 net new units, driven by 4,180 gross unit openings with meaningful contributions from each of our brands, marking the strongest growth year in our history and setting an industry record for unit development. To put that into context, as the world's largest restaurant company, we opened a new restaurant on average every 2 hours. This speaks to the health of our business, iconic brand, capable, committed and well-capitalized franchise partners and strong unit economics. This is yet another significant development milestone on our ongoing growth journey, providing customers with access to our brands through a variety of restaurant formats and on- and off-premise ordering channels.\nNow more than ever, we've leaned into the structural advantages of our diversified global portfolio by leveraging our unmatched global scale, sophisticated supply chains marketing and consumer insights expertise and our growing digital and technology capabilities to fuel growth and deliver strong results.\nEven as dining room sales recovered throughout the year, we continued to grow our digital sales that reached a record $22 billion in fiscal 2021, an increase of approximately 25% over 2020, suggesting a more permanent shift to digital channels. We ended the year with over 45,000 restaurants offering delivery, representing more than a 25% increase year-over-year. We galvanized our digital and technology strategy and accelerated the development of our ecosystem with both internal investments and the closing of the Quantum TikTok and Dragontail acquisition.\nOur teams remain focused on elevating the customer experience, expanding our off-premise capabilities and empowering our team members with tools to make it easier to run our restaurants, all ultimately fueling improved unit economics. Expectations of our customers, team members and franchisees have forever changed due to the experiences over the past 2 years, and we continue to challenge ourselves to exceed their rising bar.\nI'm confident we're poised to lead the industry as we embark on the next chapter of our growth journey. Today, I'll discuss our 2021 results showcasing a few examples across our brands for 2 of the 4 pillars in our Recipe for Growth: our relevant, easy and distinctive brands, or R.E.D. for short; and our unrivaled culture and talent. Then I'll share progress on our recipe for good. Chris will share our fourth quarter results and provide an update on the other 2 pillars of our Recipe for Growth: bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability, as well as an update on our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy.\nTo begin, Full year 2021 system sales grew 13%, with same-store sales growth of 10% or 3% on a 2-year basis and 6% unit growth. Each of our brands recorded positive same-store sales growth for the year and contributed to broad-based development strength. Full year core operating profit increased 18%, driven by same-store sales growth and the impact of unit development throughout the year.\nAs we ended the year, COVID outbreaks and resulting government restrictions, limiting mobility continued to impact sales in a few key markets, primarily in Asia, presenting a headwind to fourth quarter results. However, our sales momentum remained strong with continued global recovery as evidenced by our 2-year global same-store sales, excluding Asia, up 10% on a 2-year basis, accelerating sequentially from last quarter.\nNext, I'll talk about our 4 R.E.D. brands. I'll begin with KFC, which accounts for 52% of our divisional operating profit. KFC full year 2021 system sales grew 16%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 8% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 10% with 5% same-store sales growth or 3% on a 2-year basis. We continue to see ongoing recovery in emerging markets as evidenced by the fact that more than half of our 13 global KFC regions delivered system sales growth in excess of 25% for the full year.\nKFC International Q4 same-store sales grew 6% or 2% on a 2-year basis. Sales remained strong throughout the quarter despite regional impacts from COVID variants with momentum holding in many recovered markets more than offsetting heavily impacted markets, including parts of Asia and Western Europe. Common themes fueling top line growth in the quarter include off-premise and digital capabilities, newsworthy products and a strong value offering.\nKFC U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 4% or 12% on a 2-year basis. Strong top line momentum was fueled by strength in group occasions growth in the digital channel and the success of our chicken sandwich. The chicken sandwich continues to perform well for the business and now makes up roughly 9% of our sales mix as of Q4, and a strong improvement from a 1% mix last year. Our sandwiches are served straight from the fryer and hot to our guests. We expect the chicken sandwich platform to continue to be a significant driver of our positive sales momentum for the business going forward.\nNext, Taco Bell, which accounts for 32% of our divisional operating profit. Before delving into results, I'd like to congratulate the entire Taco Bell system for ranking #1 in the Franchise 500 for the second year in a row, beating our peers as well as impressive concepts in other industries. Entrepreneur magazine, which produces this list recognized Taco Bell for its franchisee collaboration and innovation. This recognition is further evidence of our intentionality to be the world's franchisor of choice.\nNow I'll discuss our results for the year. Taco Bell full year 2021 system sales grew 13%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and 5% unit growth. Fourth quarter system sales grew 11%, with same-store sales growth of 8% or 9% on a 2-year basis, reflecting an acceleration from Q3. Taco Bell kicked off the quarter by introducing the new Cantina Crispy Melt Taco and later in the quarter brought back the Grill Cheese Burrito, featuring a grilled and bubbly blend of real cheddar, mozzarella and pepper jack cheeses. Additionally, the team kept value front and center with the launch of a new crave more value menu featuring the $2 burritos. In addition, we launched a new lineup of coasted breakfast burritos as a way to welcome customers back to our breakfast daypart.\nTaco Bell fans continue to adopt digital ordering channels as we set digital sales records in both the U.S. and international this year. We will continue to bring distinctive products to life through our digital channels with early access to new products, digital-only campaigns and loyalty rewards.\nMoving on to Pizza Hut, which accounts for 16% of our divisional operating profit. Full year 2021 system sales grew 6%, driven by 7% same-store sales growth and 4% unit growth. Q4 system sales grew 4% with same-store sales growth of 3% or 2% on a 2-year basis. Overall, we saw an inflection in the growth trajectory of the Pizza Hut brand this year, a testament to the hard work of our team members and franchise operators and a reflection of the overall health of the system.\nPizza Hut International Q4 same-store sales grew 4%, while same-store sales declined 3% on a 2-year basis. Key markets that contributed strong performance in the quarter included Africa, Canada, India and the U.K. The brand remains focused on emphasizing easy through rate and continued growth in off-premise channels through utilization of both first- and third-party delivery networks.\nPizza U.S. Q4 same-store sales grew 1% or 10% on a 2-year basis. The team continues to bring iconic pizza that customers love to market in relevant and distinctive ways. In the fourth quarter, Pizza Hut received strong recognition for an influencer-based marketing campaign that resulted in Pizza Hut being named a 2021 culture driver by TikTok. Additionally, we brought back a fan favorite, the Triple Treat Box, offering customers a convenient and value-oriented family meal option which drove sales in the quarter.\nLastly, the Habit Burger Grill achieved full year 2021 system sales growth of 24%, driven by a 16% same-store sales growth and 11% unit growth. Q4 system sales increased 20% with 11% same-store sales growth or 5% on a 2-year basis. To showcase their chef-inspired innovations, the Habit Burger Grill reintroduced the Chicken Caprese Sandwich on garlic chabada bread with garlic Ole during the quarter. As dining rooms have reopened over the course of the year, have team members welcome customers back into the restaurants while continuing to serve customers through their digital and off-premise channels.\nNow I'll discuss our unrivaled culture and talent growth driver. The hallmark of Yum! is our people-first culture, which drives retention and recruitment of amazing talent. We remain committed to growing our talent from within and recruiting top external talent, as you've seen from some of our recent internal promotions and leadership transitions. This past quarter, we were excited to welcome former NIKE Executive, Sean Tresbon, to serve as Taco Bell Chief Brand Officer; while former Nintendo Executive, Nick Chavez, joined KFC U.S. as Chief Marketing Officer.\nPast 2 years have allowed us to build a strong foundation centered on our culture, talent and unwavering relationships with our franchisees. The collaboration with our franchisees has never been more powerful as we're aligned more than ever on the future growth trajectory of the business. Finally, I want to give an update on our Recipe for Good and the work we're doing around our 3 priority pillars: planet, food and people.\nWhen it comes to our planet pillar, 2021 was a milestone year. We announced science-based targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions nearly 50% by 2030 and and pledged to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. We are expanding our foundational requirements for green building standards for new unit builds and advancing our corporate office and company-owned restaurant footprint to renewable energy.\nIn terms of our food, we remain focused on food safety and listening and responding to customers' evolving preferences and improving the nutritional value of our menu items. We continue to introduce relevant and distinctive plant-based offerings from KFC's national launch of Beyond Fried Chicken in the U.S., the Pizza Hut offering beyond Italian Sausage Crumble in Canada.\nFinally, on the people front, we're committed to investing in Yum!'s social purpose focused on unlocking opportunities for our people and communities while championing equity, inclusion and belonging across all aspects of our business. Just last week, we announced the Yum! Franchise Accelerator, a groundbreaking partnership with the University of Louisville and Howard University to train and advance underrepresented minorities and women interested in building a career in the restaurant industry. Not only is this a priority for Yum!, but unlocking opportunity remains a focus for our brands as well with the recent launch of the Taco Bell business school.\nAs a result of our elevated commitments and transparent disclosures, we've received notable recognition this quarter, including being named the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America for the fifth consecutive year and being named on Newsweek's ranking of America's most responsible companies. I'm incredibly proud of our Recipe for Good and know that this work is more important than ever when it comes to building resilient and relevant brands for the future.\nAs I take a moment to reflect on the past 2 years, I'm extremely proud and grateful for the significant accomplishments and collaboration across our teams to both serve our customers and community while fueling growth for our franchisees and shareholders. We're entering 2022, which marks Yum! 25th anniversary with confidence in our recipe for growth and good strategies, and I'm energized for what lies ahead.\nI'm certain we'll continue to build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest-growing restaurant brands while delivering lasting value for our stakeholders. With that, Chris, over to you.\n\nChristopher Lee Turner\n\nCFO, Yum! Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, David, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss our fourth quarter financial results, bold restaurant development and unmatched operating capability as well as our strong balance sheet position and capital allocation strategy. I'll begin by discussing our financial results.\nWe finished the year strong opening a record-breaking 4,180 gross units or 3,057 net new units, resulting in 6% unit growth for full year 2021, a robust 10% same-store sales growth helped us achieve 13% system sales growth, driving full year core operating profit growth of 18%. That is a tremendous outcome given the inflation, labor, supply chain and consumer mobility challenges our brands faced in the back half of the year, particularly in Q4.\nQ4 results also reflects impressive performance. System sales grew 9%, led by same-store sales growth of 5% or 4% on a 2-year basis, accelerating from Q3. Strong underlying profit growth was masked by elevated G&A levels owing to higher incentive compensation as a result of our strong full year results, and the normalization of Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins in the quarter as previously signaled. We anticipate quarterly variability in our company-owned restaurant margins as we remain focused on balancing relative value for our customers while protecting margins in the long run.\nTo that end, full year 2021 Taco Bell company-owned restaurant margins were in line with our historical range of 23% to 24%, virtually unchanged relative to 2019 levels. This demonstrates our ability to drive strong top line results while managing profitability in an inflationary environment. Our Q4 ex special EPS was impacted by 2 items: First, we recorded a $35 million pretax gain on our investment in Debyani International Limited; second, we had a higher-than-normal tax rate for the quarter due to a tax reserve related to a prior year filing position that was changed. And so our Q4 results were in line with our internal expectations and culminated in full year results that exceeded all elements of our long-term growth algorithm.\nMoving on to our bold restaurant development growth driver. We opened 1,678 gross units in the quarter or 1,259 on a net new unit basis, resulting in nearly 4,200 gross units opened for the full year, which is a record for Yum! and the restaurant industry. That equates to over 100,000 jobs created worldwide last year alone. We're able to achieve these record-breaking openings thanks to contributions from each of our 4 brands and incredible franchisees around the globe.\nChina continues to be the biggest developer However, we continue to see broad-based strength across our portfolio, evidenced by over 2,500 restaurants opened outside of China this year. In fact, we saw new restaurants built in over 110 countries this year a step-up from prior years, signaling our development engine is diversified and stronger than ever.\nAt KFC, the brand delivered a record development year led by significant contributions from China, India and Russia. Overall, KFC International opened over 2,400 gross units and nearly 2,000 net new units during 2021. At KFC U.S., after several years of same-store sales growth and strengthening unit economics, we have a much stronger foundation now on which to grow in the future as evidenced by the inflection point in development with the system moving to positive unit growth in 2021.\nTaco Bell reported a strong development year in both the U.S. and international. In the U.S., Taco Bell reached an impressive milestone, ending the year with over 7,000 restaurants and ample white space for future development.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Taco Bell celebrated MOS international expansion as Spain was the first market to surpass 100 units. We believe this development threshold unlocks accelerated growth, fueled by the benefits of scale, including supply chain advantages as well as marketing and brand awareness. We're confident in what the future holds for Taco Bell International, particularly as scale ties directly to profitability.\nPizza Hut International delivered a record year in development with all international business units reporting net positive growth led by China and India. Continued improvement in unit economics and a more HMR-focused footprint are drivers of the broad-based unit growth. Pizza Hut U.S. continues to make progress on its development journey and is poised for future growth, thanks to improved unit economics at a healthy franchise base.\nFinally, the Habit Burger Grill restarted their development engine this year with 23 net new units. Our brands are entering 2022 from a position of strength with plans to continue exceptional growth owing to our world-class operators and franchise partners. We're confident in our future growth engine given our broad-based strength, improved unit economics and the visibility we have into our development pipeline.\nI want to say a huge thank you to our development teams and franchise partners for all the hard work it takes to open nearly 4,200 restaurants in a single year, let alone a year with ongoing COVID and supply chain-related challenges.\nNext, I'll talk about our unmatched operating capability growth driver. We remain focused on leveraging our digital and technology strategy to elevate both customer and team member experiences by leaning in on 3 key elements: easy experiences, easy operations and easy insights.\nStarting with easy experiences, we expanded our digital ordering channels, including chat ordering via TikTok to nearly 2,000 stores at year-end, an increase of roughly 60% since our acquisition in the first quarter. We also saw digital sales at KFC U.S. grew approximately 70% year-over-year, fueled by our delivery service channel and e-commerce platform that launched nationwide in early 2021.\nWe continue to invest in technology platforms focused on delivering a frictionless experience for our guests, including the launch of quick pickup at KFC U.S. in the fourth quarter that allows guests to bypass the drive-thru and grab their digital orders from (inaudible) inside the restaurant. The outstanding sales growth across our digital channels is evidence that our customers continue to expect and opt for easy access to our brands.\nNow moving on to easy operations, which are focused on making it easier for our team members to run the business and ensure a superior customer experience. I want to highlight the exceptional operating performance of our brands, starting with Taco Bell, whose team members were unwavering in their commitment to deliver a superior customer experience. In 2021, Taco Bell's drive-thru times were 2 seconds faster year-over-year, and the fourth quarter marked the eighth consecutive quarter of an average drive-thru time under 4 minutes. This truly is an impressive performance considering labor availability challenges.\nAdditionally, the Dragontail order and delivery platform is now live in 2,800 stores in 21 markets across KFC and Pizza Hut, up from 13 markets last quarter and 9 markets from the end of 2020. Dragontail allows us to tap into the power of artificial intelligence to streamline the end-to-end food preparation process and optimize delivery routes for drivers.\nAt Pizza Hut International, we continued deploying HutBot, our intelligent cooking app, designed to enhance both the team member and customer experience by digitizing routines and insights into operational efficiencies. When HutBot is deployed and used effectively, it's proven to increase customer satisfaction scores. We ended the year with HutBot live in over 6,000 Pizza Hut locations in 70 markets.\nTo round out our technology strategy, our easy insights platform provides us with invaluable knowledge about our consumers, enabling us to enhance the customer relationship. When we acquired Quantum, a leading AI-based consumer insights and marketing performance analytics business, in the first quarter, it was operating in 13 markets. We have since tripled Quantum's footprint to over 45 markets.\nWe will continue to prioritize initiatives that lead to incremental sales growth and improved unit economics for our franchisees. The impressive adoption rates of these technology platforms are evidence of our franchisees' confidence in the investments we made to advance our digital and technology ecosystem this year. We're confident these investments have created a meaningful competitive advantage and will be a point of differentiation for Yum! as we serve the elevated expectations of customers.\nNow for an update on our strong balance sheet position and our capital allocation strategy. We ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $486 million, excluding restricted cash. We closed the year temporarily below our net leverage target of 5x as a result of our strong earnings growth. Capital expenditures, net of refranchising proceeds, were $55 million during the quarter and $145 million for the full year.\nThe full year consisted of $230 million in gross CapEx and $85 million in refranchising proceeds. We paid a healthy quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share or approximately $600 million for the full year. With respect to our share buyback program, during the quarter, we repurchased 5.6 million shares at an average share price of $128 totaling $720 million. For the full year, we have repurchased 13 million shares at an average price of $122 totaling $1.6 billion.\nAs we look to 2022, our capital priorities remain unchanged: invest in the business, maintain a healthy balance sheet, pay a competitive dividend and return excess cash to shareholders via share repurchases. We remain committed to maintaining our asset-light business model of at least a 98% franchise mix. Going forward, we expect strong returns from our equity store investments to continue. And like our franchisees, see attractive opportunities to invest in unit development.\nCapitalizing on these opportunities we expect net capital expenditures for full year 2022 to be approximately $250 million, reflecting up to $350 million of gross CapEx and $100 million of refranchising proceeds. In the long run, we expect our refranchising proceeds to offset our new store investments as they have in the past. But in the near term, new store investments may exceed refranchising by $50 million to $100 million annually, primarily driven by our strategy to accelerate growth of the habit equity estate. We were pleased to announce earlier this week an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 14% to $0.57 per share in 2022. The recovery of our business in 2021 and proven resilience of our free cash flow supported this increase, reflecting a 2-year double-digit CAGR, in line with our historical earnings growth and dividend increases.\nI'd like to wrap up by providing color on the shape of 2022. I'm pleased to share that we expect to deliver full year growth in line with our long-term growth algorithm, which includes 2% to 3% same-store sales growth and 4% to 5% unit growth, culminating in mid- to high single-digit system sales growth leading to high single-digit core operating profit growth, which excludes FX. Reflecting on 2021 results, we had several quarterly drivers that created lumpiness in the shape of the year creating noise in our year-over-year lapse in 2022.\nWe expect our full year G&A to be approximately $1.1 billion but our G&A spend will return to a more balanced quarterly cadence relative to 2021. Given the shape of our anticipated G&A spend throughout 2022 in comparison to 2021, we expect G&A to be a headwind to operating profit growth in the first half and a tailwind to growth in the second half of 2022. Due primarily to these timing factors related to G&A, we are expecting roughly flat core operating profit growth in the first half and high teens core operating growth in the second half, culminating in full year high single-digit core operating profit growth in line with our long-term road map growth.\nFinally, on our 2022 effective tax rate, although it's difficult to forecast with precision at this time, we continue to believe 21% to 23% is the appropriate range. But there are factors that could move us toward the high end of the range. We'll continue to provide updates as appropriate. Overall, I couldn't be prouder of the results for the year.\nLooking forward to 2022, I'm confident we're poised to take share and deliver on our long-term growth algorithm driven by our expanding competitive advantages tied to our unmatched global scale, investments in our digital ecosystem and world-class franchise partners. I'm looking forward to the year ahead and the continued success of our iconic global brands while delivering consistent earnings growth for shareholders. With that, operator, we're ready to take any questions."

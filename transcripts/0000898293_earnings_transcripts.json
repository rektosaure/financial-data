[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to -- your host, Adam Berry Barry. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. This is also Jabil's Annual Investor Briefing. I'm Adam Berry, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs. This is an important day for us at Jabil, and we appreciate your continued interest in our company.\nOur investor briefing is always one of the highlights of our calendar. It's our opportunity to step back from the quarter-to-quarter rhythm and give you a deeper look at how we're shaping the business, how we're allocating capital, and how we're positioning Jabil for sustainable long-term growth.\nBefore we dive in, I need to cover a quick but important point. Some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding our financial guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2026 and our future business outlook.\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our expectations. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Now let me set the stage for what we'll cover today.\nYou're going to hear from a number of our leaders across the organization. Each of our -- we'll begin with Greg Hebard, our Chief Financial Officer, who will walk through our fiscal 2025 results and share the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2026. Greg will also frame how we think about the balance sheet free cash flow and capital allocation.\nNext, Steve Borges will cover regulated industries. This is a critical part of our business, encompassing health care, automotive and transportation, and renewable and energy infrastructure. These are markets where quality and trust are nonnegotiable, and Steve will share both the near-term realities and the long-term opportunities.\nAfter Steve, you'll hear from Matt Crowley, who leads intelligent infrastructure. This is our fastest-growing segment and the growth is being fueled by unprecedented demand for AI-related systems from semiconductor capital equipment to racks servers and advanced cooling solutions. Matt will explain how Jabil is positioned to capture this wave of growth with system-level integration that very few companies can deliver.\nFollowing Matt, Andy Priestley will take us through Connected Living and digital commerce. This is a segment in transition as we deliberately move away from lower-margin legacy consumer programs and strengthen our position in automation and advanced technologies. Andy will share how this pivot is improving the quality of earnings today and positioning Jabil for long-term opportunity in robotics, warehouse automation and next-generation connected devices.\nFinally, we'll conclude with our CEO, Mike Dastoor with help from EVP of Operations, Fred McCoy, and Chief Supply Chain and Procurement Officer, Fred McCoy. Mike and team will bring it all together by describing how our portfolio strategy, capital allocation discipline and culture of execution position Jabil to thrive in an evolving market. You'll also hear from Mike about the priorities that guide us, serving our customers with precision, driving sustainable earnings growth and returning significant value to shareholders.\nAll in, we expect today to give you a clear, transparent picture of how Jabil is positioned not just for fiscal 2026 but for the years ahead. With that, let's get started. It's my pleasure to introduce our Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard.\n\nGregory B. Hebard\n\nCFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin this morning with our Q4 results. For the fourth quarter, our team delivered strong performance, reaching approximately $8.3 billion in revenue, which exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by roughly $800 million. This better-than-expected growth was broad-based as all 3 segments came in higher than anticipated.\nDriven by strong underlying revenue growth, core operating income for the quarter came in at $519 million, well above the high end of our expected range. Our core operating margin was 6.3% of revenue, representing a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year. Net interest expense for Q4 was $65 million.\nOn a GAAP basis, operating income totaled $337 million and diluted earnings per share came in at $1.99. Core diluted earnings per share was $3.29. Moving on to our segment performance for Q4. Regulated Industries revenue was $3.1 billion, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated growth. Health care was in line while renewable and energy infrastructure and automotive and transportation, both exceeded expectations, supported by incentive-related demand pull forward and stronger volumes across core programs.\nOn a year-over-year basis, revenue increased approximately 3% and core operating margin expanded by 40 basis points to 6.5% driven by a better mix. Turning to intelligent infrastructure, where revenue for Q4 was $3.7 billion, $400 million above expectations. The upside was driven primarily by 3 factors within cloud and data center.\nFirst, we reached efficiency faster than planned for more than 700 new employees hired and trained as we move multiple sites to 24/7 operations in Q3, which lifted shipments. Second, we benefited from a more favorable mix versus Q3, leading to higher average selling prices. And third, in storage, we ramped our second hyperscaler faster than expected and saw stronger-than-anticipated end-of-quarter demand from traditional storage customers.\nCore operating margin for this segment was 5.9%. In Connected Living and Digital Commerce, revenue totaled $1.4 billion, coming in slightly ahead of our outlook from 90 days ago. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined approximately 14%, primarily due to softness in consumer-driven products. This was partially offset by continued growth in warehouse and retail automation.\nCore operating margin for this segment was 6.6% in Q4, up 210 basis points year-over-year. The increase reflects cost actions taken earlier in the year and a deliberate shift towards higher-margin programs and markets within the segment. Let's move to our cash flow and balance sheet metrics.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, inventory ended at 69 days, a 5-day improvement last quarter. Including inventory deposits, net inventory days were 55, down 4 days sequentially. This working capital discipline supported strong cash generation with cash from operations of $588 million in the quarter and $1.64 billion for the year.\nNet CapEx expenditures were $83 million in Q4 and $322 million for the full year or 1.1% of revenue. Full year adjusted free cash flow came in very strong at more than $1.3 billion. We exited the fiscal year with a healthy balance sheet with debt to core EBITDA of 1.3x, cash balances of approximately $1.9 billion.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed our prior $1 billion share repurchase authorization, consistent with our framework to return 80% of annual adjusted free cash flow to shareholders. With that, let's now turn to our capital structure.\nWe ended FY '25 with $4 billion of unused capacity under our global credit facilities. Including that capacity and our year-end cash balance Total available liquidity exceeded $5.9 billion. Our debt and liquidity position remains strong and well structured. Maturities are appropriately staggered and carry attractive interest rates.\nImportantly, we remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. Let's now turn to capital allocation and return to shareholders. Since FY '13, we've reduced our shares outstanding from $203 million to $107 million in FY '25, a 47% decline driven by our disciplined share repurchase strategy. Over that period, we've repurchased 136 million shares at an average price of approximately $52 contributing to total shareholder returns of $7.7 billion, including both dividends and buybacks.\nAs a reminder, in July, our Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, giving us continued flexibility to return capital thoughtfully and opportunistically, we intend to fully execute the current opposition in fiscal '26. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our Q1 FY '26 guidance. Beginning with revenue by segment.\nFor Q1, we anticipate regulated industries revenue will be $3.05 billion, up 3% year-on-year as we expect some of the dynamics that benefited Q4 particularly in automotive and renewables to carry into the early part of the first quarter. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect strong growth to continue with revenue for the quarter to be $3.67 billion, up approximately 47% year-over-year. We expect this increase to be driven by sustained broad-based AI-related growth in cloud data center infrastructure and capital equipment markets.\nIn our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.29 billion, down 16% year-on-year. This reflects continued softness in consumer-centric products, offset slightly by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets. It's important to note that some of the year-on-year decline is intentional as we focus on strengthening the quality of the portfolio by exiting or pruning lower-margin programs and remixing the segment toward more durable growth opportunities.\nPutting it all together at the enterprise level, total company revenue for Q1 is expected to be in the range of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion. Core operating income for Q1 is estimated to be in the range of $400 million to $460 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $263 million to $343 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.47 to $2.87.\nGAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.84. Net interest expense for the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $64 million. And for the year, we expect to be in the range of $240 million to $250 million. Our core tax rate for Q1 and for the year is expected to be 21%, consistent with FY '25.\nIn summary, turning to the next slide. FY '25 was marked by disciplined execution. We sharpened the portfolio, improved business mix, delivered strong margins and converted that execution into strong free cash flow. These results highlight the strength of our diversified model and the alignment of our business with secular growth drivers. We enter fiscal '26 to well positioned to continue delivering growth, margin expansion and robust free cash flow. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven D. Borges\n\nExecutive Vice President & CEO-Healthcare, Jabil, Inc.\n\nHello. I'm Steve Borges, and I lead Jabil's regulated industry segment. This segment spans 3 major areas: automotive and transportation, health care and renewables and energy infrastructure. Each of these markets are undergoing significant transformation. And our engineering led teams are deeply engaged in helping customers navigate that change with speed, precision and a focus on long-term value.\nLet's start with automotive and transportation. This industry is emerging from a global market correction. And while near-term growth in battery electric vehicles has slowed, the long-term outlook remains strong. Regulatory shifts, changing incentives and trade pressures, particularly around Chinese EVs and U.S. tariffs are reshaping OEM strategies.\nCustomers continue to design platforms that can be leveraged across their entire portfolio versus being specific to an EV, hybrid or ICE vehicle. As such, and throughout the softness in automotive, Jabil continues to add new customers in vehicle-agnostic programs, helping to bring more stability to the business. We are leaning into technologies that will define industry's future, software-defined vehicles, advanced driver assistance systems, compute, and other powertrain agnostic solutions are all growth areas.\nJabil continues to bring collaborations, like the one we announced recently with ABL to co-develop designs and manufacturing solutions for the automotive and transportation market. Beyond specific collaborations, our automotive teams continue to strengthen partnerships through execution and capability expansion. That combination of technical know-how and trusted relationships positions as well as this market continues its transformation.\nTurning to health care. We see an equally dynamic environment shaped by innovation, demographics and patient needs. Connected Care continues to create new markets, enabling care and delivery in ways that are more accessible and more personal. Virtualized medicine is driving improved outcomes for chronic diseases, while new care settings from hospitals to the home are broadening opportunities [Audio Gap] our scale, quality systems and engineering expertise allows us to provide comprehensive solutions that are difficult for others to replicate.\nOur acquisition of PII has brought us into the CDMO space. And our sterilization initiative is opening doors with new customers. We're also advancing our capabilities in minimally invasive devices, medical device reprocessing and injectables, including GLP-1s and biologics, which remain a key area of focus.\nWe remain committed to expanding our capabilities, whether through M&A or organic growth. We are unlocking new markets, creating more value for our customers and further differentiating Jabil in a competitive landscape. In short, Jabil is helping health care innovators bring life-changing solutions to patients faster, more reliably and at scale.\nFinally, in renewables and energy infrastructure, the macro picture is dynamic. Global electricity demand is projected to increase by as much as 70% by 2040, driven in large part by the growth of data centers and industrial use. Meanwhile, interest rates, tariffs, and policy changes are reshaping near-term demand in areas like solar and energy storage. Even with these shifts, we've been able to support our customers without disruption, including complex product transfers. Despite the headwinds, renewables remain the fastest-growing and lowest-cost source of new energy.\nSolar continues to be the largest driver of growth worldwide, while energy storage systems and grid modernization are increasingly critical to balancing supply and demand. Here again, Jabil is leaning into complexity, supporting customers with design and manufacturing capabilities that extend from inverters to battery modules to smart grid technologies. We're also embedding ourselves deeper into building infrastructure.\nWe're rising demand for HVAC systems, especially for data centers and the increasing need for modern security and access control solutions present strong opportunities. Across these markets, our ability to combine engineering depth with global manufacturing scale gives us a distinctive edge. To sum it up, in automotive and transportation, health care and renewables and energy infrastructure, our strategy is thoughtful and deliberate. We build capabilities that matter. We deliver with speed and quality and stay ahead of what's next. This is how we're helping customers solve complex challenges in regulated environments, while driving long-term growth and value for Jabil and our shareholders. Thank you.\n\nMark T. Mondello\n\nChief Executive Officer & Director, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. for those who haven't met, I'm [Audio Gap] -- markets that sit at the heart of today's technology transformation. Capital equipment, cloud and data center infrastructure and networking and communications, AI and advanced compute are driving one of the most profound infrastructure build-outs in decades.\nAt the same time, our customers are demanding speed, resiliency and cost efficiency and how they scale. Our role is clear: to be the trusted engineering-led manufacturing partner that helps our customers scale faster integrate more seamlessly and deploy new platforms with confidence and what differentiates ecosystem, not just a single piece of the puzzle, but the combination of compute, storage, networking, power, cooling and the tools that make all of this possible.\nLet me start with cloud and data center infrastructure. This is where the acceleration of AI workloads is most visible. The largest global platforms are redesigning servers, racks and data center architectures around liquid cooling, next-generation processors and unprecedented bandwidth demand. Instead of supplying individual parts, we're integrating full racks into one deliverable system. That's [Audio Gap] The capacity that is perfectly built for liquid cool drag.\nThat gives our customers not only scale but also the regional diversification they're asking for. Another critical piece of our data center strategy technologies and integrating them into our data center platforms and power is just as important as cooling. We're expanding into low and medium volt switch gear, PDUs and UPS systems, integrating them directly into RAC and data center designs, this allows us to deliver a truly end-to-end solution in one integrated system.\nTurning to capital equipment. This is the technology that underpins the entire semiconductor industry from wafer fabrication to automated test equipment, the capital equipment market is where the building blocks of AI infrastructure are creating Here, our strategy is to move closer to the chamber to the most critical parts of the tool or precision, quality and reliability matter most.\nWe're working with leading equipment makers to expand our role in our power technologies. By doing this, we become more embedded in our customers' platforms, which makes us harder to replace and more valuable over time. We're also investing in geographic expansion Southeast Asia, so that when our customers expand capacity, we're already there to support them.\nThe same thermal management automation and precision manufacturing techniques we use in semiconductor tools are being leveraged in data center and networking applications. That's the power of having a portfolio that spans multiple interconnected ones. Here, our strategy is anchored in liquid cooled switching and system-level integration. The explosive growth of AI workloads is driving unprecedented bandwidth requirements.\nAnd traditional air cooled networking year is no longer sufficient. We're investing in liquid cooled switch technology, integrating it with compute, power and thermal solutions to deliver complete rack level systems. This is a space where Jabil is uniquely positioned because we're not just supplying a switch. We're engineering the entire system around it. And we continue to focus on our silicon photonics business where we've developed advanced packaging capabilities to support the ongoing [Audio Gap].\nthe optics and our strategic focus remains at the system level, where all elements of the RAC architecture are converting. So let me bring it all together. Our customers are no longer looking at servers, racks or switches in isolation. They're designing entire systems that must work together seamlessly.\nAnd Jabil is positioned uniquely to deliver that. By operating across capital equipment, data center infrastructure and networking, we bring insights and capabilities from each domain into the others creating leverage that few competitors can match, by executing flawlessly for our existing partners and continuing to invest in differentiated capabilities, we're laying the foundation not only for today's demand but for the data center and network.\n\nAndrew D. Priestley\n\nExecutive Vice President of Global Business Units\n\nHello. I'm Andy Priestley, and I lead Jabil's connected living and digital commerce segment. This segment is built around 2 major areas: consumer devices and digital commerce and robotics. Together, they represent the best and dynamic mix of technologies -- start with digital commerce and robotics, where the pace of change is past us.\nThis part of our business includes retail automation e-commerce, robotics and AI-driven systems that are being fueled by powerful mega trends. Across the supply chain, full scale automation has taken hold from lights-out warehouses to autonomous last mile delivery, physical retail is being reimagined through smart shelf labels, connectivity and robotics, turning stores into digital assets that support omnichannel experiences.\nPayment technologies are also evolving fintech and biometrics are transforming how transactions happen, particularly in small and medium-sized markets where contactless and custom point-of-sale solutions are becoming the norm.\nTurning to automated retail. This market segment is growing very quickly, driven by demand for speed, convenience and self-service in areas such as autonomous vending and [indiscernible] kitchens. Lastly, robotics and AI are both advancing quickly. Gen AI and large language models are enabling robots even humanoid to learn from existing models and images, making them more adaptable, capable and widespread.\nAt Jabil, we're investing in engineering and design expertise that allows us to support the most complex and demanding technologies in the market. From computer vision and high-speed automation to complex assembly we're enabling the next generation of intelligent systems. These strengths are also opening doors in nonnegotiable. The shift towards more complex, higher-value technologies is driving margin expansion and positioning Jabil as a key [Audio Gap] as a just producing systems but partnering with customers to solve labor challenges, improve performance and [Audio Gap].\nOur scale and expertise allows us to support the largest players in this industry as they navigate today's challenges and beyond. On the consumer device side, we're focused on products that enhance everyday life from small and major appliances to home comfort and outdoor living. Consumers want smarter, more connected products enabled by AI, machine learning and IoT.\nWireless power, energy efficiency and intuitive interfaces are becoming standard. At the same time, there's a growing appetite for creating experiences at home, bringing indoor comfort outboards and elevating how people live. Safety and security is becoming a critical pillar of our future success. Our work in commercial drones and vision systems continues to support safer environment and a more enjoyable experience.\nWe're extremely proud of the innovation happening in these areas. While segment revenues show a slight year-over-year decline, the underlying story. [Audio Gap] Amerson Robotics. Over time, we will concentrate our consumer device business in areas where our engineering debt provide margin accretive opportunities with premium brands. It's also very important to note that our consumer business remains a vital driver of [Audio Gap] such as automation, AI and robotics.\nConnected Living and Digital Commerce segment has been playing a major role in our geographic mix shift since [Audio Gap] , and we value its role in the larger ecosystem.\nTo summarize, the Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment is evolving quickly. We're enabling smarter systems, more connected experiences and helping our partners stay ahead of the curve. That's how Jabil is creating value today while building the foundation for long-term growth. In closing, I'd like to thank the extended team for what has been an exceptional year. This team has delivered record performance and won multiple new programs with new and existing customers. Thank you.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As you heard from the group today, fiscal 2025 was a great year for Jabil. Operating margins grew core EPS and generate strong free cash flow and extremely strong return on invested capital. Upon taking a closer look, the dynamics varied by end market.\nIn regulated industries, automotive and renewable space pressure. In shop contrast, Intelligent Infrastructure was a growth engine as AI-related demand accelerated across capital equipment, data center and networking. And in Connected Living and digital commerce, we continue to rationalize the portfolio and execute a deliberate mix shift, deemphasizing lower-margin legacy consumer programs while strengthening our position in advanced warehouse and retail automation.\nSo stepping back, FY '25 demonstrated 2 things a while. Brazilian, where automotive and renewables slowed, AI-driven demand more than offset where consumer categories soften, CLDC expanded margins through portfolio pruning. And across the enterprise, free cash flow came in extremely strong. The effective integration of 5 key pillars.\nFirst, our long-tenured team and culture of operational execution, Around the world, teams deliver with safety, quality and accountability in a complex environment that consistency is difference between promises and performance, building and delivering products where they're consumed. In today's environment of tariffs, policy shifts and supply chain complexity this is proving to be a clear competitive advantage.\nOur geographic mix has also transformed. In FY '18, we were heavily weighted towards Asia. By FY '25, our revenue profile is more balanced, resilient and flexible. Two factors drove the shift. The FY '24 divestiture of our Mobility business which reduced concentration and free resources for higher growth opportunities and the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure in the U.S., which raised our Americas share of revenue from 25% in FY '18 to 46% in FY '25.\nThis improved balance highlights the strength of Jabil's strategy, building capabilities everywhere to serve customers wherever they operate. Third, scale rationalization and diversification. Hundreds of customers across a number of end markets trust us with mission-critical programs. That diversification provides both stability and optionality as technologies converge and market manage ships.\nToday, as we continue to scale in AI-related growth areas, rationalized part of our portfolio, particularly in CLDC and diversify further within customers and end markets. The same strengths have well positioned Jabil to keep delivering through various cycles. Fourth, supply chain orchestration. We managed one of the world's most complex supply chains with over 38,000 global suppliers and over 700,000 unique parts, which enables us to help customers redesign biller materials, qualify new suppliers and secure continuity.\nThat capability matters most when markets are tight or trade policy shared. And finally, our last pillar is automation and AI inside our factories. As programs move into higher cost regions, competitiveness depends not just on labor cost, but also on labor availability and the concentration of skilled workers in certain areas.\nTo address this, we embed robotics, predictive maintenance, automated optical inspection and scheduling optimization, to name a few, across our operations. These tools improve quality, accelerate ramps and reduce cost. With more than 30 sites in the U.S., our footprint here has never been larger. At this time, I would like to invite Fred to discuss how we are leveraging AI and automation throughout our factory network followed by Frank, who will share insights into how advanced AI tools are enabling and optimizing our supply chains.\n\nFrederic E. McCoy\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Electronics Manufacturing Services\n\nThanks, Mike. I'm Fred McCoy, and I lead Jabil's global operations. At Jabil, we're building the future of manufacturing, where intelligent automation, AI-driven processes and a fully connected ecosystem empower our people to deliver value to customers and elevate our performance. The reality is that we've been using AI and operations for years.\nOn our production lines, we deployed several thousand proprietary cameras with embedded AI computer vision models for in-line quality inspections, and we optimize our equipment utilization across our network. By connecting our more than 400 -- to categorize and optimize downtime, attrition and yield loss, which helps us self-correct and improve efficiency and make faster decisions on the manufacturing floor.\nThis means problems can be solved in place without interrupting production and teams have more confidence in the data behind their decisions. Simultaneously, automation is expanding rapidly across our network. Today, we have more than 25,000 robots in production and a team of over 2,000 trained automation engineers and technicians. They design, build and maintain solutions ranging from simple robotic arms to complex high-speed systems.\nFor mid-volume production, our proprietary figure as products change, lowering costs and accelerating deployment. We've also developed and are deploying a blueprint for material automate [Audio Gap] these solutions improve safety, provide real-time material traceability and eliminate millions in manual handling costs.\nAcross the industry and at Jabil, investment in AI and automation is accelerating. Our job is to embrace these technologies, partner with customers and suppliers and industrialize them at scale across our facilities. The future of our factories will bring even more collaboration between people and machines and our employees will focus on higher-value tasks that drive quality, safety and innovation that sets Jabil apart in the marketplace.\nI'll now pass it off to Frank to talk about the work we're doing in embedding AI into our procurement and supply chain processes.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\n5 Thank you, Fred. Hello. My name is Frank McCoy, and I lead Jabil's global procurement and supply chain operations. At Jabil, we are integrating AI into every layer of our supply chain to make it smarter and more resilient. Our vision is an autonomous supply chain, built in an AI technology stack that combines machine learning agent. Our supply and provides customers with a secure window into their supply chain by connecting real-time data across our ecosystem, we can break down silos, run simulations and act quickly on the most important insights.\nAI-powered dashboards and intelligent alerts help us prioritize issues as they arise real time. Whether that means Freight performance. The platform is also evolving with an AI-driven road map that includes new capabilities, management and advanced tariff analytics. These features will build on the intelligent dashboards and [indiscernible] that are already in place, giving our teams and our customers even greater resiliency, transparency and speed to action.\nWe also use the iron ore proprietary procurement intelligence platform, which brings together billions of data points from millions of power houses and suppliers. With this data, we can benchmark costs on sourcing scenarios and negotiate with much greater speed than ever before. And in one particular case, we were just a sourcing cycle from 2 weeks to 1 day across hundreds of thousands of parts, freeing up our teams to focus on far more strategic efforts.\nThrough IDA Global, our joint venture with ciphered a native AI SaaS provider, we're advancing even for. with Cipher self-learning AI to autonomously manage. Together, these tools are reshaping our procurement and supply chain management watch at Jabil by embedding AI into our operations, we're improving agility, transparency, and efficiency of setting a new standard for overall supply chain performance. I'd now like to pass it back off to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Frank. As you just heard from the team, the 5 pillars are not abstract. They shape how we operate in highly regulated markets, how we capture AI growth in intelligent infrastructure and how we're reshaping CODC per margin and durability. With that, I'd now like to walk you through the dynamics across ADAS segments for FY '26.\nI'll begin with regulated industries. Think of regulated industries as the place for reliability, compliance and quality are nonnegotiable. The near-term picture is mixed but the long-term teams are positive. I'll start with the headwinds are most visible in the short term. While EV adoption is strong in China in both the U.S. and Europe, demand has slowed, at intensifying competition among automakers is affecting customer market share and influencing technology strategies.\nThese dynamics will weigh on FY '26. As a result, we believe our auto and transport end market will decline by 5%. Even so, there is reason for optimism. The long-term trends remain promising as BEV still represents the fastest-growing powertrain. This, in addition to the adoption of software-defined vehicles and ADAS is increasing the content per vehicle.\nThe team is deeply embedded with leading OEMs on the technologies that are expected to define the industry's future, compute modules, advanced driver assistance systems, and other powertrain agnostic solutions are all growth areas as we support our customers' next-generation vehicles.\nAnd in renewables, and energy infrastructure over the last years, we have helped customers rebalance portfolios, localized supply chains and diversify across commercial and residential projects. These actions improve resilience now and position us for upside as economics, interest rates and demand improve. Said differently, we have done the blocking and tackling to be ready when demand improves.\nBy contrast, we believe health care outsourcing is entering a growth phase. Growth in FY '26 is expected to be led by drug delivery systems, including GLP-1 auto injectors and on-body monitoring such as continuous glucose monitors. Although these programs have long incubation lead times, they are sticky for customers valuable for patients and margin accretive for Jabil.\nIt's worth noting health care with a healthy pipeline of new business awarded is expected to be an important contributor to our path towards 6% core operating margins. Putting the segment together in FY '26, we expect regulated industries to be flat on revenue with margin expansion as health care growth helps offset automotive and renewables. If regulated industries is about trust and durability, intelligent infrastructure is about velocity.\nOur strategy here is clear within at the system level. Instead of treating servers, racks, switches, power and cooling as separate silos, we design and deliver integrated systems that combine compute, networking, power distribution and advanced cooling that integration short time to deploy and low total cost for customers exactly what they need as AI capacity scales.\nYou can see the strategy at work across the 3 end markets in this segment. In capital equipment, we're moving closer to the chamber with RF power [indiscernible] delivery and sensors, capabilities at the heart of semiconductor tools that manufacture AI cars. As AI continues to drive demand for more large memory and system on chip designs, we expect demand for automated test equipment to remain strong for the foreseeable future.\nAs we said today, we expect another strong year with 16% revenue growth year-over-year. And in cloud and data center infrastructure, we operate at rack scale, designing and delivering complete systems with advanced liquid cooling and integrated power spanning low- and medium-voltage switchgear and other solutions that enable power delivery from grid to chip and thermal management from chip to the outside.\nAnd in networking and communications, we are scaling liquid cold switching today while preparing for the eventual shift to co-packaged optics as industry standards mature. In the meantime, pluggable optics remain the backbone and we continue to build those platforms. Strength in networking is expected to be offset with continued softness in the 5G infrastructure market.\nPutting it all together for the II segment, Jabil's engineering-led system-level capabilities extend across multiple interconnected markets in the AI space. That reach enable us to transfer technologies and connect these markets seamlessly and it's this integration that stands out as a key differentiator, placing us right at the center of the AI ecosystem.\nIn FY '24, our AI-related revenues to approximately $5 billion, rising to approximately $9 billion in FY '25 as we brought on additional capacity in the U.S. Looking ahead, we expect AI-related revenue to grow by roughly 25% in FY '26, reaching about $11.2 billion. It's worth noting that demand continues to be extremely strong, as evidenced by our recent performance.\nHowever, it's also worth noting that we're now bumping up against capacity in the U.S. As you may recall, in June, we announced a new facility in North Carolina to address these capacity constraints. We believe, this new state of the art side is set to come online in the summer of 2026 and will serve as a showcase for Jabil's AI rack manufacturing capabilities and will be designed from day 1 with key part capabilities like NVIDIA Omniverse and endeavors power and cooling solutions, which positions us very well to meet future demand with greater agility and expertise.\nOnce operational, we expect the site to empower us to sustain robust double-digit growth in AI-related revenue in fiscal '27 and beyond. For FY '26, overall, we expect Intelligent Infrastructure revenue to grow 18% with double-digit contributions from cloud and data center and from capital equipment.\nSegment margins should remain consistent with Jabil's overall level in the mid-5% range. Turning now to our CLDC segment, which is in the midst of a planned transition and the logic is straightforward. On one hand, we are pruning lower margin short life cycle programs in legacy consumer electronics that [indiscernible] the margin profile we desire.\nOn the other hand, we're investing with growth and margin stronger, like digital commerce, where automation has become essential for customers to accelerate the delivery of products to and from putamen centers and physical stores. We design, manufacture and scale robotics, warehouse automation systems and physical AI platforms, helping customers move from pilot to global deployments with speed and confidence. Over time, we expect our early engagement in humanoid will be another option for growth and diversification.\nIn Connected Living, the pivot is towards advanced technologies, wireless power, human machine interfaces and connectivity platforms. We pay these technologies to realize manufacturing in Mexico Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia to shorten supply chains and reduce tariff exposure. The anticipated result is a smaller yet healthier business with better earnings quality.\nFor FY '26, we expect CLDC revenue declined about 13%. So what does all this mean for the enterprise level? Yes, the FY '26 outlook. Collectively, our portfolio remains balanced and well positioned for sustainable value creation. For FY '26, we expect approximately 5% revenue growth to about $31.3 billion.\nWe expect core operating margin to expand by roughly 20 basis points to around 5.6% in spite of the underutilized capacity in multiple geographies. Core earnings per share is expected to be $11 in FY '26, and we anticipate free cash flow to be greater than $1.3 billion.\nMoving on to capital allocation. Our priorities are straightforward. First, we'll invest organically in the highest return areas such as AI infrastructure, health care and advanced warehouse and retail automation. Second, we pursue acquisitions that build capability and where it makes sense, step into higher-value markets where we bring something distinctive to customers.\nOur M&A philosophy is simple. 1 plus 1 must equal 3. Third, over time, we expect to return about 80% of free cash flow to shareholders through a mix of buybacks and dividends while maintaining a strong, flexible balance sheet. The filter is simple. Every dollar must raise returns, build resilience or both.\nLooking beyond FY '26, here is the long-term model. Stepping past the next 4 quarters, our focus is unchanged. We target 6% plus core operating margins and north of $1.5 billion in adjusted free cash flow over time. How do we get there? Three levels: first, better mix leaning into health care, AI and digital commerce, where our system-level capabilities can be leveraged best. Second, better execution, embedding automation, AI and robotics in our operations to raise quality and speed while lowering cost; third, better capacity utilization across our global network. So every site contributes more often.\nIn short, better mix, better execution, better asset terms. Before I close the word to our people. Strategy is only as strong as the team that runs it. In Asia, the Americas and Europe, I see the same hallmarks as I visit Jabil sites, a commitment to safety, respect, culture and belonging, execution and customer focus. Thank you for what you do every day for our customers and communities.\nLet me by answering a straightforward question. Why do I feel Jabil is uniquely positioned for continued success. Let me bring it back to where I began. FY '25 demonstrated the strength of our diversified resilient portfolio and our ability to successfully navigate a complex and dynamic tariff environment even as market conditions shifted and geopolitical uncertainty increased. Our competitive edge is clear, system-level engineering expertise, robust regionalized manufacturing footprint and global scale, world-class supply chain management and a culture that executes.\nWe are powering the bill out of AI infrastructure, operating with precision in regulated markets, automating digital commerce and building capabilities on merit for the future, all while consistently returning the vast majority of cash flow to shareholders. Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Adam.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. As we wrap up our prepared remarks and before we move into Q&A, let me leave you with 5 key takeaways from today's discussion. First, fiscal 2025, we believe, proved out the strength of Able's diversified model. Second, regulated industries highlights both resilience and long-term opportunity. Third, intelligent infrastructure continues to be our growth engine. Fourth, our deliberate portfolio shift in Connected Living and digital commerce is paying off. And fifth, capital allocation remains disciplined and consistent.\nOn behalf of the entire leadership team, thank you for spending the time with us today. We appreciate your engagement, your feedback and your continued interest in Jabil. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Conference Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard; and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Dastoor. Please note that today's presentation is being live streamed.\nAnd during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides.

In addition, we will be making forward-looking statements during this presentation, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fiscal year net revenue and earnings.\nThese statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, and other filings with the SEC.\nJabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to hand the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory B. Hebard\n\nCFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance, which at the enterprise level came in well above our expectations across revenue, core operating income and core earnings per share. In the quarter, we saw significant upside in our Intelligent Infrastructure business, led by the segment's AI-related revenue. At the same time, our Regulated and CLDC segments came in largely as planned. The environment remains dynamic, but our performance this quarter demonstrates the strength of our operating model and our ability to deliver consistent results even as conditions shift. Let's walk through the details for the quarter.\nFor Q3, the team delivered $7.8 billion in net revenue, up an impressive 16% year-over-year and $800 million above the midpoint of the guidance range we gave in March. Upside strength in revenue was primarily driven by cloud and data center infrastructure.\nAdditionally, it's worth noting both our capital equipment and Connected Living end markets also saw higher-than-expected demand in the quarter. Given all this strength, core operating income for the quarter came in solidly above our range at $420 million.\nCore operating margins were at 5.4%, a 20 basis point improvement year-over-year. Net interest expense in Q3 was $66 million. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $403 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.03. Core diluted earnings per share for Q3 was $2.55, up 35% compared to Q3 of last year. Turning now to our performance by segment in the quarter. Our Regulated Industries reported revenue of $3.1 billion, roughly in line with our expectations and flat year-over-year.\nThis reflects ongoing softness in the EV and renewable end markets, partially offset by growth in our health care business. Core operating margin for the segment was 5.5%, up 70 basis points sequentially. However, this is down 50 basis points year-over-year as EVs and renewables remain below normalized levels of profitability.\nIn the Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we saw revenue of $3.4 billion, up approximately 51% year-on-year and well ahead of our expectations for the third quarter. This growth continues to be driven by sustained strong demand in our AI-related cloud and data center infrastructure business, including power, cooling and server rack solutions.\nCapital equipment was also strong in the quarter as the need for testing gear remains robust. This growth was offset slightly by lower demand in our networking and communications end market due to softer 5G demand. Core operating margin for the segment was 5.3%.\nIn our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, slightly higher than what we thought 90 days ago. On a year-over-year basis, this segment was down approximately 7%. This is mainly reflecting softness in consumer-driven products, offset by growth in areas such as warehouse and retail automation.\nCore operating margins for this segment came in at 5.3% in Q3, up 210 basis points year-over-year, reflecting both the benefits from the restructuring actions taken earlier this year to reduce costs as well as the changing mix of business within this segment.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics for the end of Q3. Inventory days decreased sequentially by 6 days to 74 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 59, an improvement of 2 days sequentially and within our targeted range.\nIn Q3, cash flow from operations was strong at $406 million. Net capital expenditures for the third quarter were $80 million. As a result of this solid performance, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at $326 million, bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $813 million.\nWith our results through 3 quarters, we are well on track to generate over $1.2 billion in free cash flow for the year. We exited the third quarter with a healthy balance sheet with debt-to-core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4x and cash balances of approximately $1.5 billion. In Q3, we repurchased $339 million of our shares. We're on track to complete our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization in Q4.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide for our Q4 FY '25 guidance. Beginning with revenue by segment, we anticipate revenue for Regulated Industries will be $2.9 billion, down 5% year-on-year as we maintain a prudent near-term outlook on the EV and renewable markets. We are also closely monitoring potential impacts, positive or negative, arising from the impending legislation in the U.S. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect strong growth to continue with the revenue for the quarter to be $3.3 billion, up approximately 42% year-over-year.\nWe expect this increase to be driven by sustained broad-based AI-related growth in cloud, data center infrastructure and capital equipment markets. In our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.3 billion, down 21% year-on-year, reflecting continued softness in consumer-centric products, offset slightly by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets.\nPutting it all together at the enterprise level, total company revenue for Q4 is expected to be in the range of $7.1 billion to $7.8 billion. Core operating income for Q4 is estimated to be in the range of $428 million to $488 million.\nGAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $331 million to $411 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.64 to $3.04. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.79 to $2.37.\nNet interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $65 million. Our core tax rate for Q4 and for the full year is expected to remain at 21%.\nIn closing, the Jabil team's execution thus far in FY '25 amid heightened geopolitical uncertainty has been tremendous. Our ability to execute effectively is a testament to the strength of our diversified portfolio and our strategic alignment with high-growth secular trends such as AI and industrial automation. This resilience not only reinforces our competitive position, but also sets the stage in the coming years for continued revenue expansion, margin enhancement and robust free cash flow generation. With that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by acknowledging the tremendous work of our global team. Their consistent execution in a complex environment is the driving force, kind of performance and our ability to deliver for our customers. The dedication I see across the organization is remarkable. And I am grateful for their efforts, our dedication, which is fundamental to our strategy, especially as we navigate the evolving geopolitical landscape. .\nToday, most of our manufacturing has migrated local for local and region for region. This focus on manufacturing, mainly in region has continued to play out well for us, particularly in today's geopolitical environment. And furthermore, I continue to see our global and growing U.S. footprint as a significant competitive advantage.\nOur ability to offer customers diverse, resilient and localized manufacturing solutions has become more valuable than ever. Being a U.S. domiciled company with deep experience across 30 countries allows us to partner with customers to navigate issues like potential tariffs and supply chain complexities, a capability, I believe, is unmatched in the industry.\nNow turning to our performance in the quarter. As Greg detailed, our third quarter results are very strong, reflecting higher-than-expected growth in cloud and data center infrastructure, capital equipment and connected living end markets. At the same time, health care, automotive, digital commerce and networking and communications were largely in line with our expectations from March.\nAs a result, the team delivered $7.8 billion in revenue, 5.4% core operating margins and $2.55 in core diluted earnings per share, up 35% from Q3 last year. As I contextualize these strong results with our year-to-date performance and projected FY '25 revenue by end market, several key points become evident.\nFirst, our Intelligent Infrastructure segment continues to stand out as it remains squarely at the epicenter of the AI revolution. Demand for AI hardware is not slowing down. If anything, it's accelerating the need for complex server and rack integration, advanced networking and innovative power and coaling solutions is surging. Our holistic approach to the data center, our deep engineering and design architecture collaboration and our ability to execute complex high-volume production at scale makes us a good partner for the world's leading hyperscalers and silicon providers.\nOur teams are executing with urgency ramping capacity, optimizing supply chains and staying ahead of customer needs, whether it's racks, photonics, advanced networking or storage, we're delivering. Given this momentum, we now project our AI-related revenue will reach approximately $8.5 billion this fiscal year, a 50%-plus increase year-on-year. And to support this growth, I'm excited to share that this morning, we announced we will be opening a new site in the Southeastern U.S. to help fulfill the ongoing increase in AI data center infrastructure demand.\nAs part of this plan, we expect to invest approximately $500 million over the next several years to expand our U.S. footprint as we remain focused on supporting cloud and AI data center infrastructure customers. With the addition of this new factory, we will now operate more than 30 sites across the United States. This investment is a significant commitment, and there are a few things to keep in mind.\nWe're in the final stages of site selection now, and we expect the facility to be operational by mid-calendar year 2026. This site will further enable our design architecture and large-scale manufacturing capabilities in high complexity AI racks with increased power requirements and infrastructure without liquid cooling. We fully anticipate that this new site will help diversify our revenue growth in the AI hyperscale space. We do not expect this investment to change our outlook for our annual CapEx spend, which currently stands at 1.5% to 2% of revenue.\nAnd finally, it is important to highlight that as the new site is projected to come online towards the end of FY '26, we do not expect it to have a material impact on our financial results until FY '27. Another area of exciting growth in '25 and beyond is digital commerce. The team continues to drive innovation in retail and logistics, helping a diverse set of customers automate everything from the warehouse to the aisle and checkout.\nAs we've discussed before, labor dynamics and fulfillment speed are driving structural investment here and our solutions are resonating with customers. As we look further down the road, we see a long runway ahead as robotics, automation and even humanizes become central to the future of day-to-day life.\nTurning to regulated industries where trends have been more mixed. As expected, EV and renewable energy markets in the U.S. remain soft. Moving forward, we continue to monitor the potential impact of the impending U.S. legislation on these end markets. We're managing these potential headwinds with discipline staying close to our customers and continue to focus on markets with accretive long-term margin potential. Health care, on the other hand, remains a bright spot. We are focusing on higher value segments such as drug delivery devices, diagnostic equipment and pharma solutions, where our PII acquisition is already opening new doors. We continue to believe this business will be a margin and cash flow contributor over the long term as we continue to add vertical capabilities in various areas of this end market.\nWith that, let's move to our updated outlook for the full year. We are raising our revenue guidance for fiscal 2025 to approximately $29 billion while we believe core operating margins will be in the range of 5.4%.\nAs a result, we now expect to deliver core diluted earnings per share of $9.33 for the year. And importantly, we expect to generate in excess of $1.2 billion in adjusted free cash flow. As we close out fiscal 2025, it's worth noting that our diversification strategy continues to aid our results as the demand profile of the end markets we serve are considerably dynamic.\nFor instance, despite persistent weakness in EVs, renewables and 5G, we're approaching record levels of core EPS. Looking ahead, we remain focused on enhancing core margins, optimizing cash flow and returning value to shareholders, primarily through share repurchases and targeted investments in higher-margin opportunities.\nThis focus, together with our disciplined financial approach creates a favorable setup for sustained value creation in the coming years. To close, I want to thank the Jabil team for their outstanding contributions and our investors for their continued confidence in our strategy. I am incredibly optimistic about the future we're building together. I will now turn the call back over to Adam.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. Before moving into Q&A, I'd like to quickly summarize our key messages from today's call. First, Jabil delivered strong Q3 results with core EPS above the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by an outstanding performance in intelligent infrastructure. And we provided Q4 guidance that reflects continued robust momentum in AI and data center markets, balanced with a prudent assumption for other areas. Second, we announced further U.S. investments in our AI and data center footprint, which will position us well for future growth.\nAnd finally, Jabil remains exceptionally well positioned due to our diversified portfolio, its manufacturing and engineering capabilities and a clear strategy focused on profitable growth and shareholder returns. To that end, I'm pleased to share that we'll be hosting our eighth annual virtual investor briefing in late September.\nDuring that briefing, we intend to provide a comprehensive full year outlook. This will include our customary commentary on the markets we serve, our growth priorities and our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Specifically, we will outline our expectations for fiscal year 2026 across core operating margins, core EPS and adjusted free cash flow. I remain incredibly optimistic about the future we're building, and we look forward to sharing our plan with you at that time. Thank you. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

Hebard\n\nCFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join our call today. I'm extremely pleased with our strong Q2 results, where the team delivered solid margins and cash flows on $6.7 billion in revenue. When excluding approximately $250 million associated with the divested Mobility business in the prior year quarter, revenue increased 3% year-on-year.\nCore operating income for the quarter came in at $334 million. Core operating margins came in at 5%. Net interest expense in Q2 came in at $6 million. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $245 million. our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.94.\nTurning now to our performance by segment in the quarter. Our Regulated Industries segment reported revenue of roughly $2.7 billion as guided. On a year-over-year basis, this represents a decrease of 8% due to expected weakness in our renewable energy and EV markets. Despite this, core operating margin segment increased year-over-year by 20 basis to 4.8% based on favorable mix in the segment.\nIn the Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we saw revenue of $2.6 billion, up 18% year-on-year, above what we expected in December. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in our AI-related cloud, data center infrastructure and capital equipment markets. The core operating margin for the segment was 5.3%, a 110 basis point improvement compared to our prior year quarter.\nIn our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, down 13% year-on-year due to our Mobility divestiture. Excluding revenue associated with the divested Mobility business from the prior year, revenue growth for the segment was approximately 4%. This reflects strong year-on-year growth across our digital commerce and warehouse automation markets, which was partly offset by weaker demand in consumer-driven connected living products.\nOn a sequential basis, segment revenue was down 13%, which is consistent with the historical seasonality typically observed in the connected living sector following the holiday period. Core operating margins for the segment came in at 4.5% in Q2.\nNext, I'll provide an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics for the end of Q2, starting with inventory. As anticipated, during the quarter, inventory days increased 4 days sequentially to 80 days, which reflects typical seasonality in our business. However, on a year-on-year basis, inventory days decreased 7 days.\nNet of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 61, a quarter-on-quarter increase of 5 days, which is slightly above our targeted range of 55 to 60 days. This was mainly due to -- within our Intelligent Infrastructure segment as we support strong growth. As we progress through the fiscal year, we anticipate that inventory days will normalize into our targeted range.\nIn Q2, cash flow from operations for the quarter were solid, amounting to $334 million. Net capital expenditures for the second quarter were $73 million. For the full year, we fully continue to expect net CapEx to be between 1.5% to 2% of revenue.\nAs a result of the solid second quarter performance and cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at $261 million, bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $487 million. We expect free cash flow for the year to exceed $1.2 billion. We exited the second quarter with a healthy balance sheet, with debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4x and cash balances of approximately $1.6 billion.\nIn Q2, we repurchased 2.5 million shares. The quarter ended with $364 million remaining on our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization, which we expect to complete by the end of FY '25.\nBefore I move on to guidance for the next quarter, I'd like to wrap up my remarks on Q2 by recognizing the Jabil team's strong execution this quarter. The team's effort have yielded strong results through the first half of FY '25 despite a highly dynamic environment. The company continues to show remarkable resilience and is poised for future revenue growth, improve margins and robust free cash flow generation.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide for Q3 FY '25 guidance. Beginning with revenue by segment. We anticipate revenue for our Regulated Industries will be $3 billion, down approximately 1% year-on-year, reflecting appropriate caution in the EV market.\nFor our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect revenue for the quarter to be $2.8 billion, up approximately 22% year-over-year on broad-based growth across our capital equipment, advanced networking, cloud and data center infrastructure markets. This strength is expected to be slightly offset by lower demand in our 5G end market.\nIn our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.2 billion. This is down 16% year-over-year mainly due to weaker year-on-year demand in our connected living markets, offset slightly by continued growth across the digital commerce space. Total company revenue for Q3 is expected to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.3 billion.\nCore operating income for Q3 is estimated to be in the range of $348 million to $408 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $282 million to $352 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.08 and to $2.48. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.99. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately $61 million.\nFor FY '25, we now expect it will be in the range of $240 million to $245 million. Our core tax rate for Q3 and for the year is expected to be 21%.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Greg, and good morning to all those joining our call today. To begin, I'd like to take a moment to thank our incredible team here at Jabil for their commitment, dedication and hard work in a particularly dynamic operating environment. As the world continues to evolve, so does this team, always striving to ensure Jabil solutions and our customer supply chains remain nimble, agile and resilient. Thank you.\nSpeaking of nimble, agile and resilient. Next, I'd like to touch on a topic that remains top of mind for customers, shareholders and employees alike, potential tariffs. Consistent with my comments in December, we placed considerable value on maintaining a large scalable manufacturing footprint.\nAnd as the geopolitical situation continues to evolve, our ability to adapt, combined with our designation as a U.S.-domiciled manufacturing service provider and our significant U.S. footprint, is becoming increasingly important for our customers. And in my opinion, Jabil is among the best positioned companies in the world to help customers navigate these complexities.\nAs a reminder, while tariffs may impact end customer demand, any changes in tariff costs are a pass-through cost for Jabil. Since our last call in December, tariff expectations have broadened to now include China, Canada and Mexico, along with the -- tariffs.\nAddressing each of these for starters, most of our business in China is predominantly local or local to regional, with a very small portion of our revenue generated from that region being U.S. pound. We had extremely limited exposure to Canada. And in Mexico, 80% to 90% of our business today is USMCA compliant.\nWhile implementation mechanics of reciprocal tariffs are unknown, [indiscernible] does level the playing field for manufacturing as hardware still needs to be built somewhere. Once again, I feel Jabil is well positioned to help customers navigate these complexities.\nAnd finally, with 30 sites in the U.S., our manufacturing footprint here has never been bigger than it is today. And while I do feel there could be some challenges to overcome -- labor, our investments and experience in tried and tested automation lines and robotics will certainly help expedite any lift and ship transfers. I personally feel there is no company better positioned than us in manufacturing in the U.S.\nMoving on to our results. As highlighted by Greg, our second quarter results were quite strong, driven by better-than-expected growth in capital equipment, cloud and data center infrastructure and digital commerce. At the same time, health care, automotive, renewables and connected living were all in line with our expectations from 90 days ago.\nAs a result, the team delivered approximately $6.7 billion in revenue, 5% core margins and $1.94 in core earnings per share, up $0.26 from Q2 of last year.\nAs I review these results in context with our updated outlook for the balance of the year, a few things stand out to me. First, our strong year-to-date results underscore resilience and strength of our diversified portfolio where certain end markets like capital equipment and data center infrastructure continue to outperform, while some areas of our business like EVs and renewables continue to warrant caution.\nWe now believe our Intelligent Infrastructure business is well positioned to deliver a 15% growth in FY '25 on a reported basis and approximately 27%, excluding the legacy networking business we exited at the end of FY '24. With this updated outlook, AI-associated business is now expected to represent approximately $7.5 billion in revenue this fiscal year as demand for servers, REX, photonics, advanced networking gear, storage and testing equipment all continue to climb higher during the quarter. This represents an approximate 40% year-on-year increase for AI-related revenue.\nContrary to market peers, the deployment of GPU intimated racks and liquid cooling data centers continues to accelerate. Our strategy to lead with design architecture and engineering allows us to keep pace with the accelerated development cycles with higher yields at launch. We can now transition from older computer architecture to GPU-led system-level design and hardware production at scale, which has been critical in establishing Jabil as a trusted partner for data center and infrastructure buildouts.\nAs we look to future growth in this space, I'm particularly excited about our expansion opportunity in India. During the quarter, we announced our plans to expand in Gujarat to support of photonics capabilities. Over the longer term, we expect Jabil to play a significant role domestically in India as the combination of domestic demand and infrastructure, young workforce and a business-friendly environment continue to support the manufacturing of advanced technologies and products, including sovereign data center build-outs that are in very initial stages.\nAnd secondly, digital commerce with our Connected Living & Digital Commerce segment is expected to increase by 14% in FY '25, as the team continues to help several customers drive automation in retail and digital commerce, be it in the warehouse, in the aisle or a checkout.\nAnd in Healthcare, I would like to welcome the team from our exciting acquisition of U.S.-based Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. This acquisition, completed in early February, allows us to better serve our pharmaceutical and health care customers in aseptic filling and dry oral dosage, which opens up a $20 billion addressable market by enhancing Jabil's existing pharmaceutical solutions offering, which includes the development and commercial production of autoinjectors, pen injectors, inhalers and on-body pumps.\nWith PII's vast capabilities and state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, we're now in a stronger position to meet the growing demand for high-quality drug development and manufacturing in the U.S.\nIn other parts of our business, we continue to be prudent with our expectations for the year. In automotive, we continue to be cautious with the EV outlook for year while at the moment, we're not seeing much recovery in the renewable energy space outside of energy storage.\nPutting it all together for the year on the next slide. We now anticipate approximately $27.9 billion in revenue with core operating margins of 5.4%. Core earnings per share now are expected to be $8.95. And importantly, as Greg indicated earlier, we now expect free cash flow generation in FY '25 of more than $1.2 billion.\nIn closing, I want to say thank you to the entire Jabil team for your dedication, and investors for your continued trust and support. I will now turn the call back over to Adam.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. Before moving into Q&A, I'd like to take a quick moment and summarize our call today. We're closely monitoring all things associated with the potential tariff situation. As Mike highlighted, we are extremely well positioned as a U.S.-domiciled manufacturing service provider supported by our global footprint and with a significant U.S. manufacturing footprint.\nAnd as Greg highlighted, the resilience of our diversified portfolio is evident. Certain end markets, such as capital equipment, data center infrastructure and digital commerce continue to perform exceptionally well; while other end markets, including electric vehicles, renewables and 5G warrant near-term caution. All of this has been considered in our raised outlook for fiscal '25.\nThank you for your time today. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Senior Vice President, IR and Communications. Adam, please go ahead.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Earnings Call. My name is Adam Berry, and I'm Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Dastoor. We're happy to be joining you today from St. Petersburg, Florida.\nAs a reminder, we conducted our September earnings call hours before Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Tampa Bay area, followed by Milton thereafter. Although these storms caused significant damage to the Southeast, our 2 sites in St. Petersburg, Florida and our 2 sites in North Carolina were all operational within 10 days. The tireless efforts of our employees to get these sites back up running considering many of them experienced damage to our own homes and communities was incredible. Thank you to all those that helped.\nWith that, please note that today's presentation is being live streamed. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To view these slides, please visit the Investor Relations section of jabil.com. After today's presentation concludes, a complete recording will be available on the website for playback. In addition, we will be making forward-looking statements during this presentation, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fiscal year net revenue and earnings.\nThese statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims that the intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory B. Hebard\n\nCFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\n\nThank you, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join our call today. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a solid start for FY '25 with Q1 revenue coming in at $7 billion, up 1% year-on-year excluding the approximately $1.45 billion associated with the Mobility divestiture in the prior year quarter. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $347 million.\nCore operating margins came in at 5% in spite of a roughly 10 to 20 basis points of hurricane-related impact. Net interest expense in Q1 came in better than anticipated at $60 million, reflecting continued good working capital management by the team. On a GAAP basis, operating income was $197 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.88. Core diluted earnings per share was $2. Turning now to our performance by segment in the quarter.\nOur Regulated Industries segment reported revenue of roughly $3 billion, down 7% year-on-year due to continued weakness in our renewable energy and EV markets. Despite this, core operating margins for the segment increased by 10 basis points to 4.7%. In the Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we saw revenue of $2.5 billion, up 5% year-on-year. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in our AI-related cloud, data center infrastructure and capital equipment markets. The core operating margin for the segment was 4.8%, a 10 basis point improvement compared to the prior year quarter.\nIn our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment, revenues were $1.5 billion, down 46% year-on-year due to our mobility divestiture. Excluding the Mobility divestiture from the prior year, revenue growth for this segment was approximately 12%, reflecting strong year-on-year growth across our digital commerce and warehouse automation markets. Core operating margins for the segment came in at 5.8% in Q1.\nShifting gears to our cash flow and balance sheet metrics where we continue to see robust results. Inventory at the end of Q1 was flat sequentially at [ 56 ] days. After adjusting for inventory deposits, net inventory days were 56, a 2-day increase quarter-over-quarter, but as expected and within our long-term target range of 55 to 60 days. Thanks to disciplined working capital management by the team, our first quarter cash flow from operations were very strong, coming in at $312 million.\nNet capital expenditures for the first quarter were $86 million. And for the full year, we continue to expect net CapEx to be between 1.5% to 2% of revenue. As a result of the solid first quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at $226 million. We continue to expect strong free cash flow for the year to come at $1.2 billion. We exited the first quarter with a healthy balance sheet with debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.4x and cash balances of approximately $2.1 billion. In Q1, we repurchased 1.8 million shares for $232 million. We have $768 million remaining on our current $1 billion share repurchase authorization as of the end of Q1. We remain fully committed to completing the current share repurchase authorization by the end of FY '25.\nBefore I discuss the next quarter guidance, I would like to conclude my remarks on Q1 by acknowledging the Jabil team's strong execution this quarter which delivered solid results to start FY '25 amid a highly dynamic environment. The company continues to demonstrate high resilience and is well positioned for future revenue growth, margin enhancement and robust free cash flow generation. With that, let's turn to the slide for our Q2 FY '25 guidance.\nBeginning with revenue by segment. We anticipate revenue for our regulated industry will be $2.7 billion, down 8% year-on-year, reflecting continued softness in the renewable energy and EV markets. For our Intelligent Infrastructure segment, we expect revenue for the quarter to be $2.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year, reflecting broad-based growth across capital equipment, advanced networking, cloud and data center infrastructure markets.\nIn our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment, revenues are expected to be $1.2 billion. This is down 20% year-over-year, mainly due to our mobility divestiture. Total company revenue for Q2 is expected to be in the range of $6.1 billion to $6.7 billion. Core operating income for Q2 is estimated to be in the range of $286 million to $346 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $183 million to $263 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.60 to $2. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.69 to $1.27. Net interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $60 million. And for FY '25, we now expect it will be $235 million, down from what we thought in September. Our core tax rate for Q2 and for the year is expected to be 21%.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to dive deeper into our strategic growth areas and the exciting opportunities ahead.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. As Greg just highlighted, our first fiscal quarter results came in stronger than we had anticipated, driven mainly by incremental strength in our Intelligent Infrastructure segment. As a result, the team was able to deliver strong core EPS, margins and cash flows during the quarter. Furthermore, we distributed the majority of the generated free cash flow to shareholders by dividend and buyback programs.\nTo summarize, I'm extremely pleased with these financial results and the positive trajectory of our year. As a management team, we are collectively working together to deliver strong core operating margin expansion and consistent free cash flow growth, which will allow us to continue to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders. In a few moments, I'll provide some details regarding our updated outlook for the balance of the year.\nBut before I jump into those details, I want to take a moment to thank the global team here at Jabil for their commitment, dedication and hard work in a highly dynamic operating environment. As the world continues to evolve, this team is working hard to ensure Jabil remains nimble, agile and resilient for many years to come. For instance, during the quarter, our team opened a large-scale manufacturing site in Croatia, which currently supports a European-based automotive OEM.\nAnd beginning in FY '27, the site will also support our health care customers, specifically in the GLP-1 drug delivery space as demand continues to exceed supply. The team also relocated and ramp multiple existing programs [indiscernible] as many of our customers continue to seek a broader geographic manufacturing solution. We added to our capabilities during the quarter to through the acquisition of Mikros Technologies, a leader in engineering liquid cool solutions. These capabilities will support our future growth in verticals in both the data center ecosystem and other end markets that require thermal management like automated test equipment for semiconductors, batteries, energy storage systems and electric vehicles.\nAnd all the while, our team was benching through major hurricanes in St. Pete, Aspell and Hendersonville, I would like to take this opportunity for a quick shout out to our teams for not only taking care of each other, but also taking care of our communities during this trying time. The Jabil culture was truly on display. I'd now like to shift our focus to fiscal year 2025 and our outlook by both end market and segment.\nI'll begin with regulated market segment where we anticipate continued year-over-year weakness in automotive and transportation, driven by lower global sales of electric vehicles. Over the longer term, we feel comfortable that our automotive and transportation business will improve as our technology agnostic capabilities position us to capture growth in both EV and hybrid vehicle solutions. In health care and packaging, as we previously anticipated, we continue to execute on our pipeline of new wins, including the launch of GLP-1 auto-injectors and continuous glucose monitors.\nAs a reminder, due to the long qualification cycles in health care, it often takes 18 to 24 months to ramp these programs. However, once these programs are ramped, they generally enjoy very long product life cycles and multiyear stable returns. Renewables and energy infrastructure, the energy infrastructure space continues to do well with solid growth in battery power management. This growth is largely offset by previously indicated weakness in renewable applications primarily focused on solar. Throughout the solar downturn, we've worked hard to better position ourselves as we wait for a recovery in the end market. This includes share gains with key customers and operating cost reductions. In the near term, renewals continue to weigh on segment core operating margins.\nTurning to Intelligent Infrastructure segment, which is driving the majority of our growth in FY '25. In capital equipment, the rise of AI is driving demand for semiconductor fabrication and test equipment, which we expect to continue throughout FY '25 and beyond. In addition, in the data center space, we continue to deepen our existing relationship with our largest hyperscaler with continued strength in their custom AI-driven GPU rack integration business. As we had previously indicated, we've also won programs with a new hyperscaler in the silicon photonics side of our business. Over the longer term, we anticipate that our capability investment in liquid cool systems will allow us to participate in solutions that address the immense power and thermal demands of AI service.\nYear-on-year, we now expect the Intelligent Infrastructure segment to be up by approximately $1.5 billion after adjusting for the exit of legacy networking businesses last fiscal year. Our Connected Living and Digital Commerce segment has 2 distinct aspects: Connected Living, which largely focuses on consumer-oriented devices remains under pressure while at the same time, we remain bullish on our digital commerce business, which is being driven higher by the automation of the retail and warehouse experience.\nNow let's discuss our global network of factories, which we believe is a significant competitive advantage. Consistent with my comments in September, we placed considerable value on maintaining a large-scale global manufacturing footprint. And as the geopolitical situation continues to evolve, our ability to adapt combined with our designation as a U.S.-domiciled manufacturing service provider and our significant U.S. footprint is becoming increasingly important for our customers. And in my opinion, Jabil is among the best positioned companies in the world to help customers navigate these complexities.\nNext, even though it's very early days, I would like to spend a couple of minutes on the topic that has received considerable attention over the past few weeks, potential tariff implications. Here is what we can share as of today. As a reminder, while tariffs impact end customer demand, any changes in tariff costs have historically been largely a pass-through cost for Jabil. For starters, most of our business in China is predominantly local to local [ or ] local or regional with a very small portion of our revenues generated from that region being U.S. bound.\nSecondly, Mexico, our footprint has evolved over the past 8 years as bringing of our customers' manufacturing solutions that were closer to the final customer. We remain well prepared due to proximity and corporate resources for any reverse lift and shift of operations from Mexico to the U.S. Third, our manufacturing footprint has never been bigger than it is today. And while I do feel there will be some challenges to overcome such as labor our investments and experience in tried and tested automation lines and robotics will certainly help expedite any transfers.\nI personally feel there is no company better positioned than us to grow manufacturing in the U.S. Of course, we'll have to see how all this plays out over the next several years. But right now, I see our large-scale manufacturing footprint as a major competitive advantage. Shifting now to full year guidance. I'd now like to take a moment and explain why we expect higher earnings and margins in the back half of the fiscal year as reflected in our Q2 and full year guidance.\nThis is mainly due to the following drivers: First, as a reminder, our mobility divestiture last year makes the historical seasonality more pronounced. And then the ongoing programs in the first half of the year in cloud data center infrastructure and warehouse automation have weighed on core operating margins. Additionally, the anticipated continued recovery of our relatively higher-margin semi capital equipment business will contribute to higher earnings in the second half. And lastly, our cost optimization initiatives, which we discussed during our last call, will also deliver improvements in margins and operational efficiency as the year progresses.\nFor all these reasons, we anticipate stronger earnings and margins in the second half of the year. Putting it all together for the coming year, we now anticipate approximately $27.3 billion in revenue with core operating margins of 5.4%. Core earnings per share now are expected to be $8.70 Importantly, we continue to foresee another robust year of free cash flow generation in FY '25 of $1.2 billion. In closing, I want to say thank you to the entire Jabil team for your dedication and to our investors for your continued trust and support. I would like to wish everyone a safe, happy and prosperous new year.\nI will now turn the call back over to Adam.\n\nAdam E. Berry\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations & Communications\n\nThanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared comments. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Jabil's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Greg Hebard; and Chief Executive Officer, Mike Dastoor. Over the next few minutes, we will review the following: review our Q3 results, provide an update on current demand and preview our 7th annual virtual investor briefing.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback. I'd now ask to view the slides on the website and follow along with our presentation beginning with the forward-looking statement.\nDuring this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC.\nJabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Greg.\n\nGregory B. Hebard\n\nCFO, Senior VP & Treasurer\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. It's a great privilege to be a part of the call today. I'd like to begin this morning by walking through our third quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue, $265 million above the midpoint of the guidance range on better-than-expected growth in our connected devices and networking and storage end markets.\nCore operating income for the quarter came in at $350 million or 5.2% of revenue, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. Net interest expense for Q3 came in better than expected at $64 million. This was due to lower levels of inventory during the quarter, reflecting improved working capital management by the team.\nFrom a GAAP perspective, operating income was $261 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.06. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.89, $0.04 above the midpoint of our guidance range.\nNow turning to our performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, $65 million above our expectations, driven by better-than-expected growth within our Connected Devices business, offset slightly by the lower-than-anticipated revenue in our automotive and health care businesses.\nOn a year-over-year basis, our DMS segment revenue was down approximately 23%, driven primarily by the mobility divestiture. Core operating margins for the segment came in at 4.6%, 50 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, reflective of the ongoing mix shift within our DMS business.\nRevenue for EMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, approximately $200 million above our expectations, driven by higher-than-anticipated revenue in our networking and storage end markets in the quarter.\nCompared to the prior year quarter, EMS revenue was down roughly 18%, driven mainly by lower revenue in end markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print, offset slightly by good growth in cloud. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment came in at 5.7%, up 2 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics.\nInventory at the end of Q3 came in 6 days lower sequentially at 81 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 58, which was a quarter-on-quarter improvement of 4 days. As a result of the team's good working capital management in the quarter, our third quarter cash flows from operations came in quite strong at $515 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $100 million, resulting in $450 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter.\nIn Q3, we repurchased 3.7 million shares for approximately $500 million, leaving us with approximately $700 million remaining on our current $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization as of May 31. We remain fully committed to completing the share repurchase authorization by the end of FY '24.\nWe exited Q3 with a healthy and solid balance sheet with decor EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x and cash balances of approximately $2.5 billion. And as a management team, we are fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our fourth quarter guidance.\nIn Q4, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.3 billion to $6.9 billion. Core operating income for Q4 is estimated to be in a range of $365 million to $425 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be a range of $285 to $355 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.43. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.88. Net interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million. And our core tax rate for Q4 is expected to be 20%.\nBefore moving to our full year guidance on the next slide, I'd like to provide a brief update on our net interest expense and core tax rate beyond FY '24. We now anticipate interest rates to remain elevated and expect our net interest expense to remain at FY '24 levels in FY '25 and be approximately $275 million.\nAnd for core tax rate in FY '25, we anticipate our core tax rate will be impacted by Pillar 2 global minimum tax legislation. We will be required to adopt this only in FY '25. We're evaluating the impact this will have. As we sit today, we anticipate our core tax rate in FY '25 to be in the range of 22% to 24%.\nNow moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. For the year, we continue to expect $28.5 billion in revenue in the face of what continues to be a very dynamic demand environment. Compared with our thoughts in March, our expectations for growth in our automotive and transportation business has softened further. In particular, the market in China has been impacted due to overcapacity resulting in a surplus of cars affecting local demand there. And new global EV platforms that we originally expected to begin launching in the next 100 days or so have now shifted out several quarters.\nOn the health care side, we see softness in medical devices, which we expect will create a headwind to revenue in the near term. These declines were offset by strength in connected devices and our AF data center end markets, which today are reported across industrial, cloud and networking end markets. All other end markets are largely in line with previous expectations.\nGiven this updated end market outlook, let's move to the next slide to review our FY '24 guidance. We continue to expect core margins for the year to come in at 5.6%, a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. We also expect to deliver EPS of $8.40 for the year. And importantly, we remain committed to generating over $1 billion in adjusted free cash flow this year.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you for your time this morning and your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before I jump to my prepared remarks, a couple of comments. I am truly humbled by the trust placed in me by [indiscernible] Jabil board. For the past 24 years, Jabil has been my professional home, and witnessing the company's journey from $3 billion in 2000 to $28 billion is a true testament to the care we offer our customers.\nAs CEO, I'm excited and carry a tremendous amount of gratitude to steward an amazing team. As Greg highlighted, the team has executed well in FY '24, amid a dynamic environment. Consider this, we divested our mobility business, a key strategic decision. We're capturing growth in the AI data center space, and we're working towards our commitment to repurchase $2.5 billion of our shares, all while dealing with end market softness in renewables, EVs and semicap equipment, which we expect to be short term in nature.\nYet when you take a step back and put it all together, the company remains resilient and on track, and we expect to deliver on them tricks, including 5.6% core margins and strong free cash flow in excess of $1 billion on $28.5 billion of revenue. More importantly, we remain well positioned to benefit from many of the world's powerful trends in areas like AI, data center infrastructure, health care, pharma solutions and automated warehousing, to name a few.\nAt the end of the day, the world needs complex manufacturing to enable innovation in nearly everything we do in our everyday lives. Jabil is at the forefront of providing solutions around a rapidly improving technology landscape with complex supply chains in an ever changing geopolitical environment.\nAs a management team, it's incumbent upon us to ensure we're focused on the right end markets with the most innovative customers, thereby delivering incredible solutions. And I think it's fair to say we're right in the middle of that ecosystem today.\nMoving ahead, we'll continue to reshape our diversified portfolio and remain focused on growing new and existing value-added businesses driving margins and generating free cash flow. So let me share where I've been spending my time over the last 6 to 8 weeks.\nI've been focused on our customers, our investors, our suppliers and our people. Some of the key takeaways are as follows: From a structure standpoint, a chasm and organizational approach that has served us well over the last decade with an intense focus on speed, precision and solutions. This focused approach, I believe, targets our ability to serve each distinct market effectively by creating domain expertise in our core areas and better positions Jabil for growth.\nFrom a capital allocation standpoint, we will remain committed to returning value to our shareholders, prioritizing organic investments in our business and aggressively pursuing share buybacks at attractive valuation levels. This balanced approach shows that we can reward our shareholders while simultaneously investing next-generation capabilities. All the while, we will take care of our customers and suppliers while treating our people here at Jabil with respect.\nTurning to the business side of things. As you recall, on May 20, we choose to resend our FY '25 guidance. And it's worth noting, there was no singular issue that led to that up decision, but rather 3 key factors. For starters, many of the end markets we serve remain soft, and the timing of recovery in these end markets remains unclear, particularly in EVs and semi-cap equipment. We also expect to accelerate reshaping our portfolio away from end markets and geographies with less attractive risk and financial outcomes.\nAs a result, our revenue in FY '25 will be negatively impacted by approximately $800 million. However, this will set us up to be a much stronger company in the years to come. And lastly, in FY '25, we now expect interest expense and the tax rate to be higher due to a push-out of interest rate current expectations and the global minimum tax that Greg noted earlier.\nOver the next couple of months, the management team will be spending a lot of time reviewing our plan for FY '25 and beyond. And in September, I fully anticipate providing a full year outlook per usual with our normal color and commentary surrounding our strategy, the end markets we serve and our anticipated capital allocation methodology for the year.\nFrom an end market standpoint, you will hear how we've aligned technology-driven capabilities in our intelligent infrastructure business to help not only hyperscalers, but also silicon providers accelerate their own technology. How our manufacturing model leverages our automation capabilities to navigate the rapid growth in AI demand, how we're prioritizing growth in certain end markets like health care and energy infrastructure, how we're helping retailers automate solutions in both the retail environment as well as warehousing through robotics. We'll also [indiscernible] color around the businesses we anticipate deemphasizing in the future. And of course, we'll do our best to provide our expectations around the road map for the timing of recovery in key areas like renewables, semi-cap, electric vehicles, connected devices and 5G.\nAnd when you put this all together, we'll describe how the seasonality has changed and how the capital intensity of our business has improved and the subsequent free cash flow we will generate given our new mix of business. I am confident that the road map we develop will propel Jabil towards an even brighter future. I can assure you that all of these actions remain squarely focused on revenue margins higher in the long run and generating robust sustainable cash flow, all while taking care of our customers, suppliers and people.\nJabil's success is not the result of individual efforts, but rather a collective achievement of our entire team. Looking ahead, I'm excited about the long-term trajectory of the company. We have a strong track record, a talented and dedicated leadership team, and a clear vision for the future. Together, we will continue to drive innovation, deliver value to our shareholders and execute for our customers.\nBefore handing the call over to Adam, I would like to take a moment to say thank you to the entire Jabil team for your commitment and dedication to our customers, communities and to each other. Thank you for your time and for your interest in Jabil. I'll now hand the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, Greg, and congratulations to each of you on well-deserved roles. I look forward to working alongside both of you.\nBefore we move into our Q&A session, I'd like to take a few minutes to broadly summarize some of our key messages you heard today. First off, our fiscal '24 outlook is on track with the update we provided in March and subsequently reiterated in May. Notably, this includes $8.40 in core EPS, 5.6% core margins and $1 billion plus in free cash flow. And as we move through Q4, we fully anticipate completing the balance of our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization.\nAs we turn our attention to the end markets, we remain fully committed to our year-over-year growth plans in our data center end markets in both fiscal '24 and '25, which today are reported across our cloud, networking and industrial end markets. At the same time, we're actively evaluating our portfolio to see if there's any opportunity to further optimize, as Mike just described.\nAnd for early modeling purposes, please keep in mind that our seasonality in fiscal '25 will be reflective of the mobility divestiture. As such, our quarterly earnings per gram will be more like that of our EMS business, where we typically earn 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the second half of the year.\nInterest expense in fiscal '25, although rate dependent, is shaping to be approximately $275 million. And our core tax rate is expected to increase from fiscal '24 to fiscal '25 as a result of Pillar 2 global minimum tax legislation.\nAnd finally, and just generally speaking, Jabil remains extremely well positioned to benefit from a recovery in many of the end markets that have proven to be headwinds in fiscal '24. And while the timing remains uncertain, the ultimate recovery will lead to solid revenue growth, further margin expansion and even more cash flow generation on an already installed capacity. We look forward to updating you on these matters and more on our 7th annual investor briefing, which is tentatively scheduled for September 26. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

Welcome to the Jabil Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining Jabil's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor; and Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson. Over the next few minutes, Mike and I will review our Q2 results, update current demand trends and provide new guidance for fiscal '24. We will then turn the call over to Kenny, who will provide several of the building blocks that give us confidence in our strong outlook for fiscal '25.\nBefore we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of the call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback. I'd now ask that you view the slides on the website and follow along with our presentation, beginning with the forward-looking statement.\nDuring this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and our other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our second quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $6.8 billion in revenue roughly in line with the guidance range we provided as a majority of the businesses performed extremely well against the updated guidance we provided back in December. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $338 million or 5% of revenue.\nThis was up 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue year-over-year due to a strong mix of business led by automotive and health care, while also supported by an ongoing mix shift within our networking and storage end markets. Net interest expense for the quarter came in higher than expected at $72 million, reflecting higher levels of inventory during the quarter.\nIt's also worth noting that we successfully closed on the sale of our mobility business to BYD Electronics during the quarter for approximately $2.2 billion. As a result, GAAP operating income was approximately $1.1 billion, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $7.31, reflecting the substantial gain associated with the sale at the end of December. Core diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.68, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance range provided in December.\nNow turning to our performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $3.4 billion, down approximately 16% from the prior year, driven almost entirely by year-over-year comparisons for the mobility divestiture. On a like-for-like basis, our DMS segment performed very well, led by approximately 11% growth in our automotive and transportation businesses.\nCore operating margin for the segment came in at 5.6%, 100 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, reflective of the ongoing mix shift within our DMS business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.3 billion, down roughly 18% year-over-year and roughly $100 million to $200 million below our expectations for the quarter.\nThe majority of our year-on-year revenue decline within EMS was driven by our move to a consignment model within our cloud business and lower revenue in markets like 5G, renewable energy and digital print as expected. However, unexpectedly, and towards the end of the quarter, our 5G and renewables businesses were both negatively impacted by yet another decline in demand associated with those end markets. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment were 4.4%, down 70 basis points year-over-year.\nNext, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q2, beginning with inventory, which came in 9 days higher sequentially to 87 days. Net of inventory deposits for our customers, inventory days were 62%, which was quarter-on-quarter increase of 4 days.\nOur second quarter cash flows from operations came in at $218 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $170 million, resulting in $48 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for $825 million, leaving us with approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of February 29.\nWith this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $2.6 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x. In closing, Q2 was largely a solid quarter. For starters, the divestiture of our mobility business and the allocation of those funds towards the share buybacks reflect the strategic intent of this management team to both reshape the business where appropriate while also maintaining healthy returns to shareholders.\nAt the same time, the business is performing pretty admirably despite considerable declines in 2 of the end markets we serve as evidenced by our ability to deliver higher margins despite these headwinds. And finally, I'll leave you with a bit of optimism as we look ahead to fiscal '25 and beyond. As we think about the adjacencies across the end markets we serve, it's becoming clear that there's a common theme forming among a number of the end markets, specific to the surge of artificial intelligence, and the impact it will have on our customers' business well into the future. And with this surge, there's a proliferation of data being created by EV and autonomous vehicles that needs to be harnessed.\nIn the health care industry, we're in the early innings of getting our arms around the benefits of AI in the operating room. And in our cloud business, we're seeing significantly increased demand for our services related to AI specific to hardware, manufacturing and design. And perhaps most exciting, this enthusiasm is beginning to turn into tangible results. For instance, our AI GPU volume in the first half of 2024 is 200x that of the level of 2023. So there's a lot to be excited about as we look a little bit further down the road.\nIn a few minutes, Kenny will share his thoughts on fiscal '25 and why he believes our original outlook of 10.65 remains attainable despite a transitional fiscal '24. But first, I'll hand the call over to Mike, who will provide more details on fiscal '24, including an update on our growth outlook by end market. With that, thank you. I'll now hand the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following: First, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q3 and updated outlook for FY '24. Next, I'll provide an update on why we are confident in our growth opportunities for FY '25. And then I'll provide an update on our accelerated share buyback execution plans, which are progressing ahead of schedule.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide for our third quarter guidance. Towards the end of our second quarter, we experienced a sudden slowdown within our 5G and renewable energy end markets, which we expect will continue through the second half of FY '24 and and result in lower-than-expected revenue for the last 2 quarters.\nWithin our renewable energy business, the inventory correction that began in our Q1 is now expected to persist through the balance of our fiscal year as customers in this end market lower demand forecast towards the back half of February. The renewable energy team has done an excellent job consolidating the supply chain within our current customer base and we will have a higher overall share of our customers' business as we move towards the end of Q4.\nIn 5G, towards the end of the quarter, infrastructure rollout slowed quicker than expected as faster-growing markets like India substantially pull back on all 5G infrastructure investments. As a result of these 2 market dynamics for Q3, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $6.2 billion to $6.8 billion. Core operating income for Q3 is estimated to be in the range of $325 million to $385 million.\nGAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $221 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.82 to $1.38. Net interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be $75 million.\nNow moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. At a high level, with the exception of the near-term dynamics within our renewable energy and 5G markets, the majority of our expectations for revenue by end market this year remains largely in line with our pots in December. Importantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across some of our core end markets, which are still experiencing year-on-year growth, notably in electric vehicles, health care and AI cloud data centers.\nMoving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that we will Jabil to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we're not anticipating the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns. Our diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers give us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow and committed to delivering value.\nNotably, by FY '24, we expect core operating margins to come in higher than we expected in December at 5.6%. Three reasons largely account for our ability to drive margins higher despite lower revenue. First, as our agile model allows, we pushed our planned investments and costs that will plan to support new ramps in renewables in the back half of the fiscal year. Because of this, deleveraging is limited.\nSecond, we expect to offset lower revenue with fixed cost recoveries from 5G and renewable energy customers. And third, we made progress with our efforts to align our cost structure and footprint with our go-forward business. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins of 5.6% in FY '24 and positions us well for future margin expansion as we drive revenue growth higher on an optimized cost structure.\nPutting it all together for FY '24 on the next slide. We expect our improved mix of business and optimization efforts will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core operating margin guidance to 5.6% and for FY '24 on revenue of $28.5 billion. We expect this dynamic to result in core EPS of $8.40, which is reflected by improved core operating income margin and accelerated share repurchases. Importantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating more than $1 billion in free cash flow.\nMoving to the next slide. Overall, we feel good about the trajectory of our end market portfolio and are well positioned to drive growth in FY '25 and headlined by continued growth in automotive, health care and AI data centers along with anticipated recoveries in areas of our business that are contracted this year. Globally, both EV and hybrid platforms continue to outpace ICE unit growth rates, albeit at a lower rate than we had originally anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year.\nOur EV business is supporting a number of new vehicle platforms with multiple customers in areas such as next-gen compute and control modules, power conversion battery management, LIDAR and other sensors as well as charging solutions. Additionally, we were recently awarded new business in optical camera modules where OEMs are predeploying optics hardware capabilities, enabling the rollout of different levels of autonomous driving through software updates.\nIt is important to note the majority of the year-on-year growth we expect in EDs in FY '25 will be driven by new programs and will be less reliant on volume growth with existing customers. These new platforms gives us confidence in our expectations of another year of growth for EVs in FY '25.\nLonger term, Jabil is well positioned to support both EV and hybrid technologies as they continue to take a larger overall share of auto unit growth globally. Within our health care business, we see significant opportunity to offer critical solutions and capabilities to customers outsourcing complex tasks. Jabil's credibility in health care as the largest EMS provider in the space positions us well to take advantage of the growing outsourcing of manufacturing trend.\nIn FY '25, we anticipate another year of growth in our base business as we continue to explore opportunities in new capabilities and B2B transactions similar to our strategic collaboration from a few years ago. And in the data center space, there is a common theme forming among a number of our end markets related to the surge of investments in AI and ML. The pace of AI investments continues to accelerate, and Jabil is winning our fair share of this growing pie as we have positioned ourselves well to assist our customers build out next-generation AI data centers.\nOur teams are quickly diversifying and winning share across multiple end markets in the AI data center infrastructure space, where we're seeing growth in AI GPU right configurations accelerated optical switches for AI back-end networking applications, silicon photonics, liquid cooling capabilities and power and energy storage. Given our success to date in this space, we now expect AI-related net revenue across multiple end markets to be approximately $6 billion in FY '25 or an increase of 20% year-on-year.\nWithin the semi-cap market, we continue to anticipate demand to remain muted for FY '24. And However, overall market dynamics are expected to improve as commentary across the industry suggests recovery may be on the horizon with a growing expectation that things improve towards the end of this calendar year, as fab utilization ticks higher and memory inventory normalizes. And in renewables, as we look to FY '25, while we expect this end market to recover very slowly, we are winning new business and market share along with the aforementioned consolidation within our current customer base.\nLonger term, we remain well positioned to support secular growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to Jabil's unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing and supply chain capabilities.\nLooking forward, we're excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio and are well positioned to drive growth in FY '25. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases. In December, I outlined our intentions of executing a series of accelerated buybacks for the balance of the $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY '24.\nI am happy to say that we're ahead of schedule with $825 million repurchased in Q2. This brings our year-to-date repurchase amount to 10.4 million shares for $1.3 billion for an average purchase price just under $127 per share. We fully anticipate completing the remaining $1.2 billion on our current repurchase authorization in FY '24 and we'll continue to opportunistically optimize our repurchases.\nWith the plan in place and progress to date, I expect [indiscernible] to be in the range of $123 million to $126 million for FY '24 and approximately $110 million to $113 million in FY '25.\nOn the next slide, in summary, for FY '25, I'm excited about the underlying momentum across our diversified portfolio, and I'm confident that we're well positioned to drive multiple paths of growth in FY '25 as a result of the following: consolidation of share in the renewable energy space, expected recovery of the semi cap end market, confirmed market share gains with multiple existing customers, new programs booked with new customers, and I am particularly excited about our silicon to solution strategy, which will help accelerate the infrastructure that will be required to fuel the AI/ML macro trend in the market. This is borne out in the continuing mix shift of our networking and storage end market where we continue to replace legacy lower-margin networking equipment with higher-margin AI-driven equipment.\nOn top of all this, when you consider our optimized cost structure, we are well positioned to expand core margins to more than 5.7%. In addition, our accelerated share repurchases and expected lower net interest expenses gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core EPS of $10.65 in FY '25. In my view, Jabil has not just more diversified, but also significantly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which offer higher returns and multiyear secular growth opportunities. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Kenny.\n\nKenneth S. Wilson\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Jabil Green Point, Jabil Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and thanks to everyone for joining us today. Fiscal '24 was always going to be a transitional year for Jabil, one of which we've successfully completed the largest transaction in the company's history with the mobility sale and its subsequent efforts by our teams to optimize our footprint and cost structure for the go-forward company. For this transaction and the optimization of our footprint were anticipated, the end market slowdown was not.\nAs I have stated previously, the key attribute of our model is agility and our ability to quickly react and effectively absorb changes in revenue. At Jabil, we obsess about operations, working tirelessly to ensure that what is within our control, we control well. Managing our factories to absorb such a March slowdown does not happen by chance. So it's pleasing to see our margins hold up. Additionally, dislocations like this provide opportunity for some consolidation and is reassuring to make progress with customers who trust us to allocate more of their spend to Jabil.\nIn tandem with our focus on operational execution, we have been intentional in how we've shaped our commercial portfolio. The closing of the mobility deal was not a one-off event, but part of a process where we look telling our capabilities current and future with markets exhibiting the desirable characteristics of long-term secular growth and appropriate margins and cash flows.\nThe result of this allows us to help simplify the lives of our current and future customers while making appropriate returns. For example, in our recent history, this has seen us transition from low tech electronics and automotive to EV and autonomous driving systems, including optical cameras. From PCBA manufacturing and health care to precision machining of customized implantables, from build-to-print servers to highly configurable AI data center racks, from simple network switches to liquid cooled accelerated switching supporting AI applications and from build-to-print in the telco space, starting a seat at the table, as we look to optimize our advanced packaging value chain for silicon photonics across multiple end markets.\nIn short, we are continuously retailing the company to ensure we are ready to support the future needs of our customers. In addition to the mobility deal, another couple of proof points were evident in the quarter. We are proud to have been awarded a new video security and optics business with Motorola Solutions including 2 highly competent manufacturing sites in North America.\nThis supports a focus on supply chain regionalization where we see significant benefits from the ability to leverage our global footprint coupled with the advantage of being domiciled in the U.S. And in the AI data center infrastructure space, we are building low and medium voltage switchgear to support proliferation of AI data centers. We were awarded a liquid cooled accelerated network switching program, which will ramp in fiscal year '25.\nWhile already, we are seeing the benefits of the addition of the Intel Silicon Photonics team with multiple wins in the pluggable transceiver space. As I think about exiting this year as a more optimized company, coupled with the numerous opportunities across our commercial portfolio, I'm confident in our ability to expand margins year-on-year while also delivering core EPS of $10.65 and free cash flow in excess of $1 billion.\nNote that in modeling fiscal year '25, we anticipate total revenues similar to fiscal year '23 levels, excluding the mobility divestiture. Importantly, we expect mix to be much improved as our business continues to trend toward markets, benefiting from long-term secular trends.\nIn closing, in the last 90 days, I have had the privilege of spending time with multiple customers and internal organizations, including executive team at [indiscernible] Solutions as we celebrated the new award. In addition to the Jabil team from [indiscernible], procurability and Intel and with our teams in Asia as we celebrate Chinese New Year with a long-held Jabil tradition.\nWhile in Asia, it was also my honor to accept a Shingle prize awarded to our health care site in Shanghai, the largest med device side to receive this award in the last 15 years. As I reflect on all of this, I believe it further demonstrates that in addition to having the right capabilities and being in the right end markets, we also have the right team to buy their actions every day, strengthen our unique global culture. All of this puts us on firm footing for fiscal '25 and beyond. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call back to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny. So there was a lot here today. And in closing, I'd like to quickly summarize some of the key messages. Our second quarter results and our fiscal '24 outlook are largely in line with the guidance we provided back in December, with the exception of the impact from 2 specific end markets, including renewable energy and 5G wireless. And despite our lower outlook for '24, positive demand signals in the market, along with new wins, higher core margins due to mix shift and the accelerated buybacks from the proceeds of the mobility transaction give us confidence in fiscal '25 which is why we chose to maintain our $10.65 core EPS target. Thank you for your interest in Jabil. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor. In terms of our agenda today, we plan to focus on the following: review our Q1 results discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve and provide Q2 guidance. We'll also reiterate our capital allocation plans, reinforce our core margin and EPS outlook for the year. And in doing so, provide you with the detail as to why we feel confident in achieving these goals for this year and next, despite our updated outlook as discussed on November 28. But before we begin, please note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides.\nTo follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted for audio playback I'd now like to ask you to follow along with our presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties and that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.\nAn extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. With that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our first quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.4 billion in revenue, near the low end of our guidance range provided in September and in line with our updated expectations announced on November 28. It's worth noting the majority of the year-over-year decline was driven by the previously announced move to a consignment model, where we transition certain components we procure and integrate into the cloud space to a customer-controlled consignment services model.\nCore operating income for the quarter came in at $499 million or 6% of revenue. This is up 120 basis points year-over-year due to an improved mix of business, normal seasonal patterns within our mobility business and the previously announced accounting impacts of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale, Core operating margin was roughly 5.3%, up 50 basis points year-on-year. Net interest expense for the quarter came in $3 million better than expected at $70 million, reflecting lower levels of inventory during the quarter as a result of lower revenue and better working capital management by the team.\nFrom a GAAP perspective, operating income was $303 million, our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.47. Core diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.60, a 13% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the midpoint of the range we provided in September. Now turning to the performance by segment in the quarter. Revenue for the DMS segment came in at $4.8 billion, down approximately 6% from the prior year, driven by continued weakness from our connected devices end market. These declines were partially offset by year-over-year growth in our automotive and transportation and health care businesses.\nCore operating margin for the segment came in at 7% and 180 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, given solid mix, normal seasonal pattern within our mobility business and the aforementioned previously announced accounting impact of assets held for sale. Excluding the impact of assets held for sale associated with the mobility sale, core operating margins for DMS were 6%. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.6 billion, down roughly 21% year-over-year. This decline was driven by our move to a consignment model and a softening in demand in end markets like 5G, networking and digital print.\nGiven this combination of consignment and mix, core margins for the EMS segment were an impressive 4.6% up 30 basis points year-over-year. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q1, beginning with inventory which improved 2 days sequentially to 78 days. Net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 58 in Q1, consistent with our strong Q4 performance. Our first quarter cash flows from operations came in at $448 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $275 million resulting in $173 million in adjusted free cash flow during the quarter.\nIn the quarter, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $500 million leaving us with $2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of November 30. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.6 billion, and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.1x. So in summary, Q1 was largely a very good quarter. While our top line growth came in a bit lower than expected, the team still delivered good year-over-year growth in core margins, core EPS and adjusted free cash flow.\nAt the same time, we were incredibly active in terms of repurchasing our own shares, and we made solid progress on the sale of our mobility business. With that, thank you. I'll now hand it over to Kenny.\n\nKenneth S. Wilson\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Jabil Green Point, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam, and good morning, everyone. As Adam mentioned, on November 28, we announced a reduction in our outlook for fiscal year '24 based on a broad slowdown of demand across multiple end markets. In short, customers adjusted demand schedules as we reacted to a slowdown in end markets heading into the end of the calendar year. Although we feel this slowdown will be temporary in nature, it is [indiscernible] on us to react and adjust our model appropriately to align with our customer requirements. Agility in our industry is key. Being able to absorb changes in demand signals effectively across our network, is a critical part of our value proposition.\nThis agility is part of our DNA and is reflected in our ability to effectively absorb downside in revenue. Tangible assets, flexible automation, single instance of SAP, common manufacturing execution systems, focus on margin-rich value-added services and multi-customer sites set up specifically to manage disparate end markets. [ In one ] campus are just some examples of disciplines embedded in our model. These core areas of focus are a large part of why we believe we can manage margins consistent with our Q1 guide and EPS at $9 plus while absorbing a broad-based slowdown.\nTurning to end markets. When we take a deeper look, we still expect growth in key areas like electric vehicles and renewables, albeit at a modestly slower pace than previously anticipated. In health care, our business remains robust and foundational intent of what we are trying to accomplish at Jabil. Our ability to provide key solutions and capabilities to customers in complex areas we're outsourcing is underpenetrated and quality is paramount underpins our confidence that we will continue to go in this end market.\nIn cloud, our team continued to drive forward within the data center space. Remember, this business moved into a consignment model last year, which makes revenue look unusually low relative to previous years, while in reality, the business is growing volumes by roughly 20%. In connected devices, we've seen softening for some time, and this doesn't seem likely to change in the near term. While in enterprise communications and 5G, we continue to expect softness based on global rollouts.\nTurning to renewables. We've seen softness in solar and wind driven by a combination of reduced channel inventory sell-through, impact of interest rates and incentive uncertainty. Outlook-wise, we remain optimistic based on multiple new business wins and some supply chain consolidation within our current customer base. On the sale our Mobility business, I'm really pleased with the progress we are making. The sales collaboration between our teams, we are working on closing the deal, ensuring the needs of our customers remain top of mind, has been really pleasing to see. Focusing on your day job, keeping product flowing while managing a complex transition is hard.\nThe fact that we are managing this so successfully is another proof point of our belief that BYD Electronics is a correct partner for this transaction. Taken altogether, we never expect revenue not associated with the mobility divestiture to be down 5% year-over-year on a like-for-like basis. Reflecting on all of the above, it's pretty satisfying to see the resilience of our model despite end-market choppiness, we expect to post year-on-year growth in core margins and EPS, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows.\nFurther, we remain committed to our previous fiscal year '25 guidance, inclusive of margins at 5.6% plus and EPS in excess of $10.65. In closing, I want to share the final thought. In Jabil we are always planning our future and a Saturday have to say goodbye to my colleagues as they transition to BYD Electronics. I would like to welcome the procurement services team from Procurability and the silicon photonics technical team from Intel as I joined our company. Welcome and we look forward to your contribution as we focus on the next chapter of our company's growth and diversification. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now hand the call to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Kenny, and good morning, everyone. Over the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following: first, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for Q2 and FY '24, which remains largely consistent with our announcement on November 28. And then I'll provide an update on our accelerated buyback execution plans. With that, let's turn to the next slide for our second quarter guidance.\nWe anticipate the multi transaction to close during Q2 of FY '24. The exact date of the close will drive where we land. For Q2, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $7 billion to $7.6 billion. The midpoint of this range assumes the Mobility transaction closes January 31, which is consistent with our modeling assumptions in September. Core operating income for Q2 is estimated to be in the range of $339 million to $399 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $260 million to $301 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.73 to $2.13. The GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.77 to $1.37. Net interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be $62 million. Before turning to our full year guidance, it's worth noting that our Q2 guidance is materially influenced by the Mobility transaction close date.\nI thought it would be helpful if I provide you with the financial impact of an earlier close. For modeling purposes, a December close would reduce the midpoint of our Q2 revenue and core EPS outlook ranges by approximately $400 million and $0.30, respectively. For the year, it would also reduce our revenue outlook by $400 million while the loss in core EPS would be expected to be offset through accelerated repurchases and lower interest expense given the earlier receipt of net funds. Now moving on to full year guidance on the next slide. As we announced a few weeks ago, towards the end of our quarter, we noticed a widespread slowdown in customer demand.\nThe majority of the slowdown we're seeing is being driven by excess inventory in our customers' channel, which we view as short term in nature. In our view, once the excess channel inventory plays up, we're optimistic that the secular trends across our business remain intact and gives us confidence in future growth. It is important to note that Jabil's net inventory days is in good shape and remains consistent with our target range of 55 to 60 days. For FY '24, we expect revenue to be approximately $31 billion for our modeling assumption of a January 31 close for the Mobility transaction.\nImportantly, for the year, we continue to expect year-on-year growth across the end markets that are experiencing strong multiyear tailwinds and notably in renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI cloud data centers and health care. Moving to the next slide. Despite the revenue headwinds in the near term, we are confident that Jabil will able to be more resilient as we've diversified across geographies, products, customers and end markets. Because of this, we don't expect the same level of margin erosion traditionally seen in past slowdowns.\nOur diversified approach, global footprint and strong relationships with customers gives us confidence in weathering these near-term challenges. We're adapting, staying focused on margins and cash flow and committed to delivering value. Notably, for FY '24, we still expect core operating margins to be in the range of 5.3% to 5.5%. And I would now like to walk you through the dynamics of how we are able to maintain margins despite lower revenue.\nAs a reminder, we have completely changed the construct of our business. We're in the process of divesting one of our highest fixed cost businesses. Additionally, 4 of our end markets, EVs, health care, renewables and cloud are growing volumes year-on-year, albeit at lower levels than previously anticipated, which means deleveraging is limited as we are able to push our planned investments and costs which have not been incurred yet.\nIn addition to pushing our ramp in investment costs, we're also moving ahead with reducing our SG&A in the back half of the year and optimizing our global footprint. All of this gives me confidence in our ability to deliver core operating margins in the 5.3% to 5.5% range in FY '24. Next, I'd like to provide an update on our share repurchases for the year. In Q1, we executed the previously mentioned $500 million accelerated share repurchase. In September, we originally expected to do a series of accelerated buybacks totaling $1.7 billion in FY '24 and $800 million in FY '25. We now intend to execute a series of accelerated buybacks of the entire $2.5 billion repurchase authorization in FY '24.\nAs a result, I now expect [indiscernible] to be in the range of $124 million to $127 million for FY '24. We also now expect interest expense to be lower this year in the range of $250 million to $260 million compared to our expectations in September as we expect working capital levels to decline with lower revenue. All of these actions gives me confidence that we will offset lower income and deliver core earnings for FY '24 to be in excess of $9 per share. And our cash flow outlook for the year remains robust, and we are committed to delivering adjusted free cash flow in excess of $1 billion in FY '24.\nIn my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment, evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets, which are undergoing multiyear secular growth. Thank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. So as you can see, we remain well positioned and extremely bullish on the future of Jabil. Thank you for your time. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Adam, please go ahead.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our call today. My name is Adam Berry. I'm Head of Investor Relations, and this is our Q4 earnings call and the sixth Annual Investor Briefing. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson; EVP of Global Business Units, Fred McCoy; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor.\nFor the sixth straight year, we're going to use this session today to accomplish the following: review our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 results; discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve; provide an update for our pending transaction to sell the mobility business to BYD Electronics; refresh our capital allocation policy given the pending deal; offer a thoughtful fiscal '24 outlook that demonstrates enterprise level growth in some key areas, while also remaining sensible and grounded given the realities of the dynamic global macro environment surrounding us today; and finally, we'll do our very best to walk through the many moving pieces we foresee in the upcoming year as we work to make our business more profitable and more sustainable.\nBut before we jump into the details, please note that today's call is being webcast live. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with these slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of the website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's presentation will be posted there for audio playback.\nI'd now like to ask that you follow our presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and other filings with the SEC. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our fourth quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.5 billion in revenue, equal to the midpoint of our guidance range.\nCore operating income for the quarter came in stronger than expected at $477 million, or 5.6% of revenue. This is up 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis and 80 basis points sequentially, driven by strong execution across both segments. Net interest expense in the quarter came in better than expected at $71 million, reflecting good progress by the team on inventory and solid working capital management.\nFrom a GAAP perspective, operating income was $441 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.15. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.45, a 5% improvement over the prior year and towards the upper end of our guidance range.\nRevenue for the DMS segment came in better than expected at $4.4 billion, up marginally compared to the same time frame from a year ago, driven by strength in our auto and health care businesses. This strength was completely offset by continued weakness in connected devices. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 6.1%, 100 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago, given the solid mix and the normal seasonal pattern within our mobility business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4 billion, down roughly 13% year-over-year and approximately $200 million below expectations.\nAs expected, during the quarter, we saw a major revenue shift in our cloud business, driven by our previously announced transition of certain components we procure and integrate to a customer-controlled consignment service model. In Q4, the overall mix of consigned components came in higher than expected.\nFor the quarter, core margins for EMS were 5.2%, up 40 basis points year-over-year, reflecting strength in renewables, which is in our industrial portion of our business, and the aforementioned consignment shift. In fiscal '23, our DMS segment revenue was $18 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In particular, it's worth highlighting our automotive and health care businesses, which were up 42% and 12%, respectively. Core operating margin for the segment came in at 5%, up 10 basis points year-over-year.\nIn EMS, core margins for the year were strong, also coming in at 5%, 70 basis points higher than the prior year on revenue of $16.7 billion. The strength in fiscal '23 income was driven by growth in renewables within our industrial and semi cap market as well as the benefit from consignment.\nNext, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics. Beginning with inventory, which saw good improvement sequentially by 4 days to 80 days. More importantly, net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were also down 4 days to 58 in Q4. Our fourth quarter cash flows from operations were strong coming in at $686 million. Net capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $28 million and for the full fiscal year, came in lower than expected at $708 million, mainly due to the timing of CapEx payments that are shifting to Q1 from Q4.\nAs a result of the strong fourth quarter performance in cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for the year came in higher than expected at approximately $1 billion. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.8 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.1x.\nFor the year, we repurchased 6.7 million shares for $487 million, leaving us with $776 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of August 31. Please note that in Q4 we were out of the repurchase market mostly as a result of the pending mobility deal. As Mike will share in a few minutes, when our opportunity to buy back reopens, we plan to accelerate repurchases in Q1 fiscal '24.\nAs I flip to the next slide, looking at the 5-year financials, it's hard to believe that another year in the books for Jabil. And as I look ahead, I can't help but think that there's so much more opportunity ahead for us. In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Kenny, Fred and Mike. But before I do, I want to spend a few minutes setting the stage for what you're going to hear today.\nOver the next couple of minutes, I think you're going to hear a lot of the same from us. From a financial target perspective, you're going to hear us talk about winning our unfair share of business and leveraging those wins to drive margin expansion, free cash flow generation and further shareholder return.\nFrom an end market perspective, you're going to hear more about the areas of our business, which continue to see solid double-digit growth, and why we believe we're one of the best positioned companies to benefit from global trends, such as electric and autonomous driving, digital health care, AI infrastructure and the long-term shift to renewable energy.\nBut there are some new dynamics to share today as well. And as a team, we're excited to share a few key updates. For starters, you may have noticed that our previously announced transaction to sell our mobility business to BYD Electronics has moved from the preliminary stages of agreement to a definitive agreement as announced earlier this week. As we move through our session today, you'll hear from both Kenny and Mike as they weave the strategic rationale and financial impact into our economic model.\nAt the same time, we have some updates to provide today on capital allocation framework, given that the mobility definitive agreement is now in place. And then given that fiscal '24 will be transitional for Jabil, in terms of closing the mobility transaction and the subsequent planned accelerated buybacks, Mike will offer a viewpoint of fiscal '25, including the full impact of both initiatives.\nSo with that, I'll now hand it over to Kenny.\n\nKenneth S. Wilson\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Jabil Green Point, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning. Thanks for joining us today. As Adam highlighted, fiscal year '23 was another strong year, and I'm pleased with the progress we have made relative to our financial objectives.\nEvery day in Jabil, we strive to do the right thing. It is how we are wired. So it's heartening when looking at our end-of-year report card to see that we are making progress on all fronts. Most satisfying for me is the resilience of our model, where despite end market choppiness, we posted very impressive year-on-year growth in core margins, up 40 basis points to 5%, earnings up 12% and EPS up 13%, while also driving in excess of $1 billion in free cash flows.\nThis time of year also sees us complete our annual strategic planning process, and it is reassuring to note that similar to last year, we reconfirmed our focus on investing in key areas of our business, including electric vehicles and autonomous driving, AI cloud solutions, renewable energy and health care. All of this sets a firm foundation for fiscal year '24 and beyond and is a testament to our customer-centric model, which is both robust and adaptable to changes in end market.\nThe next slide shows how these characteristics have shaped for the last 10 years and seen in this context, fiscal '23 was just another step in the journey. If I was looking for one word to summarize activities highlighted, it would be intentionality. We have and will continue to be very intentional as we look to grow and modify the mix of business to include longer life cycle industries like health care with the acquisition of Nypro and our strategic collaboration with JJMD.\nIn addition, we have also increased investment both organically and inorganically in emerging technologies. We review our capabilities as a match for important end markets, like renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles and cloud data centers.\nFrom an enterprise perspective, we began materially redirecting more and more of our free cash flows to buybacks and reinvest in ourselves at very attractive valuations. And finally, just a few weeks back, we unveiled yet another step in our journey as we announced the pending divestiture of our mobility business to BYD Electronics for $2.2 billion. As we move into fiscal year '24 and beyond, you can continue to rely on this leadership team to allocate capital with a view to expanding shareholder value.\nI'd now like to spend a little time talking about our decision to sell the mobility business. As you know, over the past 5 years, I've had the privilege both to lead and work alongside some of the most skilled and talented manufacturing engineers, operations leaders and material scientists in the world. And during that time, we were fortunate to build an incredible business, while also delivering best-in-class products for one of the world's greatest brands.\nI had a front row seat, unlike any other, to truly appreciate and develop a deep understanding of the level of complexity involved and introducing and manufacturing precision mechanics at huge scale for our largest customer. This perspective provides me some credibility to make the claim that our mobility team is second to none when it comes to innovative automation, tooling design and manufacturing of these components at scale. And I also truly believe this talented organization can reach new heights, with our capabilities matched by a supportive business model focused on significant growth.\nTo all my friends in our mobility business, I will miss you deeply. Thanks for showing our company at its best. For never flinching from the sometimes seemly unsurmountable asks. I'm doing so all with humility, professionalism and great skill. It has been my honor to be a part of your team.\nLooking forward, I think the particular skill sets can be leveraged in endless ways. And while it's bittersweet to say goodbye to some great friends and colleagues, I know this is the best route for our customers, employees and shareholders alike.\nIn a moment, I will turn the call over to Fred to go deeper into our end markets. But before that, I wanted to reaffirm what you can expect from me as CEO. I will work tirelessly on your behalf to ensure that we are in the correct end markets and geographies with the correct capabilities to serve our customers. I will continue to ensure that our capital allocation is shareholder-friendly, while appropriately funding our growth.\nAnd all of this will be underpinned by an unwavering passion and commitment to preserve, protect and grow our unique culture, which is the foundation of everything that is great about our company.\nThank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. I will now turn the call over to Fred.\n\nFrederic E. McCoy\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Electronics Manufacturing Services\n\nThanks, Kenny. Good morning, everyone. As you've heard from Adam and Kenny, there's a lot going on at Jabil at the moment and quite a lot to be excited about. It's my privilege to join the call today, and over the next few minutes, to walk you through the demand dynamics inside our diversified markets and how we see each shaping up for the coming year.\nAs we move into FY '24, we continue to expect growth in our business to be headlined by end markets that are benefiting from strong multiyear tailwinds, specifically renewable energy infrastructure, electric vehicles, AI cloud data centers and health care.\nLet's begin with what's going on in our industrial and semi cap end market on the next slide. In Industrial, we're experiencing robust growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure as governments globally implement legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the United States to increase investment in new projects.\nAs a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain, from energy generation, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering and to the management of power inside homes and buildings. These projects have multiyear investment time lines, independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecasts. So we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space, given these elongated infrastructure build-outs.\nAs an example, a relatively new market that we're particularly excited about is the energy storage systems market, from grid level to inside the home and in support of rapid EV charging. On the back of several recent wins in the U.S. and Europe, we expect this space to drive solid growth in the coming years, leveraging our investments in battery module integration.\nWe are well positioned to support growth in the renewable energy infrastructure space due to a unique combination of power engineering expertise, in-region manufacturing and supply chain capabilities. As a result, we expect revenue for our industrial business to be up more than 20% in FY '24.\nOffsetting this growth slightly is our semi-cap business as we anticipate market demand to remain muted for most of our fiscal year. As a reminder, our semi-cap business spans both front end, with peer that turns wafer into chips to the back end with peer that inspects and test the wafer or resulting chips.\nOur strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful, due to the high cyclicality of the market, and we've been very focused around how we've invested in this business, expecting demand to remain muted in FY '24, while preparing the capabilities and regional footprint for us to be well positioned to grow when the market moves higher as end market demand rebounds.\nWithin our Automotive and Transport business, we continue to expect growth to be driven by a global transition to electric vehicles. For FY '24, we expect another year of 20-plus percent revenue growth, despite what is a choppy overall global demand environment. The global shift to EVs continues to accelerate, and we expect EVs to represent a larger share of the global auto market in FY '24, regardless of near-term global growth dynamics.\nIn this space, we support an increasingly diverse set of the world's leading automotive OEMs as they launch new electric vehicle platforms across multiple geographies. Our focus areas in the EV market, we refer to as ACES, or ADAS and autonomous, connectivity, electrification and software-defined vehicle architecture.\nIn the EV market, we support products such as compute and control modules, power conversion, battery management, optical camera modules, LiDAR and other sensors as well as charging solutions. The path to mass adoption of electric vehicles globally is exceedingly complex, and there are very few companies that are as well positioned as Jabil to support customers' multiple complex program ramps on multiple continents with industry-leading supply chain, design and manufacturing capabilities.\nMoving to cloud. Our cloud solutions continue to resonate with customers of all sizes, from large hyperscalers to Tier 2 cloud providers, such as technology companies and leading financial firms. Today, cloud represents a relatively small portion of overall global IT spend, but we expect secular growth in this area to accelerate, including the related data center infrastructure, especially with the proliferation of AI and ML.\nNext-generation clouds, and especially AI cloud data centers, present unique challenges to customers. AI workloads, which are powered by extremely powerful GPUs that consume significantly more energy and drive increased data generation.\nThis creates three challenges: insufficient power supply on the grid to support expanded data center needs, heat generation that surpasses the capabilities of air cool data centers and enhanced data interconnections between racks to support increased data inside the data center.\nOur design to dust capabilities continue to resonate with customers and we are investing in the areas of data center infrastructure services, liquid cooling and silicon photonics to help our customers solve the above challenges. Jabil is extremely well positioned to support customers as they incorporate innovative technologies into their data centers. And with the asset-light nature of the business, we have maximum flexibility to adapt and support customer needs around the world.\nWe are already seeing success in this area. Jabil was recently awarded and began production of our largest cloud customer's artificial intelligence rack configurations that are GPU dense, which are consigned. Because these components are among those consigned, we will see year-over-year headwinds to revenue, especially in the first half of the year. In spite of the revenue decline, the underlying business and associated unit volumes, however, are expected to grow by more than 20% in FY '24.\nIn health care, we expect another robust growth year, with revenue up 9% year-on-year. In the health care space, the range of products we design and manufacture lean into digital health care trends and include highly complex diagnostic equipment and related consumables, orthopedics, including 3D printed implantables, precision health and medical devices, like minimally invasive devices and pharma solutions, including smart injection delivery devices for diabetes and obesity drugs.\nJabil's credibility in the health care space as the largest EMS provider in this space positions us well to take advantage of the outsourcing of manufacturing trend. In the coming years, we expect OEMs to continue to accelerate this outsourcing trend, regardless of global macro growth.\nA recession-resistant end market with long product life cycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why health care continues to be such a critical component of our diversified portfolio.\nWithin digital print and retail, we are seeing slower demand in legacy print and point-of-sale markets. This is being offset by growth in warehouse and retail automation markets as we have a number of key wins that will be ramping in the back half of the fiscal year. These wins leverage unique capabilities in 3D printing of production components, robotics, engineering, software and integration and complex manufacturing automation. Our recent success shows we are well positioned in these end markets to help our customers bring next-generation automation technologies to market.\nWithin our networking and storage end markets, we continue our ongoing efforts to optimize our portfolio as we prioritize margins and cash flows. We also expect overall market demand to be muted this year. Longer term, however, we anticipate growth coming from new programs in development for advanced optical networking for high-performance data center interconnect that will support growth in cloud and AI data center applications.\nAnd finally, within our Connected Devices business, demand remains soft, reflective of weakness in consumer goods spending. We expect another year of market contraction for the coming year. We remain committed to this business, however, as shorter life cycle products helped drive product and capability innovation that we leverage across our other end markets.\nIn closing, I feel strongly that we have the right team, capabilities and play in the right end markets to support fantastic momentum into FY '24 and beyond.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike to walk you through our financial forecast, including the impacts of the divestiture of our mobility business.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Fred. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.\nOver the next few minutes, I plan to provide more information on the following: the expected net proceeds of the mobility transaction and [indiscernible]; next, I'll walk you through our financial outlook for FY '24, along with how we plan to report and forecast the business considering the pending sale, followed by an update on our buyback execution plans through FY '24 and FY '25; and finally, I'll also share with you how our financial outlook looks for FY '25, excluding our mobility business.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide. As Kenny mentioned, the sales proceeds from the transaction are expected to be $2.2 billion. We expect tax and transaction costs to be approximately $300 million, which will result in net proceeds of $1.9 billion.\nUpon closing of the transaction, we expect to utilize roughly $300 million, of which $200 million is in cash towards restructuring of stranded costs and footprint optimization, resulting in total cash available of $1.7 billion after these activities. We expect to record a gain of approximately $300 million to $500 million associated with this transaction, net of the above noted expenses. The $1.7 billion in cash we expect upon closing of the transaction will afford us the flexibility to execute accelerated share repurchases, while, at the same time, drive further growth in key secular end markets.\nOver the past several years, Jabil has been on a journey: a journey of diversification, a journey of portfolio optimization, a journey of strong financial performance, all while being extremely shareholder-friendly and returning funds to shareholders.\nThis has been reflected in a resilient model delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth and strong predictable cash flows. All this throughout a range of economic cycles, including a pandemic, a war, increased supply chain complexities, elevated inflation and reshoring. During this time, we also optimized our capital structure to maximize flexibility. All of this has been evidenced by our consistent core return on invested capital of around 30%.\nMoving forward, we continue to be conservative in our approach, given the current macroeconomic dynamics, while remaining confident that we've aligned our resources with the right end markets, and we have the best team and set of capabilities to deliver for our customers.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide. We heard Fred take us through each of our end markets and how we plan to optimize this portfolio even further. We continue to benefit from multiple long-term secular growth end markets, such as electric vehicles, health care, renewables and AI-driven cloud data centers. In fact, for FY '24, we expect these four end markets to make up nearly 70% of our FY '24 revenue mix, excluding the revenue associated with the mobility sale.\nUpon closing the mobility transaction, we no longer anticipate having any customer that represents 10% or more of revenue. The long-term viability of these end markets continues to give me a high level of confidence as we navigate a range of economic scenarios, while expanding margins and free cash flows.\nNext slide. FY '24 is a pivotal year in our journey. After considering a range of scenarios, with differing outcomes associated with the timing of the mobility transaction clause, we thought it might be helpful to provide a time-based range for FY '24 results, including our mobility business until the transaction close date and highlight the FY '25 outlook, excluding mobility and after considering the full impact of accelerated share repurchases.\nBut before I do that, I'd like to walk you through some assumptions we have used, most of which we have already discussed on this call. For FY '24, we assume economic conditions remain challenged for the consumer, which we have reflected in our consumer-related end market guidance.\nIn the coming year, we continue to optimize our end market portfolio in networking and storage. As Fred mentioned earlier, we began production of our largest cloud customer's artificial intelligence rack configurations. These racks are GPU-densed and are among the components that have transitioned to a customer control consignment service model, which has effectively doubled the consignment percentage from a year ago. While volumes are expected to grow by more than 20%, we expect the shift to result in lower revenue as compared to last year of approximately $500 million in Q1 and approximately $200 million in Q2.\nWithin our mobility business, in Q1, we expect the change in more content associated with new products to impact year-over-year revenue growth by approximately $300 million to $400 million. And finally, we anticipate the mobility transaction to close some time during Q2 of FY '24. The exact date of the close will drive where we land on the time-based range.\nWith that, let's turn to the next slide for our first quarter guidance. For Q1, we expect total company revenue to be in the range of $8.4 billion to $9 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $5.1 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $474 million to $534 million.\nGAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $423 million to $483 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.40 to $2.80. This includes the benefit of approximately $0.25 associated with accounting impacts of assets held for sale. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.02 to $2.42. Net interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be $73 million.\nMoving on to full year guidance, beginning on the next slide. For FY '24, we expect revenue at an enterprise level to be in the range of $33 billion to $34 billion. As I mentioned a moment ago, we anticipate closing the transaction during Q2 of our fiscal year. Therefore, our FY '24 guidance range reflects a range of potential outcomes.\nI would caution against reverting to the midpoint of these ranges as they are time-based ranges and will be highly dependent on actual transaction close date. Importantly, for FY '24, we expect core operating margins to improve by 30 to 50 basis points year-on-year, mainly driven by our improved mix of business. Our investments in IT and factory automation will also drive improved optimization across our footprint and are anticipated to lead to higher margins in the future.\nMoving to our thoughts around CapEx for FY '24. In the coming year, we expect net capital expenditures to be in the range of 2.2% to 2.5% of net revenue. This is higher than the 2% in FY '23, due mainly to timing of CapEx investments rolling into the first quarter of FY '24.\nUpon closing of the mobility transaction, longer term, we now anticipate our CapEx to be lower as a percentage of revenue in the range of 2% to 2.3%. Our CapEx investments this year are expected to include a combination of maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. We plan to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business, with the bulk of growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space, along with health care and renewable energy end markets.\nMoving on to cash flow generation. We closed out FY '23 with strong free cash flows, north of $1 billion. We expect to continue generating strong cash flows in FY '24 with adjusted free cash flow of more than $1 billion.\nWith that, let's now turn to our capital structure on the next slide. We have a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile, with current maturities appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rates. We ended FY '23 with committed capacity under our global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity and our year-end cash balance, we had access to more than $5.6 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. We also remain fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.\nIn fiscal '24 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, along with expected net proceeds from the mobility business sale, I believe it's an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years.\nPlease turn to the next slide. This morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced that our Board of Directors expanded our current share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion. We expect to begin executing on this upsized authorization immediately.\nYou heard Adam say that we were unable to complete our Q4 share repurchases due to restrictions around the mobility transaction. We plan to launch a $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction in October prior to the close of our mobility transaction.\nPost closing of the mobility transaction, we intend to execute a series of additional accelerated buybacks throughout FY '24 and FY '25, with the intent of optimizing share repurchases and interest expense, thereby maximizing the EPS impact.\nMoving forward, we are comfortable with our ability to generate strong cash flows and will remain balanced and thoughtful in how we allocate our capital. We believe this capital allocation framework will allow us to continue to grow our business and create value for shareholders. As a reminder, we have already reduced our outstanding shares from 203 million in 2013 to 131 million at the end of FY '23, a 35% reduction over this time period. Over the past 10 years, we bought back our shares at an average price of $32.71 a share.\nNext, let's look at our FY '24 guidance. For FY '24, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse blend of end markets in areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows. We have deep domain expertise, complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 30 to 50 basis points of core margin expansion in FY '24, along with core EPS in the range of $9.30 to $9.70 and more than $1 billion in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.\nAs we transition to our final slide, I thought it made sense to provide you with a view of FY '25, excluding our mobility business, but including the impact of our accelerated share repurchases post closing. We believe we're on the path to deliver our core operating margins at or above 5.6% in FY '25 and deliver more than $10.65 in core EPS.\nTo deliver this, we need to only grow our revenues by a conservative 3%, while continuing to execute a series of accelerated share repurchases. In my view, Jabil is well positioned to navigate the current economic environment evidenced by our performance over the past several years. We are not only well diversified, but also markedly more resilient than we were several years ago due to our intentional efforts to invest and align our resources with areas in key end markets that are undergoing multiyear secular growth, all of which gives me confidence as we march towards 6% core operating margins in the future.\nThank you for your time today and for joining us this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. As we talked about at the outset of the call, there's a lot to be excited about here at Jabil. And we've given you a forecast for fiscal '24, which we believe will be a bit transitional and fiscal '25, which we believe will be a bit more normalized and will include the full impact of the share repurchases from both our previous program as well as the portion from the mobility deal.\nThere's a lot to be excited about here at Jabil and we're ready to get into your Q&A.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry. Please go ahead, Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Kenny Wilson; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor.\nPlease note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations portion of our website. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety will be posted there for audio playback.\nI'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected fourth quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings.\nThese statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our third quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.5 billion in revenue at the top end of our guidance range. Core operating income for the quarter came in at $404 million or 4.8% of revenue. This is up 60 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Net interest expense in the quarter came in better than expected at $75 million, reflecting lower levels of inventory during the quarter, resulting in better working capital management by the team.\nFrom a GAAP perspective, operating income was $375 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.72. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.99, a 16% improvement over the prior year quarter and towards the upper end of our guidance range.\nNow turning to the segments. Revenue for the DMS segment was $4.35 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis driven by strength in our automotive and health care end markets. In particular, it's worth highlighting our automotive business, which grew approximately 60% year-over-year as the team performed extremely well as volume, content and brands continue to expand.\nCore operating margin for the segment came in at 4.1%, 30 basis points higher than the same quarter from a year ago but down 50 basis points sequentially as typical, given the normal seasonal pattern within our mobility business. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.1 billion, down 8% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Also, as expected, we saw a revenue shift in our 5G wireless and cloud business driven by our previously announced move to a consignment model for certain components within that end market.\nIt's also worth noting that our industrial business, driven by global demand for renewable energy, increased by approximately 30% year-over-year. For the quarter, core margins for the EMS segment were an impressive 5.5%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially, reflecting strong growth in industrial and the aforementioned shift to a consignment model.\nNext, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q3, beginning with inventory, which saw a great improvement sequentially to 84 days. More importantly for us, net of inventory deposits from our customers, inventory days were 62 in Q3, an improvement of 7 days sequentially.\nOur third quarter cash flows from operations came in at $468 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $212 million, resulting in $256 million in free cash flows during the quarter. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.9 million shares for $154 million, leaving us with $821 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization as of May 31. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of approximately $1.5 billion and total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x.\nIn summary, the team delivered another impressive performance in Q3. In a moment, I'll turn the call over to Mike and Kenny to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal '23.\nBut before I hand it over, I'd like to announce our fourth quarter earnings call and sixth annual investor briefing scheduled for September 28, where we'll lay out our strategy and our financial plan for fiscal '24. Please mark your calendars.\nAdditionally, from an Investor Relations perspective, we're going to be active in fiscal '24 with meetings, factory tours and end market deep dives, where we plan to discuss and showcase some of the growth drivers that we feel support our longer-term expectations. Please stay tuned, and thanks for your time today.\nIt's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. For the first 9 months of fiscal year, the team has posted solid top line growth, improved core operating income by more than twice the pace of revenue growth and grew core EPS by 16% while also expanding core operating margins by 30 basis points, a solid performance by the team.\nAs you heard from Adam, our growth and improved profitability this year continues to be driven by areas of our business benefiting from secular growth like electric vehicles, health care, renewable energy infrastructure and cloud. All in all, our solid performance year-to-date gives us excellent momentum as we enter the final quarter of FY '23.\nWith that, on the next slide, you'll see our fourth quarter guidance. For Q4, we expect total company revenues to be in the range of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.\nCore operating income is estimated to be in the range of $424 million to $484 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $400 million to $460 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2.14 to $2.50. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.96 to $2.32. Interest expense in the fourth quarter is estimated to be $73 million, which is lower than we forecasted in March, reflecting better working capital management by the team.\nMoving to the next slide, where I'll offer an update on our end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY '23 revenue expectations. At a high level, our assumptions remain largely consistent with our March update. We continue to be conservative in our approach, given the current macroeconomic dynamics and expect strong growth from our secular markets to be slightly offset by lower demand in some of our consumer-facing markets and in semi cap.\nIn our automotive end market, EV growth continues to be robust, limited only by the pace at which we can scale up production across multiple geographies with several OEMs. In health care, the outsourcing of manufacturing trend continues to play out as we're seeing increased activity with interest from multiple OEMs exploring our capabilities.\nGrowth expectations for our industrials business have also improved since March driven higher by renewable energy infrastructure. Specifically, we're seeing good growth in solar inverters, smart meters, energy storage and power and building management solutions. We now expect our industrials business to be up more than 25% in FY '23. This growth has been slightly offset by incremental end market weakness in our semi cap business.\nIn summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. We now expect revenue for FY '23 to be $34.7 billion, up 4% year-over-year, which is $200 million above what we thought in March.\nConsidering this updated growth outlook, let's now turn to the next slide to get a view of our updated guidance for FY '23. Notably, we see income coming through with the increased revenue. We now expect to deliver core operating income of $1.71 billion, a year-over-year increase of approximately 11% while holding core margins at 4.9%. This 4.9% represents a growth of approximately 30 basis points year-on-year. With the additional income, we're now anticipating core EPS will be $8.50. We remain committed to generating more than $900 million in free cash flow this year.\nBeyond FY '23, we expect our secular markets to continue to drive growth. I also believe our margins will continue to expand with the combination of our positive mix shift towards higher-margin end markets and operational efficiencies driven by automation and internal use of AI and ML technologies.\nIn summary, the team is executing extremely well. I expect our strong momentum to continue into FY '24, although we remain cautious and vigilant on the near-term macroeconomic conditions.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Kenny.\n\nKenneth S. Wilson\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Jabil Green Point, Jabil Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us today. As you heard from Adam and Mike, our business is in good shape, and the team has executed well this year in what continues to be a dynamic operating environment. The success we're seeing across our business is a key proof point of our team's ability to leverage multiple capabilities across disparate end markets as we continue to diversify our service offerings underpinning our improving financial performance.\nLet's turn to the next slide, where you'll see our updated outlook for fiscal year '23. We continue to expect good year-over-year growth and operating leverage this year, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core EPS by $0.10 to $8.50.\nAt the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow. It also sets a firm foundation for further margin and free cash flow expansion as we look to fiscal year '24.\nIn fact, when I look at the growth in our business this year, it's worth highlighting that nearly 60% of our portfolio is aimed at markets with strong secular growth. Specifically, electric vehicles, renewable energy, health care and 5G and cloud.\nOur automotive business continues its healthy growth rate as the team navigates multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. Jabil continues to be extremely well positioned to support our customers as they accelerate their transition to EVs in the coming years.\nAnd in our industrial business, we are supporting customers as we navigate the rapid transition towards clean energy. Over the last several years, we've invested heavily in capabilities to support energy storage, energy conversion and grid-level power management solutions, which will now be deployed across multiple markets at scale.\nAlthough we are in the early days of growth in this space, as government policies like the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. mature and scale, Jabil is extremely well positioned to support our customers in the coming years. In health care, we continue to capitalize on the trend to outsource manufacturing. And our credibility with some of the leading OEMs in this space has positioned us well for future growth.\nAnother area that is increasingly coming into focus for us is in the AI and ML space. This has implications both on the growth side of our business across multiple end markets but also as it potentially drive efficiencies across our internal processes and factory network.\nAs it relates to our internal processes, we are capturing data and using the latest toolkits to help improve our operations. Please, however, don't view this as a new initiative, mainly the next step in the continuous improvement path we've been on for many years.\nOur operating system naturally drives us to simplify, standardize, optimize and automate processes and [indiscernible] in conjunction with our enhanced ability to mine big data, which ultimately drives sustainable improvements. In September, the Jabil team will go deeper in all of these areas at our investor briefing. At that event, we plan to offer our fiscal year '24 financial outlook as we continue to prioritize growth in core margins and cash flows.\nSpecifically, we will lay out how we plan to increase revenue while also expanding core operating margins beyond 5%, how we plan to increase free cash flow by continuing to invest in growth to provide another year of solid core EPS growth and finally, provide an update on our capital return framework.\nIn closing, I feel strongly that we have the right team, capabilities and diversified portfolio to support strong momentum into the final quarter of fiscal year '23 and beyond. I know this [indiscernible] be possible without a thriving and unified Jabil culture, which is as strong today as it has ever been. Thank you for joining us today and your interest in Jabil.\nI will now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, Jabil, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Adam Berry, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nJabil Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call is Chairman and CEO, Mark Mondello; incoming CEO, Kenny Wilson; and CFO, Mike Dastoor. In terms of agenda, Mike, Kenny and I will be offering today's prepared remarks, while Mark will join for the question-and-answer session. Please note that today's call is being webcast live. And during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides.\nTo follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within the Investor Relations section of our website. At the conclusion of today's call, a recording of the entirety will be posted for audio playback on our website. I'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings.\nThese statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.

Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our second quarter results, where the team delivered approximately $8.1 billion in revenue, in line with our forecast. As you dig a little deeper, it's worth noting we saw strength in areas such as industrial driven by continued robust demand for renewable energy generation and storage, automotive driven by the transition to electric vehicles. And health care as large OEMs in that space continue to partner with Jabil to deliver best-in-class personal care.\nConversely, a portion of the year-over-year strength was offset by weakness in Semi-Cap and other consumer-oriented portions of our business. Putting it all together at the enterprise level, revenue grew by an impressive 8% year-over-year. Core operating income during the quarter was $391 million, an increase of 14% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.8%. This is up 20 basis points over the prior year and just ahead of our expectations from 90 days ago based on great operational execution within our EMS businesses.\nNet interest in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $74 million. In the quarter, we also repurchased 1.7 million shares for $127 million leaving us with $975 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $359 million our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.52. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.88, a 12% improvement over the prior year quarter and slightly ahead of the midpoint of our range. Now turning to the segments. Revenue for the DMS segment was $4.1 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis and in line with our expectations while core operating margin for the segment came in at 4.6% as expected as a result of strong returns in auto and health care, offset by weakness in consumer markets.\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.1 billion, an increase of 7% year-over-year, while core margins for the segment was 5.1%, up 110 basis points year-over-year reflecting solid leverage on strong revenue growth. So in summary, a strong close to the first half of our fiscal year. As we sit today, I know the team here is extremely proud of the strides we've made to not only improve our business over the last several years, but also make it more strong and more resilient. This improved resiliency in our business was reflected in the Q2 results.\nIn a moment, I'll turn the call over to Mike and Kenny to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal '23. And I think you'll see there's so much opportunity as we look towards fiscal '24 and beyond. Thanks for your time today. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Q2 marked a solid close to the first half of the fiscal year. Through the first 2 quarters of FY '23, the team delivered strong year-over-year growth in revenue, core operating income and core earnings per share, while also expanding core margins by 20 basis points compared to the first half of FY '22. Growth year-to-date has been headlined by areas of our businesses experiencing long-term secular growth trends, offset slightly by some of our more consumer-centric markets and Semi-Cap.\nThe team's impressive performance through the first half of our fiscal year despite what continues to be an extremely dynamic macroeconomic environment underscores the strength of our diversified portfolio and the improved resiliency of our business. Next, I'd like to begin with an update on our cash flow and balance sheet metrics as of the end of Q2, beginning with inventory which came in higher than expected, mainly due to timing and continued component constraints on the automotive supply chain.\nThe team did a good job offsetting a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days was 69 in Q2. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY '23 and beyond targeting net inventory days ranging between 60 to 65 days in the medium term and expecting to normalize in the 55 to 60 days range in the long term. Our second quarter cash flows from operations came in at $414 million, while net capital expenditures totaled $304 million. With this, we ended the quarter with cash balances of $1.2 billion and a total debt to core EBITDA level of approximately 1.1.\nTurning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '23 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue will both be $4.1 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $363 million to $423 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $336 million to $396 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.70 to $2.10. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.90.\nNet interest expense in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately $80 million and for the year to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million, which is higher than we forecasted in December due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions. As inventory levels normalize, I expect these interest costs to gradually decrease over the mid to long term. Tax rate on core earnings in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%. Moving to the next slide, where I'll offer an update on the end market demand assumptions and how these translate to our FY '23 revenue expectations.\nAt a high level, our year so far is playing out consistent with our assumptions in December. The industry continues to benefit from outsourcing of manufacturing as a macro trend due to dynamics such as onshoring closer to end consumers, complex supply chain dynamics and greater content due to ever-increasing design complexities and products. We continue to expect areas of our businesses benefiting from strong long-term secular growth trends like electric vehicles, health care, renewable energy infrastructure, 5G and cloud to drive solid year-over-year growth.\nAn area where our outlook has improved since December is in our industrial business where we see robust demand for renewable energy infrastructure, which we expect to drive double-digit year-over-year revenue growth. Electric vehicle demand also continues to remain extremely strong as we continue to gain share in an end market with strong robust growth as we navigate product manufacturing life cycles and ramps at different stages in their maturity curves, constrained by a tight component supply chain. We expect a portion of the solid growth from our secular markets to be offset by lower demand in our consumer-facing markets and in Semi-Cap.\nIn summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect the secular demand across many of our end markets to remain strong. Considering this updated demand picture, let's now turn to the next slide to get a view of our updated guidance for FY '23. We expect our improved mix of business will drive incremental operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margins by 10 basis points to 4.9% for FY '23 on revenue of $34.5 billion. We continue to anticipate core EPS will be $8.40, which is reflective of our improved core operating income, offset by higher interest expense.\nImportantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating an excess of $900 million in free cash flow. Overall, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year and drive the company to core margins beyond 5%. And with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Kenny.\n\nKenneth S. Wilson\n\nExecutive VP & CEO of Jabil Green Point, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. I am pleased to be joining the call today. It is truly humbling to reflect back 23 years to when I joined Jabil in our manufacturing facility in Livingston, Scotland. Since then, I have been afforded the opportunity to grow and lead several areas of our business. Most recently, I had the privilege to live and work in Asia, leading our Jabil Green Point organization, which has played a major role in building out multiple key capabilities that continue to be leverage across the company.\nGoing forward, I'm excited to lead Jabil as CEO, alongside a team of extremely talented and long-tenured industry leaders. I would like to share a few thoughts on what you should expect from us going forward. As Mark mentioned 90 days ago, think of this as evolutionary, not revolutionary. It is our term to carry the torch and prepare our organization for future growth. First, we have a customer-centric organization, always have been, always will be. As such, we will continue to work tirelessly on behalf of our customers and shareholders to deliver long-term value.\nSecond, we will continue to cultivate our unique culture, which attracts, retains, empowers and enables our people, allowing their true self to turn up to work every day. Third, we will remain focused on increasing margins and delivering sustainable free cash flow through a combination of enhancing the mix of our business and excellent operational execution. It's my belief that this, in turn, will allow us to earn an appropriate return on investment for the value we provide. Moving on to our business. Today, we see incredible tailwinds driving our business forward.\nFor instance, this year, we are seeing robust growth in our industrial business in areas like renewable energy generation and storage. In automotive, the team continues to navigate multiple complex program introductions, increasing both our scale and addressable content per vehicle. And in health care, we continue to win new business in areas such as digital health and precision medicine as the industry outsource trend accelerates.\nThe success we are seeing in these areas is a key proof point of our team's ability to leverage multiple capabilities across this per end markets as we continue to diversify our service offerings. Moving on to the year. I'm pleased with the momentum underway in the business. We expect good growth and operating leverage, which gives us the confidence to raise our expectations for core margins to 4.9% for fiscal '23. At the same time, we remain highly focused on delivering more than $900 million in free cash flow. And when I think about Jabil beyond fiscal year '23, there is a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead. Between the mix of business and the growth trends underpinned by our long-tenured management team, I'm confident that we can drive the company at above 5% core margins with sustainable strong cash flows.\nThis will afford us tremendous flexibility in our capital allocation. In the coming years, we will remain focused on executing buybacks when they produce strong returns for shareholders and remain committed to a dividend. As it relates to M&A, you will see us continue to focus on capability building deals consistent with the past several years. And finally, we will ensure our capital structure is optimized and remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile. In closing, I feel it is appropriate to send a message to our people here at Jabil.\nI've spent over 20 years at our company, and I'm excited to be a leader. I will strive to make you proud. At Jabil, our people are our greatest asset. Our strength is in our ability to bring together a collection of people from diverse backgrounds, different experiences and multiple generations and moved into a culture that across the world is both consistent and a true differentiator. Being no doubt that all that matters every day is that you give away your best, focus on performance and strive to be the leader or coworker you wish you had. In summary, bring your true self to work each and every day without anxiety or fear of recourse. I am truly grateful to each and every one of you for all that you do. I will now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nJabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Kenny. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified on our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2022, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to shift our focus to our solid quarter. To kick off the fiscal year, the team delivered approximately $9.6 billion in revenue, well ahead of our forecast and at the top end of our guidance range, driven by even better-than-expected revenue in automotive, health care and industrial. All other end-markets largely performed consistent to our expectations from 90 days ago.\nWhen you put all of this together, at the enterprise level, revenue grew by 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Core operating income during the quarter was $461 million, an increase of 15% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.8%. This is up 10 basis points over the prior year and in line with expectations. From a GAAP perspective, operating income was $362 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.61.\nNet interest expense in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $66 million as the combination of higher interest rates and better-than-expected demand drove our working capital needs higher during the quarter. During the quarter, we also repurchased 2.6 million shares for $161 million. Core diluted earnings per share was $2.31, a 20% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the higher end of our range as core operating income grew much faster than net interest expense.\nNow turning to the segments. Revenue for the DMS segment was $5.1 billion, an increase of 8% on a year-over-year basis and ahead of our plan from September, while core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.2%, slightly below expectations as upside strength in automotive and health care was offset by operational inefficiencies associated with mobility in China.\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.5 billion, an increase of 18% on a year-over-year basis, while core margins for the segment was 4.3%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting solid operational execution on strong revenue growth.\nSo in summary, another strong quarter is in the books for Jabil. And I know the team here is extremely proud of the strides we've made to not only improve our business over the last 10 years but also make it stronger and more resilient.\nIn a moment, I'll turn the call over to Mark and Mike to provide some additional thoughts on our performance in the quarter and update our outlook for fiscal '23. And I think you'll see there's still so much opportunity as we move into fiscal '23 and beyond. Thanks for your time today. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. As Adam just detailed, our performance in Q1 was quite strong. I continue to be extremely pleased with the strength of our business, which delivered double-digit growth in revenue, core operating income and core diluted earnings per share in the quarter. Our diversified portfolio and continued participation in end-markets with long-term secular trends was once again reflected in our Q1 performance.\nI'd now like to walk you through our balance sheet and cash flow performance in the quarter. In Q1, cash flow from operations was $166 million and net capital expenditures totaled $164 million. As a reminder, our customers routinely coinvest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these coinvestments upfront, which are then later reimbursed to us by customers.\nDue to the high dollar value of these coinvestments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important to net the 2 line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. For the quarter, inventory days came in at 78, down 1 day sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. As a reminder, we offset a portion of our inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers. Net of these deposits, inventory days were 61 in Q1, also down 1 day from Q4. We continue to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY '23 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to improve. We exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x on cash balances of $1.2 billion.\nTurning now to our second quarter guidance on the next slide. We expect total company revenue in the second quarter of fiscal '23 to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.4 billion. At the midpoint, this anticipates DMS and EMS revenue to be $4.1 billion and $4 billion, respectively. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $347 million to $407 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $319 million to $379 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.64 to $2.04. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.44 to $1.84. Interest expense in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately $67 million and for the year to be in the range of $265 million to $270 million, which is higher than we forecasted in September due to more conservative interest rate and working capital assumptions.\nThe tax rate on core earnings in the second quarter is estimated to be approximately 19%.\nMoving to the next slide, where I'll offer an update on the end-market demand assumptions that we noted in September. As a reminder, our FY '23 guidance assumed a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Based on what we know today, our assumptions from a demand perspective remain largely consistent. Across many of our end-markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in areas that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds like electric vehicles, health care, renewable energy, infrastructure 5G and cloud. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in the pace of an economic slowdown.\nAt the same time, we also continue to expect some consumer-centric end-markets to underperform year-on-year consistent with our thoughts in September. All together, we still expect good growth in FY '23, as you'll see detailed on the next slide. Starting with our automotive business, which continues to outperform despite global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates.\nWe've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in FY '23, automotive revenue growth expected to be in excess of 40% year-on-year. We're also expecting double-digit year-over-year growth in our health care business, which continues to benefit from an outsourcing of manufacturing trend and has historically been recession-resistant with long product life cycles, accretive margins and stable cash flows. Further, our Industrial business is also expected to expand by double digits this year, fueled by growth in clean and smart energy infrastructure as government legislation, such as the Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. accelerates investment in the space.\nAnd in 5G Wireless, we continue to expect solid year-on-year growth. Infrastructure rollouts are accelerating, and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to growth in other geos such as India. We expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions. Within our Cloud business in September, we detailed our plan to shift certain components we procure and integrate from a purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This transition, in fact, began in November, which is earlier than our expectations 90 days ago. As a result, revenue will be lower than previously expected as an incremental $300 million of components was shipped to the new model. This is in addition to the $500 million of consignment impact we announced in September. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY '23 and beyond.\nIn summary, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand across many of our end-markets to remain strong with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY '23 despite an assumed economic slowdown in the second half of the fiscal year.\nNow turning to the next slide. We have intentionally structured our business with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth, strong predictable cash flows and shareholder returns. With that in mind, while we continue to expect growth in our business despite recessionary headwinds, we have identified certain cost savings mainly in our SG&A and support organization for the second half of our fiscal year as we continue to look at doing more with less. And noncore expenses associated with our optimization activities will be approximately $45 million, with the benefits expected in the back half of the fiscal year. We anticipate these costs will result in a net benefit to core earnings per share of approximately $0.10 in FY '23 and $0.20 in FY '24. This benefit has been considered in our updated core EPS outlook for FY '23 of $8.40. We expect the cash outlay associated with our optimization efforts to be incurred over the next 2 quarters, and we continue to expect free cash flow of more than $900 million in the fiscal year.\nWe expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment and feel the steps we've taken to optimize our business are appropriate and make us stronger.\nI would like to wish everyone a safe and happy holiday. Thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark T. Mondello\n\nChairman & CEO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. Thank you for your attention to detail, and thank you for the way you care for and accept one another. Your attitude is amazing, and your dedication is incredible.\nWith that, let's move to our next slide. It's staggering when I think about what our team has built and tailored over the past 5 to 6 years. A large-scale portfolio of business sectors, 8 discrete, yet interwoven sectors, which offer Jabil a high degree of resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruption as well as gearing times when we simply welcome the ongoing demands placed on us by our customers.\nIN looking at this slide, I think about a world where countless products and a massive number of supply chains need to be created, redesigned or modified, therefore placing Jabil deep in the heart of essential end-markets.\nBefore moving to our next slide, it's worth revisiting the topic that we addressed during our Investor Day event back in September, the topic being the intentional output of the portfolio you see in front of you with the intention being that no single product contributes more than 5% to Jabil's overall earnings. This result is a good thing. It's a really good thing, especially when we think about dependability and sustainability. It also shines a bright light on the strategic importance of diversification and scale and the clear impact it has when operating our business.\nIn recognizing our Q1 results, along with our 2Q guide as detailed by Adam and Mike, combined with a watchful eye on the back half of the year, we find ourselves with an updated financial plan for FY '23 and an outlook which has us increasing core earnings per share to $8.40, an increase of $0.25 from our forecast roughly 90 days ago.\nIn addition, we believe that core operating margin will hold at 4.8% for the year on revenue of roughly $34.5 billion. While free cash flow remains north of $900 million. Integral to this outlook is the fact that our team is doing an exceptional job of proactively managing costs and controlling what they can control in today's environment.\nMoving to our next slide. I'll share thoughts on our path forward. Shown here are fundamental catalysts, which are key to favorable results and future outcomes for Jabil. The unique combination of our approach, structure and experience, our ability to execute, combined with our engineering expertise, financial plans that are grounded in rational assumptions and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. And rounding on our path forward, maybe it makes sense to step back a bit and think about the past few years. The data suggests that what we're doing is working, a testament of just how well our team is managing the business. I'd now like to transition from our path to our purpose. Here at Jabil, we're never confused about our obligation to deliver a fair return to shareholders. With this obligation well understood, and considering the upcoming holiday season, we're taking a little extra time to heighten our focus on ensuring a meaningful purpose in all we do. We're encouraging our employees to take a deep breath and a short pause, creating a little time for reflection, reflect on our team, reflect on their personal lives and reflect on giving back to those in need.\nAnd speaking a reflection, when it comes to helping those in need, I'm proud to report that our employees around the world just surpassed 1 million hours of personal volunteer time for calendar 2022. What a positive difference created for so many around the world, so many who need it most.\nOur team's effort was extraordinary. And in multiple ways, their effort was life-changing. Here at Jabil, we fully embraced the meaning and importance of carrying a purpose, both at home and in the workplace. And we do so with exceptional conduct and care.\nI'm just so honored to serve such a strong and steady team. Their approach is responsible and reliable. They value the relationships we have with all of those that we serve. Each day, we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And in doing so, Jabil's making the world just a little bit better.\nIn closing, to all of you here at Jabil, please know that you can be your true self without anxiety or fear recourse each day when you come to work. And to everyone on the call today, I wish you a safe and peaceful holiday season. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

My name is Adam Berry, I'm Head of Investor Relations at Jabil. And I represent a team here that's pretty excited to share our 2022 results with you today while also providing additional detail around our focus and outlook as typical for our September call.\nIn terms of agenda over the next 60 minutes or so, we aim to accomplish the following: discuss the trends underway within the end markets we serve, review our fourth quarter and fiscal year '22 results, provide first quarter guidance, offer a fiscal '23 outlook that includes enterprise-level growth while also remaining sensible and grounded given the realities of the dynamic global macro environment surrounding us today. And finally, we'll refresh our capital allocation and shareholder return policies.\nAnd most importantly, as our session unfolds, I hope that we're able to provide you with further perspective on Jabil, which I believe is uniquely positioned to grow and win in an environment where supply chain and global manufacturing capabilities have never been so important.\nJoining me on today's call is Mike Dastoor, our Chief Financial Officer; and Mark Mondello, our Chairman and CEO, who together account for over 50 years of Jabil experience. And importantly, when you think about their respective tenures, you can't help but also think about how they have guided Jabil through periods of economic expansion and times where macro conditions were a bit more challenged, a tenure that gives me great confidence as we move into fiscal '23.\nSo with that, there's just one more housekeeping item before we begin. Please note the following. During today's presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business such as our currently expected first quarter and fiscal year net revenue, earnings and cash flow. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.\nAn extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, Jabil has vastly improved since we began these investor briefing sessions in 2018. Today, Jabil is a $33.5 billion enterprise with over 50 million square feet of manufacturing space across 100-plus sites.\nOur cash flow generation is strong, allowing us to invest in key end market growth while also returning considerable cash to shareholders, which in fiscal '22 was $744 million. And our roughly 260,000 people move with purpose and agility to meet customer needs within a wide-ranging composition of the end markets you see here.\nMoving to our next slide. You can't help but notice the global nature of our manufacturing footprint, which enables us to manufacture on a local level for a global set of customers. No matter whether it's mobility products in Asia, health care products in North America or 5G infrastructure in Europe, we work with our customers to design and develop the most impactful manufacturing solutions irrespective of region with a focus on speed and urgency and a crisp sense of consistency from plant to plant.\nThis is critical because in today's geopolitical climate, the ability to adjust and move with urgency has never been more important as we help customers react to changes in tariffs, the rise of pandemics and natural disasters, energy shortages, conflict and many other unforeseen events. The Jabil of 2022 is also diversified and robust, thereby allowing us to meet challenges head-on in one part of the business while outperforming in others.\nSo just exactly how did we get here? Well, I'm here to tell you, it was very purposeful. In the 2016 time frame, our management team concluded that our model was missing an important characteristic if we were going to deliver upon our financial priorities consistently and sustainably. This important characteristic was diversification.\nSo beginning in roughly 2017, we embarked on a journey to grow and diversify our business in areas such as 5G, cloud, health care, packaging, connected devices, semi capital equipment and electric vehicles. Our intentional and deliberate focus on these emerging end markets, combined with our already robust traditional businesses in print and retail, networking and storage and mobility, resulted in considerable enterprise-level growth over the past 4 to 5 years, as you can see here.\nAnd as a result, today, no product or product family represents more than 5% of our business, creating an added level of comfort as demand fluctuates up and down, global tastes change and technology constantly evolves. Given our intentional focus on diversification, over the next couple of minutes, I'd like to take a moment and review some of the end markets that have fueled our growth leading to the portfolio mix you see today.\nIn automotive, we're supporting a rapid shift in technology to electric vehicles as evidenced by our 121% revenue growth since fiscal '18. The growth has been driven by our best-in-class portfolio of customers in an addressable market that is growing by the day.\nIn EV, our manufacturing processes support the industrialization and production of complex technology for electric vehicles, including battery management systems, inverters, converters, cables, off-board and onboard charging. And importantly, all of this increased complexity translates to increased content per vehicle for Jabil.\nSince fiscal '18, our 5G wireless and cloud business has nearly tripled in spite of the asset-light nature of the cloud model as our Design-to-Dust value proposition resonates with existing and new customers. From secure supply chain design and manufacturing to rack integration and ultimately recycling, Jabil is winning in an expanding market.\nIn health care, our business has doubled since fiscal '18 as the industry is experiencing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations and the demand for better health care in emerging markets. To address these trends, doctors, hospitals and patients are adopting new and more innovative ways to deliver better, more personalized treatment.\nConsequently, health care OEMs are partnering with Jabil to navigate these changes. Today, we support customers in the development of solutions across medical devices, diagnostics, pharmaceutical delivery and orthopedics. From rapid prototyping using additive manufacturing to high-volume production, tooling, injection molding, robotics and rigorous test procedures for regulatory compliance, Jabil health care offers an unmatched suite of capabilities, all of which uniquely positions us to offer technology-enabled solutions to our customers.\nIn industrial and semi cap, our business has grown 43% since fiscal '18, driven mainly by the increasing need for green energy and with incredibly strong global demand for semiconductors. Within our industrial business, alternative energy generation and consumption are driving increased need for power conversion, power optimization, line balancing and storage at the end points of generation and consumption, including accelerated adoption of EVs as well as on the grid. Jabil has been investing in this space with reference designs and scaled manufacturing partnerships globally.\nOn the semi cap side of our business, semiconductor equipment has become increasingly complex and precise, driving new generations of equipment at large scale. And when you take a step back, you'll again notice an incredibly well-diversed set of business sectors in support of some of the largest, most innovative and successful brands in the world today.\nIn each of these end markets, we're incredibly focused on delivering consistent and reliable value from early in the product life cycle like product innovation and design to more mature products where we offer planning, automation, supply chain management and, of course, manufacturing. At the end of the day, we build stuff here at Jabil, and we do it really, really well.\nIn summary, so far today, I've discussed the benefits of our global footprint, our focused and intentional growth in key end markets and the high level of consistency brought forth through diversification.\nBefore turning the call over to Mike, I'll try to tie this together through the use of real-life examples within the business to demonstrate the importance of diversification while also walking through our Q4 results. For the quarter, revenue was approximately $9 billion, ahead of our forecast, driven by much better-than-expected revenue in 5G wireless and cloud and networking and storage as our ability to secure critical parts on higher end demand created meaningful revenue upside during the quarter.\nAt the same time, health care and packaging, connected devices, mobility, digital print and retail and industrial and semi cap all performed really well and consistent to our expectations. All of this growth was slightly offset by component shortages in automotive where supply chain challenges remain the most pronounced. Altogether, at the enterprise level, revenue grew by 22% year-over-year and 8% sequentially, reflecting continued strong demand.\nIn Q4, our GAAP operating income was $409 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $2.25. Core operating income during the quarter was $447 million, an increase of 42% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 5%, up 80 basis points over the prior year driven by the aforementioned strength in certain end markets, slightly offset by unanticipated costs associated with the power shortages in Chengdu during the month of August.\nNet interest expense in the quarter came in higher than expectations at $53 million primarily associated with rising interest rates, while our tax rate came in better than expected by approximately 70 basis points, resulting in core diluted earnings per share of $2.34, a 63% improvement over the prior year quarter and at the higher end of our range.\nRevenue for the DMS segment was $4.4 billion, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis, while core operating margin for the segment came in at 5.1%, slightly lower due to the temporary power shutdowns in China. Revenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.6 billion, an increase of 32% on a year-over-year basis and well ahead of our plan from June. Core margins for the segment was 4.8%, up 50 basis points year-over-year, reflecting good operating leverage on strong growth.\nI believe the fourth quarter is the perfect illustration of our global network of factories adjusting, adapting and ultimately, delivering for our customers and shareholders alike. It feels as though the days of single end markets creating outsized issues for the company seem well off in the rearview mirror. And if you're buying Jabil today, it's not for a single product but rather a tenured leadership team, strong manufacturing capabilities and the general assumption that technology is converging with our day-to-day lives.\nThanks for your time today. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Jabil. Our business model has been intentionally structured with the aim of delivering core operating margin expansion, sustainable earnings growth and strong predictable cash flows.\nOn top of this, our capital structure has been optimized to maximize our flexibility. This flexibility has enabled us to reshape our end market portfolio over the last several years, which has performed extremely well evidenced by a very strong FY '22 results.\nI'm extremely pleased with the resiliency of our business, particularly considering the numerous challenges throughout the year with ongoing COVID waves, war in the Ukraine, global inflation, supply chain challenges and multiple energy shortages. Despite these challenges, we delivered year-on-year growth in revenue of 14%, core operating income of 24% and core EPS of 36%, all while increasing core operating margin by 40 basis points over FY '21.\nAt a segment level for the year, our DMS revenue was $16.7 billion, an increase of 9% over the prior year, while core operating income for the segment was up 12% year-over-year. This resulted in core margin expanding 10 basis points to 4.9%.\nIn EMS for the year, core operating income growth was incredibly strong, up 43% over the prior year. This resulted in core margin expanding an impressive 60 basis points over '21 on revenue of $16.7 billion. The strength in our EMS margins is reflective of our improving mix and strong leverage on 20% year-over-year revenue growth.\nTurning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In FY '22, fourth quarter cash flow from operations was $1.65 billion. For the quarter, inventory days came in at 79, down 6 days sequentially on improved working capital management by the team. It's worth noting that we offset a portion of our higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, which reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet.\nNet of inventory deposits, inventory days was 62 in Q4, down 8 days from Q3. While I am pleased with the sequential decline in inventory days, the team continues to be fully focused on bringing this metric down further in FY '23 as some of the supply chain constraints continue to ease.\nNet capital expenditures for the fiscal year were $841 million or 2.5% of net revenue. As a result of the strong Q4 cash flow generation, adjusted free cash flow for fiscal year came in higher than expected at approximately $810 million.\nAnd finally, we exited the quarter with total debt to core EBITDA levels of approximately 1.2x and cash balances of $1.5 billion. Next, I would like to provide some clarity on our CapEx as shown in our cash flow statement. As a reminder, our customers routinely co-invest in plant, property and equipment with us as part of our ongoing business model. We often pay for these co-investments upfront, which is then later reimbursed to us by customers. Due to the high dollar value, these co-investments from our customers and how they are reflected on our cash flow statement, it is important that the 2 line items shown on the slide to reflect the true CapEx number and what we refer to as net capital expenditures. Our net capital expenditures for the fiscal year amounted to $841 million.\nMoving now to our capital returns to shareholders on the next slide. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares, bringing total shares repurchased in FY '22 to 11.8 million shares of $696 million.\nTo date, we have utilized $737 million of our $1 billion authorization granted in July of last year This brings our cumulative shares repurchased since FY '13 to approximately 102 million shares at an average price of $30, bringing our total returns to shareholders, including repurchases and dividends to approximately $3.6 billion, reflective of our ongoing commitment to return capital to shareholders.\nIn summary, I'm extremely pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum underway across the business, which has allowed us to deliver exceptionally strong results in fiscal '22.\nMoving to the next slide, where I'll offer some insight about how we're thinking about the business this year by end market. Across most of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds, many of which Adam highlighted a moment ago. We continue to expect these secular markets to expand in FY '23.\nWe also expect some consumer-centric end markets to underperform compared to the robust growth for the past 18 months. Unlike in past economic slowdowns where Jabil was highly concentrated in a particular product or end market, today, it is critical to think of Jabil not as one company, but as a well-diversified accumulation of many end markets, a number of which we expect will continue to benefit from long-term secular tailwinds.\nThis product and end market diversification, coupled with our global network of connected factories, global best-in-class supply chain management and deep domain expertise, makes Jabil today markedly more resilient than we were 5 to 10 years ago as evidenced by our strong results in the last few years in the face of multiple significant global challenges. Our FY '23 guidance assumes a moderate economic slowdown and some moderation in growth, which will impact certain end markets more than others.\nI'd now like to walk you through each end market and describe how we're thinking about our business in the coming year. In our automotive and transportation end market, we expect the global transition to EVs to continue to drive robust growth within our automotive business despite choppy overall demand in global automotive purchases. Our view is that EV adoption will continue to accelerate and gain a larger share of the auto market in FY '23 regardless of the near-term global growth dynamics.\nJabil's content per vehicle, which can be as high as $3,000 or more dollars for a fully electric vehicle, continues to increase, which provides further confidence in future growth. It's also worth pointing out that project life cycles in this end market run as high as 7 or more years, providing a high level of stability and stickiness.\nIn health care today, the industries are undergoing tremendous change due to rising costs, aging populations and the demand for better health care in emerging markets. OEMs are seeking to address these dynamics by shifting the focus away from manufacturing to a [space] improving patient outcomes.\nJabil's credibility in the health care space has positioned us well to take advantage of the outsourcing of manufacturing trend. Should we enter an economic slowdown, it is our view that OEMs would in fact look to accelerate this outsourcing trend. A recession-resistant end market with long product life cycles and accretive margins and stable cash flows is why health care continues to be such an important component of our diversified portfolio.\nWithin connected devices, which I remind you is made up of a number of different customers, demand generally remains resilient. But given the consumer-centric nature of this end market, as we move from the pandemic-fueled consumer spending to a more normalized environment, we feel it's appropriate to take a conservative outlook and expect some moderation in growth.\nAnd in mobility, demand signals continue to be strong as we navigate through our Q1 quarter. This quarter, which has historically been associated with channel fill during the seasonal product launch, is our highest revenue quarter.\nIt's worth noting we have a long track record of operating successfully in this end market, which is being uniquely positioned within the portfolio as we partner with the most innovative brand and market leader in the space to supply key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate.\nIn summary, for DMS to me, the key takeaway this year is the considerable mix shift underway. In FY '23, automotive and transportation and health care and packaging are expected to be more than half of our DMS business with estimated revenue growth of approximately $1.2 billion combined in FY '23. Putting it all together for DMS in FY '23, we're expecting 20 basis points of margin expansion on a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth.\nTurning now to EMS. In digital print and retail, we expect some moderation in consumer print as people return to office to slightly offset growth in industrial print and e-commerce and warehouse automation systems. Within retail, both in customer-facing stores and in the warehouse, technology is shifting rapidly. As a result, we're building and ramping some of the most complex e-commerce and warehouse automation systems in the industry, which gives us confidence in our FY '23 outlook.\nWithin our industrial business, we expect clean and smart energy infrastructure to drive growth for FY '23. There are a few major trends which drive growth in this space, but the overarching one is the green energy revolution.\nGovernment legislation such as the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act in the U.S. with the sizable subsidies and incentives is already beginning to increase investment in this space. As a reminder, we play across the entire energy value chain from energy generation and solar panels, power conversion, transmission, storage and metering to the management of power inside of homes and buildings. These projects have multiyear investment time lines independent of underlying short-term economic growth forecast, so we feel comfortable with the visibility we have in this space.\nWithin semi cap, so far, customers continue to march ahead with CapEx investments executing to their investment road maps with the recently introduced CHIP Act providing an additional catalyst in this space. I remind you our strategy in this end market has been very thoughtful due to the high cyclicality of the semi-cap market. And we have been very conservative around how we have invested in this business and our forecast for FY '23.\nOn the 5G side, infrastructure rollouts are going extremely well, and demand remains high in the U.S. and Europe. Rollouts are accelerating, and our localized manufacturing capabilities are leading to market share gains in other geo's such as India.\nWe expect these rollouts to play out over the next several years regardless of near-term economic conditions. Therefore, we anticipate the 5G end market to continue to be resilient even in the face of a moderate global slowdown.\nAnd in the cloud space, our expectation is that the ongoing shift away from on-prem will continue to accelerate, driving long-term growth in the space. If economic conditions weaken, our views of the cloud space should be a beneficiary as companies look to reduce costs in a moderating growth environment.\nIt's worth reminding everyone we have deliberately structured our cloud business as a geo-centric, asset-light service offering with very low levels of CapEx and working capital. To ensure this business remains asset-light, we routinely look for mutually beneficial arrangements with our customers to optimize our asset-light model.\nWith this in mind, in FY '23, approximately $500 million in components we procure and integrate will shift from the current purchase and resale model to a customer control consignment service model. This is in addition to the consignment of certain components we had announced in earlier years. This change will allow us to use our assets more efficiently in addition to improving margins. Adjusting for this shift, we expect continued robust unit growth in the cloud space in FY '23.\nAnd then finally, within legacy networking and storage end markets, the value proposition that Jabil provides, the best-in-class supply chain management, deep domain expertise and engineering capabilities and manufacturing in multiple geo's is resonating with our customers. And we expect market share already gained in the second half FY '22 to drive growth in FY '23 with higher margins and robust cash flows. With the current mix of business in EMS, we expect 20 basis points of core margin expansion in fiscal '23 on low single-digit revenue growth.\nIn summary, Jabil is not only well-diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multiyear proactive alerts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow's trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is solid and expect demand to be resilient with year-over-year revenue growth at an enterprise level to be approximately 3% for FY '23 in spite of an economic slowdown.\nMoving to the next slide. For FY '23, we expect core operating margins to improve by a conservative 20 basis points over the prior year mainly driven by end market growth and improved mix of business. We also expect the investments we've made in areas such as IT, automation and factory digitization will drive improved optimization across our footprint, which will translate to higher margins in the future.\nTurning now to our CapEx guidance for FY '23. Net capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $875 million or 2.5% of net revenue. This will [run] through a combination of both maintenance and strategic investments for future growth and efficiency gains. In FY '23, we expect to continue to invest in targeted areas of our business with the bulk of our strategic growth CapEx aimed at the automotive EV space, along with the health care, 5G wireless, power generation and industrial end markets, generating multiyear returns in FY '23 and beyond. Our improved profitability, strong operational performance and disciplined investment has yielded significant cash flow over the last few years, which has allowed the company to strategically invest in higher return areas of our business.\nMoving forward, we expect to continue generating strong cash flows. This is possible as a result of earnings expansion, along with our team's disciplined approach and ability to execute.\nIn FY '23, we expect to generate adjusted free cash flow of more than $900 million. It is important to note that this estimate is based on our current expectations of a moderation in growth and continuing supply chain constraints in certain secular end markets. Paradoxically, a more severe recession is likely to improve cash flows due to the working capital nature of our business.\nMoving to the next slide. A key aspect of delivering high returns and delivering long-term value to shareholders is ensuring our capital structure is appropriately balanced and optimized. Over the last year, the team has done an outstanding job of building a solid and flexible debt and liquidity profile with current maturities appropriately staggered at an attractive interest rate.\nWe ended FY '22 with committed capacity on global credit facilities of $3.8 billion. With this available capacity, along with our year-end cash balance, Jabil ended the year with access to more than $5.3 billion of available liquidity, which we believe affords us ample flexibility. And importantly, we're fully committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.\nTurning now to our capital allocation framework. In fiscal '23 and beyond, we expect to generate significant free cash flow. Given this dynamic, it's an appropriate time to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and at a high level, how we plan to deploy our capital over the next 2 years.\nThis morning, included in our earnings filing, we announced a $1 billion share repurchase program authorization from our Board of Directors. With this incremental authorization, we have approximately $1.3 billion in total share repurchase authorization, reflecting our belief and confidence in Jabil's ability to generate strong earnings and free cash flows.\nTurning now to our first quarter guidance on the next slide. EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 2% on a year-over-year basis to $4.8 billion. And EMS segment revenue is expected to be $4.5 billion, an increase of approximately 15% over the prior year. We expect total company revenue in the first quarter of fiscal '23 to be in the range of $9 billion to $9.6 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $415 million to $475 million. GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $2 to $2.40. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.65 to $2.05. Interest expense in the first quarter is estimated to be in the range of $56 million to $60 million and for FY '23 to be approximately $230 million.\nOn fiscal '23, we will adopt an annual normalized tax rate for the computation for our core income tax provision to provide better consistency across reporting periods. As a result, the tax rate on core earnings in the first quarter and for the fiscal year is estimated to be 19%.\nAs we transition to our final slide, we expect the momentum underway across our business to continue even in a subdued economic environment. Today, our business serves a diverse plan of end markets and areas that provide confidence in future earnings and cash flows.\nWe have deep domain expertise complemented by investments we made in capabilities, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver 4.8% in core margins in FY '23 along with $8.15 in core EPS and more than $900 million in free cash flow. And importantly, our balanced capital allocation framework approach is aligned and focused on driving long-term value creation to shareholders.\nI'd like to thank you for your time today, and thank you for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark T. Mondello\n\nChairman & CEO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to our team here at Jabil. I applaud the terrific care you give our customers while also keeping our people safe. Your attitude is amazing, and your stamina is incredible. Again, thank you.\nToday marks our fifth annual investor session, a day where we share insights and lay out the groundwork for our business. Adam and Mike discussed our progress, which largely stems from the construct and pedigree of the company. I'll expand on this and offer more thoughts, starting with our approach.\nAt Jabil, each employee is critical to our success, and everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. As you know, we operate our business across a broad range of geographies with team members that don't look the same, don't talk the same, that have physical limitations and neurodiversities, team members that practice different religions and team members that have different sexual orientations. The diversity we have throughout the company simply makes us better, better as a team and better for our customers.\nSecond element of our approach pertains to ESG and sustainability. At Jabil, we aim to always do what's right. This includes doing right for our planet and doing right for our communities. Our focus when it comes to ESG is grounded by our actions.\nAn example is our goal of a 50% reduction in our greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Another example that we have underway is directed towards mental health, a topic that impacts all of us either directly or indirectly.\nLastly, another action worth mentioning is our commitment to giving back. Our employees collectively are donating 1 million hours of their time during calendar 2022. Although it isn't the 1 million hours per se, it's the positive difference our Jabil team is making around the world. Their efforts are extraordinary and life-changing.\nNext, I'd like to talk about our solutions and how they're enabled by our structure, our investments and our customers. You see, our structure enables our collaboration, which allows us to act with precision and speed. Our investments enable our execution, which allows us to take the ordinary and apply the extraordinary. And our customers enable our obsession. It allows us to solve the complex.\nMoving to Slide 41. You'll see a pie chart, which reflects our end markets, a portfolio which provides the foundation from which we run our business today, a foundation that offers a high degree of resiliency for the corporation, resiliency during times of macro and geopolitical disruptions and doing more typical times when we're faced with the demands put forth by our customers.\nA real strength of our portfolio is the presence we have in essential end markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing and clean energy, markets that we believe will stimulate continued growth in earnings, especially when combined with ongoing refinement and improvement of our more traditional businesses.\nLet's now take a look at how our business has performed over the last 4 to 5 years. The 8 sectors shown here exhibit the diversified nature of our revenue with each sector having a meaningful contribution to our overall financial results.\nWhat's also captured on this slide are the end markets where we've seen good growth, growth that we think will continue on a relative basis as we benefit from secular trends.\nPlease turn to Slide 43, where we'll review our outlook. As Mike alluded to, for FY '23, we plan to deliver revenue of $34.5 billion with a core operating margin of 4.8%, a 20 basis point expansion when compared to FY '22. This translates to $8.15 in core earnings per share, a growth of 7% year-on-year. In addition, we believe our free cash flow for FY '23 will be in excess of $900 million.\nNext, if we take our FY '22 results and our FY '23 guidance, step back a bit and look at the past few years, the data would suggest that what we're doing is working. And as I've said previously, being well-diversified in our business is a significant catalyst. But diversification for the sake of being diversified isn't all that special. What is special is the composition of our diversification.\nAnd if we expand on the current composition of our business, we don't anticipate any single product or any single product family to contribute more than 5% to 6% to our overall earnings in FY '23. And that's a good thing.\nMoving on from our financials, I'd like to talk a bit about our purpose. At Jabil, we have a purpose that serves as our ultimate guidepost. And this guidepost places an emphasis on caring, perspective, proper intentions and truthfulness. These characteristics drive our behaviors in all we do. I'm proud of our team as they embrace our purpose, and with their firm embrace comes exceptional conduct.\nIf we could now move to Slide 46, where we can go over our path forward. As we think about fiscal '23, we'll certainly measure our success based on financial performance. But we'll also grade ourselves on keeping our people safe, exceptional customer care and how we interact with our suppliers, suppliers who stood by us and supported us during these most recent difficult times. By the way, thanks to everyone listening today who partners with Jabil on the supply side of our business. We're grateful.\nAs our path forward, it's clear that our journey is based on our unique combination of approach, structure and experience, our confidence in our ability to execute combined with our engineering expertise, our financial outlook which was formed with rational assumptions and our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.\nIn closing, we believe Jabil is making the world just a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil. And in doing what you do each day, I want all of you to be your true self without fear or recourse. I'm honored to serve such a reliable team. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. There's clearly a lot to like about Jabil today. To summarize, we began by describing how Jabil has undergone deep and sustainable improvements to its business model. And we highlighted the solid foundation upon which the company sits today. Then Mike walked you through our financial playbook, highlighted by the strength of our portfolio, fueled by long-term secular tailwinds. And importantly, Mike talked about our financial outlook against a challenged macroeconomic background.\nTo reiterate, today, demand still remains strong and well ahead of supply. But as Mike noted, conservatism has been baked into today's model, which anticipates good revenue growth, expanding margins and strong cash flows. And finally, to wrap up our session today, Mark offered insight into our unique approach, solutions, portfolio and purpose.\nI want to thank you for your time today, and we appreciate your interest in Jabil. Operator, we're now ready for Q&A."

(Operator Instructions). Please note, this conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'll turn the conference over to Adam Berry, Vice President of Investor Relations. Adam, you may now begin.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Jabil's Third Quarter of Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. Joining me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor.\nPlease note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our website.\nI'd now like to ask that you follow our earnings presentation with slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements, including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected fourth quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially.\nAn extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark T. Mondello\n\nChairman & CEO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. I'll begin by saying thanks to all of our people here at Jabil. Thank you for the tireless attention you offer our customers, and thank you for the manner in which you care for and accept one another.\nLet's now turn to Slide 5 and review our third quarter results. Q3 was another strong quarter, driven by double-digit revenue growth and outstanding execution. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.72 on revenue of $8.3 billion. This resulted in a core operating margin of 4.2%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year.\nAll in all, I'm quite pleased with the quarter. We're carrying good momentum as we start to think about FY '23. And when I think about momentum, I think about the primary catalysts behind our business, that being the makeup and scale of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide, Slide 6.\nThe pie chart shown here reflects Jabil's commercial portfolio, which our team has built over the past 5 to 6 years. In essence, a large-scale, well-diversified foundation from which we run our business today. And the resulting output in having built this business is threefold.\nOne, a higher level of resiliency for the corporation, either during trying times of macro and geopolitical disruptions or during more typical times when we're simply faced with never-ending demand fluctuations. Two, Jabil's presence in new markets, markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized healthcare, cloud computing and clean energy, markets that we believe will drive earnings growth, especially when combined with the continued refinement and improvement of our traditional businesses. And finally, the third resultant output of our team's hard work is the assembly and collection of our many capabilities, capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.\nMoving to Slide 7. You'll see management's outlook for the year. We're anticipating core earnings per share to be $7.45, an increase of 33% year-on-year. As for revenue, fiscal '22 now looks to be $32.8 billion, while our outlook for core operating margin remains steady at 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for FY '22.\nAltogether, this year is a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. And although we're navigating a tough environment, we have ample opportunities to consider as we formalize our business plan for fiscal '23. With this in mind, we look forward to hosting our fifth Annual Investor Briefing. And consistent with past years, the briefing will be held in late September. Adam will be confirming an exact date later this summer.\nWe'll open the session by reporting our fourth quarter and full year results. We'll then follow with a complete review of our priorities, and explain how these priorities will guide us through FY '23. Management will also share how we plan to further expand our core operating margin while sharing observations on end markets. And wrapping up the September session, Mike will share our capital return framework for FY '23 and FY '24. We have lots to share and a wonderful story to tell financially, operationally and commercially.\nWith that, let's look at my final slide, where I'd like to talk about the importance of purpose. At Jabil, we act with purpose. And with purpose comes expectations, expectations around certain behaviors, behaviors such as keeping our people safe, protecting the environment, giving back to our communities and ensuring a workplace of tolerance, respect and acceptance. Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been as important as they are today. I'm proud of our team as they embrace our purpose and, in doing so, their conduct is exceptional.\nIn closing, I like the decisions we're making. At Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really, really well. It's why we welcome the challenges put forth by our customers. And when addressing these challenges, we do our best to make the world a little bit better, a little bit healthier and a little bit safer each and every day.\nAs I alluded to earlier in my prepared remarks, the world is a bit messy at the moment. What I do believe is Jabil executes well when times are steady, but I'm even more passionate in my belief that Jabil executes really well when times are difficult.\nThank you for joining our call, and thanks for your interest in Jabil. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today.\nOur third quarter was a great illustration of our diversification in action. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our portfolio and the sustainable momentum at the enterprise level. In spite of a challenging supply chain environment and well-publicized shutdowns in China, the team still delivered exceptional results in revenue, core operating margin and core diluted earnings per share.\nFor the quarter, revenue was approximately $8.3 billion, ahead of our forecast, driven by very strong demand within EMS, partially offset by sporadic COVID challenges within DMS. Altogether, on an enterprise level, revenue grew by 15% year-over-year and 10% sequentially as demand across end markets remain well ahead of supply.\nIn Q3, our GAAP operating income was $321 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.52. Core operating income during the quarter was $352 million, an increase of 27% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.2%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Net interest expense in Q3 came in above expectations at $45 million due to a combination of higher working capital and rising interest rates. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.72, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to our third quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 7% on a year-over-year basis. Although upside in the quarter was limited in Automotive, Healthcare and Mobility, we still experienced year-over-year growth in every end market within DMS. Core margin for the segment came in at 3.8%.\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $4.5 billion, an increase of 23% on a year-over-year basis and well ahead of our plans for March. The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was extremely broad-based, with strength in our 5G Wireless & Cloud and Networking & Storage businesses, where we gained additional share during the quarter as a result of our ability to execute in complex supply chains and deliver critical parts and components. Core margin for the segment was 4.6%, up 80 basis points over the prior year, reflecting exceptional cost control on higher-than-anticipated revenue.\nTurning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q3, inventory days came in at 85 days, down 1 day sequentially and above our expectations in March, mainly due to the shutdowns in Shanghai, which also impacted upstream and downstream supply chains. We offset a portion of higher inventory levels with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of inventory deposits, inventory days were 70 in Q3, down 1 day from the previous quarter.\nAs a quick reminder, our business model is designed such that we do not take risk on inventory in anticipation of sales. All inventory orders require a customer purchase order before triggering a purchase request within our MRP system. The majority of our inventory continues to be mainly associated with raw materials as a result of kitting issues and timing of components. At the end of Q3, finished goods represented a very small level at approximately 11% of inventory, consistent with Q2.\nOur third quarter cash flows from operations were $545 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $324 million. From a total debt-to-core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q3, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares for $203 million, and for the year, we've repurchased 7.9 million shares for $475 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.\nTurning now to our fourth quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 14% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.5 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $3.9 billion. We expect total company revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $8.1 billion to $8.7 billion. Core operating income is estimated to be in the range of $390 million to $450 million, representing a core margin range of 4.8% to 5.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 80 basis points over the prior year.\nIn Q4, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $367 million to $427 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.94 to $2.34. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.78 to $2.18. The core tax rate in the fourth quarter is estimated to be approximately 17%.\nNext, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our dynamic and resilient portfolio of businesses by end market. Across the majority of our end markets, demand has been extremely resilient and continues to outstrip supply across our business, particularly in end markets that continue to benefit from strong secular tailwinds, markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine and healthcare, clean and smart energy infrastructure, 5G infrastructure, cloud and semi-cap.\nThese end markets represent a large majority of the overall Jabil portfolio today, and we believe sustained growth in these markets will continue, even if overall global economic growth slows from the solid levels over the last few years. The end markets we serve that may be more susceptible to economic slowdowns have been strategically positioned within the portfolio as we partner with market-leading brands to provide key capabilities that are critical and hard to replicate. This product diversification provides resiliency to our portfolio.\nIn summary, Jabil is not only well-diversified, but also markedly more resilient due to our multi-year proactive efforts to diversify our business and align to tomorrow's trends. As a result, we feel the outlook for our business is strong and anticipate demand to be resilient for the balance of this year and into FY '23..\nAll in all, our performance during the first 9 months of FY '22 gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.45 per share on revenue of approximately $32.8 billion. Notably, we see income and cash flow coming through with the increase to revenue. We now expect strong core margin and free cash flow of 4.6% and $700 million, respectively.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Before we move into Q&A, I'd like to remind all participants that we cannot address customer or product-specific questions. Thank you for your understanding.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A."

Please go ahead.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nGood morning and welcome to Jabil's Second Quarter of Fiscal 2022 earnings call. With me on today's call are Chief Executive Officer, Mark Mondello; and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Dastoor.\nPlease note that today's call is being webcast live, and during our prepared remarks, we will be referencing slides. To follow along with the slides, please visit jabil.com within our Investor Relations section. At the conclusion of today's call, the entirety of today's session will be posted for audio playback on our website.\nI'd like to now ask that you follow our earnings presentation with the slides on the website, beginning with the forward-looking statement. During this conference call, we will be making forward-looking statements. including, among other things, those regarding the anticipated outlook for our business, such as our currently expected third quarter and fiscal year net revenue and earnings. These statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions involving risks and uncertainties that could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially. An extensive list of these risks and uncertainties are identified in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2021, and other filings. Jabil disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark T. Mondello\n\nChairman & CEO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Adam. Good morning. I appreciate everyone taking time to join our call today. To begin with, our hearts go out to everyone impacted by the war in Ukraine. When I think about our team, along with their families, what comes to mind are words like admiration, courage and heart. Please know we're in constant communication with those on the ground, and we continue to provide resources and financial assistance as the safety and security of those in Ukraine is our top priority.\nAt Jabil, we're on corporate family with people located all over the world. And despite the physical distance between us, we'll always face difficult situations together. To all of our employees, thank you for being servant leaders. Thank you for your spirit. And thank you for looking after one another.\nLet's now turn to Slide 6, where we'll take a look at our second quarter results. Q2 was another strong quarter, both top line and bottom line, driven by double-digit revenue growth year-on-year, and exceptional execution, respectively. Altogether, the team delivered core earnings per share of $1.68 and on revenue of $7.6 billion, resulting in a core operating margin of 4.6%, a 40 basis point increase year-on-year.\nAll in all, I'm pleased with the quarter as our performance during the first half of the year gives us positive momentum as we push towards the back half of fiscal '22 and into fiscal '23. And when I think about a key catalyst driving our momentum, what comes to mind is the makeup of our commercial portfolio, which I'll now address on the next slide.\nSlide 7 is a wonderful picture, which shows the construct of our portfolio today. Jabil's large-scale diversification serves as a solid foundation from which we run our business. The team has built the foundation over the past 5 to 6 years as we target new end markets and optimize our legacy business. The output of this effort is twofold: One, a higher level of resiliency across the company; and two, a substantial presence in secular end markets. Markets that include 5G, electric vehicles, personalized health care, cloud computing and clean energy.\nIf we dissect the pie chart a bit differently, with an emphasis on financial contribution and economic relevance, we see a terrific blend of reliable margins and sustainable cash flows. Again, a real tribute to the diversified nature of our business today.\nLastly, if we look at a third dimension of our portfolio, we find a library of essential capabilities, capabilities that allow us to simplify the complex for many of the world's most notable brands. And when done correctly, our unique set of capabilities offer Jabil a real competitive advantage as we lean into a massive market where things need to be built and supply chains need to be developed or modified.\nMoving on to Slide 8. You'll see management's outlook for the year. We've increased core earnings per share to $7.25, an increase of nearly 30% year-on-year. As for revenue, FY '22 now looks to be in the range of $32.6 billion, up more than 10% year-on-year. In addition, we remain committed to delivering a minimum of $700 million in free cash flow for the year while increasing core operating margin to 4.6%, a 40 basis point improvement year-on-year. For me, this is a positive testament on how the team is managing the business as our strategy has been consistent and what needs to be done is well understood throughout our company.\nWith that, let's move to my final slide, where I'd like to start with the importance of our purpose. At Jabil, with purpose comes expectations, expectations around certain behaviors. Behaviors such as keeping our people safe; servant leadership; protecting the environment; giving back to our communities; and offering a workplace which encompasses tolerance, respect and acceptance. Within Jabil, these behaviors have never been more important than they are today. I'm proud of our team as they fully grasp our purpose. And in doing so, their conduct is exceptional.\nIn closing, our improvement is steady, commercially, financially and operationally. Quite simply, here at Jabil, we build stuff, and we do it really well. One factor that makes good companies great is having a value set, a culture, if you will, that enhances the way in which they solve problems. As a team, we embrace this as we take on the challenges put forth by our customers each and every day. To our entire Jabil team, thank you for making Jabil, Jabil.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Dastoor\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark, and thank you for joining us today. I'm really pleased with the resiliency of our diversified portfolio and the sustainable broad-based momentum underway across the business as several of our end markets continue to benefit from long-term secular trends.\nAs Mark just summarized, our Q2 results were very strong. During the quarter, revenue, core operating income, core EPS and free cash flow all exceeded our December expectations. Given the higher revenue, I'm particularly pleased with our ability to drive an extra 30 basis points of margin improvement compared to our expectations in December, mainly through broad-based strength in several key end markets benefiting from long-term secular trends, as well as outstanding execution by our business, operations and supply chain teams.\nFor the quarter, revenue was approximately $7.6 billion, up 10.6% over the prior year quarter and ahead of the midpoint of our guidance from December. The additional upside was mainly driven by our 5G and cloud businesses, while our automotive, health care and retail end markets remained very strong.\nOur GAAP operating income during the quarter was $313 million, and our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $1.51. Core operating income during the quarter was $344 million, an increase of 21% year-over-year, representing a core operating margin of 4.6%, up 40 basis points over the prior year. Core diluted earnings per share was $1.68, a 32% improvement over the prior year quarter.\nNow turning to our second quarter segment results on the next slide. Revenue for our DMS segment was $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% on a year-over-year basis. The solid year-over-year performance in our DMS segment was broad-based with strength across our health care, automotive and connected devices businesses. Core margin for the segment came in at 5.1%.\nRevenue for our EMS segment came in at $3.8 billion, an increase of 19% on a year-over-year basis. The stronger year-over-year performance in our EMS segment was also broad-based with strength across our digital print and retail, industrial and semi cap and 5G wireless and cloud businesses. Core margin for the segment was 4%, up 90 basis points over the prior year, reflecting improved mix and solid execution by the team.\nTurning now to our cash flows and balance sheet. In Q2, inventory days came in at 86 days. The sequential increase in days was driven largely by 2 factors. Firstly, the ongoing tightness in the supply chain continues to weigh on our inventory balances. It's worth noting that we've offset a portion of these increases with inventory deposits from our customers, and these deposits reside within the accrued expenses line item on the balance sheet. Net of these inventory deposits, inventory days was 71 in Q2.\nAnd second, at the end of the quarter, we experienced a timing difference on the sell-through of finished goods within our DMS segment. I anticipate this timing difference to reverse in Q3.\nIn spite of these 2 factors impacting inventory, our second quarter cash flows from operations were very robust, coming in at $246 million, and net capital expenditures totaled $201 million.\nFrom a total debt to core EBITDA level, we exited the quarter at approximately 1.3x and with cash balances of $1.1 billion. During Q2, we repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares for $145 million. And for the year, we repurchased 4.4 million shares for $272 million as we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders.\nTurning now to our third quarter guidance on the next slide. DMS segment revenue is expected to increase 17% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4.2 billion, while the EMS segment revenue is expected to increase 11% on a year-over-year basis to approximately $4 billion. We expect total company revenue in the third quarter of fiscal '22 to be in the range of $7.9 billion to $8.5 billion.\nCore operating income is estimated to be in the range of $300 million to $360 million, representing a core margin range of 3.8% to 4.2%. At the midpoint, this is an improvement of 20 basis points over the prior year and down sequentially, reflecting planned investments in our Q3 quarter. It's also worth noting, sequentially in Q4, we expect robust core margins driven by our scaling automotive business, along with typical seasonality in our mobility and EMS businesses.\nIn Q3, GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $276 million to $336 million. Core diluted earnings per share is estimated to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.80. GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.64. The core tax rate in the third quarter is estimated to be approximately 21%.\nNext, I'd like to take a few moments to highlight our balanced portfolio of businesses by end market. Today, the outlook for our business is strong with end markets across both segments continuing to benefit from multiyear secular trends. We believe these markets will continue to drive our growth as we concentrate our efforts on long-term secular growth markets with strong margin and cash flow dynamics. Markets such as electric vehicles, personalized medicine and health care, semi-cap, clean and smart energy infrastructure, cloud, 5G infrastructure and the associated connected devices.\nOur electric vehicle business, in particular, continues to outperform in spite of global supply chain issues as the transition to EV accelerates. We've seen this rapid acceleration manifest in top line revenue growth in excess of 50% this year alone in our automotive end market.\nWe're also expecting double-digit growth from the health care, automotive retail, industrial and semi cap and 5G wireless and cloud end markets. And importantly, the broad-based growth associated with these secular trends is expected to drive solid year-over-year core operating margin and free cash flow expansion.\nAll in all, our performance during the first half of the year gives us excellent momentum as we look to close out another strong year. We're now anticipating core EPS will be in the neighborhood of $7.25 per share on revenue of approximately $32.6 billion. Notably, this incremental revenue will improve mix and drive operating leverage, thereby giving us the confidence to raise our core margin by 10 basis points to 4.6% for FY '22 as we continue to drive the organization to 5% and beyond.\nImportantly, for the year, we also remain committed to generating in excess of $700 million in free cash flow in spite of the higher revenue and associated working capital. We've been working extremely hard as a team to expand margins and drive strong cash flows. I am very pleased with our team's exceptional execution of our strategy on all fronts.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Adam.\n\nAdam Berry\n\nVP of IR, Jabil Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. Before we move into the Q&A portion of the call, I'd like to remind our participants that we cannot address customer-specific or product-specific questions. Thanks.\nOperator, we're now ready for Q&A."

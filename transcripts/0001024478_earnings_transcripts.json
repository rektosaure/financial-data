I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Christian Rothe, our CFO.\nOur results were released earlier this morning and the press losing charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts [ includes and ] our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.\nA webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. I'll make a couple of initial comments before we turn to our fourth quarter results. When we introduce guidance for fiscal year 2025 last November amid a mixed set of headwinds and tailwinds for growth, much of the discussion centered on additional detail around the cost reduction and margin expansion actions we initiated in 2024. With the top line guidance range that included limited growth, we knew it would be a challenge to both absorb higher costs and expand margins.\nSo with the very busy 12 months of fiscal year '25 in the books, I'm proud of the team's execution as we have returned to top line growth and continue to reduce costs. Rockwell is well positioned for sustained market-leading growth and profitability as we build on this success for fiscal '26 and beyond.\nWe closed the year with another strong quarter of outperformance versus our expectations, including double-digit year-over-year growth in both sales and operating earnings. Our differentiated portfolio price discipline and continued focus on productivity all contributed to this great finish to the year. Free cash flow was also very good in the quarter and for the year. As we will discuss, we're taking further steps to streamline the organization and increase efficiency in the service of customer value and expanded margins.\nUncertainty remains but it's clear that countries around the world are more aware than ever of the strategic importance of investing in advanced manufacturing capabilities and capacity. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the U.S., our home market.\nLet's now turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. Both reported and organic Q4 sales were up double digits versus prior year. While we did have favorable comps from a year-over-year standpoint, Q4 sales grew high single digits sequentially, which was better than we expected. Organic year-over-year sales growth of 13% was led by continued strength in our product businesses. Similar to the last 2 quarters, CapEx activity and longer cycle businesses remain muted with customers holding off on larger investments.\nOn our last earnings call, we flagged the potential for Q4 pull-ins into Q3. Based on our analysis of daily orders and sales trends, inventory levels in our channel and machine builder surveys, pull-in orders were less than expected in Q3 and not evident in Q4. Annual recurring revenue was up 8% in the quarter. While some customers continue to delay discretionary services spending, we did have a number of large software and services wins around the world in Q4.\nOne notable win was with Stanley Electric, a Japanese Tier 1 automotive supplier, who will deploy our cloud-native Plex platform across 25 global sites. We also secured a key cybersecurity win in life sciences with GSK selecting our Verve platform as their new standard for asset vulnerability management to be deployed across 33 sites over the next 5 years.\nIn our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales were up 14% and versus prior year and up low double digits sequentially. Strong sequential growth in the quarter was driven by our power control business, where a combination of our existing business and our Cubic acquisition is helping us win competitive projects around the world. A good example of this was our win with [indiscernible] Systems, a Spanish system integrator, who will be providing a flexible and compact motor control system for Africa's largest desalination plant. I'll share some additional power control wins later on the call.\nWe also had a good quarter in our Clearpath business with double-digit year-over-year growth in our auto-autonomous mobile robot business. I'm pleased with how this acquisition continues to add new ways to win and expand our customer base. Our AMR business grew double digits in fiscal '25 and we are optimistic about fiscal '26 as we plan for Clearpath to turn profitable in the year.\nSoftware & Control organic sales in the quarter grew 30% year-over-year, led by continued momentum in our Logix business, both versus prior year and sequentially. On the software front, Plex and Fiix continue to add new logos as we augment our existing sales force with new go-to-market partners. One of our Plex software wins in Q4 was with THG, a U.K.-based global e-commerce leader in beauty and nutrition as customer chose our cloud native MES and quality management solution to eliminate manual processes and drive further operational efficiency.\nOrganic sales in Lifecycle Services were down 4% versus prior year, slightly below our expectations. Book-to-bill and this segment was 0.9%, consistent with our historical Q4 seasonality. We continue to see project delays across both our core business and Sensia, as customers wait for more clarity and stability around the impact of trade and policy on their operations.\nRegarding our Sensia joint venture with SLB. Following a strategic review, both paired companies have decided to pursue an orderly dissolution Rockwell will assume 100% ownership of the process automation business that we initially contributed to the joint venture, and SLB will again fully own the parts that they contributed. After the expected close of the transaction in the first half of this year, fiscal '26, Rockwell will realize lower revenue but higher operating margin going forward due to the deconsolidation. Rockwell's resulting sales into the oil and gas vertical will be about 10%, but with a simplified go-to-market motion. That go-to-market approach continues to include SLB as an important partner with deeper relationships [ than ] the 2 companies had 6 years ago.\nI want to be clear that Sensia did not meet our long-term expectations. That is why SLB and Rockwell have jointly agreed to make this change. However, the changes we are making demonstrate our continued commitment to the oil and gas market, and we are well positioned to grow in this space. Our portfolio has expanded since the JV was launched with new process IO and process safety capabilities from Logix, an industry-leading portfolio of cloud-native software applications and deeper domain expertise. Importantly, we have taken this step in order to grow in this vertical with improved profitability going forward. Christian will add more detail on the financial impact in the quarter and the benefits going forward later on the call.\nTurning back to our fourth quarter. Rockwell's overall segment margin of 22.5% and adjusted EPS of $3.34 were well above our expectations, driven by higher volume and strong productivity. We ended this fiscal year with over $325 million of structural productivity savings, exceeding our original target of $250 million. Similar to last quarter, tariffs did not have a meaningful impact on our results in Q4. Christian will talk more about tariffs and the expected fiscal '26 impact in a few moments.\nMoving to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 industry performance. Sales in [ discrete ] were up 20% year-over-year with strong growth in e-commerce and warehouse automation and good performance in automotive. Automotive sales exceeded our expectations in the quarter, with low double-digit growth versus prior year. The industry continues to shift from an EV focus to a mix of traditional ICE, hybrid and electric vehicle offerings. Rockwell has good technical solutions and expertise for all of these types of vehicles.\nE-commerce and warehouse automation delivered another standout quarter with sales growing over 70% year-over-year. This quarter, Rockwell secured a significant European win with another global logistics and parcel handling company. The customer selected our FactoryTalk Optix platform and digital services to digitize and expand operations across 28 sorting facilities. While our data center business is still relatively small, we continue to see strong double-digit growth with multiple wins across the globe. This quarter, Rockwell won a project with Alternative Heat Ltd., to supply modular cooling panels for large data centers in Europe. The rise of AI data centers is driving demand for faster deployment, advanced cooling solutions and secure industrial grade control platforms, our Logix control platform and modular power distribution technology are well positioned to meet these needs. We'll share more about our differentiation and growth in the data center space at our Investor Day later this month.\nTurning to our hybrid industries. We saw double-digit growth across food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences. In food and beverage, our customers are prioritizing productivity and operational efficiency in existing facilities. The industry is going through a period of consolidation restructuring and evolving consumer preferences. While this dynamic might delay some of the larger CapEx investments near term, we continue to build a strong pipeline of new capacity projects both globally and in the U.S.\nIn the quarter, Electrolit Manufacturing selected Rockwell as a key automation and digital partner for their state-of-the-art beverage blending and bottling facility in Waco, Texas. This is Electorlit's first greenfield in the U.S. Sales growth in our life sciences vertical was also strong in Q4, and exceeded our expectations. We continue to see growth in our software and cybersecurity services across the product life cycle. We're also seeing increased automation adoption in the medical device segment. One of the important wins here this quarter was with [ Howard Miller ], where our Independent Cart Technology is helping accelerate and optimize production of a high-speed auto injector line for the obesity drug market. [ During ] the process, sales in this segment grew 10% with year-over-year growth across all industries.\nSimilar to last quarter, process customers are focusing on driving efficiency and profitability in their existing facilities as they continue to grapple with weaker demand and low commodity prices. Rockwell's technology is well suited for both greenfield and brownfield investments as demonstrated by several large wins in the quarter in energy, mining and metals. A good example of this was our win with Vale Base Metals, where Arc-resistant power control systems are modernizing their Sudbury mill to significantly enhance safety and operational efficiency. This win positions Rockwell as a key automation partner in one of Canada's most critical mining operations.\nTurning to Slide 5 [ on Q4 ] organic regional sales. North America had a strong finish to the year and was once again our best-performing region in the quarter. We expect North America to continue to be our strongest region in fiscal '26. Last quarter, we announced a $2 billion investment over the next 5 years to modernize infrastructure grow talent and enhance digital capabilities. These initiatives are now underway and will unlock future growth and margin expansion with the U.S. as the primary beneficiary. We'll share more in the months ahead.\nLet's move to Slide 6 for key highlights of full year fiscal 2025. Our reported and organic sales were up about 1% versus prior year. Total ARR grew 8% with solid performance in our Software as a Service business. We ended the year with segment margin of 20.4% and adjusted EPS of $10.53. The improvement of over 100 basis points in year-over-year segment margin was driven by our cost reduction and margin expansion actions and strong price discipline. Free cash flow conversion of 114% exceeded our expectations for the year. I'm proud of our execution to get back above 100% free cash flow conversion, which remains an important part of our financial framework.\nLet's now move to Slide 7 to review our fiscal 2026 outlook. As we look to fiscal '26, we are confident in our ability to gain share and expand margins. We are less certain about the overall macro and geopolitical environment as well as the timing of the CapEx investment recovery in our key verticals. Increased stability and trade policy will help unlock additional capital spending. We expect our reported sales growth for the year to be in the 3% to 7% range. The midpoint of our guide assumes a sequential sales decline in Q1, which is typical followed by gradual sequential improvement in the subsequent quarters. Christian will provide more detail on this and the expected impact from price and tariffs in this section.\nAnnual recurring revenue is slated to grow high single digits next year. We expect our segment margin to expand by over 100 basis points, and our adjusted EPS is projected to be $11.70 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow conversion of 100% in fiscal year '26.\nBefore I turn it over to Christian, I want to reiterate how proud I am of the execution of the team in the quarter and throughout the year. To be sure, there remain plenty of opportunities for continued improvement, and we are taking action to further our progress throughout the coming year and beyond. As we'll discuss in less than 2 weeks at Investor Day, keys to execution includes strengthening a high-performance culture, accelerating top line growth, expanding margin and continuing our progress in operational excellence. And these are the elements of the Rockwell operating model.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Christian.\n\nChristian E. Rothe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Graco, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blake. Good morning, everyone. Before I get into our strong fourth quarter results, I want to spend a few minutes highlighting some of our onetime items unique to Q4, so you understand how they flow through the P&L and where adjustments were made.\nAt a high level, all these changes are outlined on Slide 8. For additional financial details, please also refer to Slides 21 and 22. First, starting in Q4, we're introducing a new engineering and development expense line in our statement of operations. This aligns with the SEC's expanded segment disclosure rules and enhances visibility into key metrics that inform management decisions. particularly total innovation spend. Engineering and development includes what you typically think of as R&D, which has been about 6% of sales historically. And our sustaining engineering spend, which maintains existing technology and has been about 2% of sales. Reclassifying these costs from cost of sales to operating expenses increases gross margin by about 8 points with no impact to the total P&L. This change was applied consistently across historical periods, as shown in the Q4 earnings slide deck appendix, Page 21.\nImportantly, this move improves visibility into Rockwell's total development spend, aligns our reporting with industrial [ intact ] peers and provides a more meaningful view of gross margin performance. Second, we're making a change to how we treat certain costs related to our legacy asbestos exposure, which is unrelated to our ongoing operations. Historically, we expensed the defense cost for these claims as they were incurred. In Q4, we changed our accounting policy to a full horizon accrual for defense costs, consistent with how we account for indemnity. All told, inclusive of the indemnity and the defense cost accrual update, the result was a onetime pretax charge of $136 million or $0.91 per share in the fourth quarter. This is the accrual portion of the changes.\nBecause these costs are not tied to current operations, we are also updating our definition of adjusted income and adjusted EPS to exclude legacy asbestos and environmental charges. In Q4, this change excluded $141 million in pretax charges or $0.94 per share from adjusted earnings. That includes the $136 million accrual as well as $5 million of normal asbestos and environmental spend we incurred in the fourth quarter. The EPS impact is $0.91 from the accrual and $0.03 from the normal spend, both now excluded.\nFor full year fiscal 2025, the definition change increased adjusted EPS by $1.03, with $0.91 from the Q4 accrual update and $0.12 from -- excluding legacy asbestos and environmental costs that we incurred for the full year. Without the definition change to adjusted EPS and excluding other onetime items in the quarter, Q4 adjusted earnings would have grown 34% compared to the 32% under the new definition. For the full year, EPS growth was unchanged under the new definition. When compared to our previous guide, the Q4 change, excluding onetimes, was a net benefit of $0.03. For the full year, the net benefit was $0.12.\nMoving to the third item on the slide, we recorded an impairment in our Sensia business following the decision to dissolve the JV, which Blake discussed. The net result is a noncash impairment charge of $110 million or $0.97 per share net of tax and the NCI adjustment. For reference, the approximate annualized impact from the planned dissolution will be a $250 million revenue reduction and virtually no impact on operating earnings. The approximate margin benefit to Rockwell on an annualized basis will be an increase of about 50 basis points.\nAnd finally, in Q4, we made a voluntary $70 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan. As Blake mentioned earlier, we delivered 114% and free cash flow conversion for the year, inclusive of that contribution. Excluding the contribution, our conversion was 119%, with free cash flow reaching a record $1.4 billion and reflective of strong operational execution and solid performance across the P&L. All financials reported in our earnings release, conference call presentation and in our 10-K, which will be filed next week, reflect these changes.\nTurning to our financial results. Let's go on to Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 14% versus prior year, exceeding our expectations and closing 2025 on a strong note. About 1 point of growth came from currency. About 4 points of our organic growth came from price with about 1 point of that coming from tariff-based pricing. Price/cost was favorable in the quarter. Company gross margins under our new reporting methodology expanded 290 basis points year-over-year and segment operating margin increased 240 basis points. While tariffs had a neutral impact on EPS, they did cause a slight margin dilution in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $3.34 was above our expectations, primarily due to outperformance on revenue better segment mix and favorable price. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was about 18%, up from about 15% last year, driven by higher discrete benefits in the prior year. For the full year, fiscal 2025, our adjusted EPR was 17%. Free cash flow in Q4 was $405 million and was $38 million higher than the prior year.\nSlide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 19.8% decreased 90 basis points year-over-year due to a tough comparison with last year's Clearpath earnout reversal and higher compensation this year, resulting in the incremental in the teens. Excluding the earnout reversal, incrementals would have been about 30%. Software & Control margin of 31.2% was up 880 basis points versus prior year, driven by outstanding 30% organic sales growth and good price realization. The segment saw year-over-year incrementals in the high 50s.\nLife cycle services margin of 17.5% was up 30 basis points year-over-year, a mid-single-digit organic sales decline and higher comp would normally have driven segment margin lower year-over-year. However, the team continued to deliver strong project execution and higher productivity. Overall, for Rockwell, the incremental margin on the year-over-year sales growth was about 40% in Q4.\nI want to take a moment to point out the sequential movement we saw in each of our segments. Intelligent Devices had sequential incrementals in the high 20s on low double-digit sales growth, reflecting seasonal shipments of [ configure to order ], which created a sequential negative mix. Software & Control sequential incrementals were in the low 20s with modest sequential sales growth after a very strong Q3. Lifecycle services saw similar sequential dollar growth in both sales and segment earnings, yielding 100% conversion on strong project execution. Overall, for Rockwell, the incremental margin on the sequential sales growth was in the high 30s.\nLet's move to the next Slide 11 for the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal 2024 to Q4 of fiscal 2025. Year-over-year, core performance had a $1.45 impact in Q4. Software & Control is the primary driver of both sales and earnings growth in the quarter. The largest driver in our core was volume, followed by structural productivity and price. Compensation had a $0.45 impact in Q4 compared to our prior expectation of about $0.30 of impact driven by our outperformance in the quarter. Full year compensation expense, which includes merit and bonus ended the year at $255 million. As I mentioned earlier, we are lapping the prior year benefit from a Clearpath earnout reversal this quarter. With some other onetime items, this resulted in a $0.15 headwind.\nSlide 12 provides full year 2025 key financial information. Reported and organic sales increased 1% to $8.3 billion, 200 basis points better than our original guidance midpoint for the year. Currency was neutral. Full year segment margin of 20.4% increased 110 basis points from last year and [ was up ] 140 basis points better than our original [ guide ]. The increase was due to our margin expansion and cost reduction actions, price and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher compensation and unfavorable net currency. Adjusted EPS of $10.53 was up 7% and well over $1 better than the midpoint of our initial guide for the year. For the year, we deployed about $1 billion of capital towards dividends and share repurchases, while we continue to pause on our inorganic revenue. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.\nMoving on to the next slide, 13, to discuss our guidance for the full year. Our organic sales growth guidance is 2% to 6% or 4% at the midpoint. We expect about 100 basis points of currency benefit, so reported revenue growth is expected to be 5% at the midpoint. Our guidance does not include the anticipated impact from the Sensia dissolution. Once the JV is dissolved, we'll update our FY '26 guide for the remainder of the year. As we mentioned, this will reduce reported revenue and increased margin percentage but have no significant impact on EPS.\nOur segment operating margin guidance is 21.5%, more than 100 basis points higher than -- higher year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS guidance is a range of $11.20 to $12.20, or $11.60 at the midpoint. We expect a couple of points of price for fiscal 2026, 1% on underlying price and 1% from tariff price. From this growth, we expect our FY '26 incremental margin to exceed 40%, inclusive of tariff-based pricing.\nLooking ahead to 2026 capital expenditures, we plan to increase investments in plant and digital infrastructure with targeted CapEx spending of about 3% of sales. In terms of the calendarization, as Blake mentioned, we expect a sequential decline in Q1, followed by a gradual sequential improvement in subsequent quarters. This is true for both sales and margins as we progress through the year.\nNow let me share some additional color on our first quarter. In Q1, we expect overall company sales to be down low double digits sequentially, given normal seasonality and the continued uncertainty and slower CapEx activity. With that said, we do expect good year-over-year growth in both sales and margins with total company segment margins in the high teens range. This translates to more than 25% year-over-year growth for adjusted EPS. From a business segment standpoint, Intelligent Devices sales in Q1 are expected to be down low double digits sequentially due to ongoing softness in our configure-to-order shipments. As a result, we expect Intelligent Devices segment margins to be in the mid- to high teens. Software & Control margin is expected to be in the high 20s in the first quarter on sequential sales declines in the high single digits. Lifecycle services sales are expected to be down high single digits sequentially, driven by a combination of both normal seasonality and continued CapEx project delays. We expect segment margin for Lifecycle services in the low double digits.\nFor the full year, we expect segment sales and margin as follows: Intelligent Devices reported sales growth is expected to be in the mid- to high single digits. We expect margins in the high teens to low 20s or 150 to 200 basis points higher year-over-year, driven by continued progress on productivity. Software & Control reported sales growth is expected to be mid-single digits. We expect margins in the low 30s, up slightly year-over-year and driven by better volume and price. Lifecycle Services reported sales growth is expected to be flattish. We expect margins in the low teens, lower than last year. Let's turn to Slide 14 for our adjusted EPS walk for the full year. Our core is expected to be $1.40 for the year. Included in our core is productivity, which is the term we are using for operationalizing our ongoing focus on cost reduction and margin expansion. FX is expected to be a $0.20 tailwind. We expect our adjusted effective tax rate this year to be 20%, reflecting the implementation of BEPS Pillar Two. The resulting EPS headwind from tax is $0.40. A few additional comments on fiscal 2026 guidance for your models. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $100 million. Since we are no longer including legacy asbestos and environmental costs and other income, corporate and other expense is about $18 million lower than it was -- than it otherwise would have been for the year. Net interest expense for fiscal 2026 is expected to be about $120 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 112.7 million shares, and we are targeting approximately $500 million worth of share repurchases during the year.\nI'd like to thank the global Rockwell team for outstanding execution that allowed us to exceed our cost reduction and margin expansion targets and company guidance for fiscal '25. This organization is ready to build on this momentum and deliver another strong year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Christian.

We had a diverse set of strategic wins in the quarter across discrete, hybrid and process industry segments. I'll highlight some of these in a few minutes.\nWe're also making good progress on our journey to the segment margin goals we introduced at our November 2023 Investor Day. This is large due to very good progress on our enterprise-wide productivity programs even as more of the year-over-year savings shifts from the initial G&A reductions to direct material costs and indirect services cost savings and operational efficiencies. We have already achieved our full year goal of $250 million in year-over-year productivity a quarter earlier than we anticipated, and I'm proud of how our organization has operationalized our ambitious productivity and continuing improving targets.\nWe're also making good progress on our journey to the segment margin goals we introduced at our November 2023 Investor Day.

Importantly, we intend to take bold steps to continue our progress. Over the next 5 years, we will invest over $2 billion in plants, digital infrastructure and talent to grow share, build resilience and expand margins. The United States will be the largest beneficiary of these investments, which are primarily CapEx. These investments will complement our robust productivity programs to drive our global growth and margin expansion goals. We'll go into more detail on the scope and milestones tied to these investments in November, but it will include thoughtful implementation of automation to drive plant efficiency talent to fuel our highest return offerings and an AI-first business system to provide unmatched employee, partner and customer experiences.\nPrice cost also remains favorable including the net impact from tariffs, which was minimal in the quarter. Importantly, we intend to take bold steps to continue our progress. Over the next 5 years, we will invest over $2 billion in plants, digital infrastructure and talent to grow share, build resilience and expand margins.

While most customers continue to prioritize their spending on the productivity and efficiency of existing capacity, some are advancing their strategic plans for larger CapEx projects, including greenfields. Similar to last quarter, our total company book-to-bill was about 1.0 with year-over-year orders growth in the Americas, EMEA and Asia. Q3 sales were above our expectations. Reported sales were up 5%, and our organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year, with currency contributing less than 1 point of growth in the quarter. Similar to last quarter, product sales were better than some of the longer-cycle businesses, which tend to be more capital intensive. It's likely there were some customer pull-ins in the quarter, and we'll talk more about that in a minute.\nTurning to our third quarter results on Slide 3.

It's likely there were some customer pull-ins in the quarter, and we'll talk more about that in a minute.\nAnnual recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter, below our expectations. Double-digit growth in our cloud native software business was offset by relative weakness in recurring services, mainly driven by delays in cybersecurity investments. From a business segment standpoint, our Intelligent Devices organic sales were up 1% versus prior year, with double-digit growth in products more than offsetting the year-over-year decline in our longer cycle configure to order business. We leveraged our differentiated intelligent devices portfolio to secure some new capacity wins both in greenfield and brownfield applications.\nAnnual recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter, below our expectations.

We leveraged our differentiated intelligent devices portfolio to secure some new capacity wins both in greenfield and brownfield applications.\nOne of these wins was with Freshpet, a leading pet food manufacturer who is looking to expand their fresh food production capacity with a new processing plant in Ennis, Texas. Freshpet chose Rockwell for our standardized designs, product interoperability and a differentiated motor control center offering to help accelerate time to market at this greenfield. Another strategic MCC win in the quarter was also in the food and beverage space with Incobrasa Industries, a Brazilian soybean processing and biodiesel manufacturing company that is expanding in the United States. Rockwell was selected as Incobrasa's official automation partner for their new state-of-the-art facility in Central Illinois.\nOne of these wins was with Freshpet, a leading pet food manufacturer who is looking to expand their fresh food production capacity with a new processing plant in Ennis, Texas.

We're making good progress in integrating the auto AMR platform with our overall road map for autonomous operations and improve profitability even in a period of subdued customer CapEx investment. Software & Control organic sales grew 22% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our hardware business. Logic sales were up over 30% versus prior year and up low double digits sequentially. Our SaaS business grew 10% year-over-year with strategic wins across FLEX and FIX.\nClearpath sales were up double digits, but continue to be affected by CapEx delays in automotive.

Lifecycle Services organic sales declined 6% versus prior year, but were largely in line with our expectations given the difficult year-over-year comparison. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.06 and was above 1.0 across all the contributing businesses. As we expected, customers continued to delay larger capital projects in Q3, waiting for more clarity and certainty around the impact of trade and policy on their input cost and volume.\nThis engagement is a testament to the strength of the ongoing relationship and our mutual focus on building the future of mining together through co-innovation.

Let's move to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 industry performance. Our discrete sales grew 10% versus prior year, driven by growth in automotive and e-commerce and warehouse automation. While most of our automotive covers continue to delay their capital investments, we had a large number of wins in the quarter. One of these brownfield projects in Q3 was to help Hyundai Motor Group expand their hybrid electric vehicle production in Georgia as they transition from EV only to a multi-energy production model, which addresses evolving consumer demand.\nRockwell's segment margin of 21.2% and adjusted EPS of $2.82 were both above our expectations, mainly due to higher volume and strong execution on our cost reduction and margin expansion actions.

E-commerce and warehouse automation sales were up 30% year-over-year with continued strength across all customer segments. In addition to our core automation offering, we're seeing more interest in autonomous material movement as our customers realize the benefits of our auto platform. Whether it is basic station to station movement or handling complex payloads, Rockwell is uniquely positioned to help scale AMR fleets to the operational needs of our customers and integrate with the rest of their automation.\nAnother important automotive win this quarter was with Lucid Motors who chose our FactoryTalk MES for their state-of-the-art greenfield facility in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Sales in this segment increased high single digits versus prior year with good growth across Food & Beverage, Home & Personal Care and Life Sciences. I already talked about some of our strategic wins in food and bev earlier on the call. We continue to see strong year and sequential growth at our packaging OEMs as they continue to invest in their next-generation machines for both food and beverage and HPC end users.\nMoving to our hybrid industries.

While tariff uncertainty has caused a number of end-user project delays. We continue to build a strong pipeline of projects with both machine builders and end users. Our strong software and digital services capabilities continue to differentiate us in the fast-growing GLP-1 space. This quarter, Rockwell was selected by Thermo Fisher to help accelerate production of GLP-1 injectables for new capacity expansion by cutting their MES implementation time line in half.\nSales in our Life Sciences vertical were up high single digits in Q3.

Our sales in this segment were down low single digits. From a broader process standpoint, energy, chemicals, mining and metals are all facing pressure from weak global demand and volatile commodity prices, which is hampering their ability to invest. With that said, each end market is selectively redirecting capital to their high strategic priorities including mirror sustainability and modernization goals. In energy, we do have both the technical portfolio and market access to participate in an all-of-the-above strategy to meet accelerating capacity needs. And we had examples of both traditional fossil fuel and renewables wins in the quarter.\nTurning to Process Industries. Our sales in this segment were down low single digits.

Once again, North America was our best-performing region in the quarter, and we expect it to be our strongest region for the full fiscal year 2025.\nMoving to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. Once again, North America was our best-performing region in the quarter, and we expect it to be our strongest region for the full fiscal year 2025.\nLet's now turn to Slide 6 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. To be sure, we continue to operate in a volatile environment. It's good to have the U.S. tax bill in place, continued low unemployment and to see some progress on tariff negotiations. However, U.S. trade policy with some important countries remains uncertain and geopolitical risk remains elevated. Accordingly, our top line outlook for the second half of this fiscal year is largely unchanged with a slight increase to our prior guide due to tariff-related price increases and favorable currency. We do see a modest shift forward in the calendarization of our sales between our fiscal third and fourth quarters.\nLet's now turn to Slide 6 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook.

We do see a modest shift forward in the calendarization of our sales between our fiscal third and fourth quarters.\nGiven the continued trade uncertainty, we think some customers have pulled forward orders from Q4 to Q3 in order to mitigate risk and secure critical components. We now expect our reported and organic sales growth for the year to be in the positive 1% to negative 2% range. The midpoint of our guide assumes low single-digit sequential sales growth in Q4. We expect our annual recurring revenue to grow high single digits this year. We continue to expect our full year segment margin to be about 20% and we are increasing our adjusted EPS outlook to be $10 at the midpoint. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 100% in fiscal '25.\nGiven the continued trade uncertainty, we think some customers have pulled forward orders from Q4 to Q3 in order to mitigate risk and secure critical components.

Rothe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Graco, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 5% versus prior year, with minimal impact from currency. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price. While price cost was favorable, about 1 point of our price realization was from tariff-based pricing, which was neutral to EPS, benefits from cost reduction and margin expansion actions and price realization more than offset higher compensation.\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone.

While price cost was favorable, about 1 point of our price realization was from tariff-based pricing, which was neutral to EPS, benefits from cost reduction and margin expansion actions and price realization more than offset higher compensation.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.82 was above our expectations, primarily due to the beat on the sales line as well as segment operating margin. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 15.2%, above the prior year rate of 13.3%, primarily due to lower discrete tax benefits. We continue to expect a 17% ETR for fiscal 2025. Free cash flow of $489 million was $251 million higher than the prior year versus 153% in the third quarter.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.82 was above our expectations, primarily due to the beat on the sales line as well as segment operating margin.

While sales and Lifecycle Services came in as expected, performance in Intelligent Devices and software and control exceeded expectations with product growth more than offsetting the decline in our configure-to-order businesses. All segments executed well on our cost reduction and margin expansion targets, helping absorb the year-over-year increase in compensation expense. As a reminder, we did not have any incentive compensation costs in the same quarter of last year. Intelligent Devices margin of 18.8% decreased by 140 basis points year-over-year. against one of their most difficult comps of the prior year, primarily due to the higher compensation expense I just mentioned.\nSlide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments.

We continue to see good price realization in this segment. Software & Control margin of 31.6% was up 800 basis points versus prior year, driven by double-digit volume growth and strong price realization. The segment saw year-over-year incrementals in the high [ 60s ]. Lifecycle services margin of 13.3% was down 600 basis points year-over-year. A mid-single-digit sales decline against record segment margins that had no incentive expense in the prior year, drove the decrementals in the quarter.\nGiven the small year-over-year dollar change in sales in this segment, decrementals are not as meaningful this quarter.

Intelligent Devices had incrementals that were in the 30s from Q2 to Q3, reflecting revenue improvement, cost reduction and margin expansion execution and strong price realization, partially offset by tariff costs, compensation and FX. Software and control sequential incrementals were in the mid-40s, with strong volume, partially offset by higher compensation. Lifecycle Services saw a small sequential dollar changes in both sales and segment earnings with higher compensation being the driver of lower margins.\nI want to take a moment to point out the sequential movement we saw in each of our segments.

Software and control sequential incrementals were in the mid-40s, with strong volume, partially offset by higher compensation. Lifecycle Services saw a small sequential dollar changes in both sales and segment earnings with higher compensation being the driver of lower margins.\nOverall, for Rockwell, the incremental margin on the sequential sales growth was in the low 30s. This rises to the mid-30s if you exclude tariff-based pricing and cost, which again was EPS neutral. The next Slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal 2024 to Q3 fiscal 2025. Year-over-year, core conversion was close to 60% and contributed $0.35 to our EPS on the 4% organic sales increase. Software & control was the primary driver of both sales and earnings growth in the quarter, where we saw margin expansion on continued improvement in logic sales. Pricing was strong for the company, and we continue to fund new product development with company R&D at 6% of total revenue.\nOverall, for Rockwell, the incremental margin on the sequential sales growth was in the low 30s.

You'll see a $0.60 impact from compensation. Our Q3 outperformance and higher guidance for the year brings with it increased incentive expense. As I said earlier, we had no annual bonus expense last year. We expect about $0.30 of compensation costs in Q4. Full year compensation expense, which includes merit and bonus is expected to be about $230 million. Currency with a $0.15 EPS headwind as the timing and movement of exchange rates, particularly in some of our foreign production locations such as Mexico and Poland, created transactional headwinds. All other items resulted in a $0.09 net headwind.\nWe saw excellent execution on our cost reduction and margin expansion actions, which were above our expectations, resulting in a $0.60 tailwind.

We narrowed our sales guidance range this quarter, raising the midpoint of our reported sales guidance to a negative [ 15% ] sales decline year-over-year. This reflects a slight increase from our prior organic sales guide, 0.5 point, driven by tariff-based price increases in the second half. The other portion of our sales midpoint guidance increase comes from currency as we now expect the full year FX impact to be neutral to sales and a $0.10 headwind to EPS. Our segment operating margin guidance of about 20% is unchanged.\nMoving on to the next slide, 10, to discuss our updated guidance for the full year.

With our updated guidance, we expect Q4 will be up low single digits sequentially after a high single-digit sequential increase in Q3. Segment operating margins exceeded expectations for Q3. For Q4, we expect margins to be similar to Q3 on slightly higher revenue with unfavorable mix offsetting the sequential volume leverage. We are updating our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $9.80 to $10.20 or $10 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance increase reflects our strong operating performance and continued progress on our cost reduction and margin expansion [indiscernible].\nLast quarter, we talked about low single-digit sequential sales growth in Q3 and high single-digit sequential growth in Q4.

Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $155 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $140 million, and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 113 million shares. Our share buybacks in Q3 were approximately 500,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $123 million. As of June 30, approximately $1 billion remains available under our existing share repurchase authorization.\nAdditional comments on fiscal 2025 guidance for your models.

First, let's talk about tariffs and our assessment of possible pull-in activity. We continue to expect the EPS impact of tariffs for fiscal '25 to be mitigated through resiliency actions and price increases. The EPS impact in the third quarter was close to 0, while about 1 point of our sales growth in Q3 was attributable to tariff-based pricing. With regard to [ Poland ], as Blake mentioned, we are not seeing a notable inflection in underlying customer demand. We have a strong process to identify and address obvious attempts to buy ahead of announced tariff-based price increases and we have canceled some orders as a result. That being said, we think it's possible that pull-ins accounted for at most 2 to 3 points of our growth in the third quarter.\nMoving on, I want to expand on a few topics.

Second, our cost reduction and margin expansion initiative reached a major milestone this past order. This program was initiated midway through our last fiscal year with some very ambitious goals, $100 million of cost savings in the second half of fiscal 2024 and another $250 million of savings in fiscal '25. We exceeded our goal and delivered $110 million of savings in fiscal '24. This year, we [ achieved ] our full year target of $250 million of savings in only 3 quarters. All told, that is $360 million in structural cost savings achieved over 5 quarters. Our team has performed extremely well for the past 1.5 years, and we are all grateful for their efforts. Well done.\nOur thesis for the second half remains intact and we believe any pull-ins that may have happened were largely just Q3, Q4 timing differences.

This bridges the gap to take the program from an event and turn it into a way of life. The team is prepared. Now that we have achieved our targets, we are going to transition the tracking of our cost reduction and margin expansion program into core in our reporting structure because by operationalizing this work into our day to day, it is now becoming part of our core.\nAt our last Investor Day, we shared our Rockwell operating model.

As Blake shared earlier, we intend to invest $2 billion over the next 5 years. This is inclusive of OpEx and CapEx for plants, digital infrastructure and talent. To be clear, a portion of this will include brick-and-mortar. We will share additional information on our Investor Day in November, but know that each element of this program will have a clear ROI aimed at enhancing competitiveness, expanding margins, and positioning Rockwell for long-term growth. We believe in the power of industrial automation and digital transformation. That's true for our customers. It's also true for us. This investment reflects our conviction.\nFinally, let's talk about the next few years and the art of the possible as well as some of the areas where we have developing programs.

We are now focusing on long lead time actions that will help us define and drive the next phase of our operating margin expansion. That's this program, investing today to help expand margins in the future and to help us achieve the next set of goals. Some other items for your long-term model. CapEx as a percentage of sales, which has historically hovered around 2%, could range between 2.5% to 4% in any given year as we make ROI-based decisions on brick-and-mortar, digital infrastructure and capital equipment. R&D spending as a percentage of sales will remain targeted at around 6%. We believe this is important to support our growth engine.\nWith our progress on price, productivity and strong operating performance, we are in a good path to reach the segment margin targets we introduced in 2023.

First, as we have mentioned in the past, we will become subject to Best Pillar 2 in fiscal '26. Current framework could cause our effective tax rate to increase 2 to 3 percentage points in fiscal '26, resulting in an EPS headwind. Second, as it relates to the new U.S. tax bill, we don't expect it to provide significant savings to Rockwell, primarily due to our international structure and minimum tax laws. We do believe, however, that accelerated depreciation can drive investment by our small and medium-sized customers. This is a sweet spot for Rockwell, particularly with the help of our partners.\nA couple of notes on upcoming tax changes.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julienne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter fiscal 2025 Earnings Release Conference Call.\nWith me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Christian Rothe, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.\nA webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make a couple of initial comments. The quarter and our full year outlook reflect increased resiliency and flexibility in our business across our global operations, even as we and our customers continue to operate in an environment of heightened uncertainty.\nWe talked about some of our actions to mitigate the impacts of announced tariffs on our last earnings call. I'm proud of how our team is executing these plans while maintaining world-class delivery and customer support. In addition to effective pricing actions, we're seeing good progress with some of our production location moves and efforts to secure alternative sourcing.\nChristian and I will cover these in more detail later on the call. Importantly, all these actions to add resiliency to our business model are further enhancing Rockwell's position both from a profitability and competitive differentiation standpoint regardless of what happens in the broader policy environment.\nWe made significant investments in our operational resilience during the supply chain crisis and they have been instrumental in helping us navigate through the current situation by giving us additional flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing footprint.\nTurning to our second quarter results on Slide 3. Q2 marked another quarter of solid sequential improvement in customer demand across many parts of our business. We had a healthy intake of orders in the quarter, with our total company book-to-bill in line with our historical norm of about 1.0.\nGoing forward, we will share additional information on total company order performance only when our overall book-to-bill is outside of the normal range. We will still disclose book-to-bill and lifecycle services each quarter since lead times are longer for that business segment.\nWhile there might have been some isolated customer prebuys ahead of tariff-related price increases in Q2, the overall value of these purchases did not have a meaningful impact on our top line. From a cost standpoint, the impact of tariffs on our Q2 results was also minimal.\nOur sales came in better than expected this quarter, with organic sales up high single digits sequentially. Reported sales were down 6% and our organic sales were down 4% versus prior year due to the difficult year-over-year comparisons we mentioned on our last earnings call.\nUnfavorable currency reduced sales by about 2 points. Even with customers continuing to adopt a cautious approach to their CapEx investments in this uncertain environment, we saw a number of strategic projects across a variety of industries and geographies in the quarter.\nIn our Intelligent Devices segment, our organic sales declined 6% year-over-year, but were above our expectations with double-digit sequential growth across all key product lines. Our strong growth over prior quarter was led by our Power Control business, where our industry-leading motor control center lead times continue to secure important new customers and help Rockwell gain domestic share.\nOne example of these competitive wins in the quarter was with Cape Electrical supply integration, a leading package power provider focused on new power generation for the data center market. Our differentiated MCC solutions are helping them secure numerous greenfield wins here in the U.S., our home market.\nAnother strategic MCC win in Q2 was at Efficient Solutions provider. This customer, an Asian panel builder, selected our cubic modular power distribution systems for their flexibility and smaller footprint, a perfect application for an end user greenfield plant in the food and beverage space.\nOur recent Clearpath acquisition continues to broaden our customer reach. Auto brand, mobile robots continue to add new logos with the recent win at Westfalia Technologies, a leading U.S. provider of automated warehouse solutions. Westfalia has a significant presence in food and beverage end users across North America.\nRockwell's AMRs were chosen to reduce the use of manual forklift trucks, resulting in faster throughput and and reduced finished goods damage as well as a safer operating environment for the customers' workforce.\nSoftware & Control organic sales were up 2% year-over-year and also exceeded our expectations in the quarter. While our high single-digit sales growth over prior quarter was driven by another quarter of recovery in LOGICS, we saw a sequential improvement in sales across both hardware and software businesses in this segment.\nWe are pleased to see sharply increased adoption of the FactoryTalk design studio, which features a GenAI Copilot to accelerate the time to design and commission automation projects.\nOne of our software wins in Q2 was with Bronco Imaging, a global leader in diagnostic imaging. The customer is using our pharma suite MES software to accelerate its revenue growth by improving quality control and increasing speed to market.\nLifecycle Services organic sales decreased 6% year-over-year and were a bit lower than expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was a solid 1.07 and was above 1.0 across all our solutions, services and Sensia businesses. But the current trade and policy uncertainty has impacted some large CapEx projects across our customer base.\nWe saw some project delays in automotive and energy and some deferrals of more discretionary spend in digital services. These customers are seeking additional certainty about the impact tariffs will have on their cost base and whether the volatility will impact their demand.\nDespite these delays, our total ARR for the company grew 8% in the quarter, double-digit growth by Plex and Fiix software businesses led our ARR performance. Rockwell's segment margin of 20.4% and adjusted EPS of $2.45 and were both above our expectations and were in large part driven by continued execution of our cost reduction and margin expansion actions.\nOur team's focus on productivity yielded another quarter of outperformance versus our target. And as we continue to look for further opportunities to expand our margins, we believe, we'll exceed our full year target of $250 million in year-over-year structural productivity. Christian will provide some additional calendarization details in his section.\nLet's move to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry performance. Sales in our discrete industries were up low single digits year-over-year with growth in e-commerce and warehouse automation and semiconductor more than offsetting the decline in automotive.\nConsistent with our expectations, our Q2 automotive sales continued to be challenged by the ongoing tariff and policy uncertainty. This is one of the verticals where we saw an increase in project deferrals in the quarter. Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation grew over 45% versus prior year and were significantly above our expectations.\nWe continue to see strong performance across our key customers in North America and EMEA. Our data center business is also continuing to gain momentum, including a significant data center project with one of Asia's largest telecom providers, delivered through our strategic collaboration with a leading full stack data center solutions provider in the region.\nGiven the outperformance in the first half and a solid pipeline of projects, we now expect e-commerce and warehouse automation to grow 45% in fiscal year '25.\nTurning to Hybrid. Sales in this industry segment were flat year-over-year, with food and beverage, home and personal care and life sciences, all exceeding our expectations in the quarter. Within food and bev and HPC, we continue to see an improvement in our machine builder performance, especially in our North American and European markets.\nSimilar to last quarter, the majority of customer spend in these verticals is driven by productivity and efficiency projects aimed at improving their profitability and sustainability. A good example of these customer wins in Q2 was our work with a U.S.-based restaurant chain with plans to leverage automation to improve speed and consistency of its operations while reducing its labor intensity.\nRockwell's independent card technology was selected for its flexibility, and agility to help increase throughput and improve cost savings. Our Life Sciences business also exceeded our expectations for the quarter. building on our strong presence with leading GLP-1 producers and the broader life sciences ecosystem.\nI already mentioned our Bronco software win in the Med Device segment earlier on the call. Another strategic win in this vertical was with National Resilience, an innovative contract drug manufacturer, specializing in bringing accessible and affordable biologic medicines to the market.\nThis customer is investing in our auto AMRs within their automated storage and retrieval system warehouse as part of their initiative to expand their lights out warehouse and automated material movements.\nMoving to process. While we were expecting to see year-over-year softness due to very difficult comparisons in our energy business, our performance in the quarter here came in worse than expected.\nWithin energy, our customers continue to exercise capital discipline by choosing targeted productivity projects, which help improve cost structure and boost profitability. Energy and process broadly were another area where we saw an increase in project delays during the quarter. Despite this pause in larger capital investments, we continue to secure competitive wins in the process control space.\nThis quarter, DPA Engineeria, a Chilean system integrator, specializing in mining and energy industries, selected our Logix Plant PAX solution to help a leading global lithium mining company advance their ambitious expansion plans.\nMoving to Slide 5. and our Q2 organic regional sales. North America was our best-performing region this quarter, and we expect it to be our strongest market for the full year fiscal year '25. We continue to believe Rockwell is a net beneficiary of policies that drive U.S. manufacturing, and we are investing in our own operations to improve our resiliency and agility.\nFor instance, we've recently decided to expand production of our auto autonomous mobile robots to the U.S. We'll be producing in both Kitchener, Ontario, and at our Milwaukee headquarters.\nLet's now turn to Slide 6 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. As I said earlier, the impact of enacted tariffs on our Q2 results was minimal with increased cost offset by price and supply chain moves. We continue to take necessary steps to offset the impact of April 2 tariffs through a combination of supply chain actions and pricing.\nWe will share the actual tariff impact by quarter as we progress through the year, and Christian will provide additional detail in a few moments.\nWe're taking a balanced approach to the outlook for the rest of the year. Our execution has been strong and demand continues to be solid, including in April. However, second half uncertainty still remains. I group that uncertainty in 3 primary areas: The magnitude of pricing will implement to offset any new tariffs, the impact of any advanced product purchases in our flow business and the timing of CapEx investments by our customers, especially in our Lifecycle Services and configure to order businesses.\nIn terms of our fiscal '25 top line, we still expect our organic sales growth to be in the positive 2% to negative 4% range. Our reported sales midpoint now assumes 0.5 point of negative contribution from currency translation. Christian will provide more detail on FX and the calendarization of our second half shortly.\nI will add that we expect to return to year-over-year sales growth in Q3. Annual recurring revenue was slated to grow about 10% this year. Taking into account our margin outperformance today and continued strong execution, we are increasing our full year segment margin target to 20%, and we now expect our adjusted EPS to be about $9.70 at the midpoint.\nImportantly, we were able to expand our margins year-over-year despite higher compensation costs. Continuing benefits from the SG&A actions we took in the second half of fiscal '24, along with the team's focus on additional structural COGS productivity in fiscal '25 enable the investment in our people and new technology even as we expand margins.\nWe continue to follow a prudent approach to hiring, prioritizing roles that drive new product introduction and revenue growth. We expect free cash flow conversion of 100% in fiscal year '25.\nI'll now turn it over to Christian to give more detail on our Q2 and and financial outlook for fiscal '25. Christian?\n\nChristian E. Rothe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Graco, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6% versus prior year. Currency had a negative impact of 2 points in the quarter and organic sales declined 4%.\nSegment operating margin of 20.4% compared to 19% a year ago was above our expectations and reflected our strong execution across the company. About 3 points of organic growth came from price and price/cost was favorable. Benefits from cost reduction and margin expansion actions and positive price costs more than offset higher compensation and lower sales volume.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.45 was above our expectations, primarily due to the beat on segment operating margin. This is another robust performance in execution and cost control through both structural and temporary costs.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.7% and the prior year rate of 14.8% -- above the prior year rate of 14.8%, primarily due to lower discrete tax benefits, partially offset by a favorable geographic mix of pretax income. We remain on track to achieve a 17% ETR for fiscal 2025.\nFree cash flow of $171 million was $102 million higher than the prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 61% in the second quarter, with accounts receivable being a use of cash during the quarter due to higher shipments and the timing of those shipments.\nAs a reminder, Q2 is typically a lower cash conversion quarter due to TCJA catch-up payments. Not shown on the slide, return on invested capital was 14.2% for the 12 months ended March 31 and 380 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by lower pretax net income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate.\nSlide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview for our 3 operating segments. As Blake mentioned, sales of Intelligent Devices and Software & Control exceeded expectations.\nIntelligent Devices margin of 17.7% increased by 120 basis points year-over-year. Despite the high single-digit volume decline and higher compensation compared to last year, our cost reduction and margin expansion actions allowed us to keep segment operating earnings flat and drove margins higher. Price cost and mix were also favorable to margin.\nSoftware & Control margin of 30.1% was up 440 basis points versus prior year, even though sales were flat year-over-year. Higher margin was driven by cost reduction and margin expansion actions and positive price cost, partially offset by higher compensation. To underscore that, sales and software and control were essentially flat year-over-year but segment operating earnings grew by about $25 million and took margins back over 30%, really strong performance.\nLifecycle Services margin of 14.5% fell 210 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher compensation and lower sales volume. Decremental margin in Lifecycle Services was about 40%. Even though higher compensation and lower sales volumes were headwinds, segment margin here was in line with our expectations due to our cost reduction and margin expansion actions and strong project execution. I want to take a moment to point out the sequential improvements we saw in each of our segments.\nIntelligent Devices had incrementals that were in the 40s from Q1 to Q2, reflecting the flow-through on higher volume and solid price realization. Software & Control had nearly 100% flow through on their sequential volume increase, aided by price and margin expansion activities. Lifecycle Services was able to grow segment operating earnings slightly despite a slight decrease in sales volume. This was due to strong project execution.\nOverall, for Rockwell, the incremental margin on the sequential sales growth was about 70%. This is reflective of strong execution by our teams around the world. I want to thank them for their outstanding efforts.\nThe next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal 2024 to Q2 fiscal 2025. Year-over-year, core performance was up slightly on a 4% organic sales decrease. Sales declines were driven by Intelligent Devices and Lifecycle Services with strong cost discipline in these segments softened the volume impact decline impact.\nAnd in Software & Control, we saw margin expansion on continued improvement in Logix sales. Pricing was strong, and we continue to fund new product development with company R&D at 6% of total revenue. Software & Control R&D as a percentage of segment sales was in the low-teens. We saw excellent execution and better timing on our cost reduction and margin expansion actions, which were above our expectations, resulting in a $0.65 tailwind.\nWe've realized about $155 million of savings in the first half. You'll see a $0.60 impact from compensation. This year-over-year delta reflects mirror increases that came into effect at the beginning of the fiscal year as well as higher incentive comp versus prior year.\nThis number is higher than we had expected in the quarter, reflecting a higher incentive accrual on the strong performance in Q2 and the increase in our expected EPS performance for the full year. Also, remember that in Q2 last year, we had an incentive compensation accrual reversal.\nComing into this year, we expected a year-over-year compensation increase to be approximately $160 million. We now expect that to be about $185 million for the full year. That translates to about $0.25 for each of the remaining 2 quarters.\nAll other items resulted in a $0.15 net headwind. This was essentially all currency as a slight tax headwind was offset by other smaller items. Taking a step back and looking at this slide, we were able to completely offset the headwinds of volume and compensation through strong execution on margin expansion and cost reduction activities as well as price realization.\nMoving on to Slide 10 to discuss our updated guidance for the full year. While our first half performance exceeded our expectations, we are leaving our organic sales outlook range unchanged. Frankly, we are allowing for uncertainty, less predictability in the demand environment and project timing.\nRegarding currency, the weakening of the dollar since our last earnings call has changed our full year expectation for currency headwind to be 0.5 percentage point, down from prior guidance of 1.5 percentage points. We've already realized all that currency headwind in the first half and FX turns to a modest tailwind for the second half of the year.\nBased on our strong execution in the first half of the year and a slight currency tailwind, we are increasing our segment operating margin guidance to about 20%, up from 19%. At the midpoint of our reported sales guidance, from a segment sales and margin standpoint, we are expecting Intelligent Devices margin to be slightly down year-over-year on mid-single-digit sales declines, Software & Control margins to be up year-over-year on a sales increase of mid-single digits and we expect Lifecycle Services margin to be down year-over-year on a low single-digit sales decline.\nWe are updating our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $9.20 to $10.20 or $9.70 at the midpoint. The EPS guidance increase reflects our performance in Q2 as well as the currency change from a headwind to a tailwind.\nUnder normal circumstances, we would have narrowed ranges for both sales and EPS, but it seemed prudent to keep a wider range due to ongoing uncertainty.\nTalk about calendarization. Our expectation is for reported sales to grow low single digits sequentially from Q2 to Q3. In Q4, we expect higher sequential sales due to a combination of our normal seasonality and our backlog. On a year-over-year basis, the more favorable FX outlook is expected to result in a $0.20 tailwind to EPS, which is split evenly in Q3 and Q4.\nRemember, this is compared to the prior year, the sequential benefit of FX is minimal. As we mentioned during Q1, we continue to take additional temporary cost measures in Q2 to offset the FX impact. We like how the temporary controls are flowing through the P&L, and the organization is executing well.\nIn this period of uncertainty, we feel better keeping those costs in check. Segment operating margins were strong in Q2 and expanded nicely since Q1. As we look forward to the rest of the year, we are expecting very slight margin expansion from the Q2 level, 6 basis points and 9 percentage points. As a result, on the low single-digit sequential sales growth from Q2 to Q3, incrementals would be in the low 30s.\nA few additional comments on fiscal 2025 guidance for your models. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be about $150 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is now expected to be about $145 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 113 million shares.\nOur share buybacks in Q2 were approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $129 million. Our opportunistic overlay on our buyback program kicked in over the last month, and we recently exceeded 300 million in buybacks year-to-date. That was originally our buyback target for the full year. But we view recent market pricing as an attractive opportunity to buy more Rockwell.\nMoving away from the slides, I'd like to expand on a few topics. First, you'll see we are no longer providing the dollar value of our orders, we began giving this information during the supply chain crisis as the ratio of orders to shipments diverge from the historical range of around 1, and we felt it was prudent to give that detail to investors. That situation has passed and we are back to a normal book-to-bill of around 1, so we are dropping additional orders data point.\nSecond, similar to last quarter, we have analyzed our orders and shipments to see if there were any indications of prebuys. New demand on distributors was roughly equivalent to the demand those distributors placed on Rockwell. Distributor inventory levels are stable to slightly down compared to last quarter.\nAnd our surveys and channel checks with our OEM partners do not point to prebuys. So we aren't seeing specific examples. In addition, we put measures in place to limit distributor and machine builder stocking orders to appropriate levels. While our diligence didn't find any -- didn't find specific evidence and we have controls in place, we're factoring in the possibility of limited prebuys.\nThird, focusing on the cost reduction and margin expansion activities that gave us a benefit of approximately $0.65 of EPS in the second quarter. This is faster than we had projected and reflects great performance by the Rockwell organization, particularly the integrated supply chain team.\nWe expanded gross margins by 130 basis points in the second quarter compared to the prior year against a 4% organic headwind. While a lot of our outperformance in the cost reduction and margin expansion program in the first half was timing, we do expect the full year benefit of the program to exceed the $250 million we have been targeting.\nLooking at some cost reduction wins. In direct sourcing, we've saved about $18 million in the first half of the year and are expecting to continue to yield benefits in the second half from supplier negotiations and transitioning to new suppliers.\nSavings are coming from areas like cables and wires, fewer broker buys, electronic components and drives. On the manufacturing side, we've seen about $20 million of savings in the first half of the year. This is coming from labor efficiency and other areas like process optimization and reduced spread.\nLast quarter, we talked about rationalizing 21,000 SKUs. That number through 2 quarters is approximately 36,000. These were heavily low to no volume SKUs. There are another 4,000 to 5,000 SKUs that we evaluated and decided to take other actions, meaning we didn't rationalize them, but we're taking pricing or other actions.\nThis work is ongoing and is truly a part-by-part analysis that is focused on optimization and simplification. This is particularly important as we move production and supply chain in response to tariffs.\nLet's wrap things up by talking about tariffs. Assuming current tariff rates and scope that are in place today remain, we estimate our tariff cost exposure to be about $125 million for the second half of fiscal 2025. We continue to manage tariffs through several actions, the fastest of which is pricing.\nWe have enacted changes to our prices as part of our recovery program. This program will flex up or down as tariffs are enacted, modified, postponed or rescinded. We're also working on moving some production. Resiliency actions we took during the supply chain crisis means we have some flexibility to move production of key product lines as we respond.\nIn summary, we are positioned to fully offset our fiscal 2025 tariff costs through a combination of pricing and supply chain actions. The objective of tariff-based price changes is the recovery of the incremental cost and not sales growth. But to the extent pricing is used, our full year organic sales performance could be improved due to tariff-based price realization.\nAgain, our full year EPS target would stay intact because our intention is to offset tariff costs and have 0 impact on second half EPS. As Blake mentioned, the impact of tariffs in Q2 was completely neutralized. Going forward, in an effort to give visibility to underlying operational performance, our intention is to disclose tariff impact on both sales and earnings in each quarter.\nIn conclusion, we had a solid Q2. Looking forward, it remains a dynamic and unpredictable environment. But operationally, focusing on the items we can control, the Rockwell team has shown its ability to profitably navigate uncertainty. We have a plan, and we have runway. This team is focused to finish the second half of the year strong.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Christian. We're pleased to report another quarter that reflects our focus on consistent execution. Investments and resilience are yielding results, including process changes to achieve faster price realization, capacity increases to create redundant manufacturing lines for high-value products in multiple countries, new lines of business that increase annual recurring revenue and a comprehensive program to increase operating margins.\nThese changes can only be successfully executed with the coordinated efforts of our employees and partners around the world. Transformation is hard in the best of times and I'm especially proud of our team's ability to position us so well in a very challenging environment. Our value proposition is stronger than ever before, as demonstrated by customers in the U.S. and around the world who are getting Rockwell involved earlier in their own transformation plans because nobody is better positioned than Rockwell to provide this value.\nAijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Blake.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Christian Rothe, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press recent charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company, and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I'll make a couple of general comments before we turn to our first quarter results. I'm pleased with the early benefits of our renewed focus on operational excellence and cost discipline as we create a solid foundation for market-beating growth and performance. Continuing benefits from cost reductions and SG&A we took last year will be joined with benefits from reduced cost of direct and indirect purchases, manufacturing efficiency and additional price actions. Overall, our plan to achieve $250 million worth of productivity benefits versus last year is intact despite additional temporary headwinds such as the negative impact of currency. Additionally, we are confident that we're dealing with the recently announced tariffs in a way that mitigates the impact and maximizes our position as a large U.S. manufacturer. We've been working on various scenarios since before the election. Undoubtedly, there will be near-term disruptions and volatility in the global supply chain, both for us and our customers, but we continue to believe Rockwell is a net beneficiary of policies that increased U.S. manufacturing. Christian will cover some of the actions we are taking later in his section.\nIn terms of demand, we are encouraged by better-than-expected order performance in the quarter. We had mid-single-digit sequential growth overall with sequential growth across all regions and business segments. Orders exceeded shipments in the quarter, giving us some additional backlog for the balance of the year. While there is still macro economic and policy uncertainty weighing on customers' CapEx plans, Rockwell one multimillion dollar strategic orders across multiple key industries in the quarter, especially in the U.S., our home market.\nLet's now turn to our Q1 results on Slide 3. Our Q1 orders grew 10% versus prior year, and as I said, we're up mid-single digits sequentially. We saw particularly strong orders for Logix controllers and IO. We believe our order outperformance reflects true underlying demand based on the broad geographic outperformance, balanced mix of hardware, software and solutions orders and the fact that distributor and machine builder inventories continue to reduce. As customers are waiting for more certainty in the macroeconomic and U.S. policy environment, they're balancing their automation spend between increasing operational efficiency and making longer-term capital investments. Our Q1 order outperformance includes a number of large customer projects that are slated to convert to sales over the coming quarters. Our Q1 reported sales declined about 8.5% year-over-year with slightly better-than-expected organic sales being offset by about 1 point of headwind from negative currency translation. Remember, our sales in the first half of fiscal '24 was still supported by a sizable product backlog, creating a difficult year-over-year comparison for us in fiscal '25. We expect to return to year-over-year sales growth in the back half of the year.\nOrganic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment down 12% versus prior year and in line with our expectations. Both Cubic and Clearpath, our recent acquisitions in this segment saw double-digit year-over-year growth in sales. We continue to grow our pipeline of multiyear projects here with significant wins across our key industries and global customers. I'll touch on some of these wins in a few minutes.\nSoftware and Control organic sales declined about 12% year-over-year, but were above our expectations. Logix exceeded our expectations this quarter, with both orders and sales up double digits versus prior quarter. Logix orders have recovered sequentially during the last 6 months. Some of our newer offerings we talked about at our Investor Day in November, continue to set us apart and help get new customers. One of these competitive wins in the quarter was with Convergix Automation Solutions, a leading global machine builder who's partnering with Rockwell to help a German end user build their first U.S. greenfield plant. The customer chose our cloud-enabled Optix platform for its hardware-agnostic nature and its ability to seamlessly extract and aggregate data from various devices on a plant floor, significantly reducing the time, risk and cost to integrate solutions for multiple vendors. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 5% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.05, led by strong orders in our solutions business and tied to some of the larger multiyear project wins I mentioned earlier. We also saw good growth in recurring services with strategic wins across automotive, tire and food and beverage. Total ARR for the company grew 11% in the quarter, led by strong growth in our software offerings. One of our notable wins here this quarter was with -- whose dairy factories powered by renewable geothermal energy and is one of the lowest manufacturing carbon footprints in the industry. Our cloud-native Plex software was chosen to help [indiscernible] enhance their product traceability, improve quality and reduce cost. Segment margin was over 17% in the quarter and adjusted EPS was $1.83, both well above our expectations as we continue to execute on our cost out and longer-term margin expansion projects. As we reiterated at our Investor Day a few months ago, we are committed to delivering $250 million and year-over-year benefits from these actions in fiscal '25. In addition to the structural productivity, we're deploying temporary cost measures to help mitigate the unfavorable currency impact on our earnings. Christian will cover this in more detail later.\nTurning to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Consistent with our overall sales results in the quarter, our performance by industry reflects difficult year-over-year comparisons with Q1 of last year, still benefiting from a large product backlog. Our discrete sales were down mid-single digits year-over-year with declines in auto and semi, partially offset by strong growth in e-commerce and warehouse automation. Within discrete, automotive and semiconductor sales continued to be impacted by delays as customers focus on driving operational efficiencies and profitability amidst increasing uncertainty from trade and policy changes in the upcoming months. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew over 30% versus prior year and were above our expectations. We saw a significant uptick of customer activity this quarter, especially in North America and Europe. Our strong position with leading machine builders and system integrators in this space is helping us gain additional share of wallet with key end users, both in the traditional e-commerce space and global logistics sector with a common theme of facility modernization and optimization. Recent new product introductions have also enhanced our competitiveness in this vertical. Given the acceleration in customer investments, we now expect e-commerce and warehouse automation to grow high single digits year-over-year in fiscal '25.\nMoving to hybrid. Sales in this industry segment was slightly above our expectations, led by better performance in food and beverage and home and personal care verticals. In food and beverage, our customers continue to prioritize spend on digital services and modernization programs over large capacity investments. We expect modest improvement in this vertical as we go through the year. In Lifecycle, we saw a number of strategic wins in the quarter, showcasing the breadth and differentiation of our offerings to serve this market. In addition to follow-on orders for GLP-1-related investments, we secured a large competitive win with our FactoryTalk MES software, helping one of the largest European and life sciences companies standardize their global facilities on our platform to increase tech transfer speed and reduce cost. Another important win this quarter was with Thermo Fisher, our auto autonomous mobile robots were selected to help address Thermo's workforce challenges by optimizing their warehouses through auto's AI-enabled determination and movement flexibility and freeing up labor to focus on more value-adding tasks.\nTurning to Process Industries. Sales in these verticals were down high single digits year-over-year on difficult prior year comps, especially within our energy market, where oil and gas grew over 25% in Q1 of last year. While the new administration support for more oil production in North America should benefit our customers in the long run, we see a mixed reaction from our energy customers near term as they continue to prioritize capital discipline and operational efficiency over adding more production in the U.S. This quarter, Rockwell and Epic Industrial, a leading EPC company in the energy and chemical space, were chosen by one of the world's largest oil and gas producers to help achieve this year's -- this end user's goal of net zero emissions by 2050. Another important process win was in our mining vertical. Vale selected Rockwell to help increase production and reduce water consumption at their new processing plant in Brazil. Our winning combination of integrated hardware, software and services is the reason Vale chose Rockwell as a single partner to integrate end-to-end solutions for this greenfield.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. As you can see, the Americas continued to outperform other regions for us this quarter. EMEA sales were down 14%. We continue to see weakness across most of the region, particularly in Germany and France, with some early signs of stabilization at Italian machine builders. Asia Pacific sales declined 9%, led by a double-digit year-over-year decline in China. While the automation market in the region is expected to stabilize later in 2025, we expect Asia Pacific to be our weakest region in fiscal '25.\nLet's now move to Slide 6 to review our fiscal 2025 outlook. We continue to expect a gradual sequential sales improvement as we move through this fiscal year. We're keeping our organic sales growth range of positive 2% to negative 4%, but we are updating our reported sales midpoint to $8.1 billion, reflecting 1.5 points of negative contribution from currency translation. Christian will cover FX in the calendarization of our guidance in more detail later on the call. Annual recurring revenue is projected to grow about 10% this year. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking additional cost measures to offset the negative impact of currency headwinds on our bottom line which means we continue to expect segment margin in the 19% range and are reaffirming our adjusted EPS of $9.20 at the midpoint. We expect free cash flow conversion of 100% in fiscal year '25.\nI'll now turn it over to Christian to provide more detail on our Q1 and financial outlook for fiscal '25. Christian?\n\nChristian E. Rothe\n\nChief Financial Officer & Treasurer, Graco, Inc.\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were down about 8.5% versus prior year. The impact of acquisitions was negligible and currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points in the quarter. While 1 point of our organic growth came from price and price/cost was favorable. Segment operating margin was 17.1% compared to 17.3% a year ago with lower sales volume, mostly offset by the benefits of -- from cost reduction and margin expansion actions, like Blake mentioned earlier. Adjusted EPS was $1.83, was above our expectations, primarily due to the beat on segment operating margins. Looking into more detail when we discuss the EPS bridge and the cost reduction actions, but I'd like to take a moment to commend the team for outstanding performance first quarter. It was about strong execution and good cost controls.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.5%, below the prior year rate of 17.9%. We remain on track to achieve a 17% ETR for fiscal 2025. Free cash flow of $293 million was $328 million higher than prior year. Free cash flow conversion was 140% in the first quarter of this year, reflective of continued working capital management by the team as well as 0 incentive payouts on fiscal 2024 performance. This is in contrast to the first quarter of last year where we had our cash bonus payout for 2023 performance. Two additional items not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $99 million. On December 31, we had approximately $1.2 billion remaining under our repurchase authorization. Return on invested capital was 14.5% for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 400 basis points lower than the prior year, primarily driven by lower pretax income.\nSlide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview for our three operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin of 14.9% decreased by 130 basis points year-over-year, purely focusing on decremental conversion, the segment had decrementals in the '20s year-over-year in the first quarter, which reflects strong execution on cost-out programs against the double-digit organic sales decline. Software and Control margin of 25.1% was flat with the prior year. This segment typically has very high decrementals with strong execution on our cost-out programs and good price/cost performance kept our year-over-year decremental margins in the 20s, performing above our expectations. It's important to note that R&D spend in this segment was in the low teens as a percentage of sales, reflecting our continued focus on new product introductions and long-term growth and differentiation. Life cycle services margin of 12.5% decreased 190 basis points year-over-year and was slightly below our expectations, mostly driven by Sensia shipments. Incrementals were solid year-over-year, reflecting the low single-digit volume growth and strong execution on our cost-out programs.\nBefore moving on to EPS, let's expand a little on orders and demand. As Blake mentioned, orders came in better than expected, surpassing $2 billion in the first quarter, and book-to-bill was greater than 1, which hasn't been the case for the last 7 quarters. This is a good sign, but didn't materially change the calendarization of our outlook. The outperformance was largely from project orders scheduled to ship later in the year.\nAnother favorable data point. In the first quarter, new demand placed on our distributors is flowing through at close to 100% in terms of new orders on Rockwell, matching historical levels, giving us further evidence that the destocking cycle is mostly behind us.\nThe next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal 2024 to Q1 fiscal 2025. Core performance was down $0.55 on an 8% organic sales decrease. Those sales declines were primarily in our higher-margin products in both Intelligent Devices and Software and Control, which impacts flow-through. Importantly, the organization had some temporary cost measures in Q1, which helped keep the core decremental flow through on the high single-digit sales decline to this level. Cost reduction and margin expansion actions, which reflect more structural productivity, provided about $70 million of benefit in the quarter, slightly above our expectations and were a $0.50 tailwind. Compensation, which reflects merit incentive compensation, was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year delta reflects merit increases that came into effect at the beginning of the fiscal year as well as higher incentive comp versus prior year. Recall that our full year 2025 guide was for compensation and inflation to be about $190 million headwind compared to fiscal 2025, with $160 million of that coming from compensation. The inflation impact is captured inside of core in this bridge. We expect compensation to be about $0.90 of headwind for the remaining three quarters of the year spread about equally. All their items resulted in a $0.04 net benefit.\nMoving on to the next slide, 10, to discuss our updated guidance for the full year fiscal 2025. Our thesis for the year remains largely intact with a couple of changes. We expect organic sales in a range from negative 4% to positive 2%, while our initial guide for reported revenue for fiscal 2025 did not anticipate any significant impact from currency, the recent strengthening of the dollar requires a modification in our guide. At current rates, we expect the currency headwind to be about 1.5 points, which takes our guidance on reported sales down to slightly below $8.1 billion at the midpoint. We expect price to contribute about a point of growth for the year. This excludes any tariff-related price actions. At the midpoint of our reported sales guidance, which is now negative 2.5%. Our current expectations are for Intelligent Devices sales to be down mid-single digits, and Software and Control and Lifecycle Services to be approximately flat year-over-year. From a margin standpoint, we expect ITD margin to be down year-over-year on lower sales. Software and Control margins to expand year-over-year on flat sales and we expect Lifecycle Services margin to be flat to slightly down year-over-year. Our adjusted EPS range is unchanged at $8.60 to $9.80 with a $9.20 midpoint.\nTalk about calendarization. The dollar strengthening late in the first quarter has continued into the second quarter and is a sequential headwind of less than 1%. Our expectations for reported sales grew low to mid-single digits sequentially and from Q1 to Q2. After Q2, we are expecting gradual sequential sales growth through the remainder of the year. On a year-over-year basis, the 1.5 points of sales headwind from FX is expected to result in a $0.35 headwind on EPS, which is split evenly to the remaining three quarters of the year. As Blake said earlier, we're taking additional temporary measures on spending to offset this impact. The team performed well in spending control in the first quarter. We're going to hold those reigns types. We can continue to drive towards that adjusted EPS midpoint of $9.20.\nSpecific to Q2, we expect segment operating margins to expand about 100 basis points sequentially on the incremental sales volume, resulting EPS, up sales and margin expectations would be in the neighborhood of $2 per share. A few additional comments on fiscal 2025 guidance for your models. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $145 million. Net interest expense for fiscal 2025 is expected to be about $140 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 113.4 million shares with about $300 million of share repurchases targeted during the year.\nMoving away from the slide, I'd like to expand on a couple of topics. First, focusing on cost reduction and margin expansion activities, which gave us a benefit of approximately $0.50 of EPS in the first quarter. For the full year, we continue to expect a benefit of $250 million or about $1.85 per share. As discussed at our Investor Day in November, there are hundreds of projects supporting these initiatives. And while each one individually may only be a couple of basis points or 10 basis points of yield. When put together and annualized, they are giving us a yield in the hundreds of basis points. The timing and magnitude continues to fluctuate as we execute against these plans. The first quarter was a good one, and we tracked slightly ahead of our goal for the quarter. The primary driver of the outperformance was manufacturing efficiencies and effective sourcing. There's a lot of year left in front of us and a great deal of work to be done. I'd like to thank the team for their efforts. Nice work.\nWell, see this initiative as cost out because that's what we're tracking and reporting to our investors. It's important to note that the ultimate goal of productivity is to drive revenue through competitiveness and speed. These actions are setting us up for long-term growth of both sales and earnings. To that end, I want to follow up on some other operational excellence topics from our Investor Day. The Rockwell operating model continues to develop as we build the foundation to sustain our long -- our cost-out initiatives as well as drive margin expansion over the long term. During the first quarter, we had another 1,300 Rockwell employees complete Yellow Belt training. In addition, we rationalized over 21,000 SKUs as we seek to simplify our operations and improve customer experience. Our product resiliency index continues to improve as we steadily reduce single points of failure in our operations. While those initial efforts arose from the supply chain prices, as we enter into an era of changing tariffs and trade, this resiliency enables us to respond to dynamic conditions.\nMoving on, I'd like to go into some depth around the potential tariff impact to our business, including our short-term actions as well as longer-term thoughts. As Blake mentioned earlier, the Rockwell team has taken initial steps in response to new tariffs. We have planned for a number of scenarios and remain ready to adapt quickly. Our priorities are a combination of maintaining profitability and utilizing resiliency in our operations and supply chain to mitigate impacts under a variety of scenarios. I want to size our exposure so you have context. Cost of finished goods imported from Mexico, Canada and China in total were less than 10% of our U.S. revenue in fiscal 2024. Separately, in fiscal 2024, our direct imports into the United States from Mexico, both from third parties as well as from our own manufacturing facilities were approximately $350 million. Imports from Canada and China were each approximately $100 million. Our tariff mitigation plan is multifaceted. For the near term, this will be primarily through price, and we have implemented price changes from the additional China tariffs that were enacted on February 4. We have made and will continue to make changes to manufacturing locations where there's an attractive ROI. Canada and Mexico tariffs, if they happen in March or sometime in the future, will impact both standard products as well as a portion of our configured order sales. We will enact price increases on impacted products and also intend to reprice our backlog to reflect our new price loss. These actions are disruptive for our customers, of course, and there will likely be some noise in the near term. We are working hard to minimize that disruption and ensure continued levels of customer service. With that said, due to our immediate actions and substantial U.S. manufacturing footprint, we do not expect these tariffs to have a material impact on our profitability for the full year.\nBeyond pricing, we have a number of projects that are in-flight to mitigate tariff costs through alternative sourcing and movement of production locations. We will be leveraging the resiliency that's been built into our operations and supply chain, including moving some production in response to tariffs. For example, we have some products that are produced in Mexico and destined for the U.S. With similar production that occurs in the U.S. where the destination is outside the United States. We're swapping those out, moving the production for non-U.S. customers outside the U.S. in order to create capacity to manufacture production for U.S. customers inside the U.S. It's a small portion of our overall tariff-impacted operations, but a good example of quick moves we can make.\nAs Blake mentioned at our Investor Day, our operations team has done a good job of keeping infrastructure in place for second shift, sometimes third shift in locations that have been challenged with lower volume in the last 12 months. That creates an opportunity to move production into the U.S. to avoid tariffs with a limited time lag. As you know, we're in a very dynamic environment. So we will continue to leverage our agile supply chain and take additional steps as necessary.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Christian. As I mentioned, we're seeing some encouraging new project activity across multiple end markets. Many of these involve U.S. user sites, but they involve multiple points of influence around the world, and we're doing a good job of coordinating this global effort. We expect the impact of so-called mega projects to be meaningful in the next few years. We continue to track new legislation and executive orders as they are announced. With our large U.S. manufacturing footprint and strong market position, we're confident that we can respond quickly to these changes. I'm pleased with the progress our teams are making toward our long-term productivity and margin expansion targets, and I'm confident we are making the right investments to drive sustained growth and profitability. The framework for superior growth and performance through the cycle that we outlined over a year ago is intact, and we are working that plan.\nI'm also taking a moment to thank our employees and partners for their dedication and hard work. I'm proud to have such a strong team to help us navigate through this dynamic period. Nobody is better positioned than Rockwell and our partners to help American manufacturers create the future of industrial operations. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let's take our first question.",

[Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website.\nBoth the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our third quarter results, I'll make some initial comments. As we saw in Q2, operational performance continued to be strong in our third quarter, but order growth continued to ramp at a slower-than-expected pace. Our accelerated actions to bring costs in line with the lower outlook on current year orders contributed to the strong margin performance in the quarter, and we are well into the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day last November.\nWe continue to expect savings of $100 million in the second half of this year, and accelerated actions taken this full year, which will create a good starting point for fiscal year '25. Based on actions taken in the last 12 months, our worldwide headcount is down 6% since Q2, and most others who will be affected have been notified. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone, plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program, as I'll discuss in a few minutes.\nWe've announced our new CFO, Christian Rothe, who starts in 2 weeks and is excited to begin. Christian brings a successful track record and will work with me and the rest of the team to combine market-leading growth and financial performance in a consistent, longer-term model based on the targets introduced last November to create significant shareowner value.\nTurning to specific results in the quarter. Q3 orders were up low single digits, both year-over-year and sequentially, with growth across all regions. However, while our distributors and machine builders are making progress on working down their excess inventory, their orders to us came in lower than expected in the quarter due to weaker end user demand. As a result, we are projecting a more gradual sequential order growth in Q4 and into fiscal year '25 than we had previously expected.\nWe had another quarter of strong execution with sales, margins and EPS all exceeding our expectations. Total and organic sales were down 8.4% versus prior year. Organic sales came in better than we expected, with strong backlog execution in our longer-cycle businesses, including Lifecycle Services and the configure-to-order products in Intelligent Devices. Organic sales in our Intelligent Devices segment were down by about 1 point versus prior year. We continue to see a solid pipeline of projects across all product lines, including good opportunities involving Clearpath's auto, mobile robots and Cubic data center solutions.\nIn Software & Control, organic sales declined over 31% year-over-year compared to 24% growth in Q3 of last year. Sales in this segment were still better than expected, driven by better Logix recovery as machine builders reduced their inventory. We also saw good growth in our software business, including both on-prem and cloud-native offerings. For example, in the quarter, we had over 150 new logos for our recently launched FactoryTalk Optix portfolio. This reinforces the importance of continued investment in innovation and new product introduction, as we continue to redeploy and prioritize our spend towards areas of highest growth and strategic importance.\nWe've talked a lot about cost savings during this challenging year, but we're taking great care to preserve the investments that will enable us to continue to grow share. Lifecycle Services had another strong quarter with organic sales up over 11% year-over-year, driven by relative strength in process end markets and strong execution of our project backlog. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.0. We did see some additional project delays, especially affecting our solutions orders. Some manufacturing customers are taking a pause in making large capacity investments as they deal with slower consumer demand, high interest rates and policy uncertainty around tax tariffs and stimulus incentives.\nEven so, our customers are still investing in their operational resilience, reflected by continued double-digit sales growth of our recurring managed services. Total ARR for the company was up a strong 17% this quarter. Segment margin of 20.8% and adjusted EPS of $2.71 were well above our expectations. We're making good progress on driving productivity across the enterprise, and we are seeing the benefits of these actions with over $40 million of savings in Q3 alone.\nTurning to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 industry segment performance. Last quarter, we talked about some project delays and end-user CapEx slowdown in parts of our business, namely automotive and food and beverage. We saw project delays across a broader group of industries this quarter, which will impact our end market performance through the end of the fiscal year. Sales in our discrete industries were down high single digits versus prior year, with declines in auto and semi, being partially offset by year-over-year growth in warehouse automation.\nWithin discrete, automotive sales declined high teens versus prior year. Brand owners are delaying more EV programs as they continue to reassess their product strategy in light of slower consumer adoption and policy uncertainty in the U.S. Semiconductor sales were down high teens. We continue to see delays in new capacity builds and the associated tooling due in part to questions about the timing and certainty of chip's funding disbursements. E-commerce and warehouse automation sales grew high teens versus prior year, led by strong double-digit growth in North America. We continue to see a broad-based recovery at our end user and machine builder customer segments.\nMoving to hybrid. Sales in this industry segment were down mid-teens, driven by year-over-year declines in food and beverage and life sciences. Food and beverage sales decreased mid-teens in the quarter, producers in certain segments of the food and beverage market, like baking and snacks, are seeing inflationary headwinds as consumers shift from high-end brands to more affordable labels. We're seeing less greenfield activity, but we do continue to see high demand for software and services that optimize processes to increase efficiency.\nLife sciences sales were down high teens. Similar to food and beverage, customers in life sciences are prioritizing investments in their operational resilience and infrastructure. In the quarter, we had important wins with 2 leading pharmaceutical companies. The life science business of Merck in Darmstadt, Germany, which operates in the U.S. and Canada as MilliporeSigma selected Rockwell to assess the company's current plant infrastructure and help enhance the digital connectivity and cybersecurity resilience of operational assets.\nAnother important Q3 win in life sciences was with AstraZeneca. Together with our partner, Clarity, we're helping the customer identify and monitor plan assets, detect threats and integrate internal services and systems to provide a comprehensive global cyber platform for all of their OT environments. Process sales were mixed across the individual vertical markets. Overall sales were about flat year-over-year with growth in oil and gas and mining, offset by declines in chemicals and metals.\nOil and gas sales grew low single digits this quarter. Within this segment, our Sensia JV sales grew double digits versus prior year, with good growth in process automation and digital solutions offerings. And while we continue to win business in the energy transition space, we did see some North America project pushouts tied to customers wanting to understand potential policy changes that may occur after the U.S. elections in November.\nIn mining, our sales increased high single digits versus prior year. Our growth in the quarter was driven by continued double-digit growth in Latin America. Here, Rockwell was chosen to integrate an end-to-end solution for Vale's new processing plant as this customer looks to increase production capacity, reduce water consumption and enhanced cybersecurity infrastructure. This is a great example of how Rockwell brings our hardware, software and services together to deliver differentiated value for our end users.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. The Americas continued to outperform the rest of the world, with North America sales flat year-over-year in the quarter and Latin America sales up almost 19%. EMEA sales were down 28%, with continued macroeconomic challenges across Germany, Italy and France impacting end-user demand. Despite these headwinds, we continue to make progress with our European machine builders to gain share in the end user market.\nIn the quarter, IMA Group, an Italian-based leader in designing and developing packaging machines, has sold over a dozen machines equipped with our Rockwell platform by recognizing the technical advantage of our motion control capabilities, coupled with the time to market provided by our integrated architecture solution. Their end user who's based in Germany, is now looking to adopt Rockwell as its preferred choice in all future commissions. Asia Pacific sales declined 22%. In addition to continued inventory destocking and economic challenges in China, we saw incremental headwinds from EV battery project delays in Korea this quarter.\nMoving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. While our orders are improving sequentially, but they're progressing at a more gradual pace than we anticipated. We believe this is largely tied to a pause in new capacity investments as manufacturers focus on cost control and operational efficiency, waiting for a potential reduction in interest rates and broader U.S. policy changes. Therefore, we are reducing our fiscal year '24 guidance to reflect this gradual pace of orders growth.\nTaking into account our order progression to early August, we now expect Q4 orders to be up low single digits sequentially. With that, we expect our organic sales to decline 10% for the year. We continue to expect acquisitions to contribute about 1.5 points of growth and we expect currency to be about neutral for the year. Total ARR is expected to grow about 15% and will exceed 10% of total Rockwell sales this year.\nWe now expect our segment margin to be slightly over 19% for the year. While this represents about a 200 basis point decrease versus last year, it also shows the improving resilience of our business model. Adjusted EPS is slated to decline 21% versus prior year. We expect free cash flow conversion of 60%. Nick will cover this in more detail in his section.\nBefore I turn the call over to Nick, I'd like to spend a few moments on Slide 7 to discuss the progress we're making in setting the foundation for long-term productivity and margin expansion. We already talked about the accelerated actions we're taking in the second half of this fiscal year to drive efficiency and scale across our entire company, and we remain committed to delivering $100 million of savings this year and $120 million of incremental savings in fiscal year '25, mainly targeted at reducing our SG&A spend.\nWe will continue to optimize our general and administrative spend through a targeted approach, although the majority of additional productivity and margin expansion will be realized as a result of reductions in our cost of sales. As you can see from this chart, we expect to save another $130 million in fiscal year '25 through additional margin expansion and productivity projects, bringing our total fiscal year '25 year-over-year savings to roughly $250 million. You can see the broad list of actions and programs that are underway to realize these targets.\nThese productivity projects include savings in the areas of product cost, indirect material, purchased services, logistics, manufacturing workflow, make or buy decisions, portfolio optimization through SKU reduction and price. We look forward to our new CFO, Christian Rothe's, additional perspective as we maximize the effectiveness of this program in fiscal year '25 and preserve it as a foundational part of our operating model going forward, regardless of the top line growth in any particular year.\nLet me now turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported and organic sales were down 8.4% compared to last year. Acquisitions contributed 60 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 60 basis points. About 350 basis points of organic growth came from price this quarter. Segment operating margin was 20.8% compared to 21.1% a year ago. Margin performance in the quarter reflects low sales volume and an unfavorable mix, largely offset by positive price/cost, lower incentive compensation and the benefits from cost reduction actions we announced on our last earnings call.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.71 was higher than expectations, driven by better revenue, mix and savings from our cost actions. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 13.3%, benefiting from discrete tax items and below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $238 million compared to $240 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income, but was mostly offset by lower working capital, which improved for the second consecutive quarter but at a slower rate than anticipated.\nOne additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $160 million. On June 30, $500 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin increased to 20.2% compared to 16.8% a year ago. The increase from the prior year was driven by positive price/cost, lower incentive compensation and our cost reduction actions, partially offset by lower sales volume. Software and control margin of 23.6% decreased from 34.8% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume, partially offset by positive price/cost, lower incentive compensation and our cost reduction actions.\nAs Blake mentioned earlier, software and control margin exceeded our expectations this quarter with better performance in Logix sales. Lifecycle Services margin of 19.3% more than doubled from the year ago margin of 9.3%. The margin performance is driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales, continued strong project execution and ongoing savings from the prior year structural actions. Lifecycle services book-to-bill was 1.0.\nThe next Slide 10 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '23 to Q3 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $0.80 on an 8.4% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix, and was partially offset by positive price/cost. Cost reduction actions contributed $0.30 to the year-over-year increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 tailwind. This year-over-year increase reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was $0.10, and currency was a $0.15 headwind. Share count, interest expense and tax were a combined $0.05 tailwind.\nLet's now move on to the next Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline by about 8.5%, inorganic sales to decline 10%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, and we now expect currency to be neutral for the year on continued strength in the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor for the year. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16%.\nWe are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to $9.60, down 21% year-over-year. With lower sales, our improvements in inventory days will be delayed and we now expect to end fiscal year '24 with 160 days of inventory. As a result, we expect full year free cash flow conversion of about 60% of adjusted income. Our free cash flow conversion for the year also reflects several nonrecurring headwinds, including our second half restructuring actions, the timing of our cash bonus payout and tax payments for both the TCJA transition tax and our prior year PTC gain.\nFrom a top line perspective, we expect flat sequential sales in Q4 in each of our business segments. Sequentially, we expect margins in Q4 to be about 100 basis points lower than in Q3. By segment, we expect our Q4 margin in Intelligent Devices to decline about 100 basis points and Lifecycle Services margin to decline about 200 basis points sequentially. In both segments, we expect the decline to be driven by a less favorable mix. We expect margin in software and control to be similar to Q3.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.5 million shares. We still expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be $140 million.\nBefore I pass it on to Blake, I'd like to talk about how actions we're taking this year are going to benefit our results in fiscal '25 and beyond. As you heard earlier, we expect our productivity and margin expansion actions to provide about $250 million in year-over-year benefit next year. These are expected to offset compensation headwinds next year, which includes merit increases and the reinstatement of incentive compensation. The $250 million in benefits is split about equally between improvements in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. We expect R&D spending next year to remain similar as a percentage of sales as we continue to invest in areas of highest growth.\nWith my upcoming retirement, I'd like to thank Blake for this opportunity and to thank all of you for your engagement over the last several years. Thank you. With that, I'll turn it over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. This will be Nick's last earnings call with us. I'd like to thank him again for his commitment to Rockwell's mission over the last few years. He's working closely with Christian for a smooth transition, and we wish Nick and his family the very best in retirement. Christian will join me in leading the fourth quarter earnings call and Investor Day in November.\nAs always, Investor Day takes place during our annual Automation Fair. Last year, over 8,500 customers, distributors, partners and investors joined us in Boston. Registration opens tomorrow for the 2024 event in Anaheim, California, which takes place during the week of November 18. This year, the fair offers an expanded 4 days of show floor access, showcasing major new hardware, software and services offerings.\nRockwell's technology portfolio, domain expertise and unmatched ecosystem uniquely position us to help customers in our home market of North America and around the world, and we look forward to seeing you in Anaheim in just over 3 months. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning. and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. .\nOur results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3, I'll make some initial comments. At a high level, our performance in Q2 was good, but I am not happy with the reduced guidance for the full year. The impact of high inventory levels at machine builders is larger than we expected. Orders are still expected to return to year-over-year growth in Q3 and continued to increase during the year, but the slower ramp is impacting shipments for the second half.\nConsequently, here's what we are doing. We are accelerating actions to bring costs in line with the revised outlook on current year orders, aligned with the more comprehensive program to expand margins introduced during our Investor Day in November. We will save $100 million in the second half of this year from accelerated actions being taken now, creating a beneficial starting point for fiscal year '25. We will see incremental savings of $120 million next year from these actions alone plus a larger amount of additional savings from the more comprehensive program targeting sourcing, manufacturing and SG&A.\nAnd we will provide a more detailed view of this program on our next earnings call. We are improving our forecasting with new perspectives on the team processes that include a deeper analysis of channel information and better decision support technology. I'm optimistic about our position when we exit fiscal year '24 and regardless of next year's growth for several reasons. Rockwell has built an unmatched portfolio to meet the world's growing need for smart manufacturing. Our home market, North America is expected to grow faster than the worldwide PAM. We are winning major new business today with both our traditional offerings and new sources of value across discrete, hybrid and process industries. As we couple this with our focus on margin expansion through cost discipline, operational excellence and organic growth we will achieve the longer-range targets introduced in November and create significant shareowner value.\nTurning to the quarter. As we indicate on Slide 3, we returned to good operational performance in the second quarter with both organic sales and adjusted EPS above our expectations. Sales of product configured to order offerings, software and life cycle services were all at or above our forecast. In products, we converted incoming orders at a much higher level than in Q1, and we now have sufficient mix of safety stock in place to convert orders at the current level or higher through the balance of the fiscal year. We are essentially back to booking and billing product orders in the quarter they are received at pre-pandemic conversion rates.\nOur orders were up low double digits sequentially and with continued recovery across all business segments and regions, North America had the highest sequential increase in the quarter. Year-over-year, total sales were down 6.5% in the quarter based on an organic sales decline of 8% and [ 1.5 ] points of acquisition growth. In our Intelligent Devices segment, organic sales declined about 7.5% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our execution to meet our shipping commitments and build safety stock in the quarter for these products. We also continue to see strong performance from our recent ClearPath acquisition, with sales of autonomous mobile robots contributing almost 2.5 points to ITD growth in the quarter.\nOne notable ClearPath win this quarter was with the Hershey Company. The Hershey Company continues to advance digital capabilities to enhance agility and efficiency across its operations, including supply chain and manufacturing processes. As part of their efforts, Hershey has selected Auto Motors technology to improve productivity in both fulfillment and manufacturing operations. Q2 margin performance for ClearPath was also better than expected.\nSoftware and control organic sales were down 23% versus prior year, largely as we expected. As you know, this segment is significantly impacted by difficult year-over-year comparables in our Logix business. In Q2 of last year, we had 42% growth in software and control. There are particularly high levels of these products in inventory at our machine builders. Despite this temporary correction, we are gaining Logix share and winning new business across our software and hardware offerings. I'm proud of the vitality of our product development here, demonstrated by recent organic product launches and partnerships with Microsoft and NVIDIA that are focused on specific customer use cases especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence.\nThese partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represented an enormous largely untapped source of data and petabytes of this data flow through our controllers. They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology. Lifecycle Services organic sales grew over 12% year-over-year and continue to outperform our expectations driven by strong process end markets. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.07, led by good order growth in our solutions and Sensia businesses. Our Sensia JV saw another quarter of over 25% year-over-year sales growth in Q2.\nThe Lifecycle Services segment also continues to contribute strong growth from our high-value services, including cybersecurity, which saw orders growth of almost 50% in the quarter. We are making substantial progress to expand life cycle services margin. We saw 16% margin in this quarter, and we're not done working on the performance of this business segment. Total ARR was up 20% again this quarter. We continue to see strong profitable recurring growth from both high-value services and software. Rockwell segment margin was 19%. This would have been about 17% without the reversal of the bonus accrual we recorded in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was above our expectations even after adjusting for the reversal of the bonus accrual.\nNick will cover this in more detail later on the call. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 industry segment performance. Sales in our discrete industries were down high teens versus prior year. The impact of high product inventory levels in the channel are most pronounced in our discrete and hybrid industry segments. Automotive, e-commerce and other warehouse automation sales were all impacted. Within discrete, automotive sales were down 20%. Much of this year-over-year weakness is driven by excess product inventory in our channel. However, we're also starting to see some impact on our fiscal '24 sales as customers take time to reevaluate the timing of their EV investments. While we are not seeing any EV or battery project cancellations, we are seeing pushouts of certain production start dates. As we've mentioned, given our strong installed base and expanded portfolio, Rockwell is well positioned with automotive customers, whether they are investing in electric vehicles or adding more hybrid options in the near term.\nThey are all interested in increasing efficiency. In addition to our traditional sources of value, ClearPath autonomous mobile robots helped us secure over half a dozen wins with major brand owners and Tier 1 suppliers this quarter. Semiconductor sales declined 25% year-over-year with continued geopolitical pressures and a temporary oversupply of legacy chips weighing on semi customers' CapEx investments. Our sales in e-commerce and warehouse automation were down high teens this quarter. We did see an improvement in sequential growth and increased our full year sales outlook. We're rebuilding a strong warehouse pipeline with traditional retailers and global shipping and logistics customers.\nTurning to our hybrid sales. This industry segment was down mid-teens year-over-year. The weakness in this industry segment was led by food and beverage and home and personal care. Food and beverage sales declined 20% in the quarter, driven by slower activity at our packaging OEMs and who are still working through their excess inventory. There are also some signs of slower end user CapEx spend. Food and beverage end users are continuing to fund capacity expansion in emerging markets like India and Southeast Asia and modernization and resilience projects across their existing facilities. We had wins in the quarter, including the AMR project I mentioned earlier and cybersecurity projects at new customers.\nLife Sciences sales were down high single digits. Results in the quarter were mainly driven by project delays, especially in China. Outside of that region, we continue to expand our installed base with newer software and hardware offerings. One example of new value in this vertical was an important Q2 order with an innovative contract manufacturer, national resilience, who selected ClearPath to provide a comprehensive AMR solution as they bring cell and gene therapies to market.\nMoving to process. Our sales here grew high single digits year-over-year, supported by continued strength in oil and gas and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 20% this quarter with continued momentum in energy transition projects. In Q2, we secured multiple decarbonization projects, including applications for carbon capture, storage and hydrogen. Let's turn to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. The Americas continued to be our strongest region this year with Latin America growing 8% versus prior year, and North America organic sales down about 4% in the quarter. EMEA sales decreased 19% due to high machine builder inventory in Germany and Italy, particularly in consumer packaged goods. Asia Pacific sales declined 17% in the quarter, with sales in China down almost 30% versus prior year. We expect a combination of weaker market conditions and slower distributor destocking to continue to impact our China performance through the balance of this fiscal year.\nMoving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. As I mentioned at an investor conference in March, while orders continue to increase sequentially from the trough we have not yet seen the acceleration we expect once distributors and machine builders work through their excess inventory. The result is that some of the demand they are seeing does not translate to an equal amount of orders placed on Rockwell. I also said that if the pace of orders continued on its current trajectory, we would expect our full year 2024 financial results to track closer to the low end of both our organic growth and EPS range. Since then, we've seen lower-than-expected order activity. While distributors and machine builders are continuing to work through their excess inventory, we have underestimated the amount of overstock at our machine builders.\nBased on information received directly from our largest machine builders, our downward revision is based largely on the size of their inventory and the expected pace of the reduction resulting in a slower ramp of orders in the fiscal year. Again, we do expect to return to year-over-year growth in orders for the third quarter and our updated forecast still implies sequential order growth in Q3 and Q4. We believe we are taking share in our major product lines globally and in the U.S. North America is our strongest market, and we are starting to see an increased order impact from customer mega projects as the year progresses.\nWe now expect our full year orders to be down low single digits versus prior year. Based on our performance to date and the lower-than-expected order ramp we are revising our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to decline 7% at the midpoint, and we continue to expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still expected to grow about 15%. Segment margin of 20% is now expected to decline versus prior year, which still implies an increase in the second half and specifically in fiscal Q4, driven by higher volume and the accelerated cost down actions I mentioned earlier.\nNick will share additional detail in his section. Adjusted EPS is slated to decrease 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. We are increasing planned share repurchases to roughly double our original plan for the year. And we expect free cash flow conversion of 80%. This is a reduction from our prior guide, and Nick will cover this in more detail later. The reduced guide for the fiscal year only strengthens our commitment to building a strong foundation for future growth and profitability. The company-wide program to comprehensively take cost out of our products and operations will positively impact our results next year. Savings will be used to expand margins and reinvest to drive future growth. We will provide additional detail no later than the Q3 earnings call. Our intention is to manage our business segments for consistent forecastable performance. You've also seen the announcement of Nick's upcoming retirement. A search has been underway and we expect to announce a new CFO in the coming months. Nick will be fully engaged in the transition to his successor and he will now provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. Although my family and I are excited about what comes next in retirement, my continued focus is on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition to a new CFO. I I'll start on Slide 7, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were down 6.6% compared to last year. Q2 organic sales were down 8.1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 10 basis points and about 150 basis points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our projections.\nSegment operating margin was 19% compared to 21.3% a year ago. This 230 basis point decrease reflects lower sales volume, partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Adjusted EPS of $2.50 was higher than expectations. Given our lowered outlook for fiscal '24, we did not accrue any bonus expense in Q2, and we reversed the prior quarter bonus accrual. This resulted in a total adjusted EPS benefit of approximately $0.30 in the quarter. Even without the bonus impact, our Q2 adjusted EPS was ahead of our expectation due to better-than-expected conversion of incoming orders into sales. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nAdjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 14.8% below the prior year rate. Free cash flow was $69 million compared to $156 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by lower pretax income and higher tax payments, partially offset by decreases in working capital. The increased tax payments relate to our gain on our sale of PTC shares in fiscal year '23 and our payments on the 2018 TCJA transition tax. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 700,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $195 million.\nOn March 3, $600 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.5% compared to 20.2% a year ago. The decrease from the prior year was driven by lower sales volume and unfavorable mix. partially offset by lower incentive compensation. Higher sequential margin was driven by better volume and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by mix. Software and control margin of 25.7% decreased from 33.6% last year. The lower margin was driven by lower sales volume partially offset by lower incentive compensation, positive price cost and favorable mix driven by higher software sales. Higher sequential margin was driven by lower incentive compensation, partially offset by lower volume. Lifecycle services margin of 16.6% tripled from a year ago margin of 5.5%. The margin performance was driven by lower incentive compensation, higher sales and higher margins in Sensia Higher sequential margin was driven by volume, lower incentive compensation and ongoing improvements in productivity. Lifecycle services book-to-bill was 1.07, indicating continued strength in underlying demand.\nThe next Slide 9 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '23 to Q2 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $1.15 on an 8% organic sales decline. The EPS decline was driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix and was partially offset by positive price/cost. Incentive compensation was a $0.55 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects no projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year. The dilution impact from acquisitions was neutral due to better-than-expected profitability in ClearPath and Verb. The year-over-year impact from tax was a $0.10 tailwind. Let's now move on to the next Slide 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are lowering our guidance for fiscal '24. We now expect reported sales to decline in the range of negative 6% to negative 4% and organic sales to decline in the range of negative 8% to negative 6%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we continue to expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth. We now expect currency to contribute about 50 basis points to growth as we are seeing continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We are lowering our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $10 to $11. We now expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. The lowered expectations for free cash flow conversion is driven by the fact that the positive earnings impact from 0 incentive compensation recorded this fiscal year does not result in better cash generation this year. This is because the payout of any annual incentive compensation occurs in the first quarter of the following fiscal year.\nTherefore, we will see the benefit of this on our cash flow conversion in fiscal year '25. From an inventory standpoint, we continue to expect that inventory days on hand will drop by -- drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to the 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. From a calendarization perspective, we expect mid-single-digit sequential order growth in Q3 and high teens sequential order growth in Q4. We expect Q3 sales dollars and segment margin to be lower than Q2 levels. Now that we have largely cleared our product backlog, we are generating most of our product sales from new orders in the quarter. which are ramping up slower than we expected. We expect Q4 to be the highest revenue dollar and margin quarter of the year.\nFrom a sequential margin perspective, we expect margins in Q3 to be about 250 basis points lower than in Q2 due to the non-repeat of the bonus accrual reversal that benefited Q2. We also lower volume and mix. By segment, we expect our Q3 margins to be up slightly in intelligent devices down significantly in software and control due to lower Logix controller sales and flat in life cycle services. As Blake mentioned, we are adjusting our spending level with the lower outlook for this fiscal year. Last quarter, we expected our full year '24 investment spending to increase by $60 million year-over-year or to be up about 2%. We now expect our full year spend to be down approximately $50 million versus prior year. This roughly $100 million spend reduction in the second half of fiscal '24 is driven by a combination of structural and temporary cost out actions, which will help protect our margins in the current fiscal year and will set the right foundation for fiscal year '25 and beyond. Some examples of temporary cost reductions items include not filling open positions, reducing contractor spend and further reducing our travel and marketing spend for the year.\nIn terms of structural actions, we are expecting about $60 million of restructuring charges related to head count reductions in the second half of the fiscal year. The expected restructuring charges are excluded from our adjusted EPS. These savings and our continued cost structure optimization are aligned with our longer-term productivity focus and profitability targets. A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now expected to be around $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 114.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $600 million and $800 million to share repurchases during the year. This is an increase from our prior range of $300 million to $500 million and reflects a higher near-term prioritization of returning cash to shareholders versus acquisitions. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is now expected to be about $135 million.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. We are focused on getting synergies and efficiencies throughout the entire organization. The portfolio of capabilities that we have built and bought is second to none and now is the time to knit all these pieces together. This will help us drive more customer value, efficiency and cost savings, which in turn will yield higher margins and funds for reinvestment.\nAijana will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to one question and a quick follow-up. Julianne, let's take our first question.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, [ Julienne ]. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.\nOur results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include, and our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.\nA webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3.\nThis quarter, we saw double-digit sequential growth in orders, with all business segments and regions up from the trough in Q4 of last year. While we are continuing to see the impact of excess inventory in the channel, the underlying demand from machine builders and end-users remain strong.\nTotal sales were up 3.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 1% in the quarter, led by North America. China was the single largest drag on our shipments. Currency translation increased sales by over 1 point, and acquisitions contributed almost 1.5 points of growth.\nOur organic sales did come in below our expectations, largely due to the timing of our recovery to a more normal product book-and-bill process. As a source of our demand shifts from older backlog to new orders that need to be shipped as soon as they are received, we are working through some lingering shortages and line constraints. Our supply chain team is expected to complete this transition in Q2 with little impact on the full year.\nIn our Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were down 4.5% versus prior year. While product shipments in this segment experienced the biggest supply chain constraints in the quarter, we were able to offset some of that impact with strong performance from our configure-to-order businesses and from recent acquisitions.\nOur Clearpath and Cubic acquisitions had a strong quarter, both on top line and bottom line, showcasing the tremendous value these offerings are bringing to our customers across new verticals and applications. Last quarter, I talked about our presence in datacenter build-outs, and Cubic's momentum with large cloud service providers continues to fuel our growth in this end-market. I'll touch on some of the important Clearpath wins later on the call.\nSoftware & Control organic sales increased 4% year-over-year and were in line with our expectations. Logix continues to demonstrate unique value in the marketplace, and we've made some major software investments in this segment over the last few years. We are seeing the value from this innovation, demonstrated by double-digit sales growth in our cloud-native and on-prem information software offerings.\nLifecycle Services organic sales grew over 8% versus prior year, better than we expected. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.13, with strong order activity across solutions, services and our Sensia joint venture. I'm pleased with how our Sensia team is making progress, with profitable growth in the quarter. Q1 orders and sales were up over 25% year-over-year.\nOne of the strategic Sensia wins this quarter was with [ Melita ] oil and gas joint venture, one of the largest oil and gas companies in Libya, Sensia's advanced measurement technology is helping this customer modernize all of their liquid metering skids and establishes Sensia as one of the key players in the region for major metering turnkey solutions.\nAnother highlight of the quarter was our continued growth in ARR. Total annual recurring revenue was up 20% year-over-year, with strong growth across our Plex and fixed SaaS offerings and recurring services, including our growing cybersecurity business. The impact of these contracts on our financial performance is also increasing, especially in a year with relatively low product growth. This quarter, our Plex SaaS platform was selected by [ EOS ] Energy, an energy start-up focused on grid scale storage for utility companies. [ EOS ] Energy, in partnership with [ Acro ] Automation Systems, has selected Rockwell Automation to provide Plex, MES and QMS information software to complement [ Acro's ] battery manufacturing solution built on Rockwell's control platform. [ Acro ] is currently building out the first state-of-the-art manufacturing line that will manufacture [ EOS ] Energy's next-gen Z3 batteries.\nSegment margin of about 17% and adjusted EPS of $2.04 were both down versus prior year. The adjusted EPS was below our expectations, and Nick will discuss this further in a few minutes.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 industry segment performance. Before we get into the individual verticals, keep in mind that the more product-intensive industries were the most impacted by planned shipments moving to Q2 and later in the year.\nOur discrete sales were down 10% year-over-year. Within discrete, automotive sales were down high single digits. While auto customers are focused on near-term profitability and temporary slowdown in EV demand, they continue to fund new EV and battery CapEx programs. In addition to these investments, we are seeing increased activity across our traditional ICE and plug-in hybrid platforms as brand owners and tier suppliers are looking to diversify their exposure in response to consumer demand and infrastructure limitations.\nAs you know, Rockwell has a substantial installed base with these established automotive customers and is well positioned to capture additional market share regardless of the application.\nThis quarter, our Logix platform was selected by AKASOL BorgWarner, a global battery producer and automotive tier supplier, developing innovative battery manufacturing processes for their production plants in Seneca, South Carolina and Darmstadt, Germany. This customer plans to increase their production volume in Europe and North America and scale to more plants globally.\nAnother exciting automotive win this quarter came from Clearpath Robotics, where a large brand owner will be using over 100 of our auto, autonomous mobile robots in their U.S. subassembly applications.\nSemiconductor sales were also down high single digits versus prior year. While the industry is still navigating through a myriad of challenges, including geopolitical risk, excess memory capacity and workforce shortages, we continue to see new announcements in orders for greenfield projects and legacy fab upgrades, along with continued momentum in our wafer transport solutions.\nWithin our e-commerce and warehouse automation industry, sales declined mid-teens and were in line with our expectations. Customers across many verticals continue to modernize their existing operations to match the current market's needs. In addition to a strong funnel of these warehouse transformation projects, we're starting to see renewed CapEx plans from our e-commerce customers for fulfillment center builds later in fiscal year '24 and in fiscal year '25.\nMoving to our Hybrid Industries. Within this industry segment, growth in life sciences and tire were offset by declines in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were down high single digits versus prior year. Given the mix of products serving this customer segment, our Q1 performance in this vertical was most impacted by our internal capacity constraints mentioned earlier on the call. Similar to previous quarters, we continue to see large end-users investing their digital and cyber capabilities across their global footprint.\nThis quarter, we had another sizable Clearpath win at one of the largest food and beverage manufacturers in the world, where the customer chose our auto AMRs to replace their existing AGV system to increase throughput and flexibility while enhancing material movement security. It is clear our customers across many industries are focused on augmenting their existing workforce through autonomous and innovative solutions to drive further productivity safety and sustainability in their operations.\nLife Sciences sales grew 10% in the quarter. Note that our Life Sciences revenue is more weighted to software and services versus products. In addition to our MES and cybersecurity services momentum, we are continuing to see increased investments in high-growth areas such as advanced therapy medicinal products and GLP-1 diabetes and obesity drugs. Tire was up high single digits.\nMoving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 10% year-over-year, once again led by strong growth in oil and gas, metals and mining. Oil and gas sales were up over 25% this quarter. I already mentioned our performance in Sensia, and we continue to see follow-on orders from our customers' decarbonization and digitization projects worldwide.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 in our Q1 organic regional sales. North America organic sales were up over 4% year-over-year. North American manufacturers are continuing to invest, and we expect this region to be our strongest performing market this year.\nLatin America was down 0.5 point. EMEA sales were down about 2%. And Asia Pacific sales declined over 7%. Similar to the last few quarters, we continue to see challenges in the Chinese manufacturing economy, with high cancellations and pushouts relative to the rest of the world. Sales in China were down high teens versus prior year.\nMoving to Slide 6 for our fiscal 2024 outlook. We continue to expect our full year orders to grow low single digits versus prior year, with strong sequential growth through the balance of this fiscal year. Factoring our performance through January, our continuous analysis of distributor inventory levels and strong pipeline of customer projects, we are reaffirming our fiscal '24 sales guidance range with organic sales projected to grow 1% at the midpoint.\nCurrency is also expected to increase sales by 1%. And we now expect acquisitions to contribute 1.5 points of growth. ARR is still slated to grow about 15%.\nSegment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year, with significant second half increases coming from increased product volume, spending discipline and the growing benefit of productivity initiatives being taken in Lifecycle Services. Nick will share additional calendarization detail in his section.\nAdjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint, again, weighted to the back half of the year. And we still expect free cash flow conversion of 100%.\nLet me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 7, first quarter key financial information.\nFirst quarter reported sales were up 3.6% over last year. Q1 organic sales were up 1%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to total growth. Currency translation increased sales by 120 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price, in line with our expectations.\nSegment operating margin was 17.3%, compared to 20.2% a year ago. This 290 basis point decrease reflects higher investment spend, mix between products and solutions, and lower supply chain utilization. While our Q1 spend was down sequentially, we had a difficult year-over-year comparison due to an abnormally low investment spend in Q1 of last year.\nKey areas of year-over-year spending increases include investments in new products, digital infrastructure and commercial resources. I'll comment later on the expected progression of our investment spend when I cover our full year outlook.\nAs Blake mentioned, orders inflected upward sequentially, and we expect strong sequential order growth through the remainder of the year. The expected slope of orders is consistent with what we have discussed over the last couple of quarters.\nAdjusted EPS of $2.04, down 17% compared to last year, was below our expectations, primarily due to lower-than-expected sales and lower segment operating margin. The devaluation of the Argentine peso was an additional $0.10 adjusted EPS headwind in Q1. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 18%, slightly above the prior year rate. Free cash flow was negative $35 million, compared to a positive $42 million in the prior year. Our lower year-over-year free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher incentive compensation payout during the quarter, which was tied to our fiscal '23 performance.\nWorking capital decreased in Q1, driven by lower accounts receivable, partially offset by lower accounts payable. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 400,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $120 million. On December 31, $800 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 8 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Blake discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, our investment spend in the year-ago quarter was lower than normal as most of the incremental fiscal '23 investments started in Q2 of last year. This resulted in a difficult year-over-year margin comparison in Q1 for both Intelligent Devices and Software & Control.\nIntelligent Devices margin decreased to 16.2%, compared to 22.4% a year ago. The decrease from prior year was driven by lower sales volume, the timing of prior year investment spend, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive price/cost. Our Clearpath and Cubic acquisitions, both part of Intelligent Devices, are performing well and are making commercial -- and we are making commercial and technical investments here to accelerate profitable growth.\nSoftware & Control margin of 25% decreased from 29.2% last year. The lower margin was driven by the timing of prior year investment spend and lower supply chain utilization, partially offset by price/cost.\nLifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.13. Lifecycle Services margin of 10.4% doubled from the year-ago margin of 5.2%. Strong margin performance was driven by higher sales, lower incentive compensation and higher margins in Sensia. We are realizing productivity benefits from Lifecycle Services restructuring actions we took last year, and those benefits are coming in as expected.\nThe next slide, 9, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal '23 to Q1 fiscal '24. Core performance was down $0.10 on a 1% organic sales increase as positive price/cost was more than offset by negative product mix and lower supply chain utilization. Higher investment spend was a $0.40 EPS headwind. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 tailwind. This year-over-year improvement reflects a lower projected bonus payout this year versus an above-target payout last year.\nThe impact from acquisitions was a $0.10 headwind and aligned with our expectations. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, with the $0.10 headwind from the Argentine peso revaluation more than offsetting the positive impact from other currencies. The $0.05 -- the net $0.05 currency headwind was offset by a $0.05 tailwind from interest expense.\nShare count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter.\nLet's now move on to the next slide, 10, guidance for fiscal '24. We are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24 of reported sales growth of 0.5% to 6.5%, and organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4%. As Blake mentioned earlier, we now expect acquisitions to add 150 basis points to growth, up from 100 basis points in our prior guidance, as the growing pipeline of projects from Clearpath is leading to higher expected growth. Given this improvement, Clearpath is now expected to dilute adjusted EPS by $0.20 versus our prior expectation of $0.25.\nWe now expect a full year currency tailwind of 100 basis points, down from 150 basis points in our prior guide because projections for the euro and the Canadian dollar have weakened slightly for the year. We continue to expect price to be a positive contributor to growth for the year.\nWe expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. And we are reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance range of $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income. This reflects our continued expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to approximately 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24, compared to 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the higher incentive compensation payment made in Q1 relative to our fiscal year '23 performance, and higher income tax payments related to the realized capital gain on the sale of our stake in PTC, as well as our Tax Cuts and Jobs Act transition tax payment.\nFrom a calendarization perspective, we expect Q2 sales dollars and segment margin to be similar to Q1 levels. We previously expected the lead times on our last constrained products would return to normal by the end of Q1. This is now being pushed back to the middle of the year. This means that our split between first half and second half revenue will be even more weighted towards the second half.\nOur plan was and continues to be for balanced spend across the 4 quarters of fiscal year '24, compared to our upward trajectory of spend in fiscal year '23, as confidence in supply chain recovery pace grew. Given the split of sales between first and second half, that means first half margins will be noticeably lower compared to the year prior and second half margins noticeably higher.\nWe expect margins in Q2 to remain similar to what they were in Q1 and then increase to the mid-20s in Q3 and Q4. That expansion in margin is virtually all -- driven virtually all by revenue returning to levels consistent with end demand. We anticipate investment spend to be relatively flat across the 4 quarters of fiscal year '24.\nFrom a year-on-year perspective, Q2 and Q3 increases in investment spend will be approximately $10 million each and then a year-over-year decrease in Q4.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $120 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Despite geopolitical volatility, our detailed discussions with our distributors, machine builders and end-users point to fairly healthy market conditions. Our outlook for fiscal year '24 is based on an acceleration of new product orders as distributors and machine builders reduce excessive inventory. Our operations team is working around the clock to ensure we can convert these new orders into shipments at lead times that are as good or better than prepandemic lead times.\nWe continue to gain share across our key platforms, especially here in North America. We are seeing early orders from customer projects facilitated by economic stimulus, and automation continues to be an important way to maximize the productivity of available workers.\nOur recent acquisitions are performing well on both revenue and cost, with Clearpath Robotics being a standout addition to Rockwell's portfolio. We've seen multimillion dollar wins across diverse end-markets, including automotive, food and beverage, and even warehousing and logistics. And this is just the beginning.\nWe have a unique portfolio of high-value assets that we've built and bought with the best partner ecosystem in the business. Our focus is now to integrate these elements as only a pure-play can, growing share, profitability and cash flow by driving efficiency and synergy.\nAijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Blake. We would like to get to as many of you as possible, so please limit yourself to 1 question and a quick follow-up. Julian, let's take our first question.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. Later in the call, we will open up the lines for questions. If you have a question.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ajanazelner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Abbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rock Automation's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Genset, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press recent charts include and our [ cold-tole ] reference non-GAAP measures.\nBoth the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Before we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. And with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We delivered strong double-digit growth this quarter with both sales and adjusted earnings growing by over 20% year-over-year. Our solid execution and improving supply chain helped us exceed our Q4 expectations, resulting in double-digit sales growth across all regions and business segments.\nWith lead times significantly improving across our product lines, we were able to deliver products to customers faster than expected this quarter contributing to over $2.5 billion in total sales. This record shipment reflects Rockwell's continued capacity investments and demonstrates our organization's ability to scale for sustained growth. Total sales were up 20.5% versus prior year. Organic sales grew almost 18% year-over-year. Currency translation and acquisitions each contributed about 1.5 points of growth in the quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. And our Intelligent Devices Business segment, organic sales increased 18% versus prior year, with strong growth across all regions.\nWithin this segment, independent car technology had another strong quarter, finishing this fiscal year with over 50% growth in sales. This offering continues to be an integral part of our advanced material handling and production logistics offering. We are excited about our latest addition to this differentiated portfolio with our acquisition of ClearPath Robotics, and I will cover some strategic highlights of this deal later on the call. Software and Control organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. We continue to innovate in both the software and hardware portions of our architecture with significant new offerings such as high availability, process IO, FactoryTalk optics and factory talk data mosaics. We are pleased with how our organic and inorganic investments in this business are delivering new customer value and continued share gains.\nLife Cycle Services organic sales were up over 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 0.97 and above the historical average for Q4. Within this segment, our Sensia joint venture had a strong finish to the year with over 50% year-over-year order growth in the quarter. This growth was driven by strategic wins in process automation and artificial lift control systems, positioning this business for continued double-digit growth and improved profitability in fiscal year '24. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. One of the largest information solutions wins ever was with Prometeon Tire, a global leader in tire manufacturing headquartered in Italy. This customer was already using our cloud-native plex quality management system and has recently selected our on-prem MES software to digitize the manufacturing processes at a number of their global sites. This win not only demonstrates the stand-alone differentiation of our modular offerings, but also highlights the value from integration of our entire portfolio making it easier for customers to standardize their global operations.\nWithin Connected Services, we continue to grow our cybersecurity practice with Q4 sales growing 30% year-over-year. Our industrial cybersecurity software and expertise, along with differentiated partnerships on the IT security front are helping us grow our cybersecurity services into a business of well over $100 million this fiscal year with a significant portion of this being recurring revenue. Total annual recurring revenue grew 16% year-over-year. That's a good number, and ARR is a meaningful contributor to our future growth framework. Segment margin of 22.3% was in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.64, which is a company record for quarterly earnings grew almost 20% year-over-year. Significantly improving lead times in our Q4 shipment overperformance contributed to rapid backlog reduction in the quarter. We are ending the year with over $4.1 billion in backlog, over 40% coverage of annual sales, which is still well above pre-pandemic levels. A return to superior customer service remains our highest priority.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. Our discrete sales grew over 15% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 30% year-over-year, reflecting continued strength of our offerings in both electric vehicle and battery. Our EV business was close to 40% of our total automotive revenue in the quarter, growing double digits both year-over-year and sequentially. One of our strategic battery wins was with Nanotech Energy, a startup with new and innovative energy storage technologies. Nanotech has chosen Rockwell as their exclusive automation partner to build new battery Gigafactories. Semiconductor sales grew high single digits. We continue to take share in facilities management, control system applications at major semiconductor companies across the globe. In addition to our existing portfolio, we continue to win and build out a strong funnel of advanced wafer transport solutions leveraging our independent car technology across customers' greenfield and brownfield projects. We are also participating in the rapid build-out of data centers to support cloud computing and artificial intelligence.\nOur control systems are used to control and optimize the environment and safety systems in these facilities and our recent Cubic acquisition extends our reach into the power distribution portion of data centers. We've seen some strategic wins in Asia and in the U.S. in the quarter with more to come. In our e-commerce and warehouse automation vertical, sales declined mid-single digits versus prior year. After several quarters of customer delays and cancellations in the e-commerce portion of this vertical, we're starting to see new investments, especially in North America, positioning us for low single-digit year-over-year growth in fiscal year '24. Turning to our hybrid industries. Strong sales in this segment were paced by good growth in Food and Beverage, our largest customer vertical. Food and beverage sales grew low double digits versus prior year. In addition to continued cybersecurity and infrastructure modernization wins in this vertical, we had several wins in Q4 incorporating generative AI functionality where our digital services business is helping our CPG customers use real-time AI assistance as they develop new products, formulations and recipes.\nLife Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. This vertical is a great example of how we are delivering expanded customer value through a combination of software, hardware and digital services capabilities. This quarter, our plant PAX system was selected by BeiGene, a global biotechnology company developing innovative and affordable cancer medicines for their process control and environmental monitoring solutions at a greenfield site in New Jersey. Tire was up high teens in the quarter, with multiple wins across the globe, including the large software deal at Prometeon Tyre I mentioned earlier on the call. Moving to process. Sales in this industry segment grew over 25% year-over-year, led by strong growth in oil and gas, mining and metals. Oil and gas sales were up over 30% in the quarter. This growth was driven by a combination of digital oilfield solutions, including process safety and lift control in EMEA and Asia as well as several new carbon capture wins in North America.\nWe continue to grow our process industry footprint with a combination of Sensia and Rockwell oil and gas capabilities. We had a notable win this quarter at multitech filtration engineers an India headquartered global EPC company working on onshore and offshore projects. This was a competitive DCS win for Rockwell with one of the largest government-owned oil and gas explorer and producers in India, and we are excited to partner with multitech as they increase their footprint in the U.S. and Middle East. Turning now to Slide 5 and our Q4 organic regional sales. Once again, our sales by region in Q4 and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflect the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. Our full year orders in the Americas outperformed the rest of the world.\nNorth America organic sales were up over 12% year-over-year. Both Latin America and EMEA sales grew over 20% in the quarter, and Asia Pacific was up over 31%. While we saw strong sales growth in China in fiscal year '23, we continue to see high order deferrals and cancellations in China. Let's move to Slide 6, key highlights of fiscal year 2023. We had a record year of sales and earnings with our total sales exceeding $9 billion. We achieved this milestone ahead of the time frame we anticipated when we introduced our framework for accelerated profitable growth at Investor Day in 2019. Both reported and organic sales grew 17% this year, well above our original expectations. Information Solutions and Connected Services were up 9% year-over-year, reaching over $870 million, demonstrating our customers' accelerated adoption of new digital offerings. This is almost 3x what this figure was in 2018.\nTotal ARR grew 16% with strong growth in both our Software as a Service and recurring services offerings. Our strong operating performance resulted in 140 basis points of segment margin expansion versus prior year. Adjusted EPS of $12.12 was up 28%. We generated a record $1.2 billion of free cash flow this year. The much better free cash flow conversion in the quarter was primarily driven by improved working capital. This represents 86% free cash flow conversion for the year, and Nick will provide more detail in his remarks. And last but not least, we continue to invest in key areas of growth. In the last few months, we made 2 acquisitions: ClearPath and Verb, to further expand our value and accelerate top line growth. While we talk more about both investments at our upcoming Investor Day, let's turn to Slide 7 and take a few minutes to share why we are excited about the impact ClearPath we'll have on both our near and longer-term growth.\nAs we've shared with you earlier in the quarter, ClearPath is a leader in autonomous mobile robots or AMRs, serving customers across many industry segments. Their differentiated portfolio of auto brand AMRs is focused on the production logistics space where customers traditionally have relied on manual labor to move raw materials and subassemblies to the right place on production lines and also to move finished goods to shipping docks and warehouses. These workflows have been identified by many automotive companies, semiconductor fabs and consumer packaged goods suppliers as their top opportunity for efficiency and increased safety. Given the workforce shortage and skills gap, along with the overall move to more autonomous operations, the market for industrial mobile robots and factory floor applications is expected to grow over 30% for the next 5 years, and we believe no one is better positioned to capitalize on this growth than Rockwell and Clear Path.\nTogether, we are the only end-to-end provider of autonomous operations in this space. We'll bring together our FactoryTalk design capabilities to configure and simulate the production environment including these AMRs integrate with our cloud-native operations management software like Plex and fix and optimize the production process with our logic and embedded AI capabilities, all with 1 technology platform. This is an important milestone for Rockwell, and you will see more of what this can do for industrial operations at Automation Fair and Investor Day next week. We closed this acquisition in early October and expect it to contribute about a point of growth to our top line performance in fiscal year '24.\nAs we move to Slide 8, let's review our fiscal 2024 outlook. Consistent with what we shared with you on our last earnings call, our orders continued to decrease through fiscal 2023, reaching what we believe to be a trough in our fourth quarter. Orders for the full year were $8.2 billion. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to increase low single digits year-over-year. Order growth is expected to be highest in the Americas Asia orders are expected to be down year-over-year due to China. However, our relatively low exposure to China helps reduce the impact on our global results. The lead times on our products have largely returned to prepandemic levels with the remainder of our SKUs getting back to normal lead times around the end of our fiscal Q1. This addresses the final golden screw constraints to shipping past due backlog and clearing committed inventory at our distributors.\nBased on our analysis of lead time reduction by product line, distributor inventory and underlying demand at our largest machine builders and end users, we expect orders to begin to recover in Q1 and build in Q2. Customers continue to move forward with plans for both greenfield and brownfield capacity investments and also with resilience projects requiring increased cybersecurity and digitization. In the U.S., we've been adding commercial resources specifically focused on projects that are incented by recent stimulus authorized by legislation, including infrastructure, IRA and the chips and Science Act. This team won new business during the second half of fiscal year '23 with a strong funnel of additional projects expected to close in fiscal year '24. Our fiscal '24 guidance assumes total reported sales of about $9.4 billion at the midpoint. Organic sales are projected to grow 1% at the midpoint.\nCurrency is expected to increase sales by 1.5% and acquisitions are slated to contribute about 1 point of growth. We are projecting ARR to have another year of double-digit growth. Segment margin is expected to increase slightly versus prior year. Nick will cover this in more detail later. Adjusted EPS is slated to grow 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. At a high level, we expect strong conversion on slightly higher year-over-year organic sales. Good performance in reducing backlog during Q4 of fiscal '23 and pulled forward about $100 million of revenue and $0.25 of earnings. ClearPath is expected to reduce fiscal year '24 adjusted earnings by a similar amount. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '24. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 20.5% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 17.7%, and acquisitions contributed 140 basis points to growth. Currency translation increased sales by 140 basis points. About 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin was 22.3% compared to 23.3% a year ago. The year-over-year decrease reflects the impact of higher sales volume and higher price being more than offset by higher incentive compensation, investment spend and restructuring actions.\nAdjusted EPS of $3.64 was above our expectations, primarily due to higher organic sales, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation. We also took a restructuring charge in the quarter of just over $20 million, which is expected to yield more than $40 million of benefit on an annualized basis. All in, adjusted EPS grew 20% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17%, slightly below the prior year rate. Free cash flow of $776 million was $417 million higher than prior year. Our strong free cash flow generation in the quarter was driven by higher income and reductions in working capital. As you know, due to supply chain volatility, we have seen working capital balances grow over the last couple of years. and we are pleased to see our actions starting to bring working capital down.\nOne additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 200,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $55 million. On September 30, $900 million remained available under our repurchase authorization. Slide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Like discussed our top line performance in the quarter, so I'll focus on our margin performance. Given our pay-for-performance culture and strong results, all of our business segments saw higher bonus expense this year. In Q4, this represented between 200 and 300 basis points of year-over-year margin headwind for each of the segments. Intelligent Devices margin decreased by 100 basis points year-over-year and was up 450 basis points sequentially because of higher volume. Within intelligent devices, we are investing in our next-generation portfolio of drives and IO.\nSoftware and control margin of 33.5% decreased 100 basis points year-over-year. Our strong Q4 margin was driven by 25% year-over-year top line growth. This is the segment with the highest share of incremental investments as we continue to invest in next-generation logic performance and our cloud-native software portfolio. Life cycle services margin was 8.4% and was under the 10% exit rate we anticipated. In addition to a higher bonus, this segment was the most impacted by the restructuring charges taken in the quarter. Absent those 2 items, the margin for this segment came in as we planned. Before moving to the adjusted EPS walk, I'd like to talk about our Sensia joint venture. Challenged by the pandemic and global supply chain constraint, this joint venture underperformed our initial expectations for 2020 through 2023.\nOur updated outlook, which includes this lower base, resulted in a partial goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter. Sensia's onetime items and supply chain-related inefficiencies in recent quarters are largely behind us. Sensia delivered double-digit top line growth in fiscal '23 has strong orders growth, as Blake mentioned. Going forward, we expect profitable double-digit growth from Sensia. The next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '22 to Q4 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.05 on a 17.7% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.45 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher bonus payout this year versus a below-target payout last year. The year-over-year impact from currency was a $0.05 headwind, offset by a $0.10 tailwind from interest expense. Share count and tax rate were each immaterial to the year-over-year change in EPS this quarter. Slide 12 provides key financial information for the full fiscal year 2023. Reported sales grew 17% to $9.1 billion, including over 1 point coming from acquisitions.\nCurrency negatively impacted sales by approximately $100 million or 1.4 points. Organic sales were up 17%. The Full year segment margin of 21.3% increased 140 basis points over last year. The increase was due to higher sales partially offset by higher investment spend and higher incentive compensation. We accelerated growth investments for fiscal '23 above our original expectations as our revenue outperformed. Adjusted EPS was up 28%, a detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference. As discussed earlier, free cash flow conversion was ahead of our expectations, with free cash flow conversion of 86% in fiscal '23. Free cash flow increased $532 million from fiscal '22. The increase in free cash flow was driven by higher pretax income. Working capital peaked in Q3 at 24% of sales and came down to 20% in Q4. Return on invested capital was 20.9% for fiscal '23 and 570 basis points better than the prior year, primarily driven by higher net income. For the year, we deployed about $850 million of capital towards dividends and share repurchases and made inorganic investments of $170 million. We also paid down debt by about $870 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong. This strength is what allowed us to fund our acquisitions in the first quarter of fiscal year '24 without any new long-term debt.\nBefore we turn to our fiscal '24 guidance, we want to update you on Q4 orders and our current thinking as we look forward. In Q4, orders decreased quicker than we expected as machine builders and distributors continue to work through inventory in response to our rapidly improving lead times. As Blake said, we believe Q4 was the trough and orders in October support that view. We expect fiscal year '24 orders to grow low single digits with an order profile similar to what we discussed in Q3. Let's now move on to the next slide, 13, Guidance for fiscal '24. In fiscal year '24, we are focusing on growing earnings even in a year of low top line growth. At the same time, we'll continue to invest in our own resilience, in our most important innovation projects to extend our differentiation and in customer-facing resources to capitalize on continued strong secular demand for automation. We expect our reported sales growth to range from 0.5% to 6.5%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of negative 2% to positive 4% and we expect acquisitions to add 100 basis points to growth in addition to a full year currency tailwind of 150 basis points.\nFrom a segment perspective, given our exceptionally strong backlog execution in software and control that resulted in 25% top line growth in fiscal year '23, we expect this segment to see the lowest growth in fiscal year '24. We expect positive organic sales growth in both our Intelligent Devices and life cycle services segments. We expect price will be a positive contributor to growth for the year. Segment margin will be around 21.5%, up slightly from fiscal year '23. This includes a 60 basis point headwind coming from the acquisitions of ClearPath and Verb. VERB's impact to adjusted EPS is relatively flat in fiscal year '24. ClearPath will reduce earnings per share in fiscal year '24 by $0.25 on an unlevered basis. This impact reflects continued R&D and commercialization investments as well as integration expenses. We expect the ClearPath acquisition to become accretive to earnings in fiscal year '26. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. Our adjusted EPS guidance range is $12 to $13.50. We expect full year fiscal '24 free cash flow conversion of about 100% of adjusted income.\nThis reflects our expectation that inventory days on hand will drop to 125 days by the end of fiscal year '24 compared to approximately 140 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '23. Our outlook for cash tax payments is higher due to a tax payment for realized capital gains on the sale of our stake in PTC and a higher tax and higher tax payments required under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We expect free cash flow conversion in the first half to be well below 100%, mostly tied to the timing of our incentive compensation payout and income tax payments. From a calendarization perspective, we expect year-over-year organic sales to grow in the low single digits in Q1, followed by sequential growth in sales volume as we progress through the year. As a result of our strong Q4 backlog performance, volumes will be down from Q4 to Q1. Given this dynamic, Q1 is projected to be our lowest margin quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year.\nFor the full year, let's turn to Slide 14 for our adjusted EPS walk. Our core is expected to have a modest positive impact on earnings of about $0.05 from fiscal year '23 to fiscal year '24. Structural productivity from our Q4 actions is expected to increase earnings by $0.25 and while increased growth investments will reduce earnings by $0.55. Incentive compensation for fiscal year '23 was above target due to strong performance. So this represents a tailwind of $0.85 for fiscal '24. Acquisitions will be diluted by $0.25. Our 150 basis points of sales growth from currency will add $0.25 a and the net of interest, tax and shares will contribute about $0.05. A few additional comments on fiscal '24 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '24 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.3 million shares. We expect to deploy between $300 million and $500 million to share repurchases during the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. As I reflect on 2023, it's clear our continued investments in talent and technology are paying off. I'm proud of how our tight knit organization has navigated through a dynamic environment and helped us deliver a record year of sales and earnings exceeding expectations. Looking at the year ahead of us, we are aware of the macroeconomic backdrop and the geopolitical situation that continues to change every day.\nYou heard us talk today about focusing and optimizing our workforce for further productivity so that we can continue investing in key areas of growth. Our customers rely on our continued innovation and differentiation to provide energy and critical infrastructure security across the globe to help bring new life-saving drugs to market and to use leading technology to augment and enable their workforce. We look forward to seeing a lot of you at our Investor Day in Boston next week where we will be",

Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We saw good double-digit growth in both sales and earnings this quarter as component shortages continue to ease. Lead times also continued to reduce across our product lines with recovery to pre-pandemic lead times expected for all products by the end of the calendar year.\nWe did miss almost a week of planned shipments in May because of a longer-than-expected changeover to a new third-party logistics supplier at our North American distribution center. Shipments from this distribution center recovered in June and we now have higher capacity in place for Q4 fiscal year '24 and beyond. Both total and organic sales grew over 13% versus prior year with currency and acquisitions roughly netting each other out.\nCurrency translation decreased sales by less than 1 point and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. Similar to prior quarters, the split of our sales by business segment, region and industry was largely driven by the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up 8% versus prior year. The changeover in our distribution center had the biggest impact on this segment in the quarter. Within the Intelligent Devices segment, independent car technology continues to be a disruptive technology, and we had several more strategic material handling wins in the U.S. this quarter.\nThe recent launch of our on-machine armor kinetics motion control products adds to our innovative material handling portfolio. We also had an important win in Europe with [indiscernible] one of the world's leading desalination companies where our PowerFlex drives and services expertise are helping this customer deliver economical and sustainable drinking water to millions of people in developing regions.\nSoftware and control organic sales grew over 24% year-over-year. Logix sales were up almost 40% this quarter, reflecting the strong differentiation of our control platform. and the continued benefits from supply chain resiliency investments we've made over the last year. Another example of our many ways to win within software and control is recent success at a well-known global parcel delivery company, where the combination of our awesome industrial PCs ThinManager and View software unseated a long-standing competitor as the customer standardizes its North America facilities on a Rockwell visualization platform.\nLife Cycle Services organic sales increased 8% versus prior year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.08, led by strong orders in Sensia and our services business. Sensia had another good quarter of orders and sales with multiple large deals across EMEA and Asia. We also delivered higher sequential margins in life cycle services this quarter. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew 10% versus prior year. We had multiple wins across our entire Information Solutions portfolio in Q3 and including both our on-prem and cloud-native software.\nThis quarter, 1 of the world's top tire manufacturers located in Asia Pacific, selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk production center to develop its new global MES platform. Another important IS win in Asia was with a Japanese global leader in HVAC where our cloud-native plex platform is being deployed on Microsoft Azure at 1 of their greenfield plants. The customer chose our SaaS solution to quickly start up a manufacturing execution and quality management system without the need for extensive on-premise hardware, software and support.\nWe saw Plex synergy wins continue to ramp up in the quarter as our strong market access machine is contributing to new SaaS logos. In the quarter, we saw the benefits of our software partnership with PTC with numerous recurring revenue wins through a combination of our digital services business and PTC's ThingWorx visualization platform. Also regarding PTC, we continue to monetize the investment we made in 2018. We now own less than 5% of total shares outstanding and in accordance with the terms of our agreement, I am stepping off of their Board. Our commercial relationship remains strong and was extended in June. In Connected Services, we had an important cybersecurity win with ADNOC, the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company.\nThis customer is leveraging our network of security services and expertise along with an intrusion detection system from our partner, Dragos to help secure its network infrastructure and comply with cyber governance regulations. Our total annual recurring revenue grew a very strong 17% year-over-year this quarter. Segment margin of 21.1% was flat to last year and in line with our expectations despite the shipment shortfall. Adjusted EPS grew over 13% year-over-year. Backlog is beginning to reduce as lead times improve. Let's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance.\nOur discrete sales were up about 10% versus prior year. Within discrete, automotive sales grew mid-teens year-over-year. One of the notable customer wins here this quarter was with the Korean Tier 1 supplier working on an EV battery project for a European brand owner. This customer is using our core automation offerings, including motion control to provide tooling for battery thermal management.\nAnother automotive win this quarter was with Jaguar Land Rover, where Rockwell was selected to support the JLR electrified architecture for 3 of their EV body shops in the U.K. Semiconductor sales grew high teens this quarter. Building on strength over the last few quarters, we continue to see broader adoption of our wafer transport solutions by the world's leading semiconductor manufacturers.\nThis quarter, we also had an important plex win in semiconductor at SOC, Saudi Arabia, as the customer implements our smart manufacturing platform at its site and read. In e-commerce and warehouse automation, sales were down high teens versus prior year, driven by continued delays in some cancellations at our e-commerce customers. Moving to our hybrid industries segment.\nSales in this segment grew 15% year-over-year. led by strong growth in food and beverage and tire. Food and beverage sales were up mid-teens versus prior year. We continue to see both greenfield and brownfield investments in this vertical with 1 of our most important multiyear wins this quarter focused on a customer's global fleet modernization program. A leading global food processing company is standardizing over 50 of its sites on our plant PAX control platform. This competitive DCS win is a testament to our progress in process control applications in both technology and domain expertise.\nLife Sciences sales grew mid-single digits versus prior year. This industry continues to see strong investments in CapEx and OpEx projects across all regions both in traditional pharmaceuticals and newer advanced therapy medicinal products. We had a strategic win with Biosero, a member of the Bico Group in North America where our combined technologies increase the speed and accuracy of new drug development. Biosero selected our independent cart technology to automate lab workflows for a cell and gene therapy program.\nTire was up over 35% in the quarter. Turning to Process Industries, Process sales were up 15% year-over-year, led by growth in oil and gas and mining.\nTurning now to Slide 5 and our Q3 organic regional sales. As I said earlier, our growth by region this quarter and for the full year fiscal year '23 reflects the composition of our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew about 2% year-over-year against higher comps. Latin America was up 7%. Through Q3, our orders in the Americas are outpacing the rest of the world. EMEA sales grew 34% and Asia Pacific was up over 44%. We did see an uptick in order cancellations in China this quarter.\nLet's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We are confident that shipments in the fourth quarter will recover the shortfall in Q3 caused by the distribution center change. Shipments in July were in line with our forecast for the full year. Our fiscal '23 guidance assumes a total reported sales growth range of 14% to 16%, and we continue to expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We now expect the impact from acquisitions and currency to offset each other. Nick will cover this in more detail later.\nWe have said all along that we expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and constrained products improve, and that's what we are seeing right now. With improving lead times, machine builders do not need as many months of products on order and are no longer placing unusually large advanced orders. Their incoming orders and frontlog remains strong and improving component lead times will help them improve their cash flow.\nWe also expect distributor restock orders will pick up as they receive the last constrained items that allow them to clear their committed inventory and complete customer orders. Our order cancellation rates remain low. We now expect our full year fiscal year '23 orders to be in the $8.5 billion to $9 billion range. Given this updated order outlook, we now expect to finish the year with about $4.5 billion to $5 billion in backlog, with about 80% of that backlog shippable in fiscal year '24.\nWe expect organic ARR to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by 160 basis points year-over-year. We are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 and now expect adjusted EPS to grow 25% versus prior year. And we now expect 80% free cash flow conversion due to higher working capital.\nLet me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q3 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 13.7% over last year. Q3 organic sales were up 13.2% and acquisitions contributed 120 basis points to total growth. Currency translator decreased sales by 70 basis points. About 3 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.1% and was in line with our expectations as improved productivity offset lower-than-expected sales. The 30 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price cost, partially offset by higher investment spend. .\nCorporate and other expense was $32 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was below our expectations due to our shift in shipments from Q3 to Q4. Adjusted EPS grew 13% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide. The adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.1% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow of $240 million was $87 million lower than prior year, driven by increases in working capital and income tax payments, partially offset by higher pretax income. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable and inventory.\nInventory grew by 6 days, primarily in finished goods as a result of the shift in planned shipments from Q3 to Q4. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 220,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $62 million. On June 30, $1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales growth was led by software and control, which grew 24% year-over-year. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin decreased by 290 basis points year-over-year due to higher investment spend, unfavorable mix and higher incentive compensation. partially offset by positive price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 340 basis points compared to last year. on higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher investment spend.\nWe continue to accelerate top line growth and profitability from acquisitions in the past few years, including Plex, Fiix and ASEM. Lifecycle Services margin was similar to last year and improving sequentially through the year as planned. Our focus on productivity is yielding benefits now and into the coming quarters. We continue to expect life cycle services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4.\nThe next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '22 to Q3 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $0.90 excluding increased investment spend of $0.35 on a 13.2% organic sales increase. Incentive compensation was a $0.20 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects the higher expected bonus payout this year versus a below normal payout last year. The year-over-year impacts from tax, interest expense, currency and share count were each immaterial to EPS this quarter.\nBefore we turn to our fiscal '23 guidance, let's spend a few minutes talking about our orders trends on Slide 11. We think it will be helpful to provide more color on our orders progression over the last couple of years and going forward. First, in fiscal 2020, we saw reduced orders caused by the constraints on customers' operations and uncertainty that the pandemic created. Then in fiscal '21 and fiscal '22, we saw increased orders driven by the combination of 3 things: first, historically high levels of investment in certain verticals like EV and semi as well as an increasing need for more automation to address workforce shortages and business resiliency.\nSecond, catch up on products that many of our customers deferred during fiscal year '20. And three, large advanced orders due to extended lead times caused by component shortages. In fiscal year '23, we are continuing to see strong underlying demand but we are now seeing the long anticipated moderation in orders driven by our improving lead times for products. As we stated earlier, we expect lead times to continue to normalize in the next 2 quarters and we expect virtually all of our product lead times to be back at pre-pandemic levels by the end of calendar year '23.\nOnce our lead times are back at normal levels, we expect customer orders to closely align with the strong underlying demand. I think it's worth noting that over the fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year '23 time period, encompassing the ups and downs of the order cycle, we will have grown revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 8% plus a backlog that has more than tripled during that time frame.\nLet's now move to the next Slide 12, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing the midpoint of our reported sales guidance from 14.5% to 15%. We expect organic sales growth in the range of 14% to 16%, and we now expect a full year currency headwind of 100 basis points, 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook reflects the weakening of the U.S. dollar in recent weeks. We continue to expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. And we still expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, unchanged from prior guidance.\nOur updated guidance still assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, unchanged from our prior guide. We are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $11.70 to $12.10. This increases the midpoint of our EPS guidance to $11.90, up $0.05 from prior guidance and up 25% from last year. The $0.05 increase is driven by currency.\nWe now expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 80% of adjusted income. This updated guidance reflects the new calendarization of our revenue and our updated projection of inventory days on hand. We do expect our inventory days on hand to drop by the end of the year to 125 days. This will be lower than the approximately 130 days of inventory we had at the end of fiscal year '22, but will likely not reduce to the 112 days we originally expected.\nOur outlook for cash tax payments also increased as we realized capital gains on our sales of PTC shares. Income tax payments tied to these gains are reflected in our free cash flow results.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be about $130 million. And we're still assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. As we continue to stay close to end users, machine builders and distributors, a few key themes emerge. First, demand remains strong. We've mentioned softness in e-commerce and in parts of the Chinese economy, but investment by end users and machinery builders continues across the majority of regions and serve verticals. Second, the global supply chain is improving, but it will take some months to flush the inefficiencies that have built up over the last few years, especially inventory. This is seen at machine builders, distributors and in our own operations.\nThird, the opportunities for automation to play a strategic role in our customers' success have never been higher. -- workforce scarcity, American shoring of manufacturing and the premium being placed on business agility are all positive reads for Rockwell. We're moving fast to meet these needs with new capacity and capabilities. It's hard to believe, but our annual Automation Fair and Investor Day are only about 3 months away. And you should look forward to hearing more about the exciting next leg of our journey.\nI want to thank all our employees and also our unmatched distributors, who have worked so hard to bring us to this point and who collectively make the difference at our customers.\nAijana will now begin the Q&A session.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Julian. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO. Our results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures.\nBoth the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our second quarter results on Slide 3. We had an outstanding quarter of strong growth in both sales and earnings. Our double-digit sales and margin growth continue to reflect Rockwell's strong execution and focus on business resiliency as well as overall improvement in electronic component availability.\nThe demand for our differentiated offerings continue to be strong even in this uncertain economic environment. Through the first half of this fiscal year, our total orders were $4.8 billion, spread evenly between the 2 quarters once we adjust for the estimated price-related pull forward in our fiscal Q1. As expected, our order cancellation rates remain in the low single digits through April.\nTotal sales grew over 25% versus prior year. Organic sales were up over 27% year-over-year and were above our expectations. Currency translation reduced sales by about 3% and acquisitions contributed over 1 point of growth this quarter. As in the prior quarters, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry, was largely driven by access to electronic components and the composition of our backlog.\nIn the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew 27% versus prior year with broad-based growth across all businesses. We continue to see wider adoption of our Independent Cart Technology in new applications across semiconductor, food and beverage and life sciences. One example of a new application is wafer transport in semiconductor fabs.\nWe continue to see increasing demand for this offering, including an important win with a large U.S. company this quarter. This customer is investing in modernizing and expanding its material handling systems and our Independent Cart Technology helps increase wafer output and more efficiently utilizes existing fab space leading to increased capacity and significant savings.\nSoftware and Control organic sales increased over 40%. Strong growth versus prior year was led by logic, where we continue to see the benefits of our resiliency investments and an overall improvement in supply chain.\nLifecycle Services organic sales were up 12% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.27, led by strong order intake in our Sensia business. Information Solutions and Connected Services sales grew about 10% versus prior year. We had another quarter of competitive multiyear wins across our software and cybersecurity services portfolio.\nWithin Information Solutions, I am pleased with the increasing breadth of our new Plex customers as we continue to expand our SaaS, Smart Manufacturing platform to new industries and geographies.\nOne of our Plex wins this quarter was with AB-InBev, the world's largest brewing company and its start-up business EverGrain, focused on upcycling grain by product into sustainable supply of nutritious food ingredients. Our modular and cloud-native Plex software is helping EverGrain quickly deploy mission-critical quality management capabilities today while providing the functionality for the business to scale in the future.\nIn Connected Services, we saw another quarter of customer demand for our recurring cybersecurity and infrastructure as a service offerings as customers across many industries are continuing to invest in safety and security of their operations. One of these wins was with Darling Ingredients, a food processing company focused on reducing food waste by collecting and repurposing animal-based products.\nOur annual recurring revenue grew 15% year-over-year in Q2. Segment margin of 21.3% was up over 560 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew over 81% year-over-year. We also completed the acquisition of Knowledge Lens this quarter. which adds significant scale to our Kalypso digital services business.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q2 end market performance. Consistent with my earlier comments on the gradually improving supply chain environment, all 3 industry segments grew strong double digits versus prior year. Our discrete sales were up about 20% in the quarter. Within discrete, Automotive sales grew over 40% versus prior year. We saw a number of strategic wins in EV and battery this quarter both in the U.S. and China, where a combination of our core automation and strong partner ecosystem helped edge out our biggest competitors. While some customers are optimizing operating costs in the near term, they still continue to invest in building out new capacity to meet their production goals.\nSemiconductor sales were up mid-teens year-over-year. I already mentioned 1 semiconductor win. Another example of how Rockwell is expanding our existing semi footprint now with wafer transport applications is our multiyear project win with analog devices.\nOur Independent Cart Technology was chosen to automate [ ADi's ] material handling applications at several of their global fabs. By implementing our technology, ADi will improve operator productivity by at least 20% by moving away from manually delivering lots across the fab.\nIn E-commerce and Warehouse Automation, our Q2 sales were down mid-single digits versus prior year. While we continue to see a pause in greenfield announcements, e-commerce players, traditional retailers and many consumer packaged goods companies continue to invest in modernizing their warehouses.\nTurning to our hybrid industries. Sales in this segment increased 35% year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up almost 40% versus prior year. We also saw a number of large orders this quarter with customers in this vertical continuing to invest in making their brownfield facilities more efficient and resilient. Demand in our dairy and agriculture processing business remains especially strong.\nLife Sciences sales grew 20% year-over-year. One of the important wins this quarter was with a leading European health care company, where our Kalypso digital services used our Emulate3D simulation software to model and test multiple plant layouts to eliminate potential bottlenecks and increase worker safety. Tire was up over 50% in the quarter.\nMoving to process. This segment was up over 25% versus prior year, once again led by growth in oil and gas and metals. Within process, we had an important sustainability win. Through Occidental Petroleum's 1.5 subsidiary, Rockwell is providing control systems for direct air capture units that help remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. We are proud to be a part of Oxy's low-carbon strategy to deliver large-scale carbon management solutions that accelerate net zero economy.\nTurning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales. Similar to prior quarters, our growth by region reflects the electronic component availability and what's in our backlog rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 23% year-over-year. Latin America increased 16%, and EMEA sales grew 42% and Asia Pacific was up 32%.\nLet's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. We have previously said that the fiscal '23 sales performance is primarily based on our ability to ship backlog. Given our performance in the first half, improving chip supply and the benefits of our resiliency actions, we are increasing our sales and earnings outlook for fiscal '23. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 14.5%. We expect organic sales growth of 15% at the midpoint. We expect acquisitions to contribute over 1 point of growth and currency to be a headwind of 1.5 points. Nick will touch more on this later.\nOrganic ARR is expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over [ 160 ] basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 25% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion.\nBefore I turn it over to Nick, let me share some of our thoughts on the setup for fiscal year '24. With more than half of this fiscal year behind us and through our continued discussions with end customers, we believe we have better visibility into our full year orders and backlog levels. We expect our fiscal '23 orders to be about $9 billion, which implies a slight moderation of orders in the second half of this year. This is consistent with our expectations of improving component availability and the subsequent reduction in customer lead times.\nWith our current orders outlook, we anticipate exiting the year with backlog levels of around $5 billion, positioning us well for fiscal year '24. Also, as the largest pure play, we have an impressive record of earnings growth, and we expect that to continue given our unique market focus and differentiation. Let me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q2 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nChief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 25.8% over last year. Q2 organic sales were up 27.3%, and acquisitions contributed 130 basis points to total growth.\nCurrency translation decreased sales by 2.8% about 6 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 21.3% and was higher than our expectations. The majority of this outperformance was driven by the higher revenue. The 560 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by higher sales volume and positive price costs, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and higher investment spend.\nCorporate and other expense was $29 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $3.01 was ahead of our expectations and grew 81% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 17.4%. Free cash flow of $156 million was $110 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income, partially offset by higher working capital. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by higher accounts receivable given our Q2 sales outperformance.\nWe improved our days on hand in inventory by 7 days in Q2, and we expect reductions in inventory days to continue for the balance of the year. One additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 140,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $38 million. On March 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits year-over-year in each of our operating segments. Turning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin increased by 560 basis points year-over-year due to positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation.\nSegment margin for Software and Control increased 900 basis points compared to last year on higher sales volume and positive price costs partially offset by higher investment spend and incentive compensation.\nLifecycle Services margin decreased by 180 basis points year-over-year as the benefit of higher sales was more than offset by higher incentive compensation and onetime items to expand future profitability. We expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand sequentially and exceed 10% in Q4.\nThe next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '22 to Q2 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $1.95 on a 27.3% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in EPS. The year-over-year headwind reflects a stronger dollar versus Q2 of last year. Incentive compensation was a $0.40 headwind. This year-over-year increase reflects our lower bonus in Q2 of last year and our higher growth and earnings expectations for this fiscal year.\nHigher interest expense was a $0.05 impact. Our adjusted -- our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05.\nLet's move on to Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to approximately $8.9 billion in fiscal '23 or 14.5% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 13% to 17% or 15% at the midpoint. We expect volume to add 10 points of growth and price to add 5 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our performance through the first half of the fiscal year and is based on our current view of ongoing supply chain improvement.\nIn terms of the second half, we expect mid-teens organic growth in Q3 and high single-digit growth in Q4. This calendarization includes our view of chip availability in each of the next 2 quarters and our Q3 transition from one third-party logistics provider to another at 1 of our distribution centers. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 150 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance. This updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar.\nWe expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%, up from our prior guidance of about 21%, driven by higher volume and higher benefit from price costs for the full year. We now expect an over 200 basis point improvement to margin year-over-year from positive price cost. This represents a 100 basis point increase versus our prior guidance, split evenly between price and cost. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of close to 40%. We now expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17.5%, down from our prior forecast of 18% due to discrete items that were realized in Q2.\nWe are increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to $11.50 to $12.20. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 25% adjusted EPS growth, up from prior guidance of approximately 17% growth at the midpoint.\nWe expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. A few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is still expected to be around $130 million. And we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.6 million shares.\nTurning to Slide 12. Versus our prior guidance, we are increasing the midpoint for EPS by $0.75. Our guidance reflects an increase in our core of $1.05 driven by higher organic sales and our improved outlook in price/cost. We also deployed additional investments in sales and new product development as well as digital infrastructure that will generate future revenue growth and profitability. Currency is adding $0.05. Given the stronger outlook, our incentive compensation is increased by $0.40. And finally, our 50 basis point drop in our adjusted effective tax rate will add $0.05.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. We are still operating in a dynamic environment and are laser-focused on execution through the rest of this fiscal year. With that said, we are continuing to accelerate new product development and investments in cloud-native technologies.\nRevenue from our new offerings, both organic and inorganic is becoming a more meaningful contributor to growth and share gains. We are the largest pure-play automation company with market-leading solutions across discrete, hybrid and process industries and we are adding scale to our differentiated offerings through strong partnerships and strategic acquisitions.\nOur recent acquisition of Knowledge Lens is adding 600 resources with cutting-edge data science, AI and cloud solutions to our existing digital services business. This expanded team is already working with our key customers on their next-generation plans. I want to welcome all Knowledge Lens' employees to Rockwell.\nOur close relationships with end customers, our best-in-class ecosystem and our talent give us confidence in the continued momentum for growth and profitability this year and beyond. Aijana will now begin the Q&A session.",

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations and Market Strategy. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning, and thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.\nOur results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference, non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days.

Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and details in all our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3.\nI'm pleased with our team's exceptional focus and execution as we delivered another quarter of strong growth and profitability. Organic sales and earnings were both up year-over-year and better than we expected this quarter. Rockwell's continued investments in resiliency and agility, along with a gradually improving supply chain environment, helped more than offset many of the headwinds we faced heading into Q1.\nOrders in backlog were up sequentially in the quarter. Order cancellation rates were flat to prior quarter and remain in the low single digits through January. We are encouraged by the continued strength of our end user demand across all business segments and regions.\nTotal sales grew almost 7% versus prior year. Organic sales were up 10% year-over-year, better than our expectations despite a very dynamic supply chain environment. Currency translation reduced sales by 4% and acquisitions contributed about 1 point of growth this quarter.\nConsistent with our prior assumptions, the split of sales by business segment, region and industry was impacted by access to specific electronic components and the composition of our backlog. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased about 7% versus prior year, with growth in all regions and product lines. We had another quarter of remarkable order growth in our independent card technology business, driven by large multiyear deals across many industries, including EV, material handling and semiconductor. I'll cover some of these strategic wins in a few minutes.\nSoftware and control organic sales grew almost 16% versus prior year. Better-than-expected growth was driven by our team's ability to quickly redesign and requalify certain logic products to secure additional components supply with the support from key suppliers. We also continue to see a gradual improvement in electronic component supply.\nLifecycle Services organic sales were up 10% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was a healthy 1.21 and was consistent across solutions, services and Sensia businesses. Information Solutions & Connected Services sales had another quarter of double-digit year-over-year growth. We are seeing a significant uptick here in large multisite and multiyear deals, both in software and services.\nOne of our Information Solutions wins this quarter was with a leading potato processing company, where a combination of our Calypso digital consulting and enterprise analytics capabilities helped the customer increase throughput and reduce energy costs across multiple production lines. We're proud to be an important digital partner to this global company as they focus on doubling their revenue over the next 5 years.\nOur recent software acquisitions continue to land us new logos across various industries and regions. These include Plex wins in metals, food and beverage and automotive and numerous enterprise asset management wins with Fiix's cloud-native offering in Asia, where we are leveraging the distribution network to amplify our sales with local customers.\nOn the Connected Services side, we continue to build momentum with enterprise cybersecurity wins with customers across food and beverage, life sciences and consumer packaged goods, prioritizing their investments and resiliency of their operations.\nOne of our key cyber wins this quarter was with one of the world's largest global consumer goods companies who chose Rockwell's differentiated portfolio of hardware, software and services along with the capabilities of our partner Clarity to manage OT security at hundreds of their sites globally. This multiyear deal will also contribute to our double-digit growth in annual recurring revenue.\nQ1 ARR grew 14%. Segment margin of 20% was up over 100 basis points year-over-year and was better than expected. Adjusted EPS grew 15% year-over-year.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q1 end market performance. All 3 industry segments saw strong year-over-year growth and were above expectations, consistent with the continued gradual improvement in electronic component availability.\nIn our discrete industries, sales were up low teens. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We continue to win new and follow-on orders with both the brand owners and the supporting EV ecosystem, including vehicle and battery OEMs and system integrators.\nA good example of Rockwell's strong position in EV this quarter is our win with a leading battery supplier. Our independent cart technology was selected for the battery cell assembly and formation process to support Ford's Blue Oval greenfield plants in Kentucky and Tennessee. We talked about our strategic partnership with Ford at our Investor Day last November, and we are excited about the progress we are making together.\nSemiconductor sales grew over 20% versus prior year. This is another vertical where we are able to expand our offerings to new applications, including independent cart for wafer transport and logic-based automation for silicon carbide wafer manufacturing.\nIn e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down low teens versus prior year. Some of our largest e-commerce customers are in the process of shifting their investment from greenfield to brownfield, and we expect continued investments in upgrading existing facilities, including next-gen sortation systems, over the course of this fiscal year.\nOne of our large multiyear wins in e-commerce this quarter was with CMC, a leader in smart solutions for sustainable packaging. Rockwell's Smart Machine Architecture, which includes our full portfolio of hardware and software, will help CMC produce its innovative on-demand packaging at scale.\nAnother important win in the quarter was with Phononic, a technology company focused on unique heating and cooling systems. This customer is working with our Kalypso team to create the cloud and IoT infrastructure necessary to support Phononic's disruptive design for cold chain solutions and warehouse applications.\nMoving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew low teens year-over-year, led by strong growth in food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up over 15% versus prior year. As I mentioned earlier, we saw a number of large cybersecurity wins in this vertical, underscoring customers' focus on resiliency and security in their operations.\nLife Sciences sales grew mid-single digits in the quarter. In addition to software, we saw a high number of cybersecurity wins in this end market this quarter with several important wins coming from Europe. Tire was also up mid-single digits in the quarter.\nLet's turn to process. This segment grew mid-single digits versus prior year, led by growth in metals and oil and gas. We rarely talk about our metals vertical, but we had an important sustainability win with Cornish Lithium, a pioneering mineral exploration and development company, who chose Rockwell's PlantPAx process control system for its demo plan to convert lithium concentrate into high-grade refined lithium used for battery production. We are excited to partner with Cornish Lithium on this energy transition journey.\nTurning now to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales. Similar to last fiscal year, our performance here is a reflection of electronic component availability rather than the underlying customer demand. North America organic sales grew 8% year-over-year. Latin America sales were up 6%. EMEA sales increased by over 13% and Asia Pacific was up 16%.\nLet's now move to Slide 6, fiscal 2023 outlook. Given our Q1 performance, our record backlog and a gradually improving supply chain we are increasing our top line and bottom line outlook for fiscal 2023. While we are encouraged by the improving electronic component landscape, the macroeconomic environment is still very dynamic. We continue to take a conservative approach in our operations.\nOur fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 12%. Organic sales growth of 13% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain improvement. The majority of our fiscal '23 shipments are already in backlog.\nWe continue to expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2 points. Nick will touch more on this later. ARR is still expected to grow 15%. Segment margin is expected to increase by over 100 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 17% versus prior year, and we continue to target 95% free cash flow conversion.\nLet me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q1 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 6.7% over last year, Q1 organic sales were up 9.9% and acquisitions contributed 80 basis points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4 points. About 7 points of our organic growth came from price. Segment operating margin expanded to 20.2% and was significantly higher than our expectations. The majority of our margin improvement versus our expectations was driven by the higher revenue from the redesign activity and improved electronic component availability that Blake discussed earlier.\nThe 110 basis point year-over-year increase in margin was driven by positive price cost and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher investment spend. Corporate and Other expense was $27 million, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS of $2.46 was ahead of our expectations and grew 15% versus prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 17.1%. This was in line with our expectations and aligned with our full year estimate of an 18% adjusted effective tax rate. Free cash flow of $42 million was $91 million higher compared to last year, driven by higher pretax income.\nAs in recent quarters, working capital continued to grow sequentially. We expect one more quarter of working capital increases this year. We expect working capital balances to decline slightly in the second half of the year as our supply chain gradually improves.\nOne additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $156 million. On December 31, $1.1 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Organic sales grew double digits in Software & Control and Lifecycle Services, with Intelligent Devices growing 7% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned earlier, orders grew sequentially in Q1 as we saw healthy demand driven by continued strong project activity with our customers.\nWe continue to see customer ordering patterns consistent with the longer lead times we have for portions of our portfolio. We expect further normalization of ordering patterns as lead times and different products improve.\nTurning to margins. Intelligent Devices margin declined by 130 basis points year-over-year due to higher resiliency spend and an unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by positive impact from higher price cost. Segment margin for software and control increased 630 basis points compared to last year on positive price cost, the favorable year-over-year impact of Plex and higher sales. Life cycle services margin was roughly flat year-over-year. Similar to Q2 fiscal year '22, we expect Lifecycle Services margin to expand through the balance of the year.\nThe next Slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal '22 to Q1 fiscal '23. Core performance was up $0.55 on a 9.9% organic sales increase. The impact of currency was a $0.15 reduction in earnings per share. This was slightly better than our expectations. The year-over-year impact was due to a stronger U.S. dollar.\nIncentive compensation was a $0.10 headwind, slightly more than our original plan and driven by our increased growth and earnings expectations for the year. Our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.05 headwind and our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05.\nLet's move on to the next slide, 11, guidance for fiscal '23. We are increasing our reported sales guidance to about $8.7 billion in fiscal '23 or 12% growth at the midpoint. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 11% to 15% or 13% at the midpoint of our range. We expect volume to be 9 points of growth and price to be 4 points of growth. This guidance takes into account our Q1 outperformance and is based on our current view of electronic component availability and the rate at which we can deliver on our backlog.\nBy quarter, we expect organic growth rates in Q2 and Q3 to be the highest of the year, with each up in the mid- to high teens year-over-year, while Q4 revenue is expected to grow organically single digits. While we expect sales to be up sequentially in Q2, we expect margins to be similar to Q1 levels due to higher sequential spend on new product development, resiliency, and the timing of our annual merit increase. We now expect a full year currency headwind of 200 basis points, which is 50 basis points better than our previous guidance.\nThis updated outlook primarily reflects the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar. We expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21%, up from prior guidance of about 20.5%. We continue to expect positive price/cost for the full year, with most of the favorability coming from the price actions we took in fiscal '22.\nAs expected, the majority of our year-over-year price cost benefit this year is coming in the first half of the year. Our updated guidance now assumes full year core earnings conversion of around 35%. We continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 18%.\nWe are increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $10.70 to $11.50. At the midpoint of this range, this represents 17% adjusted EPS growth, up from the prior guidance of approximately 12% at the midpoint. We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is still expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is now expected to be about $130 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.4 million shares. We've also included on Slide 12 an adjusted EPS walk from our previous guidance to our current guidance at the midpoint for your reference.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. In this dynamic environment, we are positioning ourselves and our customers for a more resilient, agile and sustainable future. Automation has never been more important in solving our customers' biggest challenges. A large percentage of these global investments are being made in the U.S., where we have the strongest market share, the best channel and decades-long relationships.\nShoring is real for many of our most important verticals, and we see these investments, along with the early benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, reflected in our continued strong order rates. We are accelerating the pace of our innovation, including new product introductions across all key product platforms and our recent acquisitions. These were showcased at our very successful automation fair in Chicago, where we welcomed over 18,000 customers, partners and employees to an amazing demonstration of the value provided by Rockwell and our friends.\nI was also able to meet our new CUBIC team in Denmark a few weeks ago, and I am excited about the new opportunities to expand our sustainability portfolio with an increased presence in renewables, CUBIC's largest customer segment.\nImportantly, I'm happy with how our culture is both embraced and enriched by our recent additions. And I'm excited to see how we deliver strong growth and new customer value together in the years to come.\nAijana will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Blake.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThank you, Julianne. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.\nOur results were released earlier this morning and the press and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include in our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures. A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are, therefore, forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties and that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 3. We had a great finish to the fiscal year and delivered very strong operating performance. I'm proud of how our teams navigated this challenging year with continued supply chain volatility, significant inflation and currency headwinds. Our Q4 results were in line with our expectations with organic sales and earnings, both growing double digits year-over-year and sequentially.\nOrders came in as expected in the quarter. Our record backlog, along with very low order cancellation rates reflect the continued solid underlying demand from our customers across many industries and regions. Total revenue of over $2.1 billion was up 17.6% year-over-year. Organic sales grew 20.5% versus prior year in line with our expectations. Acquisitions contributed almost 2 points of growth this quarter.\nCurrency translation reduced sales by about 5%, driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. As expected, we continue to see a gradual stabilization of global supply chain. Similar to last quarter, the split of Q4 shipments by business segment and region was driven by access to specific electronic components.\nIn the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales grew over 16% versus prior year with growth in all regions. While growth in this segment for the quarter was once again disproportionately impacted by component availability, we were able to mitigate these supply issues with the benefits from our resiliency actions.\nWe see continued market need for our intelligent devices from PowerFlex drives to our motion technology to our best-in-class safety solutions. Our independent cart technology business had a record year with both orders and sales growing over 35% year-over-year. Software & Control organic sales growth of over 32% versus prior year was above expectations.\nStrong double-digit growth in [BU] and Logix was driven by an improving component supply and our redesign investments. Lifecycle Services organic sales were up 16% year-over-year. Book-to-bill in this segment was 1.02, very good for our fourth quarter. Information Solutions and Connected Services had another quarter of double-digit growth in both orders and sales.\nHere are a couple of wins in ISCS to highlight the continued value of our recent acquisitions and new releases in these areas. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with Futaba North America, a member of the Toyota business network. Futaba has selected Plex Smart Manufacturing platform for ERP, MES, quality management and production monitoring. Our state-of-the-art solution provides real-time inventory management complex planning and full visibility into this customer's manufacturing operations.\nAnother example of how our new offerings are adding new value to our traditional customers is our win with Kraft Heinz this quarter. Our Plex platform, along with Kalypso's digital design and implementation services are helping Kraft meet its productivity, yield and quality goals. We also continue to broaden our customer base with our fixed, cloud-native maintenance management system.\nIn the quarter, Fiix was chosen by Barrett Steel, the U.K.'s largest independent steel stockholder to help reduce their unplanned downtime with a solution that could be easily scaled across 28 sites. Connected Services sales were also strong in the quarter with double-digit growth in digital projects and cybersecurity services. In the quarter, ARR grew 14%, bringing our ARR to over 8% of total revenue.\nSegment margin of over 23% was up 540 basis points year-over-year, reflecting another quarter of strong execution. Adjusted EPS grew 30% year-over-year. Earlier this week, we completed the acquisition of the Danish company, CUBIC, a worldwide leader in modular systems for electrical panels. This acquisition will help expand the global REIT for our intelligent devices and will bring new customers and partners, including a broader market access in renewable energy and data centers.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q4 end market performance. All three industry segments grew double digits this quarter driven by continued gradual improvement in the availability of electronic components. In our discrete industries, sales were up almost 20%. Within discrete, automotive sales were up 25% versus prior year. We had numerous wins this quarter with our customers continuing to invest in their global operations, whether it's starting up a new factory, securing their network infrastructure, or upgrading existing facilities with cloud-native software.\nOne of our key EV wins this quarter was with Hyundai Motors for their U.S. greenfield mega site in Bryan County, Georgia. Hyundai Motors has selected Rockwell as their controls partner for press, body, paint and general assembly. Semiconductor sales grew 30% year-over-year with several global wins this quarter.\nIn addition to securing a sizable turnkey project in Asia with our proven facilities monitoring system, we had an important win here in the U.S. to provide flexible wafer transfers as part of this customer's automated material handling system. Our independent cart technology is being leveraged at scale to support this customer's labor productivity and capacity goals.\nIn e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were up high single digits in the quarter. Even with the slowdown in new e-commerce fulfillment center investment, retailers continue to adopt our solutions for greater warehouse efficiency and throughput.\nMoving to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew over 20%, led by growth in food and beverage, life sciences and eco-industrial. Food and beverage sales were up 20% versus prior year.\nSimilar to last quarter, we continue to see a good pipeline of greenfield and brownfield projects at our key customers. In the quarter, we won several multisite deals with some of the largest food and beverage companies with a healthy mix of intelligent devices, software and digital consulting and implementation services.\nLife Sciences sales grew over 35% in the quarter with continued customer investments in software, cybersecurity and modular process control. Tire was up 20% versus prior year, led by growth at our end user customers. This is another vertical where we are seeing an increase in greenfield projects in all regions.\nTurning to process. This industry segment grew mid-teens versus prior year, with growth in metals, chemicals and oil and gas. One of the wins in chemicals this quarter was with Bora, LyondellBasell Petrochemical, the joint venture between LyondellBasell and Bora Enterprise Group. The customer chose our advanced analytics solution to help improve product quality and increase production capacity at their new polymer production plant in China.\nTurning now to Slide 5 in our Q4 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 20% versus the prior year. Latin America sales were also up 20%. EMEA sales grew over 24%, and Asia Pacific was up almost 18%.\nLet's move to Slide 6, an update to our orders and backlog performance this fiscal year. Order cancellations continue to stay within our historical low single-digit range. Our orders of over $10 billion and record backlog of over $5 billion this year set the stage for another year of strong sales growth in fiscal year '23.\nAs we turn to Slide 7, let's review highlights of fiscal '22. We had another year of record orders with total orders of over $10 billion, growing 20% versus prior year. Reported and organic sales grew 11%, an impressive performance in light of all the challenges of the year. Information Solutions and Connected Services continue to meaningfully contribute to our growth with over $800 million in sales, growing double digits.\nARR is also growing double digits and now accounts for more than 8% of our total revenue. Adjusted EPS was up 1% versus prior year. Excluding last year's onetime items, adjusted EPS was up 11%. Free cash flow conversion of 61% was driven by higher working capital. Nick will cover this in more detail later.\nThe investments we've made this year have strengthened the resiliency of our business model and position us for sustained growth in fiscal year '23 and beyond.\nLet's now move to Slide 8, fiscal 2023 outlook. With the size of our record backlog, our outlook for fiscal 2023 is predicated on the availability of components. Given continued supply chain volatility, we think a conservative approach is appropriate. Our fiscal '23 guidance projects total reported sales growth of 9.5%. Organic sales growth of 11% at the midpoint assumes continued supply chain stabilization with 4 points of growth coming from price and 7 points coming from volume.\nWe expect acquisitions to contribute a point of profitable growth and currency to be a headwind of about 2.5 points. ARR is expected to have another year of double-digit growth. We are projecting segment margin to expand by 60 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS is expected to grow 12% versus prior year. And we target generation of over $1.1 billion of free cash flow next year with a return to a more normalized conversion of 95%.\nLet me turn it over to Nick to provide more detail on our Q4 performance and financial outlook for fiscal '23. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, fourth quarter key financial information. Fourth quarter reported sales were up 17.6% over last year. Q4 organic sales were up 20.5% and acquisitions contributed 1.9 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 4.8 points. Segment operating margin expanded to 23.3% and was in line with our expectations. The 540 basis point increase was driven by higher sales and positive price costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency.\nCorporate and other expense was $35 million and in line with the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $3.04 was in line with our guidance and grew 30% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 17.8%. The year-over-year increase was related to the cumulative impact of several onetime discrete items recognized in the prior year. Free cash flow was $359 million and was up $200 million over the prior year, driven by higher pretax income.\nWorking capital on a currency-neutral basis grew 10% sequentially versus our plans for a 10% decline. Our planned inventory reductions did not materialize in the quarter due to the continued build of raw material and work in process waiting on critical components. The actions we put in place to rightsize inventory are taking longer to implement in the current supply chain environment.\nOur inventory days on hand at the end of the current year were close to 130 days versus a pre-pandemic average of 90 to 100 days. One additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased approximately 300,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $76 million. For the full year, our share repurchases totaled $301 million, in line with our July guidance. On September 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total and organic sales grew double digits across all three segments with software and control growing over 30% year-over-year. Backlog for all three segments grew sequentially and was up over 75% year-over-year.\nSegment margins for the Intelligent Devices segment expanded to 22.3% on higher sales and positive price/costs, partially offset by the negative impact from currency. Compared to last year, Software & Control margins were up over 10 percentage points driven by higher sales and positive price/cost, partially offset by negative currency impacts.\nLifecycle Services segment margin was 10.7% and increased 260 basis points versus prior year, benefiting from higher sales. Book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.02.\nThe next Slide 11 provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q4 fiscal '21 to Q4 fiscal '22. Core performance was up $1.15 on a 20.5% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.10 were related to nonrecurring accelerated investments that were made in the prior year. These investments were mostly in our Software & Control segment. The impact of currency was a $0.25 reduction in EPS, which was about $0.10 worse than our expectations, reflecting the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar throughout the quarter.\nIncentive compensation was a $0.10 benefit. As previously noted, our higher adjusted effective tax rate was a $0.60 headwind due to prior year comps. Acquisitions, including the impact of interest added $0.15, primarily related to the prior year Plex deal fees. Our reduction in outstanding shares added about $0.05.\nSlide 12 provides a walk from our Q4 midpoint in our July guidance to our actual Q4 adjusted EPS results. Other than currency, sales and profits in the quarter played out in line with our guidance. Currency impact on sales was about $25 million worse than we expected and a 0.10 worse on EPS. The impact from currency on EPS was offset by a slightly lower incentive compensation and a more favorable adjusted tax rate. Strong organic sales growth and good execution delivered over 23% operating margin in the quarter.\nSlide 13 provides key financial information for the full year fiscal '22. Reported sales grew 10.9% to $7.8 billion, including over 2 points coming from acquisitions. Currency negatively impacted sales by approximately $200 million or 2.7 points. Organic sales were up over 11% with growth bounced across all regions and business segments.\nFull year segment margin remained at about 20%. The benefit from higher volumes and lower incentive compensation was fully offset by higher wages and labor inefficiencies in our projects and in our plants caused by supply chain constraints. Margins were also negatively impacted by negative price costs, primarily in the first half of the year.\nWe increased our growth investments by double digits this year with a big focus on key product launches, new digital capabilities, increased sales force investments and plant capacity expansion. Corporate and other was down $16 million, mostly related to acquisition costs associated with the Plex acquisition in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was up 1%. A detailed year-over-year adjusted EPS walk can be found in the appendix for your reference.\nExcluding the impact of the tax rate and the prior year onetime items, which included a favorable legal settlement and onetime accelerated investments, our adjusted EPS was up 11%. As discussed earlier, free cash flow performance was below our expectations with free cash flow conversion of 61%. The $460 million decrease in free cash flow was driven by a 50% increase in working capital on a currency-neutral basis as well as the payments of the fiscal year '21 bonus in fiscal year '22.\nThere was no bonus payment made in fiscal year '21. Working capital as a percent of sales was 16% compared to 12% a year earlier. Return on invested capital was 15.2% for fiscal year '22 and 16 points worse than the prior year, primarily related to higher invested capital and lower pretax GAAP income driven by our mark-to-market adjustments made on our PTC investment in both years.\nFor the year, we deployed about $900 million of capital towards dividends, share repurchases and inorganic investments in fiscal '22. We also paid down debt by about $150 million. Our capital structure and liquidity remains strong.\nBefore I cover fiscal year '23 guidance, let's turn to Page 14. In fiscal year '22, our backlog grew by over 75% year-over-year, including strong double-digit growth in each segment. Pre-pandemic, we had about one month or less of the following year's revenue in the backlog for Software & Control and Intelligent Devices. Our backlog now represents over 50% of our fiscal year '23 sales guide for both of these segments. This unprecedented backlog coverage adds to our confidence in our revenue outlook. Our backlog also includes the benefits of price increases that were implemented throughout fiscal year '22.\nLet's move on to the next slide, 15, guidance for fiscal year '23. We are expecting sales of about $8.5 billion in fiscal '23, up 9.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 9% to 13% and 11% at the midpoint of our range.\nThis outlook includes our current backlog levels, our latest assumptions on supply chain stabilization as well as continued price growth momentum. We expect full year segment operating margins to be about 20.5%. At the midpoint, our guidance assumes full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%. I'll cover a few more details on this on the next slide.\nWe expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate will be around 18%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact our tax rate in fiscal '23. Our adjusted EPS guidance is $10.20 to $11. This compares to fiscal '22 adjusted EPS of $9.49. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 12% adjusted EPS growth.\nI will cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS walk on a later slide. We expect full year fiscal '23 free cash flow conversion of about 95% of adjusted income. This reflects $190 million of capital expenditures. We are planning for a reduction in our working capital days with a focus on inventory days on hand.\nOur working capital is targeted to be about 15% of sales, still above our historic amount of around 12% as the return to pre-pandemic supplier lead times is slow.\nFinally, our projections include additional income tax payments of around $100 million related to the change in U.S. tax law that no longer allows for the immediate expensing of R&D.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '23 guidance. Corporate and other expense is expected to be around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '23 is expected to be around $120 million. And finally, we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 115.1 million shares.\nLet's turn to Slide 16. Given the continued supply chain volatility and many moving pieces, we wanted to provide a slide that lays out the tailwinds and headwinds that are included in our fiscal year '23 guidance. From a top line perspective, our 11% organic sales growth is supported by our higher backlog. This includes about 7% from higher volumes due to general supply chain stabilization, low cancellation rates and resiliency benefits coming from our redesign efforts done in fiscal '22 and continuing in fiscal '23. About 4% is coming from price growth, mostly tied to price actions that went into effect in fiscal '22.\nWe also have factored in about 1% inorganic growth for our recently completed acquisition of CUBIC. While the supply chain shows some signs of stabilization in Q4, there continues to be volatility along with a dynamic macro environment, macroeconomic environment, including the unfavorable impact of currency. All of these factors have informed our sales guidance and range.\nOn adjusted EPS, we expect margin expansion from increased volume and positive price growth. The net favorable impact of price cost on margins is about 100 basis points. We also will benefit from a higher discount rate favorably impacting our pension expense and we'll see about a $0.15 benefit from share repurchases. We continue to make investments in attracting and retaining key talent as well as restoring our bonus payout back to 100%. Combined, these two items are around a 150 basis point headwind to our margins.\nWhile we do expect a positive price/cost for the year, we are also factoring in continued inflation, primarily in electronic components. We expect our margins to be negatively impacted by unfavorable mix and currency. Combined, these two items will be a negative impact of around 150 basis points. We are expecting an adjusted effective tax rate of 18% or about a $0.20 headwind.\nThe next slide, 17, provides the adjusted EPS walk from fiscal '22 to fiscal '23 guidance at the midpoint for your reference and which I spoke to on the previous slide. From a calendarization viewpoint, we expect our second and third quarters to have the highest sales growth rates for the year with each up mid- to high teens year-over-year.\nWe expect Q1 and Q4 to be in the single-digit growth range. Following the first quarter, we expect sequential sales to improve over the balance of the year. We expect segment margins and adjusted EPS to decline year-over-year in Q1. We see segment margins in the mid-teens for Q1, which is factored into our full year view of 20.5%.\nIn Q1, we are projecting a year-over-year margin decrease from increases in spend, unfavorable mix and currency, partially offset by positive price/cost. We are seeing improved -- margins improve sequentially following Q1, driven by higher volumes and continued positive price/cost.\nMoving on to the next slide, 18. I'll make a few comments on our capital deployment framework. Our long-term capital deployment priorities remain the same. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareholders through our dividend and then share repurchases.\nIn addition to our organic and inorganic investments, our capital deployment plans for fiscal '23 include a focus on delevering, dividends of about $540 million and share repurchases of between $200 million and $300 million. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. As we look to 2023, we are confident in our ability to execute a strategy. Our record backlog, underlying customer demand and a more resilient operating model set the stage for a year of double-digit sales and earnings growth. As you've heard today, we're continuing to invest for our future, including investing in attracting and retaining key talent.\nI would like to thank our people for their relentless commitment dissolving the immediate needs of our customers while focusing on continued innovation and investment for the future. We're excited to share some of these innovations with you at our Investor Day in Chicago during Automation Fair later this month.\nWe will be introducing an industry-first cloud-native programming application for Logix, a new operator interface package, new I/O for process industries, on-machine motor control, and a host of other differentiated offerings that make this time a historic moment in Rockwell's journey.\nAijana, we'll now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Thank you.

I need to remind everyone that today's conference call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nAt this time, I would like to turn the call over to Aijana Zellner, Head of Investor Relations. Ms. Zellner, please go ahead.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Rex. Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Rockwell Automation's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. With me today is Blake Moret, our Chairman and CEO; and Nick Gangestad, our CFO.\nOur results were released earlier this morning, and the press release and charts have been posted to our website. Both the press release and charts include and our call today will reference non-GAAP measures. Both the press release and charts include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures.\nA webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand it over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aijana, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I want to also take this opportunity to congratulate Aijana on her promotion since our last earnings call.\nLet's turn to our third quarter results on Slide 3. We had a strong quarter with orders, shipments, margin and profit all at or above our expectations. We successfully navigated supply chain disruptions in a still volatile environment, and we saw the positive impact of pricing actions that demonstrate our strong position in the market.\nTotal orders grew over 17% versus prior year, with strong demand in all 3 business segments. Our continued order strength reflects the value our customers place on Rockwell's differentiated offerings and the increased need for automation solutions regardless of the current macroeconomic backdrop.\nTotal revenue of almost $2 billion was up 6.5% year-over-year. Organic sales came in as expected and grew over 7% versus prior year. Acquisitions contributed 2.5 points of growth. Currency translation reduced sales by over 3%, driven by continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar.\nWhile we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain through the quarter, our sales volume and mix continued to be impacted by component shortages, as we've been discussing for a while now. Our top line performance, both by segment and region, was driven by specific component availability in Q3 more than the underlying demand, which remains strong.\nIn the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales were up over 2% year-over-year but below expectations. This segment was disproportionately impacted by component availability further exacerbated by extended China COVID shutdowns.\nSoftware & Control organic sales growth of over 13% versus prior year was above expectations. Our strong performance here reflects both an improvement in the chip supply and some early benefits from the recent resiliency investments.\nSales of our view operator interface panels, which we redesigned to optimize our component supply, were up almost 60% year-over-year. Our software sales grew double digits versus prior year.\nIn Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased almost 9% versus the prior year, despite continued component shortages and a partial shutdown of our Shanghai facility earlier in the quarter. Within Lifecycle Services, Sensia had another quarter of strong growth with both orders and sales up over 20% year-over-year. Sales in our services business also grew double digits, driven by higher demand for asset management and cybersecurity. Lifecycle Services book-to-bill was 1.27 in the quarter, reflecting continued strength in our orders.\nInformation Solutions & Connected Services orders and sales both grew strong double digits in the quarter with particular strength in MES software and industrial cybersecurity sales. Within Information Solutions, we had a number of strategic wins this quarter, thanks to our industry-leading portfolio of scalable and flexible software offerings. For instance, Eli Lilly and Company has chosen Rockwell Automation's PharmaSuite MES solution as a next-generation MES platform for their drug products.\nIn addition to our on-prem software wins, we continue to gain traction with our recent cloud-native acquisitions. One of our Plex wins this quarter was with ZEVx, an Arizona-based company focused on electrification of light- and medium-duty fleet vehicles worldwide. Our smart manufacturing platform will help this customer's aggressive growth plan with advanced supplier and inventory management, improved data visibility and reporting. We're also happy to report the sale of a Plex application that will run natively on Microsoft Azure in Europe as well as a growing list of wins in food and beverage companies. These are important deal synergies that we are starting to realize.\nAt Fiix, we continue to see strong double-digit sales growth led by both new logo wins and expansion deals. Our competitive maintenance management wins across many verticals, including EV and food and beverage, reflect the platform's differentiated AI capabilities and ease of deployment.\nConnected Services orders and sales were also strong in the quarter, demonstrating customers' increasing reliance on our deep domain expertise, cybersecurity services, and 24/7 remote support, especially as many companies are struggling with labor shortages and temporary budget constraints.\nIn the quarter, total ARR was up almost 60% and organic ARR grew 18%. Our strong operating performance and focus on price cost execution resulted in exceptional earnings this quarter with adjusted EPS growing 15% versus prior year.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 to review key highlights of our Q3 end market performance. As I mentioned earlier, while we saw a gradual overall improvement in supply chain constraints this quarter, some of our businesses and industry verticals, mainly discrete and the hardware intensive parts of hybrid, were disproportionately impacted by the ongoing component supply issues.\nIn our discrete industries, sales were up low single digits. Within this industry segment, automotive sales were up 6% versus prior year. We continue to see investments in the EV transition from both traditional brand owners and EV start-ups with a healthy mix of greenfield and brownfield activities. In Q3, we had a strategic greenfield win in Asia where a Chinese automotive company, Chery Auto, chose Rockwell's differentiated MES, IoT and core automation offerings over their traditional European supplier to build a smart plant and increase their speed to market.\nIn addition to working with leading electric vehicle manufacturers, we continue to gain share in the EV battery space, with several competitive wins in the quarter, both in Asia and Europe. While most of our previous wins in this space were in battery assembly and conveyance, we're starting to expand our presence in battery cells. Rockwell's integrated Logix and motion offering was selected by [Durr Clean Technology Systems] to provide an end-to-end coating process, from powder handling and slurry mixing to coating and drying.\nSemiconductor sales declined 2% versus prior year and were significantly impacted by COVID-related shutdowns in China. Despite the near-term supply chain challenges impacting its own ecosystem, this industry continues to see strong demand with about 80 greenfield and 300 brownfield projects announced to date.\nIn the e-commerce and warehouse automation, our sales were down over 15% in the quarter, mainly driven by electronic component shortages and tough prior year comps. While we are seeing a slowdown in investments from some e-commerce customers, we continue to work with traditional retailers and grocers who are investing in new automated infrastructure to gain share in the market.\nTurning to our hybrid industry segment. Sales in this segment grew mid-single digits, led by growth in life sciences and food and beverage. Food and beverage sales were up mid-single digits versus prior year. While inflation might put some pressure on new expansion investments, we continue to expect especially strong demand in certain markets like agriculture processing, where Rockwell has high share and a differentiated technology offering.\nWe saw a number of CapEx wins in Latin America this quarter with one of our food and beverage wins coming from CP Kelco, a Brazilian nature-based ingredients manufacturer, who chose Rockwell and our PlantPAx process control architecture as their automation partner for the next capacity expansion project.\nLife sciences sales grew over 15% in Q3 with strong year-over-year growth in medical devices, pharma and biotech. This was another industry where our differentiated process controller, along with strong network infrastructure and overall project management expertise, helped us win a competitive project with Thermo Fisher in their joint venture plan in China. A combination of industry-leading MES and IoT software and the multidiscipline Logix platform for hybrid applications, along with our increasing expertise in biotech and cell gene therapies, position us well in this fast-growing vertical.\nTire was up low single digits in the quarter. We continue to see increased customer demand for our software and services in this vertical. In the quarter, we had our first Plex win in tire with Prometeon Tyre Group, a global leader in tire manufacturing headquartered in Italy. The customer chose our Plex QMS to standardize quality management across its global operations.\nMoving to process. This industry segment grew 12% versus prior year, with oil and gas, mining and metals all growing double digits. We continue to grow our presence in process by displacing the traditional DCS players across oil and gas, mining and chemical industries. Our investments in process control technology and petrochemical expertise are paying off, as demonstrated by our recent wins in North America and Europe.\nWe also had a strategic multimillion dollar ESG win, where Rockwell will be helping one of the most active operators in the Permian Basin reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and bring all operated oil and gas assets to net zero by 2050.\nTurning now to Slide 5 in our Q3 organic regional sales performance. Once again, these results were heavily impacted by our component availability. North America organic sales grew by 11% versus the prior year. Latin America sales increased by over 15%. EMEA sales were up over 3%, and Asia Pacific was down almost 6%.\nLet's move to Slide 6. An update to a new slide we had provided last quarter. As you can see, order cancellations remained very low and are within our historical ranges. Our strong orders and record backlog of over $5 billion continue to support strong sales in fiscal year '22 and beyond.\nAs we turn to Slide 7, let's review highlights for the full year outlook. Orders are expected to stay strong for the remainder of this fiscal year. While we continue to expect strong double-digit year-over-year and sequential organic sales growth in Q4 resulting in double-digit growth for the full year, we're reducing the midpoint of our organic growth range to 11%. Our revised guidance reflects ongoing supply chain volatility in this environment, especially for business operations and suppliers located in Asia. The supply of electronic components is gradually improving but remains volatile.\nAcquisitions are expected to contribute 2.5 points of profitable growth, more than offsetting a 2-point headwind from currency translation. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services.\nWe continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth. Our organic investments and acquisitions help make this revenue stream become a more meaningful contributor to our overall business resilience.\nOur additional investments and resiliency actions are progressing well as we develop deeper relationships with key suppliers, complete redesign projects and realize price to mitigate inflation. We expect our margins to expand in Q4 on higher sales and continued price/cost execution. With only 1 more quarter to go, we have narrowed our adjusted EPS guidance range with our midpoint still at $9.50. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion of 85% for the full year.\nNick will now add detail to our Q3 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, third quarter key financial information. Third quarter reported sales were up 6.5% over last year, with organic sales up 7.1% and acquisitions adding another 2.5 points to total growth. Foreign currency translation reduced sales by 3.1%. While the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many currencies, the strength against the euro has had the largest impact on Rockwell in the quarter.\nWe saw our organic sales improve through the quarter helped by some easing of supply chain constraints following the lifting of COVID restrictions in China.\nSegment operating margin was 20.8%, an increase of 90 basis points versus last year, mostly due to higher sales and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher investment spend.\nLast quarter, we shared our expectation that price/cost would improve significantly in Q3 and that is exactly what happened. Price in the quarter more than offset our year-over-year increases in input costs.\nOur adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.66, up 15% from the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the third quarter was 14.5% and in line with the prior year. This was better than our expectations due to a favorable return to provision true-up.\nFree cash flow dollar generation was $327 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to higher working capital primarily in receivables. We saw a higher percentage of our sales in June than in the prior year, and our free cash flow conversion exceeded 100% in the quarter despite our increases in working capital.\nOne additional item not shown on the slide, we repurchased 860,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $176 million. On June 30, $1.3 billion remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 10 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. We had a good quarter with organic sales up in all 3 business segments, both year-over-year and sequentially. Improving sales and our strong operating execution resulted in sequential margin growth of over 500 basis points.\nIntelligent Devices organic sales were up 2.7% in Q3. This segment had the largest negative impact in the quarter from component availability and extended shutdowns in China. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins declined 220 basis points to 19.7%, primarily driven by higher investment spend. Year-over-year price increases were able to neutralize the impact of higher input costs. Margins in this segment improved sequentially by 510 basis points driven by positive price cost and higher volume.\nSoftware & Control total sales were up 19%, including 13.4% organic growth versus the prior year. Strong sales were driven by improved chip supply and benefited from resiliency actions taken earlier in the year. Segment margins were up 620 basis points compared to last year and up 680 basis points sequentially, mostly due to higher sales. Price/cost was positive year-over-year and sequentially.\nLifecycle Services organic sales grew 8.7%, led by strong double-digit growth in Sensia. Demand continues to remain strong across all businesses. Book-to-bill was 1.27 for Q3. Segment margin declined 90 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by supply chain constraints and higher investment spend, partially offset by higher sales and lower incentive compensation. Segment margin was up again sequentially on higher sales. With gradual improvements in the supply chain, we expect the trend of sequential margin expansion to continue in the coming quarters.\nThe next slide, 11, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q3 fiscal '21 to Q3 fiscal '22. Starting on the left, core performance was up about $0.15, including about $0.25 from higher sales. Price/cost contributed $0.05. Strong execution led to about $0.10 of productivity. We saw some favorable corporate items, about half of which were due to timing between Q3 and Q4. We also continue to invest in growth and resiliency, which offset the core growth by $0.35. In the prior year, we made about $0.10 of nonrecurring accelerated investments that mostly impacted our Software & Control business. Currency negatively impacted our earnings by about $0.10. On a year-over-year basis, incentive compensation was about a $0.20 tailwind. This brings us to our total adjusted EPS of $2.66.\nLet's move to the next slide, 12, our guidance for fiscal '22. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.7 billion to $7.9 billion in fiscal '22, up 10.5% to 12.5% for the year. We expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 12%, and we expect about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions, and currency translation will be a headwind of about 2 points.\nOur sales guidance range reflects the continued volatility we see in the supply chain. The midpoint of our guidance implies a 9% sequential increase in Q4 total sales, driven by improved material flow from key suppliers, including those in China, further sequential improvement from resiliency actions and higher sequential price realization.\nWe continue to expect full year segment operating margin to be about 20% and unchanged from our prior guide. We expect our margins to continue to expand in the fourth quarter. The margin expansion will come primarily from higher sequential sales and continued positive momentum on price/cost. While price/cost will be negative for the full year, it is positive in the second half.\nWe now expect second half core conversion above 40%. We expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 16.5%. And we are narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.30 to $9.70 with no change to our midpoint of $9.50 from prior guidance. Finally, we continue to expect full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate and other expense is now projected to be around $110 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is now expected to be about $120 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 116.7 million shares.\nFinally, on capital deployment, our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same, including our focus on deleveraging. As I mentioned earlier, we repurchased about $176 million worth of shares in Q3 and are now projecting our full year share repurchases to be about $300 million.\nTurning now to Page 13. While there is no change to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we wanted to show some of the moving pieces within this number, starting on the left. There is a lower contribution due to the lower organic sales guidance. This is fully offset by improved productivity, favorable segment mix and lower corporate expenses. Currency is an additional headwind of about $0.05. A more favorable tax rate adds $0.05, which brings us to our midpoint of $9.50. Although not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions, including Plex, to be about neutral this year, including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A. Blake?\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. We had a good quarter of growth, price realization profitability and investment for the future. We are executing well, and I'm proud of how our teams are managing supply chain complexity to serve the needs of our customers. In volatile times, our relentless focus on helping customers creates long-term differentiation and value.\nAijana will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nAijana Zellner\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\n(Operator Instructions) Rex, let's take our first question.",

That's @investorsrok.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements.\nOur actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in all of our SEC filings.\nSo with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.\nBefore providing detail on second quarter results, which were below our expectations, I want to provide general comments on the business environment. Through the first half of our fiscal year, two themes stand out.\nThe first is broad-based demand growth across industries, geographies and offerings. Substantial backlog in all three business segments, low cancellation rates and detailed component supply forecasts give us confidence that we will achieve double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year and reach $9 billion of profitable sales in the next couple of years.\nThe second theme is persistent supply chain constraints and associated cost inflation, which put particular pressure on Q2 sales and earnings.\nSince our last earnings release in January, we've seen supplier push-outs and decommits for electronic component shipments, the impact of unexpected COVID-related shutdowns in China and Russia start a war in Ukraine. These have had an impact on our results and guidance.\nSo let's get into the detail on our quarter, the outlook and what we are doing to maximize Rockwell's business performance and long-term value.\nOur second quarter results are summarized on Slide 3. Total orders grew by 37%, once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions.\nTotal revenue grew 2% year-over-year in the quarter. Organic sales grew a little over 1% versus prior year, worse than our expectations due to the supply chain challenges. Through 6 months, Rockwell's organic top line has grown 9% year-over-year.\nOrders momentum was broad-based across all three business segments. However, product shipments and solutions with significant hardware content were limited by multiple component shortages.\nIn the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales declined 3% versus prior year, a sharp reversal from the 25% growth in the first quarter, reflecting volatile components supply. Within this segment's motion business, sales of our Independent Cart Technology grew strong double digits, and our orders more than doubled from a year ago.\nSoftware & Control organic sales grew a little less than 1%, also reflecting component shortages. We continue to see strong order growth in this business, led by Logix and Visualization.\nIn Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 11% versus the prior year, led by 24% growth at Sensia. Demand is broadly increasing in Lifecycle Services as demonstrated by a 1.34 book-to-bill.\nInformation Solutions & Connected Services grew strong double digits in both orders and revenue.\nIndustrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter, with orders up 90% year-over-year as customers in life sciences, food and beverage, mining and many other end markets are increasingly relying on us to provide the robust network technology and real-time domain expertise to keep their critical operations secure and resilient.\nIn the quarter, one of our Plex wins was with [Reautomotive], an automotive technology company and EV platform maker, headquartered in the EMEA region, where our cloud-native Smart Manufacturing Platform will enable the plan with real-time production monitoring, inventory and quality management, creating an agile manufacturing system needed for customized electric vehicles.\nYou will recall that globalizing market access for Plex' software was an important synergy to be realized through this deal. Last month, Plex also became available on Microsoft's Azure Cloud in Europe, and we're partnering with Microsoft to promote this new capability.\nAt Fiix, we had another great quarter with ARR growing over 40%. We continue to win new logos, including our first wins in Asia. Our partnership with PTC continues to grow. And in the quarter, we booked software subscriptions for Digital Performance Management, based on ThingWorx.\nThis new solution helps identify, prioritize and act on debottlenecking opportunities that have the greatest potential P&L impact in manufacturing sites. We combine great technology and domain expertise to create a very strong value proposition for our customers. In the quarter, organic ARR grew by 17%.\nLet's turn to Slide 4. Our usual Q2 market performance slide is in the appendix. It's important to understand that this quarter, sales growth or decline in specific industry verticals is primarily based on the particular products being shipped into these verticals and the degree they were impacted by component shortages rather than underlying demand.\nWorking left to right on the slide, auto and e-commerce, two very important verticals we serve within our Discrete Industry segment, were down in the quarter, with the resulting single-digit decline for the Discrete segment.\nThe majority of sales to these verticals are in products, which were heavily impacted by component shortages that impacted our ability to ship to these customers.\nIn contrast, orders for auto and e-commerce remain very strong. We continue to see large competitive wins with our Independent Cart Technology for motion control and battery applications. And about 1/3 of our total auto business is expected to be for electric vehicle applications in the full year.\nWe also had an important sustainability win this quarter at Electro Battery Materials, a leading provider of low-carbon and sustainable metals to the EV automotive sector. Rockwell was chosen to provide a turnkey solution for North America's first integrated and environmentally sustainable battery materials plant.\nIn e-commerce and warehouse automation, we continue to win expansion projects with our flexible material handling technology and digital twin software.\nAnd in semiconductor, our offerings can be found in chip-making machinery, material handling equipment and building management systems at the largest semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment companies in the world. It is clear we are playing a critical role in this industry's plans for multibillion dollar capacity expansion.\nWe continue to see strong broad-based demand in food and beverage, with particular focus on digital transformation projects. Life sciences sales were up double digits as 2/3 of our life sciences business is in software solutions and services that are less dependent on electronic components.\nOil and gas sales were up double digits, led by improving trends in upstream and midstream. Our Sensia joint venture had strong orders and ships in the quarter and is expected to grow strong double digits for the year.\nIn summary, multiyear capital investments across many end markets, coupled with higher automation and digital transformation intensity, have created high backlog and a continuing strong order funnel to support growth in each industry segment we serve.\nTurning now to Slide 5 and our Q2 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales declined by about 3% versus the prior year due to the higher mix of Intelligent Devices in this region.\nThe Intelligent Devices segment was more heavily impacted by component shortages this quarter. We continue to expect more balanced sales growth across regions for the full year and expect North America to be the fastest-growing region in fiscal '22.\nLatin America sales were up 13%. EMEA sales increased 6% and Asia Pacific grew 9%, due in part to the higher solutions content in this region. In China, we saw high single-digit growth, driven by strength in mass transit, life sciences, tyre and oil and gas.\nLet's turn to Slide 6, which is a new slide we thought would be helpful this quarter. The high backlog we've been building over the last few quarters and continued low cancellation rates set the stage for strong revenue growth in the second half of fiscal '22 and beyond.\nWe do expect lead times and backlog to stabilize over the next year. And at that point, orders and shipment levels will begin to converge, which is a good thing. In the near term, the primary limiting factor to growth is component availability.\nSo as we turn to Slide 7, let's go a bit deeper into some of the actions we are taking to improve semiconductor, chip availability and our overall resiliency. We expect component shipments to increase in the coming quarters due to several factors.\nThe first is improved material flow from key suppliers over the next couple of quarters. Where we are seeing improved flow from existing suppliers, several factors are contributing, such as the addition of incremental capacity, improved allocation percentages, opportunistic broker buys and some of these suppliers recovery from discrete events like fires and floods.\nWe have also reengineered certain products to utilize components with better supply resiliency. For example, the new series of [PanoVu] operator interface has enabled us to double the shipment quantity in the last 2 months.\nWe have significantly accelerated our manufacturing capacity investments in our Twinsburg and Singapore facilities over the last year, which will benefit production and resiliency in the second half of fiscal '22.\nWe continue to qualify new and additional semiconductor chip vendors to create redundant sources for individual components and to diversify our supplier base. And we expect to see the benefit in fiscal [Q4].\nWe continue to invest in diversifying our portfolio and see continued double-digit growth in our Information Solutions & Connected Services, which are less dependent on hardware supply chains. Price is also a meaningful contributor to our growth and our resiliency in mitigating inflation.\nWe have very strong pricing power in the market, thanks to our highly differentiated offerings. We're seeing good price realization as annual customer agreements renew, and we are taking action to get quicker realization of future price increases.\nIn the last year, we have announced several price increases, totaling 17%, materially benefiting the latter portion of this fiscal year and even more so in fiscal '23.\nHowever, as you know, there are risks that cannot yet be accurately quantified, which is one of the reasons we have widened our range for growth expectations for the full year.\nThese risks include the duration and potential escalation of the war in Ukraine. We have suspended the small amount of business we do in Russia and Belarus, less than half of 1% of total sales. We are seeing logistics cost increases due to higher energy costs as well as constrained and lengthened air freight lanes.\nAnother source of risk is the widespread shutdown of businesses in China due to COVID infection outbreaks. Our plants have partially reopened due to the critical role our products and services play in industries such as semiconductor.\nBut the bigger risk is from upstream suppliers with operations in the area. We have built in some risk for China shutdowns, but it is difficult to quantify this risk in the next 2 quarters.\nLet's now turn to Slide 8 to review highlights for the full-year outlook. Orders for the year are expected to approach $10 billion. At some point, we expect orders to moderate as lead times for our products return to more normal levels.\nHowever, orders are expected to remain well above prepandemic levels, given the amount of capital projects underway in industries we serve.\nWe continue to expect double-digit reported sales growth, but we've reduced the midpoint and widened the range, in part, given the volatility of component supply that we saw in the second quarter. April component supply and total sales are tracking well with our forecast.\nAcquisitions are expected to do well and contribute over 2 points of profitable growth. We continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services.\nWe continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, which makes up over 8% of our total revenue. I'm pleased with the impact of both acquisitions and organic investments are having in these new lines of business.\nWe have reduced our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target range for the year. The midpoint of the adjusted EPS range represents 1 point of increase over the prior year and a 13% increase without the impact of last year's lower tax rate and benefit from a one-time legal settlement. And as noted on the slide, the Board authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases.\nNick will now add detail to our Q2 results and our financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 9, second quarter key financial information. Second quarter reported sales were up 2% over last year. This is below our expectations and was directly linked to electronic component availability in the quarter.\nQ2 organic sales were up 1.3% and acquisitions contributed 2.3 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by 1.8%.\nSegment operating margin was 15.7%, approximately 300 basis points worse than we expected and primarily impacted by lower-than-expected sales volume and higher input costs.\nVersus last year, our margins declined 630 basis points, mostly due to negative price/cost and higher investments in key growth areas. I will comment further on price/cost on the next page.\nOur adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.66 and 31% down from the prior year. As we said last quarter, we expect Q2 to be the most impacted by negative price/cost as the benefits from prior price actions will be more heavily weighted to the second half of fiscal year '22 and into fiscal year '23. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was $46 million in the quarter and down compared to the prior year due to lower pretax income and higher income tax payments.\nIncome tax payments were in line with our expectations and higher year-over-year due to the payments made in the current quarter in the U.S., related to fiscal year '21 discrete tax transactions.\nFree cash flow results were lower than expectations, driven by lower pretax income and higher working capital as we continue to build our subassemblies for more rapid conversion into finished goods as we receive critical components.\nTurning to Page 10. This is a new slide we added this quarter. This slide shows the actual impacts for quarter 1 and quarter 2 and what we included in our projections for the second half for both price and input costs.\nFirst, on pricing. From our three price increases since last summer, we expect those actions to provide about $400 million of cost recovery, once fully implemented. Less than 10% of this benefit was realized in the first half of fiscal year '22.\nThe ramp to achieve the pricing impact occurs because much of our pricing is set by pricing agreements we have with our customers. Once we announce a price increase, these customers will not see the increases until their current annual agreements renew. We are implementing actions to accelerate realization on future price increases.\nThe price growth projected here is only from previously announced price increases and factors in higher inflationary costs not yet seen.\nIf inflation forecast for fiscal '23 worsens more than expected, we will take further price actions to offset these costs.\nOn input costs, we did see a higher year-over-year and sequential increase in input costs in Q2. These increases were driven by increased logistics costs and a higher level of broker buys.\nWe anticipate these elevated costs to continue increasing for the balance of the year. For fiscal '22, we expect input costs to increase over $200 million, primarily due to higher electronic component costs and higher freight.\nOn a net price/cost basis, we are negative in the first half and positive in the second half. We now expect full-year price/cost to be slightly negative in fiscal '22.\nSlide 11 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our three operating segments. Total reported sales were up mid- to high single digits in both our Software & Control and Lifecycle Services segments.\nIntelligent Devices was down 5% as this segment was impacted more by supply chain constraints. Intelligent Devices organic sales were down 3% in Q2 and up 10% in the first half.\nCompared to last year, Intelligent Devices margins declined 920 basis points to 14.6%, driven by negative price/cost investment spend and lower volumes. This segment accounted for the vast majority of the miss to our internal expectations in both sales and margins.\nWe expect the second-half margins in this segment to expand by 200 to 300 basis points sequentially on higher volumes and higher price from earlier-implemented price actions.\nSoftware & Control organic sales were up less than 1 point and 4% in the first half. Segment margins were up sequentially for this segment and declined 520 basis points, compared to last year, mostly due to higher year-over-year investment spend, negative price/cost and the impact of acquisition integration costs.\nWe expect the second-half margins in this segment to expand by over 600 basis points sequentially on higher sales and higher price from implemented price actions. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 11%, including more than 20% growth from Sensia.\nDemand remains strong across all businesses and end markets. Book-to-bill was 1.34 for Q2. Segment margin was up sequentially for this segment and declined 170 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower labor utilization caused by supply chain constraints, partially offset by higher sales volume and lower incentive compensation.\nMargin is expected to grow through the [balance] of the year with strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog.\nThe next slide, 12, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q2 fiscal '21 to Q2 fiscal '22. Starting on the left. Core performance was down about $0.75 on a 1.3% organic sales increase as we continue to make growth-related investments.\nWe also were impacted by the timing of [merit] increases and lower labor utilization. As previously discussed, price/cost had a negative $0.25 impact in the quarter.\nGiven our updated guidance, we lowered our estimate for fiscal year '22 incentive compensation. On a year-over-year basis, incentive compensation was about a $0.25 tailwind. This brings us to our total EPS of $1.66.\nLet's move on to the next slide, 13, guidance for fiscal '22. We are updating our sales guidance to a new range of approximately $7.8 billion to $8 billion in fiscal '22, up 11% to 15% for the year.\nWe expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 10% to 14%. We expect currency translation to be a headwind of 1.5 points and about 2.5 points of growth coming from acquisitions.\nOur wider sales guidance range reflects the volatility we see in the component supply and uncertainty of the full impact of COVID-related shutdowns in China.\nAs Blake mentioned earlier, we are forecasting an increase in sales in the second half, in line with improved material flow from key suppliers.\nFrom a calendarization perspective, we are forecasting improved sequential performance over the balance of the year, with a heavier weighting in Q4 driven by the resiliency actions Blake mentioned, as well as the timing from higher price realization.\nWe expect full-year segment operating margin to be about 20%. This is a 150 basis point reduction from our prior guide and is the result of our volume decrease.\nThe impact from higher input costs since our January guidance is expected to be more than offset with reduced spending levels, including lower incentive compensation. We will continue to prioritize our growth and resiliency investments.\nWe expect second-half margins of around 22%, up 4 percentage points from first-half levels, primarily driven from higher sales volume and a 250 basis point improvement from price/cost.\nThe first-half impact of price/cost and margins on a year-over-year basis was dilutive by approximately 250 basis points, and the margin impact in the second half from price/cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points.\nWe expect margins to improve sequentially 300 to 400 basis points in the third quarter and another 400 to 500 basis points in the fourth quarter. We now expect full-year core earnings conversion of between 20% and 25%, with second-half core conversion of approximately 40%.\nWe continue to expect the full-year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22.\nWe are decreasing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $9.20 to $9.80. At the midpoint of the range, this is up about 1 point compared to the prior year. Finally, we expect free cash -- we expect full-year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 85% of adjusted income.\nThe decrease from our prior guide of 90% is driven by higher working capital, where we continue to have high inventory levels, in order to support our increased demand.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate and other expense is projected around $120 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million. We're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of about 117 million shares.\nFinally, on capital deployment, our capital allocation priorities for this year remain the same, including our focus on deleveraging.\nAs Blake mentioned earlier, the Board authorized another $1 billion of share repurchases. Board and management are committed to using our capital deployment framework to drive long-term [share owner] value, including opportunities for increased share repurchases.\nTurning now to Page 14. This slide bridges the midpoint of our January adjusted EPS guidance range to the midpoint of our new range. Starting on to the midpoint of our new guidance.\nStarting on the left. There is a lower contribution from core operating performance due to the lower organic sales guidance, partially offset by lower spend. We now expect price/cost to be negative for the full year or a $0.25 negative impact versus our January guidance. Currency is expected to be a $0.20 headwind.\nNext, given the decrease in our forecasted performance, there is about a $0.35 impact from a projected lower bonus expense, which brings the new midpoint of the guidance range to $9.50.\nAlthough not on this page, we continue to expect our acquisitions, including Plex, to be about neutral this year, including incremental interest expense or a year-over-year benefit of about $0.15.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. This was a tough quarter, but we are aggressively working to temper the impact of persistent and volatile supply chain shortages. We have provided guidance that reflects a detailed view of expected component availability and actions we are taking to increase the flow of product and solutions to the market.\nWe are beginning to see increases in some of the semiconductors we use, we continue to qualify new sources and important new capacity is being built for the technology we use in many of our products.\nFor example, the incremental fab capacity, a major supplier is planning to bring online, will directly benefit a number of our product families in early 2023. While we do not anticipate supply chain challenges to end soon, we do expect gradual sequential improvement over the coming quarters.\nI want to thank our suppliers for the recognition of the critical role we play in U.S. manufacturing and industrial applications around the world.\nWe are on track with our manufacturing capacity expansion to ensure that internal equipment and processes support our revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and beyond.\nDespite these challenges, we are also on offense. We continue to introduce new differentiated technology and services, including the January opening of our Israeli Cybersecurity Operations Center to support worldwide customers.\nLater this year, we will release new factory -- operator interface and design software at our Annual Automation Fair. We have reduced spending plans in response to the higher cost, but we are prioritizing programs that will generate new revenue in the coming years, and we are increasing investments that strengthen our resiliency.\nWe continue to focus on accelerating profitable growth within the long-term financial framework that has served us and our investors well. We complement internal investment with a disciplined capital allocation that is focused on creating value.\nThe capabilities and dedication of our people continue to set us apart. From our manufacturing associates and plants around the world to our salespeople working together with supply chain professionals to meet our customers' most critical needs, through our development engineers, balancing the simultaneous demands of building component resiliency and launching new products, to the teams who are focused on keeping our people safe and productive, we're confident that our extra effort will be remembered as we help manufacturers speed, cloth, protect and move the world.\nJessica will now begin the Q&A session.\n\nJessica Kourakos\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nOperator, you may begin Q&A.

A webcast of this call will be available on our website for replay for the next 30 days. For your convenience, a transcript of our prepared remarks will also be available on our website at the conclusion of today's call. Additional information and news about our company can also be found on Rockwell's Investor Relations Twitter feed using the handle @investorsrok. That's @investorsrok.\nBefore we get started, I need to remind you that our comments will include statements related to the expected future results of our company and are therefore forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to a wide range of risks and uncertainties that are described in our earnings release and detailed in our SEC filings. So with that, I'll hand the call over to Blake.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Let's turn to our first quarter results on Slide 3. Total orders grew by more than 40% to over $2.5 billion, once again reflecting very strong demand across our portfolio of core automation and digital transformation solutions. Total revenue of $1.9 billion grew 19%. Organic sales grew 17% versus prior year, better than our expectations despite significant supply chain challenges in the quarter.\nThe manufacturing supply chain remains constrained due to extremely high levels of demand and persistent electronic component shortages. It's a very dynamic situation, and our global supply chain organization continues to navigate these challenges. We're taking a variety of actions, including qualifying additional semiconductor technology and investing in capacity, to increase our supply chain resiliency and support our growth.\nTurning now to our top line performance. Core automation sales and orders momentum was broad-based across our product lines, including control, visualization, network, motion, power, sensors and safety. In the Intelligent Devices business segment, organic sales increased 26% versus prior year, even with significant headwinds from supply chain. Software & Control was also impacted by supply chain constraints, but organic sales growth of 8% was above our expectations. We also had very strong orders growth in this segment. Of note, industrial PC orders at ASEM, our recent acquisition, were particularly strong and almost doubled from a year ago. In Lifecycle Services, organic sales increased 10% versus the prior year led by double-digit growth at Sensia and our solutions business. Demand is strongly increasing in this segment as demonstrated by double-digit sequential orders growth and a 1.38 book-to-bill for the segment.\nInformation Solutions & Connected Services grew double digits in both orders and revenue. Q1 sales were particularly strong across the entire Information Solutions portfolio as well as Kalypso's digital consulting services. Industrial cybersecurity demand was strong in the quarter and included a strategic win with one of the world's leading natural gas pipeline companies in North America. We also had a key win with one of the largest beverage manufacturers in EMEA, demonstrating how our industrial cyber business continues to create new ways for us to win.\nOur investments in the cloud are also showing very good traction. Another notable win in the quarter was with the Shyft Group, formerly known as Spartan Motors. The Shyft Group is a global leader in the commercial vehicle industry and a big beneficiary of EV and last-mile delivery trends. Here, Plex's smart manufacturing platform was chosen to enable best practices across their operations, reduce material costs, automate quality processes, all while supporting high-speed line deployments.\nAt Fiix, we had another great quarter with their ARR growing over 40% and over 600 new Fiix customers added in just the last 12 months. In the quarter, Rockwell expanded its presence within Lucid Motors, one of the top up-and-coming luxury EV companies in the world. Lucid already selected Rockwell's FactoryTalk software to manage production and is growing their fixed subscription base to ensure readiness and facilitate skilled resource effectiveness. This is a great example of the synergies we are already seeing across our cloud and on-prem software portfolios and the positive contributions they are making to our overall business.\nI'd also like to highlight the continued traction we see with our PTC partnership. The capabilities and versatility of the combined solution has contributed to our significant software portfolio differentiation and has become a great way to win with customers.\nIn summary, I'm very happy with how these digital offerings are contributing to our recurring revenue base, including contributions from our organically developed software, PTC and our recent acquisitions. In the quarter, double -- in the quarter, total ARR grew by over 50% and organic ARR grew double digits.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4, where I'll provide a few highlights of our Q1 end market performance. Each of our industry segments showed strong double-digit year-over-year organic growth. And as we've said, our strong orders are reflective of underlying demand. Advanced orders for longer lead time products that are not immediately needed make up about 10% of the total. In our discrete industry segment, sales grew approximately 20% versus the prior year. Within this industry segment, automotive sales grew mid-teens, led by a 50% increase in EV capital project activity around the world and strong growth in EV battery led by our independent Cart Technology.\nSemiconductor sales grew over 25% in the quarter with strong double-digit growth in all regions. Significant greenfield project activity is leading to our strong growth at semiconductor-focused engineering firms and machine builders.\nE-commerce was our fastest-growing vertical with sales growing approximately 50% over the prior year. E-commerce orders included a series of multimillion dollar wins to automate new fulfillment centers throughout North America for a well-known e-commerce provider. We believe our strong differentiation in motion, including advanced material handling technology and support services, are driving market share gains in this fast-growing vertical.\nTurning now to our hybrid industry segment. The verticals in this segment also had a terrific quarter. Food and beverage grew over 20% in Q1, with broad growth across the regions. Once again, SKU expansion, end-of-line automation and the need for greater manufacturing flexibility are important trends requiring greater levels of automation. We believe the steady pipeline of greenfield and brownfield project opportunities, our deep relationships with machine builders and our strong technology differentiation are driving record demand in this key vertical.\nLife sciences. Sales grew over 10% in Q1 off of an extremely strong quarter last year and remains one of our fastest-growing verticals in fiscal '22. We have significantly invested in this area of our business over the last few years and believe we are well positioned to gain more share through broader and deeper offerings and expertise.\nOur fastest growing vertical in the hybrid segment this quarter was Tire, which grew about 35% in the quarter. This is another great vertical that is investing heavily in innovation.\nTurning to Process. This industry segment grew approximately 15% led by improving trends in upstream and midstream oil and gas. Our Sensia joint venture had strong sales and orders in the quarter led by strength in process automation and lift control solutions. Sensia's digitalization solutions are well suited to the energy industry's desire to improve productivity and extend the useful life of existing infrastructure as well as the desire to use modern technology to improve safety and reduce environmental impact. As operating and capital budgets increasingly open up, we believe Sensia is well positioned for double-digit growth in fiscal '22.\nTurning now to Slide 5 and our Q1 organic regional sales performance. North America organic sales grew by 16% versus the prior year with strong double-digit growth across all 3 industry segments. EMEA sales increased 15% driven by strength in food and beverage and tire and metals.\nAsia Pacific was our fastest-growing region in Q1, growing 25% with broad-based growth led by semiconductor and food and beverage. In China, we saw double-digit growth driven by strength in tire, food and beverage, chemical and mass transit.\nLet's now turn to Slide 6 to review highlights for the full year outlook. We now expect orders for the year to exceed $9 billion, which is above what we expected just a few months ago and really taking our business to a whole new level.\nWe continue to expect total reported sales growth of 17.5%, including 15.5% organic growth versus the prior year. Our projections reflect a detailed review of supply chain constraints by supplier and product line over the course of the year. But as we've said before, these constraints remain very dynamic.\nWe continue to expect double-digit growth in both core automation as well as Information Solutions & Connected Services. Acquisitions are off to a good start and expected to contribute 2 points of profitable top line growth.\nWe are maintaining our margin expectation and adjusted EPS target of $10.80 for the year, which represents about 15% growth at the midpoint of the range compared to the prior year. I should add that we continue to expect another year of double-digit annual recurring revenue growth, including our recent Plex acquisition, which adds approximately $170 million to our ARR totals in fiscal '22.\nA more detailed view into our outlook by end market is found on Slide 7. I won't go into the details on this slide, but as you can see, there is no change to the outlook for our 3 industry segments. With that, let me now turn it over to Nick, who will elaborate on our Q1 results and financial outlook for fiscal '22. Nick?\n\nNicholas C. Gangestad\n\nSenior VP & CFO, 3M Company\n\nThank you, Blake, and good morning, everyone. I'll start on Slide 8, first quarter key financial information. First quarter reported sales were up 19% over last year. This is slightly better for the quarter than we expected and indicated in November. We saw some improvements in the timing of electronic component shipments from our suppliers that resulted in a stronger first quarter than we anticipated. Q1 organic sales were up 17%, and acquisitions contributed 2.6 points to total growth. Currency translation decreased sales by under 1 point. Segment's operating margin was 19.1%, better than expected and improved sequentially from Q4. Our stronger sales performance improved our margins in the quarter. Versus last year, our margins declined 70 basis points due to higher planned spend and negative price costs, both in line with expectations. These were both partially offset by the impact of higher sales.\nCorporate and other expense was $29 million. Our adjusted EPS in the quarter was $2.14. Q1 of fiscal year '21 included a nonrecurring favorable legal settlement of $0.45. Excluding the prior year favorable legal settlement, adjusted EPS grew 11% versus the prior year. I'll cover a year-over-year adjusted EPS bridge on a later slide.\nThe adjusted effective tax rate for the first quarter was 15.3% and in line with the prior year. Free cash flow was negative by $50 million in the quarter and down compared to prior year. due to the payout of the fiscal '21 bonus, an increase in our working capital to serve our strong demand and higher planned tax payments.\nOne additional item not shown on the slide. We repurchased 151,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $49 million. On December 31, $503 million remained available under our repurchase authorization.\nSlide 9 provides the sales and margin performance overview of our 3 operating segments. Total reported sales grew double digits across all 3 of our segments. Intelligent Devices grew organic sales by 26%. Compared to last year, Intelligent Devices margin expanded 430 basis points to 23.7% on higher sales despite a price cost headwind. Software & Control organic sales were up 8%. Segment margins for this segment declined 730 basis points compared to last year with higher planned investment spend and the impact of acquisition integration costs partially offset by higher organic sales. This segment also saw a negative price cost in the quarter. Lifecycle Services grew organic sales by 10%. Segment margin was 5.5% and declined 340 basis points driven by higher planned investment spend, unfavorable project mix and higher input costs partially offset by higher sales. Margin is expected to grow through the balance of the year as a result of strong sales growth and a higher margin backlog.\nThe next slide, 10, provides the adjusted EPS walk from Q1 fiscal '21 to Q1 fiscal '22. Starting on the left. Core performance was up about $0.55 on a 16.8% organic sales increase. Approximately $0.20 was related to temporary pay actions that were benefiting the prior year and have since been reversed. This is the last quarter that we have this in our prior year comparables as a headwind. Currency was slightly unfavorable by about $0.05. Acquisitions had a negative impact of $0.10 mostly related to Plex. We continue to expect that Plex, including the impact of interest expense will be breakeven in fiscal year '22 EPS and up $0.15 from fiscal year '21. As a reminder, our prior year EPS included a nonrecurring legal settlement gain of $0.45. This brings us to our total EPS of $2.14.\nLet's move on to the next Slide 11, guidance for fiscal '22. We are reaffirming our sales guidance of about $8.2 billion in fiscal '22, up 17.5% at the midpoint of the range. We expect organic sales growth to be in a range of 14% to 17% and 15.5% at the midpoint of our range. This guidance is based on our current view of electronic component availability.\nBy quarter, we see Q2 sales improving sequentially low to mid-single digits with continued improvement in the second half of the year. Our first half is expected to be in line with our initial projections with our first quarter being a little stronger and our second quarter coming in a little lower due to timing of electronic component availability. We are pleased with our supply chain team's ability to navigate through this dynamic environment and keep the focus on serving our customers.\nWe expect full year segment operating margin to be about 21.5%. We continue to expect slightly positive price/cost for the full year. We expect the first half impact of price cost on margins to be dilutive by approximately 200 basis points and that the margin impact in the second half from price cost will be accretive by over 100 basis points. Given the first half of the year negative impact of price cost, we expect margins in the second quarter to be similar to Q1 margins with the positive impact from higher sales being offset by higher sequential input costs. We expect the phasing of our price increases, along with higher sales, will significantly benefit margins in the second half of the year.\nOur full year view on margins and the impact of price cost on those margins remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year core earnings conversion of between 30% and 35%, and we're on track to grow our R&D and other growth-related investments by double digits. These investments will position us well as we drive sustained growth in '22 and beyond.\nWe continue to expect the full year adjusted effective tax rate to be around 17%. We do not anticipate any material discrete items to impact tax in fiscal '22. We're also reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of $10.50 to $11.10. At the midpoint of the range, this represents 15% adjusted EPS growth.\nFinally, we are projecting full year fiscal '22 free cash flow conversion of about 90% of adjusted income. This reflects a $155 million bonus payout made in quarter 1 for the fiscal '21 performance, $165 million of capital expenditures and funding higher levels of working capital to support significantly higher sales growth. Our working capital target is aligned with our historical amount of about 12% of total sales.\nA few additional comments on fiscal '22 guidance. Corporate and other expense remains around $125 million. Net interest expense for fiscal '22 is expected to be about $115 million, and we're assuming average diluted shares outstanding of 117.5 million shares.\nFinally, on capital deployment, no change to our strategy or fiscal '22 priorities. Our first priority is organic growth. After that, we focus capital deployment on inorganic activities. Then we focus on capital returns to shareholders through our dividend and then share repurchases, and we continue to focus on delevering in fiscal year '22. With that, I'll turn it back over to Blake for some closing remarks before we start Q&A.\n\nBlake D. Moret\n\nChairman, President & CEO, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nick. Strong order trends and record backlog underpin a robust top line outlook for fiscal '22. As we said last quarter, we're making investments in our capacity, technology and people to support our future growth. We are investing in our operations to expand capacity by $500 million per quarter while, at the same time, increasing the resiliency of our supply chains. We made significant progress in the quarter to release FactoryTalk's SaaS offerings, including new Plex smart manufacturing platform capabilities and we've expanded Fiix's applied AI capabilities.\nWe also released the next version of Emulate3D to further our capabilities in creating and operating digital twins of production systems. A significant release of new logic functionality is scheduled for next quarter. Importantly, last year's accelerated organic investments have allowed us to release new secure remote access functionality and cloud-based data management of automation design information earlier than originally anticipated.\nIn summary, Q1 was a great start to the year. We've been very busy capitalizing on the opportunities we see today while, at the same time, building for the future.\nI want to take a moment to recognize the people in our organization and the tremendous work that went into these results during especially challenging times. We're making significant investments in existing and new talent and are empowering them with the technologies and resources to be successful. We continue to encourage fresh ideas from across the organization and look at ways to increase our value through the customers' eyes. I feel confident that investments in automation and digital transformation have never been more top of mind than they are today. As a pure-play leader devoted exclusively to these areas. We think our agility, our differentiated portfolio of products and services, our significant domain expertise and our ecosystem of best-in-class partners make us the best positioned company to benefit from what should be a significant multiyear growth cycle.\nLet me now pass the time back to Jessica to begin the Q&A session.\n\nJessica Kourakos\n\nHead of IR, Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n\nThanks, Blake.

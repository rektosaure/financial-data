My name is Kelvin, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to DuPont's Q3 2025 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star one again. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Angie and Christopher. Please go ahead.\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q3 2025 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Lori Koch, Chief Executive Officer, and Antonella Franzen, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and has been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. As a quick reminder, on the basis of presentation for our Q3 financial results, our total company net sales, Operating EBITDA, and Adjusted EPS include segment results for Electronics Co. and Industrials Co., excluding results for the previously announced divestiture of the Aramids business, which is now reported as discontinued operations. I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will begin on slide 3.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our Q3 call. Earlier today, we reported another solid quarter ahead of our previously communicated guidance. Q3 sales of $3.1 billion grew 6% on an organic basis. Operating EBITDA of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year, resulting in an Operating EBITDA margin of 27.3%.\nAs a result of our strong Q3 financial performance and our expected operational improvements, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance for the new DuPont. Antonella will provide further details shortly. Q3 saw organic growth across all businesses, with continued strong volume growth in healthcare and water, coupled with strength in electronics driven by AI technology demand in both Interconnect Solutions and Semi. Today, we also announced capital allocation updates for the new DuPont, both in the form of a quarterly dividend and a new share repurchase authorization. We declared our initial quarterly dividend under new DuPont in the amount of $0.20 per share, in line with our targeted 35% to 45% payout ratio. The Board of Directors also approved a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, under which we expect to quickly launch an ASR in the amount of $500 million.\nBoth of these actions underpin our commitment to a disciplined capital allocation model and are a testament to our financial strength and dedication to delivering value. Earlier this week, we announced the successful completion of the QUNITY separation. As a premier PurePlay Technology Solutions partner to the semiconductor value chain, QUNITY is well-positioned to deliver growth and value creation for its shareholders. Turning to slide 4, as part of Investor Day, I outlined a clear strategy for the new DuPont to drive value creation for all our stakeholders. Our strategy is focused around driving above-market organic growth, building a robust business system, deploying a balanced capital allocation model, and consistently delivering results. We are already seeing progress against these value creation drivers.\nWe have successfully repositioned ourselves and have a streamlined portfolio of leading businesses, the majority of which are aligned to secular end markets, which will enable strong organic growth. We saw nice growth in Q3, and we continue to expect 2% organic growth for the full year. Our innovation engine continues to deliver. We announced the launch of our latest technology in Tyvek garments, branded Tyvek Apex. This latest technology for PPE provides enhanced breathability while maintaining the same level of protection and durability. The launch clearly demonstrates how we collaborate with customers and deploy our application development expertise to meet their needs. As I noted at Investor Day, we are driving towards building a robust business system, starting from a strong jump-off point with a full suite of tools that are being actively deployed.\nThis quarter, we introduced a core set of enhanced KPIs that are focused on driving improvement for our shareholders, customers, and employees. These KPIs were embedded in a refreshed set of management standards, which has added more visibility, rigor, and structure to ensure we achieve our business objectives. On commercial excellence, we have advanced the framework across commercial enablement, sales effectiveness, and strategic marketing, a key priority with focus on pipeline discipline. We have designed a more transparent, data-driven process, which links demand generation, opportunity qualification, and conversion metrics to deliver against our growth targets. Specifically, within our water business, we have taken a regional approach to the rollout and have improved pipeline rigor in North America and Europe, leading to sizable improvement in our opportunity funnel. We plan to launch in Asia later this quarter. We also continue to drive enhancements in operational excellence.\nDuring the quarter, we rolled out an updated set of KPIs aligned with our focus on safety, quality, delivery, and cost. We also refreshed our toolkit around OEE and reliability, which is driving reductions in unplanned downtime and improving our maintenance spend and wrench time. On capital allocation, I highlighted earlier the dividend and share repurchase authorization that was approved by our board. In addition, we also announced in late September that we signed an agreement to acquire manufacturing capacity to expand our reverse osmosis footprint in China. This aligns with our local-for-local strategy and increases our capacity to meet growing demand for industrial water purification and reuse in the region.\nWith this backdrop, I remain confident in delivering the medium-term targets for Q26 through Q28 that we outlined for you at Investor Day: 3% to 4% organic growth, 150% to 200 basis points of margin expansion, 8% to 10% EPS growth, and generating strong free cash flow conversion at greater than 90%. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Antonella to cover the financials and outlook.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We delivered another quarter of year-over-year growth in organic sales and operating EBITDA on volume strength across many key end markets. Operational focus by our teams drove solid financial performance in the quarter, including strong cash conversion, beginning with Q3 financial highlights on slide 5. Net sales of $3.1 billion increased 7% versus the year-ago period on 6% organic sales growth, and a 1% benefit from currency.\nOrganic sales growth consisted of a 7% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% decline in price. Organic sales included a $70 million benefit from order timing shifts into Q3 from Q4 due to system cutover activities in advance of the separation. Excluding this, organic sales growth would have been 4% in the quarter. From a segment view, both segments saw organic sales growth with Industrials Co. and Electronics Co. up 4% and 10%, respectively. All businesses had organic growth during the quarter, led by low teens growth in Interconnect Solutions, high single-digit growth in both healthcare and water technologies in Semi, and low single-digit growth in diversified industrials. We saw organic growth across all regions, with North America and Asia-Pacific up 7% and Europe up 6% year-over-year.\nQ3 operating EBITDA of $840 million increased 6% versus the year-ago period, as organic growth and productivity benefits were partially offset by growth investments and unfavorable mix. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 27.3% was down approximately 30 basis points year-over-year due to unfavorable mix in Electronics Co. Turning to cash flow, we delivered transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $576 million and related conversion of 126%. This was in line with our expected acceleration this quarter. Turning to slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.09 per share was flat with the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.09 was primarily offset by a headwind from a higher tax rate year-over-year. Our base tax rate during the quarter was 24.6%. The prior year base tax rate, which included discrete benefits, was 19.5%. Turning to slide 7, Industrials Co.\nQ3 net sales of $1.8 billion were up 5% versus the year-ago period on 4% organic growth and a 1% benefit from currency. Organic growth included a benefit of approximately $30 million in order timing shifts. Excluding this benefit, organic sales growth was 2% in the quarter, in line with our expectations. For Q3, healthcare and water sales were up high single digits on an organic basis versus the year-ago period. Organic growth was led by continued strengths in medical packaging, biopharma, reverse osmosis, and ion exchange. Diversified industrial sales were up low single digits on an organic basis, as growth in industrial technologies was partially offset by continued softness in construction markets. Operating EBITDA for Industrials Co. during the quarter of $465 million was up 4% versus the year-ago period on organic growth and productivity gains, partially offset by growth investments.\nOperating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25.9%, flat with the prior year, absorbing a margin headwind from currency. Sequentially, operating EBITDA margins improved 30 basis points. Turning to Electronics Co. on slide 8, Q3 net sales of $1.3 billion increased 11% versus the year-ago period on 10% organic growth and a 1% benefit from currency. Organic growth included a benefit of approximately $40 million in order timing shifts. Excluding this benefit, organic sales growth was 7% in the quarter. At the line-of-business level, organic sales for semiconductor technologies were up high single digits on continued strong end market demand driven by advanced nodes and AI technology applications. Interconnect Solutions also posted another strong quarter with organic sales up low teens, reflecting continued demand from AI-driven technology ramps and benefits from content and share gains across advanced packaging and thermal management solutions. Operating EBITDA for Electronics Co.\nof $403 million was up 6% versus the year-ago period, as organic growth was partially offset by growth investments to support advanced node transitions and AI technology ramps. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 31.6%, down 140 basis points versus the year-ago period, primarily due to unfavorable mix and currency headwinds. As a reminder, QUNITY Management will host a call later today to provide a business update. Earlier this week, we announced the successful completion of the QUNITY separation. In connection with this transaction, we received approximately $4.2 billion of cash in the form of a midnight dividend from QUNITY, which will be used to reduce DuPont's debt and achieve the targeted capital structure that we outlined at Investor Day. Turning to slide 9, which outlines our latest view on 2025 financial guidance.\nAs a reminder, we provided an updated view of our full year 2025 expectations, reflecting the separation of QUNITY and the presentation of the Aramids business as discontinued operations as part of our Investor Day in mid-September. Also in Q4, we will be reporting under a new segment structure of healthcare and water technologies, and diversified industrials. In the appendix to the slide deck, we have included preliminary, recast, quarterly segment information for your reference. From a top-line perspective, our expectation of organic sales growth for the full year remains in line with the guidance we provided at Investor Day. We expect organic sales to be up 2% year-over-year on strong demand in healthcare and water, partially offset by ongoing weakness in construction end markets. Our current full year sales guidance of $6.84 billion reflects slightly lower currency benefits from our prior expectations.\nWe are raising our full year operating EBITDA guidance to $1.6 billion, driven by our stronger Q3 performance, underlying operational improvements across the businesses, and lower corporate costs. We expect full year adjusted EPS to be $1.66 per share, an increase of about 16% year-over-year. Our full year base tax rate is expected to be about 28%, including about 200 basis points of headwind related to total company interest expense that cannot be reflected as discontinued operations. We continue to expect that our go-forward tax rate will be in the 25% to 26% range, consistent with the guidance provided at Investor Day. For Q4, we estimate net sales of about $1.685 billion, operating EBITDA of about $385 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.43 per share. Our Q4 guidance assumes about 1% organic growth when normalizing for the Q3 timing shift.\nOn a reported basis, we expect a Q4 organic sales decline of about 1% versus prior year. As you will recall, we provided full year 2025 pro forma estimates as part of our Investor Day to serve as a baseline for our medium-term targets. Our stronger underlying performance translates into revised full year 2025 pro forma estimates for operating EBITDA of $1.63 billion and adjusted EPS of $2.02 per share, compared to the $1.62 billion and $2 per share. Our lower corporate costs are accelerating our run rate towards our expected $95 million public company corporate cost structure. I want to thank our employees for remaining focused on delivering these results and for driving the successful completion of the QUNITY separation. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. During the Q&A, we ask that you please limit your inputs to one question and one follow-up. I would like to remind everyone, to ask a question, please press the star button followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star one again. One moment, please, for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partners, Vertical Research Partners\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Congrats on getting the job done. Good morning, Jeff. Good morning. Thanks.\nYeah. Just I wanted to kind of focus more on just sort of the end market trends, and there's some color on page 12 that helps.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nBut first, this timing benefit, is this something you did or kind of pushed on behalf of your customers so they wouldn't somehow be disrupted? Maybe just give us a little sense of what was behind that, if you don't mind.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So, Jeff, kind of the way to think about it is, as you would expect, the separation that we did really touched every legal entity within the organization. So, in essence, we had to repipe everything in all of our financial systems to do that. So our customers were notified that we would be in a blackout period in early October as we did this after quarter end. And therefore, we had some orders that were originally set to go out in the October timeframe that our customers accelerated into Q3, given we were going to be in a blackout period. So it was completely customer-driven.\nAgain, no changes really to our expectations of what we expected from an organic growth perspective in the second half, but it clearly created a higher organic growth in the third quarter and a lower organic growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partners, Vertical Research Partners\n\nYeah. And then I think you probably intentionally didn't say anything about 2026 today, but maybe give us some initial thoughts on sort of these exit rates that we're looking at here in Q4, again outlined on page 12, what might be sort of the pluses and minuses as we shift into next year. Particularly interested in what you're seeing in the healthcare and water businesses, especially.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So we're exiting the second half at about 2% organic growth in line with where we are for the full year.\nSo from an end market perspective, we would expect healthcare and water to be right in line with what we gave in our medium-term targets, which is about 5% organic growth on average. And then on the diversified side, in the 2% that we'll report for the second half, shelter is still down. So it's going to be down about 1% in the second half, but full year, it's about 4%. So given that that's about 25% of our revenues, if that were to see them to normalize to flat, that would be a nice lift as we head into 2026. So no material changes. We put the targets out just six weeks ago. We mentioned that in order to be able to deliver against expectations, we can't start in a hole. So we would expect our medium-term targets to be something that we would consistently deliver.\nWe'll obviously be paying close attention to the construction markets, though, and see how they play out.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partners, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks. I'll leave it there.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nOkay. Great.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, Lori, Antonella. And I'll echo what Jeff said. And congrats. You guys have done a lot of wood chopping in the last few years, particularly the last few months. It's kind of a lot of moving parts, and my head's spinning a little bit. But if we can just start with a little bit of minutia, what's your plan with the balance sheet? I think you're something like 0.8 times pro forma leverage. I know you still have some liability issues you got to manage. But what is kind of the plan and target there?\nAnd will there be a—I saw the buyback announcement—but will there be other deals like Spectrum, things like that, that you guys would be potentially looking at in 2026?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So let me start with, from a balance sheet perspective. So we would expect our pro forma debt to be around $3.25 billion, and we would expect to have a billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet. So our starting point net debt to EBITDA leverage is around 1.7 times. Our target is to stay below two times from that perspective in terms of where we expect to be on the balance sheet. As you saw this morning, we did announce the $2 billion share repurchase authorization, and we expect to, I would say, imminently start an ASR into size of about $500 million that we will do.\nAnd then clearly, as we progress during the year, as we mentioned at Investor Day, we would have a balanced approach. We would continue to look at share buybacks. We will continue to look at M&A activity. But we're clearly in a very good spot from a balance sheet perspective, quite honestly, Scott, to be able to do both. We have a really strong balance sheet going in. We have the Aramids' proceeds that will be coming in in the first quarter as well. And as we talked about at the Investor Day, over the next three years, even accounting for dividend payments and share creep, we would have about another $500 million a year that is deployable in free cash flow.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. And on the opportunities you had mentioned spectrum, so we did actually complete a small tuck-in acquisition in the water space recently.\nSo we bought RO capacity in China that really helps with our footprint there, enabling us to be local for local, given that China is the largest RO footprint for us. So we'll continue to be opportunistic. We're looking in all spaces in the healthcare with respect to not only additional spectrum-like assets in the CDMO space, but also potentially in med packaging and other areas that have nice secular growth. And then we'll also be opportunistic as we can in additional water opportunities. So we've got a really rich pipeline, and, as Antonella mentioned, the strong balance sheet to be able to be proactive with it. And we'll be prudent. So we'll have a profile on a return that we want to deliver.\nSo we would get to ROIC greater than WAC by year five and a nice path line to a net synergy number that is in line with our affordability range.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then at Investor Day, you talked a little bit about your renewed focus on lean and operational excellence. I think you had made a hire in that regard on chief operation, I think, title, whatever you call it. But can you just talk about what you're trying to achieve on that front? I don't have a great sense of where you are today as it relates to lean in your current portfolio. Just talk a little bit about the opportunity and what you're planning for here. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So we picked up Dave Cook from Danaher. So he was the ops leader for Pall, and we were fortunate to get him into our organization.\nHe's made an impact already in just the couple of months that he's been here. We started down the path a few years ago on an OpEx framework that deployed lean tools as well as some Six Sigma tools and within a continuous improvement mindset. We're going to take that baseline that we have and kind of put it on steroids and make sure that it influences truly the way that we work. We've rolled out enhanced management standards, which really will dictate how we monitor the performance in our business and solve problems in our businesses to make sure that we have a continuous improvement mindset. We've identified eight core KPIs. Four of them are shareholder or financial-related, two of them are customer-related, and two of them are employee-related.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nAnd they will form the basis of our monthly business reviews and allow us to be able to understand performance and understand improvement opportunities. So it's really a cultural change around a continuous improvement mindset, looking for net productivity opportunities year in, year out.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nInteresting. Sounds interesting. Congrats on hiring, David. We've heard good things. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks. Great.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nShigurui Sakato\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nHi. This is Shiguri Sakato going for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. I'm just following up on the 80/20 initiatives that you talked about at Investor Day. On the flip side, there's probably some opportunity to prune the portfolio on the edges. But if you can talk about any opportunities you're seeing there, it would be great. Thanks. Yeah. Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nSo we had mentioned at Investor Day, too, as part of the team refresh, we brought in Beth Ferreira, who had a background at ITW, who is well-versed within the 80/20 framework. And so she's actively deploying that toolkit across the diversified industrials businesses to see opportunities for us to improve margins across that side of the portfolio. I think as far as pruning, we had mentioned that we have a goal to be able to continue to work the portfolio towards more secular-based end markets. And so today, we're about 50/50 with respect to healthcare, water, and the diversified businesses. And ideally, we would be more like 2/3, 1/3. So I don't really want to comment on what businesses those would entail, but the goal is to continue to get more into the secular-based mid-single-digit growth.\n\nShigurui Sakato\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Good morning.Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one on the pro forma EBITDA forecast. Inched up a little bit. Admittedly, not a huge amount, but it's a pretty brief amount of time. And I think you attributed it to stronger underlying business performance. I guess, where is the area that you're being surprised on? And is it on the volume front, or is it more on the cost and efficiency side, would you say?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nI would say it's more on the margin side. So what you see us kind of putting through in the pro formas is really how we exceeded or how we raised our guidance this year related to the segment performance that we had. So you see that kind of flowing through the pro formas.\nSo it's from the margin perspective and better operational performance that we have.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Okay. And then with regard to M&A, I mean, you made the reverse osmosis asset acquisition. So clearly, some things out there on your radar that you're opportunistically going after. I guess, can you give us a little bit more color as to what you see in the pipeline? If there are a lot of targets out there at this point, if it's a little bit scarce, I guess, how you're thinking about that?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So we have a robust pipeline. I would say it is deeper on the healthcare side than it is on the water side, just given the fragmentation that exists in healthcare and the consolidation that exists in water.\nSo water, there's still opportunities probably to go beyond the water filtration assets that we have today into potentially other areas within the water value chain. And on the healthcare side, it is pretty deep, just given, as I had mentioned, the fragmentation that exists on the CDMO side. So there's lots of players. The majority of them on both sides, actually, are owned by private equity. So that gives us the opportunity to be able to transact at some point versus having to try to shake something loose from a strategic. And so it's deep. And we're actively pursuing opportunities and reviewing opportunities with our strategy and M&A team.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nAnalyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the call and congratulations on the split.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Great.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you so much for taking my question. So when you take a step back as an independent company and you look at your strategy and margins and market performance, whether it's this quarter or what you are forecasting on a preliminary basis for 2026, what do you think the street is missing the most about the independent company's outlook? And what are you the most enthusiastic about now that you have full independence?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nWell, I think if I speak in the today and now, I think the street is confused on our numbers, just given where the pre-market trading is. So there was a lot of noise, obviously, around the numbers with Aramids coming out as a disc ops and maybe Consensus not getting fully reset. But we had a beat and raise. We beat our Q3 numbers, and new DuPont raised our side of the numbers as well.\nSo I think that's one kind of short-term confusion. I think longer term, it's just the view on who we are. And so I think there's still a view that potentially we're a chemical company versus we have significantly transformed the portfolio to a multi-industrial. And we've got the financial performance that is right in line with the multi-industrials. And so we would expect that we would continue to re-rate up towards more of that multi-industrial multiple. So I think that's one of the biggest confusing points, is that we have a much more streamlined, simplified portfolio and a refreshed team to be able to continue to deliver.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. And just very quickly to follow up, on the water portfolio, you have a pretty well-rounded enhanced lineup of everything from ultra to RO and everything else within the filtration side.\nDo you have the willingness or desire to get further into metering or anything else, kind of as a tangential kind of growth theme, in terms of how that market is evolving over the next three, five, 10 years? Just, I'd love to hear about your strategy broader than it's been over the last, let's say, five or so. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. We do have a strategy to go beyond just the water filtration. We're obviously the largest player in all the key technologies. So to get larger there via acquisition could be tricky from a regulatory perspective. I would say metering is not one that we're actively looking at, just given the valuations are quite high. But we are looking at opportunities more potentially either in systems plays or potentially other areas of filtration beyond just generally water.\nSo we do have within our ion exchange resin business some water filtration around food and beverage, and microelectronics, and dairy. So potentially, are there some opportunities there that kind of take us beyond traditional industrial wastewater purification and desalination?\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nVery helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. First, I just wanted to try to ask on the cash and the balance sheet comments. I think some of our math was that your ending cash might be closer to $1.5 to 2 billion before buybacks, just given where cash sits today and fourth quarter free cash flow. I don't know if that's wrong from the math or if the $1 billion in cash is a target. So just curious, can you help bridge us for the moving pieces between Q3 and year-end, please?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So you have to keep in mind a couple of things. So one, the cash on the balance sheet at the end of Q3 is the cash position for both the new DuPont as well as QUNITY. So there is some cash that will go over to QUNITY as part of the separation. So again, on a pro forma basis, we expect to be at around $1 billion, which is what the new DuPont will have as a cash position, which, quite honestly, is a pretty healthy spot to be in as we move forward, given the size of the organization. And is that before or after the ASR? That would be before the ASR. That is our pro forma cash that we expect to keep.\nThe other thing to keep in mind is as we get towards the end of the year, between the timing of when certain separation costs would be paid, we obviously said we're going to move pretty imminently on the ASR. So clearly, that's before we get to year-end in terms of doing that. So there will be some cash out the door related to that that we'll have before year-end. There's also timing of separation costs. So there is the potential that by end of year, we may have a little bit of commercial paper that's on hand. But clearly, as we mentioned before, we do have a nice amount of proceeds coming in the door in Q1 of 2026 related to the Aramids divestiture.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nThanks. And if I could just follow up quickly on margins. I mean, you reiterated your improvement plan over the next few years.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nI guess, assuming that the macro demand is a bit softer next year, do you see a bigger opportunity to pull forward some productivity and get more margin expansion, or is that more of a volume-dependent type profile where you'd need to get a stronger macro to achieve that? I mean, as we did our walk that we talked about on Investor Day, we did have a portion of the margin expansion that would be coming from our revenue growth.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nAs Lori mentioned earlier, I would keep in mind that when you look at our healthcare and water business, as we exit this year and go into next year, we are still in a very good position to be able to grow at mid-single-digit growth.\nAnd you really only need a little bit of growth, I would say, on the diversified industrial side of the house to kind of get to, I would call it, the low end of our organic revenue growth target as we move forward. So that was a piece of it. So we feel really good that we're positioned to do that. In addition, we had about 40 basis points of margin expansion over the three-year period coming from the removal of our stranded costs. Clearly, that's 100% in our control. And as I mentioned at the Investor Day, the plan would be to get that out by the end of year two. So you'd have that margin improvement in the first two years of the plan. And then you heard Lori talk a little bit earlier about our lean initiatives and how we're operating as a new company going forward.\nSo we do have another additional up to 50 basis points coming from productivity greater than inflation. And I would say the teams are doing a really good job relative to that. We even saw underlying margin improvement this quarter, and we would expect to continue to see that as we go forward.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Financial Group\n\nThank you. Where are we on the discussions with MSCI on reclassification? And will we get a pro forma balance sheet at some point, or just wait until we get the year-end balance sheet for new DuPont?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So a couple of things. Let me take the good old Dick's question first because it's one of my favorite topics. So I would say we are continuing to make progress towards an industry classification change.\nAs I'm sure you've seen, QUNITY got their semiconductor classification, which we obviously positioned for. So that has worked out well. I would say the way that S&P and the MSCI work, they do kind of wait for your publicly filed information. So I think they'll see clearly the new DuPont as we get to this upcoming 10-K filing. But we will continue to push on that. I would say the one thing that I would always recall is that the fact that really our valuation is really going to depend more so on our consistent performance more than any classification. But I would tell you that I'm on a personal mission related to our GICS code to ultimately have that appropriately reflect the DuPont portfolio that we have today. In terms of pro formas, on Monday, this past Monday, we did file an 8-K that did show pro forma information.\nSo some of that is actually already out today and already out as of now. And then clearly, as we get to the end of the year, all of our financials will clearly show both electronics and aramids as discontinued operations. So you'll have a nice 10-K with historical periods all recasted for the new DuPont as we go forward.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nAnalyst, Mizuho Financial Group\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alexei Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexei Yefremov\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc\n\nThanks. And good morning, everyone. This is Ryan on for Alexei. Just want to echo some of the earlier comments and my congratulations in getting everything done. The earlier part of the call kind of focused a lot on maybe where you could go with the portfolio, but I was hoping to kind of focus on what you currently have.\nEspecially in the healthcare business, there's a lot of talk in the slide deck about medical packaging, and biopharma this year. But maybe we could get some additional color kind of on what's going on in the medical device space.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So we're really excited about all aspects of the portfolio, but the healthcare, and water with the mid-single-digit growth areas that will continue to differentially invest. And so we saw nice growth across the broader healthcare business. And so we kind of said mid to high single-digit growth on a full-year basis for healthcare, and water combined. The healthcare business would be north of that average. And so it was really a combination of nice performance across Liveo, which is our biopharma business.\nAnd so I think, as you've seen across many of the peers that have exposure in biopharma, this was a nice year with kind of completion of the DSOC and a return to really nice growth. We saw really nice growth in the med packaging. And then to your question specifically on healthcare and the med device space, we're seeing nice growth too as we exit the year. And so we actually just announced that we are bringing in a new leader for the healthcare business to lead the Spectrum and Liveo businesses. He joins us from a long history of running other types of CDMOs. So he starts Monday, and we're really excited to have him join the portfolio as well. So we look for nice growth from that business and then ideally being able to be opportunistic and add to it as we go forward.\n\nAlexei Yefremov\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc\n\nGreat. That's helpful.\nAnd then just on the construction market, you and a number of players in the space have just kind of been talking about softer market conditions. So just kind of wondering what your outlook is. I know it's still early kind of getting into 2026, but just maybe if you can give some high-level commentary about how you're thinking about it. Thanks.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So a little bit of reminders of kind of where we've been related to our shelter business. That is what's tied to the construction market. So when we look actually at 2024, I would say we were in a relatively good position. We actually held flat with the market. And as you know, I would say over the last at least four years, we've all been in that second half of the year recovery, and then it kind of gets punted to the next year.\nAnd those are the early thoughts, I would tell you, as you start to read different reports that are out there related to the construction market, that the second half of next year would start to get better. As Lori mentioned earlier, we do expect the shelter business to be down around 4% organically this year. So we do feel we're at a relatively low level at this point. So we really aren't going to be expecting a significant amount of growth next year. But quite honestly, even getting to flat actually has a nice impact on our overall organic growth. So we do expect a little bit of growth in shelter next year, again though, off of a pretty low bottom here.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Matthew DeYoe of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nMatthew DeYoe\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning, everyone. Yeah.\nAnd congrats on the formal separations, but it's been a long road. I think if we look under the surface at new pro forma industrial core, I think the comment was organic sales were +4% ex-FX and then 2% extra pull forward. Can you just parse that out a little bit on a segment basis? Just trying to get a sense for volume and price in healthcare and water versus diversified industrials core. Just trying to get a little bit more granularity on what the pro forma business is doing here.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYep. So on a reported basis, healthcare and water were up high single digits. I would say if you kind of adjusted that for the pull forward impact, we were at mid-single digits. And diversified industrials was up on a reported basis organically in the low single digits.\nAnd I would say if you adjust for the pull forward, it would have been pretty relatively flat.\n\nMatthew DeYoe\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nAll right. And then you had said shelter was -4% on the year. As we just look at Q3 into Q4, I'm not sure if you said it or not, but where is that construction business comping? Is it -2%, -3% in this quarter in Q3, or maybe a little bit more out there?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. I would say in the third quarter, relative to the pull forward we had, it was down around 2%. We do expect as we get into the fourth quarter, we're down more in that 3% to 4% range. But I would say when you look at the overall 4% for the year, we were down more in the first half of the year than we are in the second half of the year.\n\nMatthew DeYoe\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you for the context. I appreciate it.\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nTurner Hendricks\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey. Good morning and congrats. This is Turner Hendricks on for Vincent. I was just wondering if you could provide some color on your confidence in the 3% to 4% top line algorithm for 2026.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So as we had mentioned, we don't expect to start in the hole to be able to achieve our medium-term targets of 3% to 4% over the 2026 to 2028 timeframe. So if we look at our performance in the second half of 2025, which can be an indicator of what you might be looking into in the beginning of 2026, our healthcare and water business is performing in line with our medium-term targets. So with that being roundly 5%, about half our company.\nSo you get 2.5% organic growth straight from that. And as we had mentioned, the shelter business, which is about 25% of portfolio in the second half, is down about 2.5%. We don't expect it to continue to be down next year, but we're not really expecting any material growth. But just the absence of a negative brings an opportunity incrementally from the second half. And as we look at the rest of the industrial tech portfolio, which makes up about 30%, we would expect to see sort of minimum low single-digit growth. We had mentioned the whole portfolio should be at average 2% for the industrial technology side.\nAnd so if you take that piece, you can generally roundly get to your medium-term targets at the midpoint range, with really just the big inflection point being recovery of the shelter markets and no longer being a drag on the total organic growth.\n\nTurner Hendricks\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Great. Appreciate the color. And I wanted to circle back as well on the building and construction discussion, specifically on BNC margins. How much are they holding the segment margin back at this point, given the weakened demand environment? And how much lift could there be if conditions begin to improve? And would this be in addition to the 150 to 200 basis point improvement that you all are targeting for 2028 overall?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. I would actually say I believe you mentioned the construction market, so the shelter business.\nI would say overall, actually, the business has actually been doing pretty well from a margin perspective. So I would do a nice shout-out and kudos to the team that despite the fact that volume has been down, they have been significantly driving productivity, watching costs, making sure that we are positioned for the current market environment that we're in. So that should set us up nicely for when we get back to being in growth mode in the construction space.\n\nTurner Hendricks\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nRachel Lee\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone. This is Rachel Lee on for Patrick. Can you expand more on the strategic rationale for the RO acquisition in China?\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nUnderstand it enables you to be more local for local, but can you touch more on the technology value-add perspective and specifically what you're seeing in terms of water market growth in China?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So the acquisition was more one of a capacity add. So on the Ion Exchange side, we've got five different plants across the globe, so we're able to be local for local. On the RO side, prior to this acquisition, we really had membrane capacity really only at one spot for the most part in the US and nothing outside of the US of any materiality. We had started to build fabrication capabilities outside the US through contract manufacturers, and we had established capabilities within the Asia-Pacific region.\nBut it was really important that we also get membrane capacity in Asia, just given that it's about 1/3 of our sales and there's growing local for local preferences in the region. So it really doesn't give us any additional technology. We've got the leading technologies that we'll continue to protect here in the US operations. It just gives us more local production capabilities for membrane within the China region.\n\nRachel Lee\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nGot it. That's very helpful. And then going to the diversified industrials side, it seems like organic sales grew better than expectations due to industrial technologies. Can you touch more on maybe how auto, or aerospace, or other businesses perform better than prior expectations? Thank you.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So on the diversified side, we had a little bit better performance than we had expected. A lot of that was related to the timing shift, though.\nSo from a full-year perspective on organic basis, we continue to expect to be at 2%. And it really hasn't materially changed across any of the lines of business or reporting units. But to your question, we did see nice improvement on the kind of general next-gen mobility space, which would include both the automotive and the aerospace side. So we had mentioned at Investor Day, I believe, that we are starting to feel a little bit of momentum building in the auto space, and we saw that play out in Q3. And so the revisions that have been happening the last few months have been improving with respect to auto builds. And so we're cautiously optimistic that we keep pace there. And the improvement that we've been seeing, more importantly, has been in the US and North America markets, which is where our outside exposure is versus China.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nSo we'll remain optimistic on the automotive piece. And then the EV piece that we've talked about too continues to perform really well. So we've got share gains realized and more opportunities coming in the pipeline with ongoing opportunities with the EV battery space.\n\nRachel Lee\n\nAnalyst, Citigroup\n\nThanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHey. Good morning and congrats as well. Just curious. I think the case to change the GICS code is pretty straightforward, but if it doesn't change and stays in chemicals, why do you think that is? And then if you are stuck with us, who do you think would be good comps relative to your performance for investors to look at? Is it more like an Ecolab, Linde, or Sherwin-Williams? Just curious if that sort of scenario unfolds. Yeah.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.",
    "content2": "So I would say it's not a straightforward process. One might think that it should be, but it's clearly not in terms of having the classification change. So as I mentioned earlier, we will continue down that path. At the end of the day, our performance will drive our valuation, and that's what we're focused on. So as an organization, nothing will change in terms of our strategy, how we're expected to perform, and what we would do. Relative to peers, quite honestly, none of the chemical peers would be our peers that we should be compared to. I mean, we just have very different portfolios. So there is no comparison to the others that are listed within specialty chemicals.\nWe will continue to say for no matter who's following us and reporting on us that at the end of the day, you really got to look at the multi-industrial peers to kind of compare our performance.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Thanks for taking my question. You commented on maybe some details on your healthcare portfolio. Could you also comment on the water side? You guys recently completed that acquisition in China. What else are you guys looking at? And I guess, how are you prioritizing capital allocation towards this business? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nYeah. So on the water space, we'll look to see if we can be opportunistic to add to our water filtration capabilities.\nBut as I mentioned, they might be a little bit more minimal because of the consolidation that exists in the space as well as our market leadership that we have across the core technology. So we'll look more broadly into potentially systems plays or some services plays. I had mentioned that steering probably would be off the table just given the high valuations that come along with those assets. And we'll continue to be prudent to ensure that we can get a return that's in line with our expectations. But I think that the pipeline is rich on both sides to healthcare and water. We'll differentially invest in those businesses both from an R&D and a capital perspective to ensure that we're getting outsized returns and we'll bias our M&A activity towards those businesses as well.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time.\n\nRachel Smith\n\nAnalyst\n\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back to Angie and Christopher for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Great. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes today's call. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect your lines."

My name is Chris, and I will be your conference operator for today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Q2 2025 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. We kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star one on your telephone keypad. If you wish to withdraw your question, you may also press star one again. Thank you for that. I would now like to turn the conference over to [VP for Investor Relations] Ann Giancristoforo. You may begin.\n\nAnn Giancristoforo\n\nVP for Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q2 2025 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen [Executive Chairman]; Lori Koch [Chief Executive Officer]; Jon Kemp, current [Electronics & Industrial President and CEO Elect of the future Electronics Co]; and Antonella Franzen, (Chief Financial Officer). We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nOur Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and has been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will begin on slide three.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thanks everyone for joining our Q2 call. Earlier today, we reported another solid quarter ahead of our previously communicated guidance. Q2 sales of $3.3 billion grew 2% on an organic basis. Operating EBITDA of $859 million increased 8% year over year, resulting in operating EBITDA margin of 26.4%, an increase of 120 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted EPS of $1.12 was up 15% year-over-year. As a result of our strong Q2 financial performance, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance. Antonella will provide further details shortly. Q2 saw continued strength in electronics driven by AI technology demand in both interconnect solutions and semi, and strong volume growth in healthcare and water. This momentum is continuing into the 3Q with order patterns remaining strong through July. Weakness in construction continued to impact our diversified industrial business during the quarter.\nI also wanted to highlight that yesterday, jointly with Chemours and Corteva, we announced a settlement with the state of New Jersey to comprehensively resolve all current and future environmental claims, including PFAS, across the four current and former operating sites and statewide for PFAS claims. The settlement will be payable over a 25-year period, and our portion of the total settlement is $177 million on an NPV basis. Importantly, this settlement also includes AFFF, which was less than 1% of the total settlement amount. The settlement is subject to final court approval. Regarding our separation milestones, progress on the intended spinoff of Qnity Electronics continues and we remain on track for a 1 November separation date.\nIn June, we completed the composition of the Qnity board, adding two new members that bring a depth of experience and knowledge of the semiconductor sector that complements the existing diverse set of skills. The Qnity board will be comprised of 10 members, including Jon Kemp. We filed a First Amendment to the Form 10 registration statement with the SEC in June, which included additional pro forma financial information. This will continue to be an iterative process with the SEC as we progress towards separation. Turning to slide four, we are pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day on 18 September for DuPont and Qnity focused on introducing both portfolios and their respective strategies for driving value creation.\nI continue to be excited about what lies ahead for both future independent companies and the investment potential for each, for the new DuPont as a leading advanced solutions provider and Qnity as a pure-play technology solutions leader within the semiconductor value chain. As we look forward to the new DuPont, we've assembled a highly experienced senior leadership team consisting of a healthy mix between in-house and external talent who bring great experience in driving growth and margin expansion. To highlight a few of our new leaders, Jeroen Bloemhard currently leads our healthcare and water technologies business. Jeroen has both internal and external experience in complex global markets with a strong focus on commercial excellence as well as a growth mindset. Beth Ferreira recently joined our team to lead our diversified industrials business.\nBeth brings deep experience and global perspective in the industrial space with key roles at ITW and IMI, where she successfully led transformation efforts, drove operational efficiencies, and fostered a customer-centric culture. David Koch just recently joined us from Danaher and will be our Chief Operations and Engineering Officer. Dave brings extensive knowledge and operational excellence with a proven track record of driving performance improvement and implementing business systems. The new DuPont will have a more focused portfolio highlighted by high-growth healthcare and water end markets. With a continued emphasis on innovation and customer relationships, we are well-positioned to accelerate growth through a more agile and focused organization. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jon.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. As we approach our 1 November spinoff, Qnity is poised to emerge as a premier pure-play technology solutions partner to the semiconductor value chain. With a leading portfolio, a focused business model, and global and local scale I could not be more excited about Qnity's future. Established with decades of innovation, quality, consistency, and technical know-how, we are a trusted partner to the world's leading semiconductor customers and electronics industry OEMs.\nOur broad and uniquely positioned portfolio brings end-to-end solutions and competitive advantages that span the entire electronics value chain, enabling AI applications as well as high-performance computing and advanced connectivity. Qnity is well-positioned for growth, powered by a large and expanding addressable market and multiple industry tailwinds. I am equally excited about our upcoming Investor Day. At that event, I will share more about our portfolio and strategy, unique competitive advantages, and innovation engine to drive long-term growth. I will now turn the call over to Antonella to cover the financials and outlook.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with another quarter of organic growth and margin improvement as continued volume growth across many key end markets and operational focus by our teams drove strong financial performance in the quarter including solid cash conversions. Beginning with Q2 financial highlights on slide five. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 3% versus the year-ago period on 2% organic sales growth. Organic sales growth consisted of a 4% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decline in price. Currency was a 1% benefit in the quarter. From a segment view, both segments saw organic sales growth with Electronics Co and Industrials Co up 6% and 1%, respectively. Organic growth during the quarter was led by high single-digit growth in Interconnect Solutions and Healthcare and Water Technologies along with mid-single-digit strength in semi.\nFrom a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 4% organic sales growth year-over-year. Organic sales were up 2% in Europe and 1% in North America. Q2 Operating EBITDA of $859 million increased 8% versus the year-ago period as organic growth and productivity benefits were partially offset by growth investments. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 26.4% increased 120 basis points year-over-year. Turning to free cash flow, we delivered transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $433 million and related conversion of 93% in the quarter. This was in line with our expected acceleration. Turning to slide six, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.12 per share increased 15% from $0.97 in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.11 drove the year-over-year increase, along with a lower tax rate which resulted in a 4% benefit. Turning to segment results, beginning with Electronics Co on slide seven.\nQ2 net sales of $1.2 billion increased 6% versus the year-ago period on both a reported and organic basis due to an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. Currency was about flat during the quarter. At the line of business level, organic sales for Semiconductor technologies were up mid-single digits on continued strong end market demand driven by advanced nodes and AI technology applications. Semi demand was better than expected, driven by timing shifts of about $15 million from Q3 into Q2 primarily in China. Interconnect Solutions also posted another strong quarter with organic sales up high single digits, reflecting continued demand from AI-driven technology ramps and benefits from content and share gains across advanced packaging and thermal management solutions.\nOperating EBITDA for Electronics Co of $373 million was up 14% versus the year-ago period as organic growth and lower legal costs were partially offset by growth investments to support advanced node transitions and AI technology ramps. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 31.9%, up 220 basis points versus the year-ago period. Turning to slide eight, Industrials Co's Q2 net sales of $2.1 billion were up 1% versus the year-ago period on both a reported and organic basis as 2% volume growth was partially offset by a 1% decline in price. Currency was about flat during the quarter. For the Q2, healthcare and water sales were up high single digits on an organic basis versus the year-ago period, with strong growth in both businesses. Diversified industrial sales were down low single digits on an organic basis due primarily to softness in construction markets.\nOperating EBITDA for industrials co during the quarter of $509 million was up 3% versus the year-ago period on organic growth and productivity gains. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 24.4% up 50 basis points from the year-ago period. Turning to slide nine, which outlines our latest view on 2025 financial guidance. From a top-line perspective, the midpoint of our full-year total company net sales guidance of $12.85 billion remains unchanged as currency benefits are offset by volume softness, primarily due to a delayed recovery in construction end markets. We are raising the midpoint of our full-year operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS guidance to $3.36 billion and $4.40 per share, respectively, driven by our stronger Q2 performance, which more than offsets the net impact of tariffs now incorporated into the outlook.\nThe net tariff impact assumed in the second half of 2025 is currently estimated as a $20 million headwind or $0.04 per share, equally split between the Q3 and Q4. Our updated guidance assumes no earnings benefit related to currency fluctuations versus the prior guide, given our geographic cost base. For the Q3, we estimate net sales of about $3.32 billion, Operating EBITDA of about $875 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.15 per share, which includes a $0.02 headwind related to tariffs and a $0.05 year-over-year headwind related to tax. Our Q3 guidance assumes about 3% organic sales growth versus the prior year, led by continued growth in healthcare, water, and electronics end markets, partially offset by continued weakness in construction end markets. Overall, another solid quarter and strong first half of the year.\nI want to thank our employees for delivering these results and for their ongoing support of the separation process. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, ladies and gentlemen, we'll take our first question from Scott Davis of Melius Research.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everyone, Lori and Antonella.\nGood morning. [crosstalk]\nI just wanted to drill in a little bit on industrials because in three months it's going to be a standalone. The 1% price, would I assume that's mostly just due to the Tyvek weakness and some price you have to kind of give up in that business when material costs are down?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, morning, Scott. No, it's more related to the price that we took through the inflationary period and having to give back a little bit as the raw material environment resolved. So it really was more in the diversified industrial space. There really wasn't anything in that Tyvek or healthcare space. So we look to reduce that price headwind as we go through this year, just as we lap some of the concessions that started in 2024.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. And will there be an effort to capture price to offset the tariff impacts then as well, Lori?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWe do have some, but the majority of the reductions is related to supply chain moves. We're able to move product around to avoid the tariffs. There is a little bit of surcharges that we put in to offset, but the majority of the benefit reducing the gross headwind down to the $20 million net headwind is from supply chain moves.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's it for me. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Best of luck in the spin.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Jeffrey Sprague of Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nMorning, Joseph. [crosstalk]\nHey, good morning. Hey, on the settlement, obviously nice to see that done. Very interesting comment, right, that AFFF was 1% of the settlement amount. You've made a longtime argument, right, that you shouldn't really be embroiled in AFFF to a significant degree. But I just wonder how we should read that across. One could maybe guess that New Jersey was so big and complicated, and there was so much going on that AFFF considerations were really way down the pecking order. But perhaps not. I'd love your thoughts on how to read that 1% across the other outstanding AFFF kind of open issues that you're dealing with.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we were definitely happy to announce the settlement and get another one behind us. And the real important piece for us was that it's paid over a 25-year period. So the cash flows related to the settlement will be material to the overall DuPont cash flows at any period. But to your question, the settlement amount that was related to AFFF is in line with where we said the original water district settlement case would be with about 3% to 7% of the total headwind belonging to DuPont. So if you take our portion that's related to AFFF and compare it to the 3M announcement earlier in New Jersey, it's in that 5% range, so right in the middle of that 3% to 7%. So that was really important for us to get out there to kind of give an indication of where future settlements in states where we didn't have a site could land with respect to the overall landscape.\n\nEdward Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nAnd Jeff, we have one more state where we have a site where we've done significant remediation and we continue to. So at some point, you'll probably see something there. That'll be North Carolina. But every other state is AFFF and should fall, as Lori said, as this one did in between that 3% to 7%. And then remember, the 3% to 7% were 1/3 of the 3% to 7% at DuPont. And one of the other things we liked about this, what Lori mentioned, it was over 25 years. So I think there's opportunities to structure things like that for the others.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nYeah, that's great to hear. Then just back to the brighter side of industrial coat, just looking at healthcare and water, were they up collectively high single digits or both individually were up high single digits? But really, my real question is just I would assume we're kind of through the inventory liquidations that have been weighing on those end markets. But can you give some color on that? Have we recoupled the end demand? Anything else going on in the channel there? And just how you see the back half playing out in those businesses?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, no, they were both up nicely. So healthcare was a little bit ahead of water with respect to growth, but both up nicely. And as you had mentioned, they're decoupling from the lapping of the DSOC that happened in both RO, on the water side, and then in medical packaging, on the Tyvek side. So really starting to get to a nice position. As we look to the back half of the year, we'll continue to expect outsized growth versus the rest of the portfolio in healthcare and water.\nReally, a lot of opportunities on the water side, just given the secular trends around access to clean water and desalination. And on the healthcare side, just with the aging population. And we've also been pretty clear that we'll look to add to those pieces of the portfolio as we go forward from an M&A perspective. So really starting to try to bolster that piece today. It's about 40% of the portfolio. We'll look to increase that as we can advance some of our M&A activities.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nWe've had some people play in healthcare mentioned uncertainty about Medicaid, Medicare reimbursements, and the like. You're not seeing any of that sort of pressure in your business?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Steve Tusa of (JPMorgan).\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMorning, Steve. [crosstalk]\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nJust on the electronics trends that are going on out there, there's just a lot of mixed messages. How do you see this cycle in totality? Are you guys at kind of like a normalized run rate of growth? Are we still at a bottom in some of the consumer markets and therefore things can accelerate? What is the, do you think, the broad messaging on the electronic side?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve. Great question. I know there's been a lot of discussion already over the last couple of weeks as lots of industry players have reported already. What I would say is that we continue to be in a fairly mixed environment. Really, all of the growth so far for the last several quarters is really coming from AI-driven applications across advanced nodes, advanced packaging, and data center. Most of the rest of the electronics economy kind of remains relatively weak. I think we're starting to see the green shoots of stabilization and recovery on the lagging edge parts of the market. We expect kind of slow improvement as we move through the back half of the year for the more industrial-focused lagging edge semiconductor nodes.\nAnd then we still have a relatively weak consumer environment where consumer devices are expected to be up kind of low single digit. So we're really happy with the growth that we've seen in the position of our portfolio with advanced technologies, data centers, and advanced packaging. But as we go forward and we start to see broader recovery, I think there's plenty of opportunity to see continued improvement.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAnd then just one follow-up to that. I guess there was some news around some changes in the way that they're assembling and manufacturing some of these chips with, I guess, direct to the board type of process. I'm certainly not an expert on this. I'm not sure if you guys have heard about that or looked at it, and what that would mean for kind of your content in general on some of these new chips if they change that process.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah, Steve, look, I think that those types we've said for a long time that we see convergence across the technology roadmaps between the chip fabrication and the semi roadmaps as well as the printed circuit board roadmaps. And that kind of converges mostly in the advanced packaging space. But because we have a really nice position kind of on both ends of that spectrum, we're able to sit down at the table with our customers and understand their end-to-end manufacturing process, their system integration, and really work with them to solve problems. And to your point, we're seeing an increased number of engagements broadly with all of the industry leaders to help solve those challenges across both sides of our portfolio.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot. Good luck.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Chris Parkinson of (Wolfe Research).\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you. Jon, if I could just ask that question slightly differently. When I take a step back and I look at the environment heading into 2026, I think most people are aware of kind of the node transitions. But when you think about your portfolio and where you stand and what you're seeing in terms of second-half growth rates and where you think you could ultimately be, could you just quickly comment on what you're seeing across semi-advanced packaging and ICS in terms of data center, HPC, and hyperscalers? It seems like there's some divergent growth rates, but things should ultimately be moving in the right direction over the next 12 months. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. Thank you.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah, Chris, thanks for the question. I think you're absolutely right. The hyperscalers, for the most part, seem to continue to be very robust in their investments and continuing to put in capacity. And we see ongoing node migrations to support those investments from our customers. We're really excited as we get into the second half of the year on the node migrations, particularly at N2, as well as some of the HBM, whether that's 3E or 4 on the DRAM side. We're really well positioned with content gains on both N2 and on the HBM side. So we see that as a net positive as those more advanced nodes start to scale.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd then to the comment I made earlier, as we start to see a broader market recovery both in the more industrial parts of the market and the consumer parts of the market, as we start to see some of those refresh cycles tick up, obviously, that will be a nice plug as well and as it gets into more of 2026, stay tuned for that. As we mentioned, we'll be doing Investor Day in mid-September and we'll provide a lot more color on the trends that we're seeing kind of in the second half of the year and heading into next year.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you for the extra detail.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have John McNulty of (BMO Capital Markets)\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. Wanted to dig into healthcare and water a little bit more. The high single-digit growth certainly looks like it did better than what we saw from most in water and actually most in healthcare as well. I guess, can you speak to the drivers that you're seeing there? Which of them are kind of industry or end market-driven, and which ones are maybe some of your own initiatives that may be helping to accelerate the growth? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, thanks. So a little bit was the recovery. So this was probably the last quarter that we would see the outsized number because of the lapping of the DSOC last year on the RO side, on the medical packaging side, and then also on the Liveo side. So on the biopharma side, we're seeing nice growth there. But underlying, it really just goes back to the mega trends, and we're really well positioned to take advantage of those. So we've got really great customer relationships. We're leading positions in really all the end markets that we compete in. We've done a really nice job on the water side to really shore up our position in China. So we had mentioned that last year we saw a bit of a DSOC, especially within the distributor channels that led to negative growth in 2024.\nWe quickly corrected that and got us back on track to see really nice share regain within China on the RO side. So it's really just being well positioned in a nicely growing market and as I had mentioned, we'll continue to try to add to that portfolio so that we can continue to drive outsized growth for the new DuPont.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks for the color on that. And then, maybe just the second question: just look, splitting up a company has a lot of things to do, as I'm sure you're all seeing. I guess, where does M&A and building up a list of assets for potential acquisition and a team to evaluate them, where does that fit kind of in your to-do list? And how should we be thinking about that, and how are the boards thinking about that when the assets actually do split come November?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So obviously, the first priority for us is getting Qnity separated. So we're well on track with that separation. We'll have the go-live internally on 1 October, and then obviously the formal separation on 1 November. But our strategy organization and a lot of my time and Antonella's time is spent looking at making sure we've got the right pipeline from an M&A perspective to be proactive when we have the opportunity. So we spend a lot of time discussing this with the board around where the key components are. There's a lot of fragmentation left within the healthcare space that we'll look to continue to take advantage of. Obviously, we completed Spectrum and Donatelle the past couple of years that really gave us nice positions in the med device space, and we'll look to add on there. And the same in water.\nSo making the decision earlier this year to keep water in the portfolio was the right one, and we'll continue to add to it. So it's a key focus of our strategy team. They're not really involved in the separation work that goes on. So they can obviously dedicate their full time to looking and scouting out new opportunities for us.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThanks very much for the color.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. So next up, we have David Begleiter of (Deutsche Bank)\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning. Jon, just an interconnect solution, sorry. Organic sales growth did slow versus Q1, or the rate of growth did slow. Can you talk to why that occurred?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah. I think it's really just the year-over-year comp. So Q1 2024, we were still kind of in the midst. The recovery hadn't really started yet. And so Q1 2024 was a pretty easy comp. And we started to see acceleration in growth and the recovery, especially on the AI and advanced packaging side, really starting in Q2 and then continuing through H2 2024. So the ICS has now posted several really strong quarters on the back of some great wins and share gains in both advanced packaging and data centers. And we expect that momentum to continue into H2 of the year.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nPerfect. Lori, in the PFAS news yesterday, you're agreeing to buy rights to insurance proceeds from Chemours. Can you discuss why you're doing that and what that means for potential future support from DuPont to Chemours? Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So together with Corteva, we did that to ensure that Chemours had the ample liquidity to be able to make the payments over the next five years. And I think they were making statements that it covered them through 2030. So they should be in a really nice position to be able to make those payments as they come due. And I think reiterating what we had said earlier, just the 25-year payment schedule was really key to that announcement and sets a precedent, hopefully, for future announcements. So that was really the reason behind it. We obviously have the MoU broadly governing the payments between the three parties, and I think it's been working really well for us.\n\nEdward Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYeah. We're also highly confident we're going to recover the insurance money. It's not a freebie. We'll get paid back on that.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Josh Spector of (UBS).\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question for Jon about the mix in electronics. I think one of the learnings from us from the Form 10 filings was the greater share of China exposure within Qnity. It's about 34%, almost double where some of the peers are. I think some of the commentary in the industry is higher exposure to leading-edge nodes, which helps drive above-average growth. Can you just square that view versus higher exposure in China and why that is, I guess, good exposure in your opinion? Thanks.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. So when you look about China for the entity, last year, and I think this is what's in the Form 10, we had about $1.4 billion. It's just over 30%. It's about 1/3 of our total sales. When you look at that, more than half of that is really coming from the ICS part of the portfolio and the PCB and assembly. And that's just a function of where that part of the market is. And the preponderance of printed circuit board and assembly manufacturing in the world is taking place in China. And so it's somewhat natural that our position with the technology leaders in that space would give us some outside sales in China and then on the semi side, it's about nominally, it's about $650 million. A part of that is going to multinational companies who are manufacturing in China.\nAnd then we've seen the startup of a lot of new fabs in China over the last couple of years. And we're well positioned in the startup environment because of the quality and the reputation of our materials. So that's what's fueled a lot of the growth that we've seen specifically in China. As we look forward, we've said over the last couple of quarters, we've said we expect a normalization of growth in China. I would expect that to come down to be kind of if you take kind of 2024 and the acceleration out, typically, we would expect to be about 30% of sales in China. And I think that's kind of where we'll normalize too. That's pretty consistent with others in the industry. And I think China is a large and growing market in electronics, and we're well positioned to win in China.\nParticularly in, like I said, in some of the circuit board and assembly technologies, where we've got local teams on the ground there, and we're doing a lot of local-for-local type strategies. As supply chains shift based on kind of geopolitical or other requirements, we've got a really good global position, and we'll shift with our customers as those supply chains evolve over time.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. That's very helpful. I wanted to ask separately just if you can comment at all on if there is a process on Aramid's divestments. If so, I guess how you're thinking about in the context of an investor day in a month and a half, is there a goal to maybe have a firm view of if that's in or not the portfolio before that happens to make an easier communication story for you on the remaining core of DuPont, or is this just ongoing and we'll see where it ends up?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Thanks. I mean, no comment. Our focus right now, obviously, as mentioned, is getting Qnity out the door on 1 November. So no comment on the Aramid's speculation. We have been pretty clear, though, that we'll look to shift the focus of the portfolio towards the healthcare and the water, and that we had incremental portfolio work that we would probably be doing for new DuPont. So I'll kind of leave it at that. So no incremental comments to the news out there.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up, we have John Roberts of (Mizuho)\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThanks. Let me ask this maybe a different way. The agreement with Chemours and Corteva has a minimum EBITDA requirement. So if you do decide to further focus remains code, how much EBITDA could you divest without going below the minimum requirement, or does the lower leverage that you're going to have remains code signal that you're going to do acquisitions first that might give you some headroom for that minimum EBITDA requirement?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we'll reset the minimum EBITDA between Chemours and new DuPont at separation, and that'll kind of set the new minimum floor for each of those entities. So there will be a cushion in each side if there wanted to be incremental divestments to be able to morph the portfolio. So there is room there at the outset. Obviously, the intent, I think, on both organizations, if there were divestments, would be to redeploy the proceeds in M&A to continue to grow so that you don't run into problems with the Corteva side of their agreement. But there will be some cushion at the outset. So today [crosstalk] our combined EBITDA is over, so each of them will have an over.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research\n\nThank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Aleksey, your line is now open. Perhaps you have us on mute, Aleksey.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nI think we can just move to the next question.\n\nOperator\n\nWill do. Patrick Cunningham of (Citi)\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nHi. Good morning, everyone.\nMorning. [crosstalk]\nYou had pretty robust margin performance in industrials and posting pretty strong incremental margins despite price down. Can you help us think about the margin progression for the second half, given you've lapped the bulk of destocking and maybe have some additional mixed normalization there?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYes. We have had very strong margin performance, and I would say better margin performance than we initially anticipated at the beginning of the year. And quite honestly, when you look at our updated guidance and you kind of take a look at where we're at, I would say on an overall basis, although we expect about 70 basis points of margin expansion from an underlying basis. So when you kind of put to the side the impact of tariffs and the impact of FX, it's actually more of 100 basis points of margin expansion.\nSo we're definitely doing better than we had originally anticipated. And to your point, focusing on industrials co explicitly, although our organic growth has been relatively low, the team is very focused on productivity, which is clearly helping drive the incremental margins. Particularly in Q2, I would say very strong incrementals in that 70% range, and we'll continue to post nice margins on the industrial side.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just to follow up on Industrials Co. on pricing, just to clarify, we should expect less of a drag from price in the second half and now that this will be a standalone business, how should we think about pricing across sub-businesses in a more normalized environment?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So as Lori mentioned earlier, so one, yes, we will continue to see pricing be less of a component of that in terms of price going down. As Lori mentioned earlier, where we have been seeing some of the pricing is on the diversified industrial side. Because when you take a look back at the last couple of years, we had some really strong pricing that clearly more than offset the impact of some of the increased costs that we had. So we always take a look at the trade-off between volume and price and you always got to look at each business individually when you're doing that from a line of business level, and what's most important at the end is that we continue to grow the business from an organic perspective and continue to have healthy margins.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Next up, we have Michael Sison of (Wells Fargo).\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey. Good morning. Just for industrial co, volumes and EBITDA performance this year has been much more stable than my traditional chemical coverage. Anything else to point out to folks as you look to maybe shift that SIC code to industrials or manufacturing versus chemicals that you might highlight as your Analyst Day, but just give us maybe a preview of the case there given the results this year?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I think when you kind of take a look at our portfolio, it's pretty clear that Industrials Co is an industrial company and not a chemical company. I think that kind of shows through clearly within our performance. So when you take a look at kind of the composition of Industrials Co and 40% of it being in healthcare and water, and then even when you look at the diversified side, although there are a couple of different components within that piece of the portfolio, it's clearly much more akin to an industrial portfolio. And I think that that's very clear. We are continuing to progress down the path relative to the GICS code. It will be looked at, and we'll see ultimately where we land. But I think that there's no question that we're an industrials company.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nClient Service Associate, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. And a quick follow-up for Electronics Co. Can you remind us kind of where we're at in terms of how much the portfolio is in Advanced nodes and how much AI will continue to drive the growth there down the road?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah. Michael, so for advanced nodes, we have about 35% of our semiconductor exposure is in advanced nodes, which compares to about kind of 20% of the total industry. So nice outsized outperformance there, which is kind of contributing to us growing better than the market. On the AI side, what we've said before is AI high-performance computing and data center is about 15% of our portfolio, and it's growing nicely. In Q2, for example, we saw growth rates above 20% in that AI data center space. So really pleased by the performance there.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nClient Service Associate, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up, we have Frank Mitsch of (Fermium Research)\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nYes. Hi. Good morning. So the Chinese investigation into Tyvek was dismissed. I was curious if you have any further dialogue with the Chinese, and are there any other investigations that they may or may not be undertaking?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo. No. So we were happy to see it suspended and closed. So it was when it first came out, news that we quickly said was related to Tyvek and Tyvek only and now it's been suspended. So we were happy with that conclusion.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nAll right. Terrific. And then the adjustment downward of the tariff impact from $60 million to $20 million. Can you provide any more context on the $20 million, and could that, obviously, things are changing on a daily basis, but any context you can provide around the expectations for the $20 million?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So to your point, it does tend to change on a day-to-day basis. But based upon where we're at, I would tell you that what we included in our guidance is based on the 90-day pause that went into effect in May, and we are assuming that that kind of holds through the remainder of the year. There have been a couple of other changes, particularly related to tariffs on the EU and India, that we've put into our number. I think the latest news that potentially came out Sunday night into Monday is not necessarily included in the $20 million. We continue to watch it closely, as do all other companies, and continue to work our mitigating actions as we move forward.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nNext up, we have Vincent Andrews of (Morgan Stanley)\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. And good morning. Just wanted to revisit Electronics Co and the margins and maybe some thoughts into Q3 on the margins. You had volume up 8%. It sounds like that had some favorable mix to it as well. But price was down too, and you still got EBITDA margins up 220 basis points, which is obviously a robust increase. There was also a callout of lower legal costs. So could you just help us understand which parts of that are sustainable into where the margin in Q3 should be and how you're able to offset that negative price? Thank you.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nCEO Elect and President of Electronic and Business, DuPont\n\nYeah. Thanks. Thanks, Mitch. Now, the price decline that we saw. It's really more of a mix issue with the strong growth that we had in ICS. ICS typically has a slightly lower margin than our semi business. So as the ICS business, as a percentage of the sales, is a little bit higher, it brings the margin down just a little bit, but not too much. Still pretty healthy levels. As it relates to the overall margin potential, very similar to what Antonella commented on earlier, the teams continue to do a really nice job of balancing the volume and price equation and then driving underlying productivity.\nObviously, as we get more volume, we do see nice incrementals as we put more volume through the plant sites, and then the teams continue to drive additional productivity on top of that, giving us opportunity to continue to invest in our technology roadmaps to really sustain and fuel the organic growth of the business. So I feel good about kind of where margins are at, and I think they're in a quite healthy place for us as we look to the second half of the year.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you, and Antonella, if I could ask you on sundry expense, there's been a pretty big swing in it year to date of about $137 million. How much of that is stuff that sort of was one-time items and was excluded versus stuff that is actually in the numbers? And where do you think that they'll wind up being for the full year? Does it just sort itself out through the course of the year? And is there some way we can tease it out of the guidance that's on, I think it's slide 14 that you have the below-the-line stuff?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So when you look at our sundry expense, one of the big things in there is the mark-to-market on the swap. So that's really what's driving the number within that line item, and that is excluded from our underlying results that we report.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. And with that, our final question for today will come from Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAdam\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHi. This is Adam on for Arun. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on a great quarter. You guys have already spoken at length about the reasons for the cancellation of the water spin previously, but looking past the Qnity spin in November, are you looking at the water business as core to the new DuPont, or do you think you could potentially revisit that in the future?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo. Thanks for the question. Yeah. We definitely see it as core to the new DuPont. So the decision to keep and shore up the growth portfolio in the new DuPont was the right one. So we've got roundly 40% of our revenue today in healthcare and water, and we'll look to add to that to bolster it and get it increased in the future. So no intent to do anything but grow and invest in the business.\n\nAdam\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for that and if I could slip in one more, just to dig a little bit more into the tariff comments. You mentioned that you're taking a lot of mitigating factors. Is that mostly from moving volumes around your network, changes in procurement? I think you also mentioned local-for-local strategy, or is it a combination of all that? Any additional color on that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So I would say about more than 90% of it is really related to supply chain movements. And then, as Lori mentioned earlier, there is a small piece related to surcharges.\n\nAdam\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWith that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our Q&A session. I'll turn things back over to Ann for concluding remarks.\n\nAnn Giancristoforo\n\nVP for Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGreat. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted to DuPont's website. This officially concludes today's call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your call. You may now disconnect your lines. Thank you again for joining us today.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Ed Barna, Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nEdward Barna\n\nInvestor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q4 2025 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Executive Chairman, Lori Koch, Chief Executive Officer, Jon Kemp, current Electronics Business President and CEO-elect of the future independent electronics company, and Antonella Franzen, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials, and has been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will begin on slide 3.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thanks, everyone, for joining our call. Earlier today, we reported solid Q4 results ahead of our previously communicated guidance. Q4 sales grew 6% on an organic basis on strong volume growth. Operating EBITDA of $788 million increased 16% year-over-year, demonstrating strong leverage in the quarter. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.7% increased 240 basis points from prior year, and adjusted EPS of $1.03 was up 30%. From an end-market view, we saw continued broad-based demand in electronics driven by strength in semi-advanced nodes and AI applications, and strong volume growth in our healthcare and water businesses. We continued to see strong order patterns through April, consistent with our expectations. Regarding our strategic priorities, I am pleased with the continued progress that our teams are making on the intended spinoff of our electronics business, which was announced this week as Qunity.\nIn addition to the naming, we recently achieved several key milestones, which enables us to remain on track for our November 1 separation date. First, we completed key executive leadership appointments. Jon Kemp, current DuPont Electronics Business President, was named as CEO-elect. Jon is well-positioned to lead the future independent company, given his proven leadership and extensive experience in the semi space and broader electronics industry. We are pleased to have Jon on the call with us this morning. Matt Harbaugh was named as CFO-elect. Matt has an impressive track record as a public company CFO, along with deep experience in spinoff transactions, and will serve as a valuable business partner to Jon. Next, we've made significant progress on the composition of the Qunity board. Three existing DuPont directors, as well as four external members, will join Jon on the new board.\nThis is a group of highly accomplished leaders with global business experience, diverse industry expertise, and varying key competencies. Finally, last week, we submitted the initial filing of the Form 10 registration statement with the SEC. This document contains detailed business and financial information related to the future standalone company, as well as information related to the separation. Turning to slide 4, which details how we are addressing tariff uncertainty. We are a global organization with presence in all key regions, including a significant manufacturing footprint in the U.S. and Asia. Our scale provides ample flexibility to adjust production and product flow, enabling us to mitigate trade risks. Additionally, from a sourcing perspective, the vast majority of our raw material buy is purchased in the region it is consumed and is not subject to the new tariffs.\nOur teams have been carefully analyzing ongoing global supply chain dynamics, engaging with our customer and supplier base, and actively working on a number of tariff mitigation actions, including production shifts, sourcing alternatives, surcharges, and product exemptions. Based on tariffs in place today, our estimated cost exposure in 2025 before mitigation actions is about $500 million on an annualized basis. We have identified actions to substantially offset this potential headwind, with the net cost impact in 2025 currently estimated at about $60 million, which primarily would impact the second half. We continue to evaluate additional measures in order to further minimize the potential impacts. Overall, we have a solid game plan to continue to consistently deliver results, and we are executing well in advancing our strategic priorities. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jon, who will begin on slide five.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I am honored to be here today as CEO-elect of the future independent electronics company, which we've named Qunity. The name is inspired by Q, the symbol for electrical charge and unity, reflecting the collaborative way we work with our customers. Qunity will be one of the largest pure-play electronics materials and solutions providers in the industry, with $4.3 billion in net sales in 2024. We have a broad portfolio and customer relationships founded on a heritage that spans more than 50 years. As the partner of choice for our customers, we have a seat at the design table working to advance their technology roadmaps, enabling the next generation of advanced computing and connectivity applications. As a global technology leader, we offer a diverse portfolio serving the entire electronics value chain, from chip fabrication and advanced packaging to advanced interconnects, assembly, and displays.\nWe bring material science expertise and end-to-end engineering solutions across the full breadth of our portfolio to deliver world-class innovation to our customers. Qunity is well-positioned to benefit from robust growth in semiconductor markets while leveraging a strong financial profile. With about 60% of net sales in semiconductors, the company will compete with a set of recognized global semi participants, and we expect to attract an investor base commensurate with this profile. We have long-term relationships with all key semiconductor and other electronics OEMs in the industry and a strong history of co-development and application engineering to ensure customer success. In addition, the business is well-equipped to continue to participate in the AI-driven growth acceleration via our advanced node semi products and advanced packaging applications for use in data centers and personal devices. We further enable key AI applications with high-density interconnect products and layered thermal management solutions.\nWe believe these leading positions will continue to drive industry outperformance for the future electronics company. As Lori previously mentioned, we continue to make very good progress on the separation, and I look forward to working more closely with our future board. I will now turn the call over to Antonella to cover the financials and outlook.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Jon, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased with the solid start to the year, as increased volumes across many key end markets and continued operational focus by our teams drove strong financial performance in Q4. I would also like to remind you that we realigned our segment reporting structure during the quarter, given the upcoming separation, with segment results now reported as Electronics Co and Industrials Co. Beginning with Q4 financial highlights on slide 6. Net sales of $3.1 billion increased 5% versus the year-ago period, as 6% organic sales growth was slightly offset by a currency headwind of 1%. Organic sales growth consisted of an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. From a segment view, both segments saw organic sales growth, with Electronics Co and Industrials Co up 14% and 2%, respectively.\nVolume gains during the quarter were led by double-digit growth in our businesses serving electronics, healthcare, and water end markets. From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific delivered 13% organic sales growth year-over-year, including another strong quarter of growth in China, where organic sales were up about 20%, driven by electronics and water. Organic sales were up 4% in Europe and flat in North America, given the soft construction and auto markets. Q4 operating EBITDA of $788 million increased 16% versus the year-ago period, as volume gains and savings from prior year restructuring actions were partially offset by growth investments. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 25.7% increased 240 basis points year-over-year.\nOn a continuing operations basis, operating cash flow for the quarter of $382 million, CapEx of $249 million, and $79 million of separation-related transaction cost payments resulted in transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $212 million and related conversion of 49%. As a reminder, Q4 cash flow is inclusive of our annual variable compensation payout. We expect cash flow conversion to accelerate as we move through the year, with full-year conversion of greater than 90%. Turning to slide 7, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.03 per share increased 30% from $0.79 in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.19, as well as below-the-line benefits totaling $0.05, drove the year-over-year increase. Turning to segment results, beginning with Electronics Co on slide 8.\nElectronics Co's Q4 net sales of $1.1 billion increased 14% versus the year-ago period on both a reported and organic basis due to a 16% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. Currency was flat during the quarter. At the line-of-business level, organic sales for semiconductor technologies were up low double digits on strong end-market demand, driven by advanced nodes and AI technology applications. Semi demand in China continued to be strong, with better-than-expected growth driven by timing shifts from Q2 into Q4. Interconnect Solutions also posted another strong quarter, with organic sales of high teens, reflecting broad-based demand, volume gains from AI-driven technology ramps, and continued benefits from content and share gains across layered laminates and metalization.\nOperating EBITDA for Electronics Co of $373 million was up 26% versus the year-ago period, as volume benefits were partially offset by continued growth investments to support advanced node transitions and AI technology ramps. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 33.4%, up 340 basis points versus the year-ago period. Turning to slide 9, Industrials Co's Q4 net sales of $1.95 billion were flat versus the year-ago period, as a 2% organic sales growth was offset by a 1% currency headwind and a 1% unfavorable portfolio impact. Organic sales growth of 2% reflects a 3% increase in volume, partially offset by a 1% decrease in price. In connection with the Q4 segment realignment, we have organized Industrials Co into two lines of business: healthcare and water technologies, and diversified industrials. Healthcare and water technologies consist of our high-growth businesses of healthcare and water.\nOur healthcare portfolio includes Tyvek medical packaging and garment offerings, Spectrum and Donatelle advanced medical device applications, and Liveo Biopharma processing and solutions. Our water business is a leading technology provider with a comprehensive portfolio of filtration technologies, including reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and ultrafiltration. Water also has strong exposure to secular growth drivers and serves key end markets such as industrial water and energy, municipal and desalination, and life sciences. Diversified industrials is a leading provider of innovative products and solutions supported by well-known brand names serving industrial-based end markets, including construction, advanced mobility, and personal protection. For the Q1, healthcare and water technology sales were up low teens on an organic basis versus the year-ago period, reflecting volume gains in all business lines within healthcare and strength in water led by reverse osmosis.\nDiversified industrial sales were down mid-single digits on an organic basis due primarily to softness in construction and auto end markets. Operating EBITDA for Industrials Co during the quarter of $464 million was up 6% versus the year-ago period due to volume gains and savings from prior year restructuring actions. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 23.8%, up 130 basis points from the year-ago period. Turning to slide 10, which outlines our latest view on 2025 financial guidance. For Q2, we estimate net sales of about $3.2 billion, operating EBITDA of about $815 million, and adjusted EPS of $1.05 per share. These estimates include a seasonal sequential sales lift, although muted from prior expectations, given timing shifts from the Q2 into the Q4 in semi.\nFor the full year 2025, we are maintaining our guidance at our prior outlook, with estimates for net sales of $12.8-$12.9 billion, operating EBITDA of $3.325-$3.375 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.30-$4.40 per share. In addition, as Lori mentioned earlier, for 2025, we currently estimate a net cost impact of tariffs of about $60 million, or about $0.10 per share, mainly related to the second half of the year. Our financial guidance does not include this estimated net cost impact, as we continue to identify further mitigation actions, as well as tariff implementation uncertainty. Overall, I am pleased with a solid start to the year and want to thank our employees for delivering these results and for their ongoing support to the separation process.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, if you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. And if you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star two again. We also ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up only. Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hope everyone's well and busy, I see. Hey, maybe since we have John on the call, could I start there? John, I just wonder if you could just walk us through sort of the exemption process. How many kind of different exemptions do you need or do you have? And most of what you need relative to this guide, is that in hand at this point?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah, Jeff, and good morning. Thanks for the question. When you look at it total, when we think about all of the tariff actions that we're pursuing in terms of supply chain adjustments, sourcing strategies, surcharges, and pricing adjustments and mitigations, the product exemptions, I would say, is probably the smallest of those four categories. Really, the bulk of the tariff savings and mitigation actions that we've done have really been on the procurement and supply chain optimization side of the house. We continue to have very constructive dialogue with both the U.S. and China authorities on the dynamics, particularly in the semiconductor industry. It's a relatively small percentage of our total mitigation strategy, and we continue to have those dialogues with the teams on the ground.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nThanks for that. Then, so on the supply chain optimization side then, does that imply that you're sourcing from Europe now or trying to source from Europe now or somewhere else into China to get around the need for exemptions? Maybe just a little bit more color on what you're actually doing on the supply chain side and sourcing.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah, so when we think about our supply routes into China, actually very little of what we produce in China actually comes from the U.S. It's a very small percentage of the total. Most of what we buy for our products in China are actually sourced from non-U.S., the vast majority of them. And so we're sort of positioned well already, given the extensive footprint across the industry and where we have supplier relationships. And in the handful of places where we do have U.S. source materials, generally we have alternative suppliers that we've been working with our customers to shift to those alternative suppliers that wouldn't have any difficulty with the tariffs. In some cases, those materials are already qualified. In some other cases, there's a little bit of a timing lag to make sure that we can qualify those new materials.\nIn general, we're really well positioned within the electronic space from a sourcing standpoint based on where we're already buying our materials.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Jeff, the total company number for sales that we export from the U.S.. into China is only about $200 million. So the bulk of the gross impact that we size at $500 million on an annual basis is us moving intermediate product into China for final completion and then shipping to the customer. And so that's why we're able to flex our own supply chain internally to be able to mitigate a lot of that impact if not actually shipping finished product into China.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nRight, so those intermediates can come from other places as part of the sourcing changes and optimization then to some degree.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nCorrect. Yes.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Analyst, Vertical Research\n\nOkay. Thank you for that color. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman & CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everyone. And congrats on all this stuff. As Jeff said, you guys have been busy here. Hey, I wanted just to see if you could give us the tariff numbers broken down into the two businesses. Just starting to think about DuPont is completely separate. You've got a few months left. Do you have that data available between Qunity and/or DuPont?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nHey, Scott, it's Antonella Franzen. So just a couple of comments related to that. So when you look at our net exposure for 2025, it's actually split pretty evenly between Electronics Co and Industrials Co. So about $30 million in each is kind of the way to think about it. When you think about our exposure relative to a percent of our COGS, it's actually around 6% for both Electronics Co and Industrials Co. So I get, on a gross basis, again, so pretty evenly split. The one other thing that I would just mention and bring up related to the impact is we talked about the in-year impact being about $60 million.\nThe one thing I do want to make clear, and as Lori mentioned, that's predominantly in the second half of the year. If you kind of start to look into 2026 and assume nothing changes from where we are today, which is a big assumption, I just want to make sure that you don't walk away thinking the 60 becomes 120 next year and that we have an incremental $60 million headwind. As John briefly talked about, we do have additional incremental mitigating actions that we're looking at. Some of it relates to qualifying certain products in different areas. So we have incremental mitigating actions that will come into play towards the end of the year that will help mitigate any further impact that we would have in 2026, assuming there's no changes from where we are right now.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman & CEO, Melius Research\n\nThat's helpful, Antonella. And just to follow up on Jeff's question, that $200 million of intermediate product that's being shipped to China, would there be a long-term plan to try to locate that in China? Is there IP protections? Is that one of the reasons why you're shipping it from here to there? Just trying to get a sense of just the challenge of moving that asset base or whether this is a bit of a kind of permanent structural issue.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so the $200 million was the finished product export sales from the US to China. So when I talked about the intermediates, that's the bulk of the gross exposure of the $500 million that we size. So I know a lot of numbers flying around. So yeah, we believe, as Anse Mellon had mentioned, that we've got continuing actions that we can take either on our own supply chain, or favorable outcomes on the exemptions, or ultimately pricing actions in excess of the surcharges that we're putting in place. So we're not done yet. And ideally, we get to the place where it's really not a net impact for us.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman & CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, but it's not moving your own fixed assets. I guess that was kind of the question.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo. Yeah.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman & CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. All right. Fair enough. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Appreciate it.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nOkay. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nI'm just curious, how much of these sales in China do you think are you spec'd in on with long-term contracts with the OEMs there or whoever is buying and integrating your products and the finished product? What percentage of those sales can they kind of substitute?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nSo Steve, this is John. Good question. So when you think about from an electronics point of view, we've got roughly last year, for example, we had about $1.4 billion of sales into China. I would say almost half of that went to multinational company sales, and almost 100% of those multinational company sales are materials that are spec'd in. There's an additional probably 25% to 30% that go to the semi customers where we have what we would call process of record identified, which means that we're spec'd into their particular technologies. So switching us out immediately for a competitor is not an easy task. It takes time, and there's a lot of cost involved in making that switch.\nSo in general, you put those two numbers together, and we get to a point where north of 70% of our sales into China are really kind of spec'd in materials.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay. Great. And then you don't really have anything that's coming cross-border into the U.S., right? That's not really the issue here anymore when you're shipping to China?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nThat's correct.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a little bit of a shift away from the tariff question. We've been seeing some of the water markets starting to accelerate a bit, but you guys seem like you're definitely at the high end of some of the results that we're seeing. I guess, can you help to unpack that a little bit as to what that demand's really stemming from? If there's any specific end markets or industries that are maybe driving that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so we did have really nice results in water in the quarter, and we expect water to be up kind of mid to high single digits for the year. So a piece of it is the favorable comp from last year. So last year, Q1 was our low point for the water business as we saw the tail end of the destocking specifically within China taking place. But more broadly, the demand is very strong across the main technologies, whether it's RO with all of the desalination requirements as we address the water scarcity issue. Ion exchanges are where we get more diversification from an end market and application perspective. So there's a lot of opportunity, whether it's in microelectronics for purification of water or within food and beverage for purification of water.\nAnd then there's some key nascent technologies that we're following that aren't in our numbers today, but present nice upside for us as we go forward, especially around PFAS cleanup and the DLE, so the direct lithium extraction opportunity for us. So we're really excited to have the water opportunity in the portfolio.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Okay. No, that's helpful color. And then just another question on the electronics co-side. I know in the past you've spoken to some of your AI exposure. You specifically called out the interconnect solution side and some of the AI-driven technology ramps. I guess, can you help us to understand the size of that business in interconnect solutions and some of the applications that you're helping to address there?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah, sure. So I think last time on the last call, we sort of talked about sort of AI and particularly kind of the data center and high-performance computing exposure. And part of that is comprised of the advanced chips that are coming from advanced nodes, whether that's 3-nanometer, 2-nanometer coming out this year, and the high bandwidth memory. And then the rest of it is sort of in advanced packaging and other interconnect technologies. So data center for us is about 15% of our portfolio. And I would say in Q1, we had another terrific number. It was actually up mid-teens in the quarter, really with the growth across all of those categories of the advanced chip, the advanced packaging, the layered thermal materials, and EMI shielding materials, and then in particular, some high-performance laminates.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the caller.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Can you hit on very quickly what you're seeing across both SemiTech and ICS and how you're thinking about the China market versus just the non-China market in terms of how things are evolving thus far in Q2 and how that could potentially lead to second-half trends? Thank you so much.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah, Chris, sure. So in China, as we've talked about before, the China growth has really been driven by fairly strong domestic demand in China as well as a bunch of new fab startups that are taking place. If you recall, when you start up a new fab, typically you're running a lot of material because you're starting out with a fairly low yield. Then over time, your yields will gradually come up. So as you start up new fabs, the material consumption is a little bit higher. That benefits us. Then just the underlying demand in China has been strong for several quarters now. As we think about the China demand in semi going forward, we think that normalizes to so it doesn't have kind of the elevated.\nIt normalizes to a more normal demand level, and we are expecting about flat for the full year. On the ICS side, those customers are operating kind of most closer to actual demand. So there's not really pull-forward dynamics that are happening in the ICS markets. It's more real-time production. And that demand continues to be strong both in China and really in the rest of the world, driven from really kind of, I would say, the smartphone PCs build that is happening in China, as well as some of the data centers, and the advanced packaging applications, the OSATs, for example. And then when you go kind of more broadly, the rest of the world, we're expecting high single-digit growth from both semi and ICS for the rest of the year.\nSo even with a flat China, we see demand really being driven by the AI advanced nodes and advanced packaging applications continuing through the year. And that's really what's fueling most of the growth. Advanced logic and DRAM continue to have high utilization rates. And then, as we've talked about before, NAND and mature logic are a little bit slower. So I would say if we see any uptick in mature logic and NAND, that would probably give us some nice upside. And that commentary is pretty consistent with, I think, what you've heard from our customer base in the broader market over the last couple of weeks.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThat's helpful. Actually, you're kind of leading me into my follow-up. When we think about your exposure in packaging and circuit materials, and we think about kind of the intermediate to long-term trends in HPC, can you just talk about your competitive positioning? What are we going to be talking about as we approach 1 November as it relates to 2026, 2027 earnings in terms of that specific business and how it's evolving? Thank you.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nThanks, Chris. So we're excited about our position. We've got a terrific position in both the advanced nodes and the advanced packaging, especially in areas like our CMP business, pads, slurries, and cleans, continues to be a very strong business for us. And as we go forward into 2026 and 2027, one of the exciting opportunities is, you're just starting to see some of those CMP processes that are used today on the front end of the line in the semi world moving into the back end of line into some of the packaging. And that's nice upside. That will help contribute to kind of what I would call content growth in the semi process because today you're only using those steps mostly on the front end. And as you start to see those processing steps needed on the back end, that'll be some nice upside opportunity for us.\nOn the advanced packaging side, we have a broad set of materials going into that market, the largest of which is metalization materials. We're well positioned on both metalization materials and thermal materials. We're working with, in particular, some of the foundry customers to be able to scale up their 2.5D and 3D packaging technologies. And as we continue to see that build out, including some of the vertical scaling that may happen in some of the outer parts of the time horizon that you mentioned, that also represents additional upside for us. And as we do that, we are seeing some nice share gains in the advanced packaging space in particular and in our interconnect solutions business. So packaging slurries, for example, packaging metalization, and IC substrates are all businesses where we've seen some nice share gains over the last few quarters.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat color. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi. Good morning. First, I just want to ask on the guidance and just kind of the logic of not changing the guidance, but highlighting the tariff impact. I guess, are you messaging that there's potentially more offsets that could then get you into your original guidance range, or is it just uncertainty and you didn't want to adjust yet?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nHi. It's Anse Mello. Two things related to that. So one, as you very well know, it's kind of been a moving target day by day. So we wanted to keep our underlying guidance clean so you can see our operational performance. And as we've been talking about, I would tell you the teams have been working really, really hard to offset the impact of the tariffs. We started with a $500 million annualized number. Our impact for the year currently is around $60 million. We're continuing to work actions. We have not stopped. We will continue to look at that. There clearly could be some incremental mitigation actions that we have in place by the end of the year as well. So we'll continue to watch it. We'll continue to assess it. We'll see what position we're in at the end of Q2.\nThen we'll, depending on where things kind of land, we'll embed it into our guidance.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. That's helpful. And if I could follow up on the China anti-competitive review that's going on on Tyvek, one, can you comment on that beyond what you guys had in the press release a month or so ago? And then two, if you can say anything about the potential or lack of potential for further China reviews to spread to other parts of the business, is that a risk that you're worried about, or is it something that you're not worried about? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So on the second part of your question first, we don't see a risk of it going beyond the initial Tyvek investigation. So the investigation is kind of at a steady point. So we comply very quickly with all of their requests and are awaiting information from them. As we size, when the initial news came out, the exposure is not large. It's less than 1% of sales. So it's not a huge number for the total company. And as mentioned, we don't see it creeping into other areas of the business.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. The documents that we turned over to them were all related to just the Tyvek business.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThe only thing I would add is while this is ongoing, there are no changes to the businesses. We are able to continue to sell to customers within the area. There's no changes to that as well.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nThank you. Lori, are Kevlar, Nomex, core the new DuPont? I would have thought they would be, but it sounds like they may not be. So why is that the case? Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we've been talking when we made the decision to keep the water business that we would build around the high-growth components of the portfolio, which are healthcare and water. And we would look to take complexity out over time, so i.e., start to reduce the end markets in which we play. So I don't want to comment any further on the speculation around the news from the aramids business beyond saying that we've been pretty vocal about differentially investing and driving growth around the healthcare water market.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nGot it. And just can you quantify the impact of the pull-forward of semiconductor technology earnings into Q1 versus Q2? Thank you.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So hi, Anse Mello. So in total, we sized that around $30 million of sales that went into Q1 from Q2. That's at a pretty high margin rate, I would say.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Could you give us a little more granularity for the diversified industrials segment? And will the 10-Q have any more additional reporting within that kind of subsegment?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo. So the diversified is primarily comprised of the shelter business, which is about $1.7 billion in sales. Next Gen Mobility, which is our auto and aerospace exposed businesses, which are about $1 billion in sales. The Aramids business, which is about $1.3 billion. And the remainder is printing and publishing that came over, or printing and packaging, which came over from electronics, which was reported within the industrial solution space. So those are the key components. You'll see that we're disaggregating revenue for the new DuPont company at two levels. So you'll see today the healthcare and water under one segment, and then diversified industrials underneath another segment. So as we get to separation, we'll have to disaggregate that even farther.\nSo you would see most likely the areas that I just identified for diversified, and then you would see the healthcare and water separately for healthcare and water.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nHi. Good morning. You've noted share gains pretty consistently for electronics. And I'm just wondering, in the current sort of environment where we're seeing normalization and tariff uncertainty, do you see any pressure on that outperformance, whether it's additional competitive dynamics, or changes with customer relationships, or engagement on new product introduction?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nSo thanks, Patrick. Look, it's a competitive space. Our teams are fighting the battles kind of on the street, customer by customer, business by business every single day. Our teams are in constant contact with our customers, and we're watching that really closely. It is a competitive environment. We feel good about our competitive position. The dialogue that we have with our customers is strong. And when I think about the way in which our customers continue to work towards more advanced technologies with increasing process complexity and increasing quality requirements, the reality is that there's not as many participants who can help them to maintain the quality and the yields that they need in their facilities, whether you're talking a semiconductor chip or a printed circuit board.\nWe supplement that with large groups of application engineers in the local geographies where our customers are at to help them optimize their production. Really, our engineers are working side by side with them in the factory to help them optimize how our products are used to maximize their performance. That's part of the value proposition that we bring and part of why we have kind of a seat at the design table with them.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Citi\n\nGot it. Very helpful. In the past, I think there's been restrictions on U.S. product shipments to China, namely in electronics. Could fresh restrictions be a potential retaliatory measure in this trade environment?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nI think we watch that closely. It's certainly a dynamic environment, and it's possible. We don't have anything kind of scoped out that we're anticipating at the moment. But I think as we've seen since going all the way back to 2019, that it continues to be a dynamic environment, and we'll continue to watch it closely. I think teams have demonstrated an ability to navigate those changes pretty well, and we'll continue to do so.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alexei Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexei Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning, everyone. In industrial, your full-year sales guide is for 3% to 4% growth. That's acceleration from flat in Q1. So what would get better here in your view?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I think you're mixing as reported and organic. So in Q1, our organic sales for industrials were 2% up. And for Q2, we're kind of forecasting low single digits, so a similar profile. And then for the full year, we're saying organic 3 to 4, and we had mentioned that we were trending towards the lower end. So I think the guidance was on an organic basis versus a total company reported basis. Total sales.\n\nAlexei Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay. That's helpful. So not much of a change in trends, and sounds like. Going back to electronics in China, just to clarify, so you mentioned the pull-in from Q2 into Q1. And last year, you've been talking about also potential some of the give-backs from strong sales in China that you could see in 2025. Is that still on the table sometime later in 2025, or how do you think about that dynamic, just China being so strong last year?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah. So I think our guide, it has it normalizing kind of through the rest of the year as we continue to see kind of the customers. It's kind of flat year-over-year. And part of that is whatever materials they have, we expect will be consumed based on demand. But when we talk to our China customers, they continue to see fairly strong local demand and that they're not talking about hugely elevated inventories. We do expect that there will be some normalization. So we'll be flat year-over-year, but we'll have to monitor. We'll have to monitor how that goes. I would go back to globally, we still expect the markets to be fairly strong, especially in some of the advanced technologies that I've talked about. For China, a lot of China's got data center activity going on.\nThey've got a very strong EV and automotive business that they're supporting. Their consumer electronics businesses have been fairly strong. As we see that kind of pan out globally, we think that demand conditions, what we're hearing from our customers, is those demand conditions should continue.\n\nAlexei Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nEquity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Good morning, team. Appreciate it. My first question is, my understanding is water and some of the industrials businesses are often sold through distributors. So I guess, do you have any sense of channel inventories and any impact of potential pre-buying in that segment?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So you're right. So the new DuPont is about 50/50 between direct and distribution. It's heaviest in shelter. So that's what's kind of driving up the average. But in water, to your specific question, we saw all of the DSEC activity kind of as we headed into the tail end of 2023 and in the beginning of 2024. So the inventory levels are definitely normalized, and we don't see anything building there again.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nEquity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay. Great. And then second, I wanted to follow up on the aramids business. I appreciate the disclosure around what drove the timing or need to perform an impairment analysis. But can you just talk a bit more about what drove the write-down? Was it volume, profitability decline? Was it recent, or was it long ago, closer to when the merger occurred? Just some sort of context on that would be helpful.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nSure. It's Anse Mello. So just to be clear, there were actually no significant changes to the future cash flows of the business at all. What happened was really more accounting-related, is how I would characterize it. So you got to keep in mind that as we redid our segments, we had to re-identify what our reporting units were. So ARAMIS is now a standalone reporting unit. Previously, it was part of protection. You heard us talk about that kind of in the 10-Q when we would do our annual impairment test. So there were other businesses within there as well. When you pull ARAMIS out on a standalone basis, again, no changes to what was expected in terms of performance.\nBut when you look at the carrying value versus the fair value, the fair value was lower, so we had to take the impairment charge during the quarter. So it all stemmed from the realignment of the businesses during Q1.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nEquity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nHey, good morning. Congrats, John. Question for you. In terms of Qunity comparisons, how should investors think about sort of the right companies to compare you with? And the thought was semiconductor materials and equipment folks, but you've seen pretty significant multiple compression at the Entegris and others. And then on the other side, a lot of the higher quality materials companies like Linde, Sherwin-Williams, Givaudan, Ecolab, their multiples have held up really, really well. So how do you think about the right comps for your business and how we look to value the company post-spin?\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah. Thanks, Mike. I still think that the industry, the semi-industry pure plays are still probably the best peer set for us. So Entegris is still a good peer. I recognize there's been some compression in the short term, but I think over the long term, the industry dynamics are still very favorable with long-term growth and where we're going broadly across the electronic space. And I think that that'll support kind of over time, that'll support a long-term very nice valuation for us and for others in the electronics industry.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nGot it. As a quick follow-up, curious if you'd like to opine on AI. There's a lot of questions on whether we peak, whether we're continuing to grow, whether we're early in the potential. Obviously, that's probably a good driver for this business longer term.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nYeah. So look, I think when I think about AI, I think we continue to believe that we're still in the very early days of the adoption of AI use cases, and that there's still a lot of opportunities for further adoption and further growth. I think that's been reaffirmed a lot by the hyperscalers that have come out. And if anything, they're not pulling back their investment. They're increasing the size of their investment in the space. When we think about our AI exposure, our AI exposure, I kind of sized it with kind of the data center number that I gave earlier. It's about 15% of the portfolio, and it was up mid-teens. It's a big part of our advanced packaging business as well, which is about 10% of the portfolio. And it was up in the low 20s in Q1.\nReally nice growth rates for us. We continue to see opportunities for market expansion as well as for share expansion as that continues. We see more and more adoption of use cases. To the extent that AI use cases become more broadly affordable for more people, that will only accelerate because fundamentally, it comes back down to needing more compute and more connectivity. Both of those trends support growth for our business.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo Securities\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research",
    "content2": "Hey, good morning, and thanks. I wanted to drill into the industrial co-side of the house. Obviously, very strong in the healthcare and water, did low teens. I believe that initially, there was a thought that the healthcare and water side would grow mid to high single digits. Having done low teens in Q1, what your thoughts are for the balance of the year. And then secondly, taking a look at diversified industrials, obviously down in Q1, what your thoughts are in terms of growth rates on that side of the business. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So Frank, we're still in the same zone for the full-year growth for water and healthcare, as you had mentioned. So healthcare being up more in the high single digits and water mid to high single digits. So see a lot of momentum there. And we actually see them lifting as we go through the year on the water side from new system implementations being put in place in the second half and on the healthcare side, pickup on the med device side that's driving the growth there.\nBut the first quarter being up 14% and 11% organically for those businesses was a function of strong markets, but also the prior-year comp, which, as we had mentioned earlier in the call, the water was low from the completion of the DSEC, and we were still seeing the DSEC on the Tyvek medical packaging side in the first quarter of last year. So we do see those growth rates moderating as we head into the second quarter, but still very robust. And on diversified, the 4% organic decline was really driven by shelter and automotive. So those businesses are well telegraphed to be softening shelter kind of across. Mainly, the largest soft is falling on the residential side and the do-it-yourself side. And on the automotive side, it's in Europe and the US auto markets.\nThe revisions that came out from IHS in this last cycle took the full-year growth down about 120 basis points. That was reflected in the Q1 numbers. We do see a little bit of a tick up in the second half, really around the personal protection space, and the aero piece of industrial remaining strong. Obviously continued strength, as I had mentioned, in healthcare and water segments.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nVery helpful. Very helpful. Just to follow up on the building and construction and auto side, how are your order books looking April, May for Q2 relative to how they are historically? I mean, are you seeing a lot less visibility? How could you characterize the order books there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So no change there. We had mentioned April turned out strong for us. Within industrials co, we typically start with about 75% of the orders on the books for the month. And so we're in good shape there. We haven't seen any slowdown in orders. We actually usually see orders tick up as you start the year, and we nicely saw that. So no change in momentum from that perspective.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nTerrific. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. Ed, wondering if you can give us an update on PFAS and whether you think there'll be any material developments between now and November spin, either in the state attorney generals or in the individual litigation.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. It doesn't seem like anything big will happen until at the earliest kind of going towards the tail end of this calendar year. You have two things coming up. You have the Chambers Works, New Jersey trial, which starts sometime this month, but it's in phases, so that'll probably most likely go through the whole summer. And then I'd say the bigger issue that'd be nice to get settled is the personal injury ones, and the first bellwether cases for that are in October of this year. So really nothing imminent in kind of the next six months.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks very much. I'll pass it along.\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my call. I hope you guys are well. Maybe I can just ask a question about the logistics of the spin. So I guess, is it possible that you could pursue any M&A ahead of the spin? You've talked about growth in healthcare and water. If you were to possibly monetize some, and could you potentially monetize any other assets ahead of the spins, or is that something that we should expect after 1 November? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I would say probably nothing material before 1 November 2024. So obviously, all hands on deck to get the 1 November 2024 separation complete. But we are actively looking at areas where we can either add to the portfolio. I'll speak to Remain Co. Maybe Jon can talk a little bit too in Qunity if they're looking at stuff. But we're always looking and have robust pipelines. But there's nothing that I would say is imminent, but it would happen before the 1 November 2024 separation.\n\nJon Kemp\n\nElectronics Business President and CEO-elect, DuPont\n\nFor Qunity, it would be very similar to how Lori characterized it.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, have you seen any change in your order patterns amongst some of the industrial customers, maybe in different countries on the water side? Do you see any change in behavior as far as pulling back or maybe extending out orders as it relates to tariffs or any other macro concerns, or have that momentum kind of continued? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I know we haven't seen any oddities in the order patterns for new DuPont. So as I had mentioned, April was strong. The order book is consistent with our expectations as we see it through the second quarter, so.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will be Steve Byrne, the last question for today with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nYes. Thank you. A couple of days ago, the EPA put out their PFAS action item list, and I'm really anxious to hear your view of it. It is quite detailed and quite a few action items. It seems to be a little bit of a different approach than the way they've taken on to cut lots of other environmental regs. But a couple of items from there that I wonder what your view is. They're proposing to develop some effluent guidelines, which, Lori, you had mentioned the potential benefit in your water business from treatment for PFAS. Maybe effluent guidelines could assist in that, although they might cut or change drinking water standards. And the other one they've highlighted was the liability framework, whether or not you think that could have an effect on some of the future litigation.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I mean, we continue to study it. I think, as I had mentioned, there's no change right now on the opportunity side within the water business to address the PFAS cleanup and remediation work. And I think on the liability side, we continue to make progress within the settlement on MDL, which from our experience, our exposure is most concentrated. So we got the large one out of the way like a year and a half ago with the water districts, as Ed had mentioned. The bellwether cases on the personal injury front start in October. So we'll see how discussions go as you get closer to that date. And then we continue to manage our own kind of state-by-state exposure with the attorney general. But we'll read through the document and see if there's any changes to our current views.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah. Remember, the personal injury case is coming up, our firefighting foam, which we never made it. So I think the parameters we had in the last big settlement would clearly apply here also.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nThen one quick follow-up. This $200 million of finished goods shipments from the U.S. to China, what products are those? What business is that? How are you avoiding this 125% tariff?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So those are exports from the U.S. to our customers. And so the tariff would be on them with respect to payment. So obviously, we're working to make sure that maybe all the exemptions that could mitigate that piece for them would be in place. Evenly, that's split kind of evenly between electronics and industrial co, that $200 million from an export perspective.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America Securities\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nOperator\n\nQuestion and answer session for today. I will now turn the call over back to Ed Barna for closing remarks.\n\nEdward Barna\n\nInvestor Relations, DuPont\n\nThank you, everyone, for joining today. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on DuPont's website. This concludes our call.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference. You may now disconnect.

You may begin.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Executive Chairman; Lori Koch, Chief Executive Officer; and Antonella Franzen, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and presentation materials, and have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori, who will begin on slide three.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our fourth quarter call. Earlier today, we reported solid quarterly results to close out a strong year of performance. Fourth quarter sales grew 7%, including another consecutive quarter of double-digit organic growth in E&I, and highlighted by a return to organic growth in W&P of 6%. We showed strong operating leverage as operating EBITDA of $807 million increased 13% year over year. Operating EBITDA margin of 26.1% expanded 140 basis points, and adjusted EPS of $1.13 grew 30% from the prior year. From an end-market view, fourth quarter saw continued strong demand within electronics, driven by the ongoing transition to advanced nodes and related AI-enabling technologies. Further improvement in healthcare markets resulted in a return to volume growth for both our medical packaging and biopharma products, which both grew at double-digit rates.\nAdditionally, we continued to see growth acceleration in water in the quarter, with 4% sequential sales lift and an 11% year-over-year increase. Looking back at full year financial performance, volume growth of 2% was solid and grew as the year went on, culminating in 8% growth for the fourth quarter. This, combined with operational discipline and productivity actions, was key to our earnings growth and resulted in strong incrementals and margin improvements. Coupling improved segment earnings with the benefit of a reduced share count led to a robust 17% growth in adjusted EPS. Working capital optimization, which has been another key operating priority for the team, helped drive strong cash generation with transaction-adjusted free cash flow conversion of 105%. I'd like to thank the entire DuPont team for all their hard work and dedication to achieve these results.\nTurning to slide four, I will cover our key priorities for 2025: organic growth, operational execution, and portfolio management. Starting with the top line, as mentioned, we saw volume growth improvement in both E&I and W&P as we progressed through this past year. Looking into 2025, we expect further acceleration in volume growth, targeting mid-single-digit organic sales growth for the total company. To enable this, we will continue focusing on optimizing our growth opportunities within each business, which includes both continued investment and innovation, as well as driving commercial excellence initiatives, including strategic marketing and sales effectiveness activities. To ensure success, we recently hired a Chief Commercial Officer to drive consistent execution across all of our businesses. Additionally, our businesses continue to focus on driving operational excellence.\nWe are entering our fourth year of driving an enhanced focus on Nomex, and our profitability continues to benefit from the expanded toolkit and discipline rollout across the organization. Coupling our standard OPEX framework with steady investments in digital tools will lead to continued improvement in financial performance. Finally, regarding portfolio management, we announced last month that we are targeting 1 November of this year for the intended spinoff of the electronics business, which is nicely accelerated from the initial timeframe of 18 to 24 months. We remain excited about the sizable shareholder value creation opportunity from creating a leading pure-play electronics company. We continue to make progress towards establishing the future boards for electronics and DuPont and remain on track to be able to announce new board members as well as executive leadership for the future electronics company by the end of Q1.\nWe continue to see the excitement building internally and externally, and I look forward to updating you in the coming months. With that, I'll turn it over to Antonella to cover the financial results and outlook in detail.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Lori, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the solid finish to a strong year of financial performance. End-market recovery and improved volumes have been the primary driver of our accelerated sales and earnings growth throughout 2024, and our teams have also continued to execute well on our operational excellence initiatives, including both enhanced productivity and the previously announced cost actions. I look forward to the continued momentum that we are carrying into 2025, but first, I'll cover our fourth quarter financial highlights in further detail, beginning on slide five. Net sales of $3.1 billion increased 7% versus the year-ago period, as an 8% increase in volume was slightly offset by a 1% decrease in price. Currency and portfolio were both flat. Higher volume was led by continued strong demand in electronics and markets, with semi and interconnect solutions both up double digits.\nFurther acceleration in water solutions yielding double-digit volume gains and a return to year-over-year growth in both safety solutions and industrial solutions. On a segment view, E&I and W&P organic sales grew 10% and 6% respectively. Organic sales and corporate declined 7% versus the year-ago period. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 11% organic sales growth year-over-year, including another strong quarter in China, where organic sales also increased 11% due to continued strength in electronics markets and acceleration in water. Organic sales were up 5% in North America and up 1% in Europe. Fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $807 million increased 13% versus the year-ago period, as volume gains, the benefit of higher production rates, and savings from restructuring actions were partially offset by higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 26.1% increased 140 basis points year-over-year.\nFourth quarter cash generation was strong, reflecting a continued working capital discipline across the businesses. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $564 million, CapEx of $161 million, and $52 million of separation-related transaction cost payments resulted in transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $455 million and related conversion of 96%. As Lori mentioned earlier, 2024 was a strong year for cash performance, with transaction-adjusted free cash flow of $1.8 billion and related conversion of 105%. Turning to slide six, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $1.13 per share increased 30% from $0.87 in the year-ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.17, as well as below-the-line benefits totaling $0.09, from a combination of lower share count, tax rate, and foreign exchange losses, drove the year-over-year increase. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide seven.\nE&I's fourth quarter net sales of $1.5 billion increased 11% versus the year-ago period on organic sales growth of 10% and favorable portfolio impact of 1%, reflecting the Donatelle acquisition. Organic sales growth of 10% reflects an 11% increase in volume, slightly offset by a 1% decrease in price. At the line-of-business level, organic sales for semis were up low teens on continued semiconductor demand recovery driven by AI technology applications. Semi demand continues to be notably strong in China, with year-over-year growth of about 40% during the quarter. Given elevated levels of growth throughout 2024, we currently anticipate relatively flat semi sales in China for 2025, though overall organic growth in semi is expected to be up 6% to 7% for the full year.\nInterconnect Solutions posted another quarter of strong results, with organic sales up low double digits, reflecting broad-based end-market strength, additional share gains, and continued volume benefits from AI-driven technology ramps. Industrial Solutions returned to organic growth in the quarter, with organic sales up mid-single digits due to improved demand for biopharma within healthcare and continued strength in printing and packaging applications. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $457 million was up 21% versus the year-ago period on volume gains, the benefit of higher production rates, savings from restructuring actions, and a $13 million gain related to a technology license agreement, which was contemplated in our guidance. The year-over-year increase is partially offset by higher variable compensation. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 30.3%, up 250 basis points versus the year-ago period. For the full year, E&I net sales of $5.9 billion increased 11%, with 6% organic sales growth.\nFor the full year, operating EBITDA of $1.7 billion increased 17%, with operating EBITDA margin of 29%, up 140 basis points from the prior year. Turning to slide eight, W&P fourth quarter net sales of $1.4 billion increased 6% versus the year-ago period due to an 8% increase in volume, partially offset by a 2% decrease in price. Safety Solutions returned to year-over-year growth as organic sales were up high single digits, reflecting continued improvement in healthcare markets, evidenced by medical packaging sales lift for three consecutive quarters, including a 6% increase from Q3. Shelter Solutions sales were flat on an organic basis, with headwinds in North America construction markets offset by growth and repair and remodel demand. Within Water Solutions, sales were up low double digits on an organic basis, driven by continued broad-based volume recovery.\nOn a sequential basis, Water Solutions sales also increased for a third straight quarter, with sales up 4% from Q3. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $357 million was up 14% versus the year-ago period, as volume gains and savings from restructuring actions were partially offset by higher variable compensation and the absence of about $25 million of discrete item benefits recorded in the prior year. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 26.3%, up 170 basis points from the year-ago period. For the full year, W&P generated net sales of $5.4 billion, with operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion. Operating EBITDA margin for the full year of 25.1% increased 50 basis points. Turning to slide nine, which outlines our Q1 2025 and full year guidance expectations.\nAt a consolidated level for the first quarter, we estimate net sales of about $3.025 billion, operating EBITDA of about $760 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.95 per share. Our first quarter net sales guidance assumes a mid-single digit organic growth and a currency headwind of about 1.5% versus the first quarter of 2024. We expect a more normal seasonal progression into the second quarter, with a sequential sales lift of about 6% to 7% from the first quarter. For the full year 2025, we estimate consolidated net sales of $12.8 to 12.9 billion, operating EBITDA of $3.325-3.375 billion, and adjusted EPS of $4.30-4.40 per share. Our full year consolidated net sales guidance assumes mid-single digit organic growth and a currency headwind of about 1%.\nOur EPS estimate includes a headwind from below-the-line items totaling $0.10, related primarily to an assumed 1% higher tax rate versus this past year. I would also like to highlight that we plan on realigning our segment reporting structure in Q1 in advance of the intended separation of electronics later this year. We will begin reporting under this new structure when we release our Q1 2025 results. The businesses comprising the future electronics company will be reported as the electronics co-segment, while the businesses that will remain with DuPont will be reported as the industrials co-segment. We are providing historical segment information reflecting these realignments for comparison purposes, which you can find in the earnings presentation accompanying today's call. For the new electronics co-segment, we expect full year 2025 organic sales growth in the 6%-7% range.\nThis assumed growth is expected to be driven by ongoing strength within semi, fueled by continued AI adoptions, and transition to advanced nodes, as well as the impact from more normalized sales in China, as previously mentioned. In Interconnect Solutions, we expect continued growth driven by improved sentiment within consumer electronics, and refreshed cycles in support of AI adoption. For the new industrial co-segment, we expect full year 2025 organic sales growth in the 3%-4% range. Within healthcare markets, we expect growth acceleration in medical devices, along with continued stabilization for medical packaging applications, and in biopharma markets. In water, we expect a strong year for the business with continued volume growth year-over-year, and we expect stable demand within markets served by our remaining industrial-based product lines.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one in your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Your first question today comes from the line of Scott Davis from Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Lori, Antonella, Chris.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWhat's up?\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYou guys talked - you referenced AI-related revenues a few times in the call. Is there any - can you size that for us at all and kind of give us a sense of what kind of growth rates you've seen there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Scott, we saw really nice growth this year, up about 30% in the AI-related sales. We're up over $300 million now. And so we continue to expect that to be a key piece of the growth for the electronics co as we move to separate them towards the end of the year.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. That's helpful. And then the incremental margins, 47% or so, is what I was calculating. Is pretty strong. But you've got a little bit of price, perhaps, headwind in front of you. How do you think about incrementals in 2025 and the sustainability, kind of puts and takes of cost coming back? And I know there's going to be some noise in the transition here, but do you think there's an opportunity to keep those incrementals above historic levels, or do you see some cost coming back and some price issues?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. In 2024, we saw incrementals kind of in the low to mid-60s, and we have them, as you had mentioned, in the mid-40s in 2025. So again, very strong. We had mentioned that we do have a 1% assumed price headwind in 2025 versus 2024, but net between that and inflation, and absorption tailwinds, we see that about neutral on the bottom line. So we'll share a lot more about margin projections when we do investor day later in the fall, but we continue to expect to see really nice margin improvement across both new DuPont and electronics.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay. Congrats on the year. Best of luck, guys. We'll see you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. So maybe just a question on water.\nObviously, there were some easy comps there, but it also seems like it really continued even on a sequential basis. Can you help us to think about some of the drivers that you're seeing there that are really pushing that growth and how we should be thinking about them as we go through 2025?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we did see really nice recovery. So it was up about 11% year-over-year organic in Q4, and we see about mid to high single-digit organic growth overall in 2025 for water. So a lot of it really is just around the secular tailwinds in the water space, so the access to clean water. We see nice growth across all key technologies. We are the one player within the space that has all the four key technologies when it comes to filtration.\nThere's some incremental opportunities, not necessarily in 2025, but longer term around both DLE, so direct lithium extraction within the battery space, and then also some PFAS opportunity as well.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Okay. Thanks for the color on that. With regard to semis, it looks like there's a number of node transitions kind of especially rolling in in the second half of 2025. Can you help us to think about what that means for the cadence of growth in the semi-tech platform for you as we look through 2025?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we had mentioned for overall new electronics co it'll be about 6% to 7% organic growth. That's about even between both sides of it, so between semi and ICS. Q1, just given the favorable comp, will be the highest growth. We said low double digits, I believe, for the new electronics.\nIt'll moderate as the year goes on, but again, really nice overall 6%-7% on top of a really strong year in 2024.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nDid you see any kind of pull forward in demand with regards to any concerns around tariffs or new administration in the fourth quarter?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nHey, Steve, it's Antonella. We've talked about in the last couple of quarters that we saw. I would call it more of pre-buy in the semi space related to a lot of the new fabs that have started up during the course of the year. So you heard us talk about that in Q2 and Q3. We would estimate that in Q4 it was probably around $20 million or so.\nI would say we would attribute it more to the new fab startups versus tariffs per se, but there could have been a little bit of it related to the tariffs coming in 2025 as well.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. And then I think there was a modest gain in the electronics segment. I'm not sure if you fleshed that out. How big was that?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we commented on that in our prepared remarks. It was $13 million, and it was included in the guidance when we provided it on the Q3 call.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOh, okay. Got it. All right. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research. Your line is open.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Sorry if I missed this at the beginning. I was also about 10 minutes late getting on. Just on the spin and the timing now, I feel that's a pretty hard lock on 1 November 2024, and maybe any update on just kind of the cost to separate and the kind of stand-up, stand-alone costs associated with electronics. Again, apologize if you addressed that.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nHey, Jeff, it's Antonella. So yes, timing is pretty locked in. I would say the team has clearly done a lot of work to accelerate the timeline. We've had a lot of good practice in the organization in doing this. So we have a really good plan in place, and things are progressing as expected. In terms of a couple of updates, so our separation costs, we had said would be around $700 million. We do expect that to be a little less than that as we move forward now, given that water will remain in the DuPont portfolio.\nBut I would just be mindful that a lot of things that kind of went into that will still continue to happen, whether it was one separation or two separations. In terms of dissynergies, we initially quoted that as around $60 million. Now we would expect that that would be closer to $40 million.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Then would that also encompass sort of the stranded costs? That $40 million, is that sort of the public company cost for new electronics co separated apart from sort of stranded that you need to get after? Could you just kind of put a finer point on that?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nSure. So when you kind of take a look at our dissynergies, it is predominantly standing up two public companies.\nSo when you kind of compare where our corporate costs are today versus where we expect corporate costs to be in the future, that is a big bulk of it. There's a little bit of it that is in the businesses. As we've said before, it does not include per se stranded costs, but I would tell you that at this point, based upon all the work that we've been doing in terms of getting the two organizations ready for day one and kind of having a cost structure that's fit for purpose in terms of their size, we do not expect that to be very material.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner, Vertical Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nNo problem.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Chris Parkinson from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Dierector, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Just going back to the water protection, you hit on this towards the end of your prepared remarks, but could you just give us a little bit more perspective on how you see things shaping up across safety, shelter, and water throughout 2025, as well as just kind of the key considerations that we should be looking at in terms of potential market outperformance? Thank you so much.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So I'll answer your question in the new form, given that's how we're going to report in 2025. So for the three pieces within the new DuPont, the water and healthcare will be about 40% of the portfolio, and we expect them to have nice mid to high single-digit growth organically in 2025. So a continued improvement coming off of the bottom that we saw throughout 2024.\nSo we had noted medical packaging got better every quarter, and we exited a really nice position from 2024. The same with water. So water improved kind of every quarter, and we exited in a nice position. And we see the destocking that we had telegraphed early in 2024 essentially complete. Then the remaining portion of the portfolio probably will be around the low single-digit growth. So that would encompass the aeromids business, the shelter business, and then the businesses that we picked up from the industrial solutions business within electronics.\nSo overall, nice 3%-4% organic, definitely outsized within the healthcare and the water portion.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Dierector, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. Just as a quick follow-up, just on the interconnect side, you mentioned obviously some AI-driven tech benefits, but could you just hit on kind of the key drivers of the remainder of the portfolio and just any differences based on geography as well? Thank you so much.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Within electronics, within the interconnect business, we had mentioned the AI around the packaging space. There's also a lot of upside that we saw in 2024 and continue to expect in 2025 on the Laird. So this was the business that we had acquired back in 2021. It's a lot around thermal management. So we're looking, as the chips get smaller and the tech more intense, for us to be able to drive a lot of outperformance on the Laird side. So that was key to the growth before and expected to be strong again this year.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Dierector, Wolfe Research\n\nGreat color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Josh Spector from UBS Financials. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemical Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask on the industrials co guidance, but specifically on first quarter versus the year. So in your first quarter, it seems like you're guiding for low single-digit growth. You just did mid-single-digit growth in fourth quarter, and you have a pretty easy comp in first quarter. So what am I missing about why that growth shouldn't be higher in first quarter as it relates to the year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So the largest piece is within the automotive portion of new DuPont. So overall, last year was still robust for them in Q1 from both the automotive side of the adhesive piece as well as within Kevlar within the business.\nSo one of it is a comp, a little bit less of a favorable comp than maybe what you would have expected. Also, if you look at the bills, you're going to go year over year, you're comparing, and then you're going to go sequentially. But the bills in Q1 2025 are expected to be down 4% year over year than what they were in Q4 2024. So that would meet the expectations. Otherwise, everything else is generally the same between the two quarters.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemical Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thanks for that. And if I could just follow up on cash deployment, you guys haven't bought back stock in about three quarters now. Your leverage is low. Understanding you're going through everything with splits, but seems to be an opportunity for you to deploy some cash and a buyback. So why isn't that something that we're doing now?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So as we mentioned in some prior calls, we do not plan on doing any more share buyback until at least, at the minimum, until post-separation. I would just be mindful. Obviously, there are a lot of cash costs related to the separation. So that's where our cash will be deployed in the near term.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemical Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Patrick Cunningham from Citi. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. Good morning. The performance seemed to imply the EBITDA margin profile, the corporate retained businesses, maybe high teens, low 20s. I mean, would you characterize these as normal levels? And does it change maybe what the long-term margin target would be for the industrials co versus W&P?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So you're right. So the businesses that are coming into the new DuPont, so the businesses that were in corporate M&M and then the businesses that were in the industrial portion of E&I had a lower overall margin profile than the heritage W&P businesses. And so from the corporate M&M businesses that came in, you called it right. They were kind of in the high teens, maybe low 20s. I would say that's that benchmark level. If you look to the other adhesive players, probably even slightly above.\nAnd then the businesses that we picked out from the industrial business, a lot of that would be the spectrum piece that came in through acquisition. And when we had done that acquisition, we said the margins were in the low 20s. So we're right sitting at 23%, 24% in 2024 for industrials co. We'll look to continue to drive productivity and mix enrichment.\nAnd then, as mentioned earlier in the call, we'll get into more of the margin targets that we would expect for each of the two new companies that they're investing in in the fall.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thank you. And apologies if I missed this, but is there any update on CalRes? How is that business performing? We had a few quarters of sharp de-stocking. Should we expect some rebound there in 2025 helping underpin some of the strong growth rates in the electronics business?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I would say mid-year 2025 is the one business that we have in the portfolio that hasn't quite gotten through its de-stock yet. So we're targeting mid-year 2025 for that to get back to more normal growth levels.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nThank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. How are you thinking about industrials portfolio now that you decided to keep the water business? Any further divestments, or do you see any interesting bolt-ons here?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I would say it's both. I mean, as we continue to look at the remaining core portfolio and look to take flexibility out and get it more towards the simplified businesses, more exposed to higher circularized markets, you'll continue to see portfolio activity on the new DuPont side. And then we'll look to invest in M&A primarily around the healthcare and the water business as we look to outsize our exposure there. So we'll come out at about 40% of sales in the healthcare and water, and we'll look to lift that through both M&A and also growth as we move forward.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thank you. And then a follow-up on electronics. Do you have an assumption for underlying market growth in semis and interconnect or a target outgrowth for each of these segments in 2025?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So in 2025, we see MSI of around single digits. And again, we had talked through 2024 with a little bit disconnected with respect to wafer starts and wafer consumption because of the inventory levels that were consumed on the chip side. So we see our view of MSI at around 6% growth. We see overall semi-fab utilization in the high 70s in 2025. And then on the ICS side, kind of the combination of PCB and smartphones, we see in the mid-single digit range.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of John Roberts from Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Congrats on a good quarter. Are you planning to change the name of Industrial Co and any progress on industry reclassification?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So I'll do the name. So Industrial Co will be DuPont, and I'll turn it over to Antonella on the reclassification.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we're doing the work around the reclassification, as we talked about before, with clearly the intent of getting that moved from the chemical classification to an industrial classification. The change would not necessarily be made until the separation is complete, but we are working on that, and that is clearly our intent as to where we should be and where we need to be.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nAnd then secondly, are you planning on keeping Water Solutions separate within Industrial Co, that would preserve the option for a spin later on if that's what you wanted to do?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nSo Water Solutions will be reported as a segment in new DuPont. I think that's probably the question that you're asking. So Water Solutions would be a segment. We have to clarify all of this, but you can imagine we'll want to highlight water in healthcare given the growth profile. So those would be segments within the new portfolio.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director, Mizuho\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Mike Haley from Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMike Haley\n\nIntermediary Relationship Manager, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning to you. For the electronics co, are we 100% headed for a spin here in November, or is there any chance of merging or selling these assets before then?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We're headed towards a spin.\n\nMike Haley\n\nIntermediary Relationship Manager, Barclays\n\nOkay. And then I apologize if I missed it.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nYeah. We'll announce management teams before the end of this quarter, and we're pretty set with a full board slate for electronics, which we'll also be announcing before the end of the quarter.\n\nMike Haley\n\nIntermediary Relationship Manager, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Then I apologize if I missed this, but did you announce who your new chief commercial officer will be, and will they stay with industrials co, I presume?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nHe will stay with Industrials Co His name is Lakshmi Yalamanchili. Joining us from SKF next week.\n\nMike Haley\n\nIntermediary Relationship Manager, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Lori, in semis, you referenced flat sales in China in 2025. Can you give a little more color as to why that's happening and just how big is China for the entire semi tech business? Thank you. Yeah.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nSo it's more around the normalization of the volume growth versus demand. So in 2024, in China for semi, we saw 40% volume growth. And I had mentioned that probably overall, we saw about $16 million worth of pre-buy activity.\nSo normalizing that against 2025 is why we can see a flat volume within China for semi. Overall, semi China is about a $600 million market. About two-thirds of it is local Chinese semi producers, and the rest are the multinationals that produce within China.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nAnd how much of your business is semi tech is China?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThat's the 600 million.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nSorry about that. So about 30%.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. And just on North American construction, any signs of progress in either residential or commercial? Thank you.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nWhen you actually take a look at our shelter business, what I would say is we've actually fared pretty well given the environment that we're in. So as we talked about in Q4, we did see a little bit of softness on both the residential and non-residential side being offset by some growth in repair and remodel. Kind of as we go forward, we are currently anticipating, I would say, low single-digit growth in that business for 2025.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I wanted to follow up on the divestitures discussion, and I'm just wondering, with Water Solution now staying within Industrials Co, is there a window between now and spin where you can get some assets out of the business without having to assign pro rata PFAS liabilities to them? And if you don't get that done before 1 November, presumably they would have to have liabilities assigned thereafter. And is 1 November 2024 really the hard date on that?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So technically, you could do a divestiture between now and 1 November 2024 and stay above the $2.5 billion threshold, and then therefore not have to assign PFOA. We're obviously fully focused on getting the electronics separation out 1 November. At that point, we'll comply with the side letter and pro rata distribute the PFOA side letter agreement with Corteva between new electronics and DuPont.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Then just on free cash flow for 2025, obviously, you're going to have spin costs and other things that are going to be sort of clouding the underlying performance. So could you give us a sense of, you obviously had excellent conversion this year. What do you think 2025 might look like?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So as we look to 2025 in our free cash flow conversion, we would expect it to be greater than 90%, which is kind of the number that we've been focusing on. We've had really good conversion this year. We were at 105%. We did have a nice benefit of a lot of the practices we're putting in place related to working capital that helped us this year. As we go into next year and the growth that we're kind of expecting on both the electronics co side and the industrials co side, we will have some working capital usage. But again, we feel good that we'll be above the 90% conversion, excluding clearly all the transaction costs, which is how we've been reporting our free cash flow over the last couple of quarters.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nEquity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nPerfect. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Nice quarter. Organic growth in industrial co in the fourth quarter, as well as your outlook in the first quarter, appears pretty differentiated relative to traditional chemical companies where growth seems to be pretty negative. So I suspect that helps your cause in getting that designation change. But maybe can you remind us of what other metrics, margins, returns on capital, or sort of just make the case why this should be more of a multi-industrial business than a chemical business?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. No, I mean, obviously, our growth that we would expect in 2024 and expect in 2025, and then even the margin profile is significantly different than what you would see on the chemical side, and even just the volatility. We don't have the swings in pricing that you may see with respect to utilization levels in the commodity chemical side as well.\nSo any support that we can get in our endeavors from both the buy-side and the sell-side to be able to get that GICS change would be really helpful because we do believe it's fundamental to how we are defining the new company. We'll target similar leverage profiles to the other multi-industrials. We'll have very strong margin profiles similar to the multi-industrials and a very similar growth trajectory.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nAnd by the way, the last big piece we divested, which was the M&M business to Celanese, was really the last vestige of a chemical business within the portfolio. So we actively work hard for, I think, seven years now to get to more of a multi-industrial company and out of the chemical space. So hopefully, good luck with changing the code.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nSounds good. And then just a quick follow-up. I think in the past, you talked about advanced nodes as a percent of electronics, which I assume includes AI-related sales. Can you remind us how big, I guess, advanced nodes are now for semi tech and interconnect, and then maybe what the growth rate for that subset will be in 2025?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So advanced nodes are about 40% of the semi portfolio. Their growth, obviously, would be higher than the average six to seven that we had mentioned earlier in the call. We had said that for the AI-specific exposure, we saw 30% growth within the semi business. So you would expect a nice outperformance in the advanced nodes versus the more mature nodes.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nAll right. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is open.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nGood morning. Let me echo the congrats on the quarter. You basically hit the trifecta in terms of exceeding guidance on sales, EBITDA, and EPS from what you provided in the early part of November. So I'm curious as to what went right or what exceeded your expectations in November and December.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So I'll take that advanced analysis. So when you look at the electronics space, I would say that's the one that really drove the beat. We did continue to have strong demand. And as we talked about a little bit earlier, we did have some pre-buy in there as well. I think the other important thing to mention when you kind of take a look at Q4 is not only did we exceed our expectations as we set them, but we also, I would say, covered incremental pressure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter as well.\nBut other areas, so electronics was clearly a standout, but as we talked about, the water business was even a little bit better than we expected on a sequential basis. Up for the Tyvek medical packaging business was slightly better than we expected. Biopharma was actually even a little bit better as well. The only area that I would say we kind of expected is that auto would be softer, and it was. Shelter was pretty much in line. So from an operations perspective, that's how I would characterize it. Now, when you take a look at total EPS, the other factor that we clearly had that drove the beat was the tax rate in Q4 was a bit lower than we had anticipated. So that's in the number as well relative to the fourth quarter.\nAnd we did talk about as we go into 2025, we do expect the tax rate to probably be about a point or so higher than where we kind of landed this year.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nUnderstood. And as we sit here today, in the early part of February, the segments that you thought were doing better, i.e., water, packaging, etc., has that continued at that pace? So the follow-through that you're seeing here in the early part of 2025?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYes. It is playing out as we've expected.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nAll right. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (RBC Capital)\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital\n\nGood morning. This is Adam on for Arun. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the great quarter. I'd like to double-click on the cash a little bit. I know you've said most of the cash deployment for the year is going to be related to transaction costs. Could you give us a sense on maybe the cadence of some of those costs or any of those going to linger into the Q4 or Q1 of next year? Are those mostly going to be advanced? Just thinking about when we could start thinking about resuming maybe cash deployment to other avenues.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So what we talked about, our transaction costs are around $700 million. We expect them to be slightly less now that we are retaining the water business within the portfolio. I would be mindful that from a cash perspective, as you can see in the schedule attached to our press release, that cash out this year related to transaction costs was only $64 million. So a bulk of it is all sitting in 2025.\nI would also be mindful there could be some costs related to debt as well. That's in addition to those transaction costs, which is why the focus in 2025 is all around getting the separation done and kind of putting a majority of all those costs behind us. I mean, there could be a little bit of trickling that goes into the following year, but a majority of it will be 2025.\n\n[Analyst] (RBC Capital)\n\nAnalyst, RBC Capital\n\nGreat. Thanks. And maybe if just we could quickly touch back, you mentioned healthcare and water assets potentially as targets for M&A going forward. Any additional color you could give there maybe on types of assets or parameters you'd use for the search? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we have an active pipeline in both spaces, so we'll continue to look and see where we can pick up assets that would add to our portfolio.\nWithin the water space, we would even broaden the adventure beyond just filtration and go into some of the other areas in order to be able to bulk up our exposure there. And within healthcare, you would expect a similar dynamic to what we've done with our last few acquisitions around Spectrum and Donatelle in the med device space. So bringing our capabilities to bear and adding new capabilities to the toolkit.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from a line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nSo good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the comments around the construction outlook. What specifically are you assuming for remodeling activity? And also, what's your assumption around FX?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nSo for remodeling within shelter, our expectation as we go into 2025 and what's built into our guidance is that that would be relatively flat on a year-over-year basis.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nDid you say FX, Laurence, for your last question?\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYeah. Yeah. Just currency FX. Yep.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we have about a 1.5% headwind in Q1 and then about a 1% headwind for the full year.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from a line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManiging Director, Bank of America\n\nYes. Thank you. Laura, you mentioned the fourth water treatment technologies in your remarks. I was curious whether any of the revenue in the water business is a service component such as monitoring or maintaining those treatment technologies, and/or do you have an interest in adding a service component to that business to help your industrial customers reduce water usage? Is that part of your vision in that business?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWe don't have any service revenue today in the portfolio, but we'll look broadly in the water space to be able to add to our exposure. So I would say services as well as other areas within the water landscape would be on the table.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManiging Director, Bank of America\n\nI'm just curious about price trends in your various Tyvek products. You sell them into construction, into packaging, into personal protection. How do those end markets differ in terms of price trends for those products?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. There's not really material deviations in price across all the different end markets within Tyvek. So it's a high value. We've got a lot of expertise in the Tyvek overall space, and we'll continue to benefit from the recovery on the medical packaging side as well.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManiging Director, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question and answer session.I will now turn the call back over to Chris Mecray for closing remarks.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nThanks, everybody, for joining today. For your reference, a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website. This concludes the call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call.

You may begin.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for DuPont's 2nd Quarter 2024 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Executive Chairman, Lori Koch, Chief Executive Officer, and Antonella Franzen, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nOur Form 10-K, as updated by our current periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We'll also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and has been posted to DuPont's investor relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Lori.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining. I'm excited to be here today for my first quarterly call as CEO and to be joined by Antonella, our newly appointed CFO.\nWe both look forward to partnering with Ed and our global team to continue to drive value creation for all stakeholders. We remain focused on driving results and demonstrating the performance potential of our combined portfolio while furthering the plans to unlock value through our previously announced separations. This morning we reported second quarter financial results ahead of our previous guidance, reflecting continued positive momentum led by broad-based electronics recovery as well as sequential improvement from all W&P lines of business. We were very pleased with this outcome and by the continued focus and strong execution of our global team. On a consolidated basis for the quarter, we saw improvement across all key financial metrics. Net sales and operating EBITDA were both up year-over-year and sequentially, including a 17% pickup in operating EBITDA versus the first quarter.\nWe saw strength in the Semi business driven by growth in advanced technology applications including AI.\nWe also realized continued recovery and wins within consumer electronics markets to drive both year-over-year and sequential growth for Interconnect Solutions. We did see some favorable timing benefits within each of these businesses during Q2 relative to our expectations in the W&P segment. We were pleased to see a better than anticipated sequential step up in our water business in China, as well as improvement in Tyvek Medical Packaging within Safety Solutions, which was in line with our expectations.\nOur year-over-year growth in operating EBITDA reflects solid margin expansion with operating EBITDA margin improvement of 130 basis points driven by favorable business mix, stronger production rates in our electronics businesses, and realization of restructuring-related cost savings partially offset by higher variable compensation expense. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 14% year-over-year. Strong cash generation and related conversion of over 100% was another bright spot for the quarter, highlighting disciplined working capital management amid a sequential sales ramp. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS, which Antonella will detail shortly. I also wanted to highlight that earlier this week we closed our acquisition of Donatelle, a manufacturer of sophisticated medical devices.\nWe are delighted to welcome the Donatelle team to DuPont and are excited about this transaction, which will deepen and complement our expertise in medical device markets alongside Spectrum, which we acquired last year. Donatelle will be managed within our E&I Industrial Solutions line of business alongside the Spectrum team. Together, these offerings are expected to enhance our position as a partner of choice for customers in the high growth medical device field. I'll now turn the call over to Ed, who will provide a progress update on our planned separations.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nThanks and good morning everyone. As seen in our second quarter results, we are well into the recovery phase from last year's inventory corrections in most key end markets, and electronics may be setting up for a prolonged positive cycle. Turning to the separations, we've received very encouraging feedback since our May announcement of our intent to separate the electronics and water businesses, and the formation of three independent companies. We believe our investors broadly appreciate the value creation opportunity of having three industry leading global companies with compelling growth opportunities and distinct investment propositions. As we shift gears to ramp up our separation activities, we have also worked to ensure our teams internally are highly motivated to remain focused on serving customers and driving business performance. That remains the top priority, and I'm confident our operating teams will continue to execute.\nAs you can see on slide 4, we have already begun working on the rigorous project management processes necessary to ensure the separation work is executed smoothly. Our teams have plenty of experience to rely on to ensure we stay within the 18 month to 24-month timeline from our May announcement with all three companies well positioned for day one. One key short-term milestone that has already been completed is the establishment of key work stream leaders as part of our integrated project management team under Lori and Antonella's leadership along with myself. Key separation work streams underway include legal entity Stand Up, IT separation and Stand for our financials, and talent selection. A current priority, along with our board, is to complete executive leadership appointments for electronics and water along with corporate governance aspects including board appointments. We currently anticipate announcements in early 2025.\nWe are also making progress towards the future capital structures of the three intended companies. Specifically, during June we redeemed $650 million of our 2038 bonds and entered into new interest rate swaps to hedge the rate risk on our longer dated maturities. To the extent that it becomes necessary to repay these bonds, the new swaps hedge the risk of higher debt repayment costs that would occur in a lower interest rate environment. So while it is still early in the process, you can see that the separation work is progressing along, and we look forward to updating you as we move forward. Before I turn it over to Antonella, I'd like to mention one of the updates detailed in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today, specifically around the South Carolina MDL.\nNow that the water district settlement has become final, the court has indicated a focus on the personal injury cases. Earlier this year, the court ordered cases not involving one of the eight medical conditions to be dismissed by August 22nd unless certain evidence is presented. About half of the 6,000 cases pending on June 30th are expected to be dismissed on that basis. They can be re-filed over the next four years if those evidence requirements are later met. We do not, however, expect any trials in 2024 in the South Carolina MDL. With that, let me turn it over to Antonella, who will provide additional details on our financial results and outlook.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks Ed and good morning everyone. I'm excited to be here today and honored to serve as CFO of DuPont. Turning to Slide 5, I will cover our second quarter financial highlights in further detail. Our second quarter results were clearly encouraging. Volume recovery is a key driver of our improved Q2 financial performance. Additionally, our ongoing commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence as well as continued savings from restructuring actions announced last November are also contributing to top line growth, margin expansion, and cash flow improvement.\nNet sales of $3.2 billion increased 2% versus the year ago period as a favorable portfolio benefit of 4% reflecting the Spectrum acquisition was partially offset by a 2% currency headwind. Organic sales were flat as a 2% increase in volume was offset by a 2% decrease in price.\nHigher volume was driven by broad-based growth in electronics markets within Semi and Interconnect Solutions, with year-over-year reported volumes up more than 20% and mid-teens, respectively. These gains were partially offset by year-over-year declines in China within Water Solutions, as well as Tyvek Medical Packaging. However, we did see sequential improvement in these areas, as Lori mentioned. On a segment view, E&I organic sales inflected to grow 8%, while W&P organic sales decline moderated to 6%. Organic sales in corporate declined 5% versus the year-ago period. From a regional perspective, Asia Pacific delivered 3% organic sales growth versus the year-ago period, with growth driven by China, where organic sales were up 8%, led by strong growth in E&I.\nIn other regions, North America was down 2%, and Europe was down 7%.\nSecond quarter operating EBITDA of $798 million increased 8% versus the year ago period as volume gains, lower product costs, savings from restructuring actions, and the earnings contribution from Spectrum were partially offset by higher variable compensation.\nOperating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25.2%, up 130 basis points versus the year ago period and up 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter. Additionally, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance as we reported another quarter of strong cash generation and conversion. On a continuing operations basis, cash from operations of $527 million. Less capital expenditures of $102 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $425 million. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 104%.\nTurning to slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.97 per share increased 14% from $0.85 in the year ago period. Higher segment earnings of $0.10 and the benefit of a lower share count of $0.09 were partially offset by lower interest income of $0.05 resulting from a reduction in cash on hand versus the prior year. Other below the line items totaled a net $0.02 headwind as a higher tax rate and depreciation were partially offset by lower exchange losses versus the year ago period.\nOur base tax rate for the quarter was 26.4%, up from 23.7% in the year ago period driven by certain discrete tax expenses as well as geographic mix and earnings. Our full year 2024 base tax rate is now estimated to be at the high end of our prior range or approximately 24%.\nTurning to segment results beginning with E&I on slide 7. E&I's second quarter net sales of $1.5 billion increased 15% versus the year ago period as a Spectrum sales contribution of 9%, and organic sales growth of 8%, were partially offset by a currency headwind of 2%.\nOrganic sales growth of 8% reflects a 10% increase in volume partially offset by a 2% decrease in price.\nAt the line of business level. Organic sales for Semi were up more than 20% driven by continued Semi demand recovery, including AI-driven technology ramps, as well as higher volumes for OLED materials led by new product launches. A resurgence of demand for leading-edge materials requiring higher content, and accelerated buying in support of new fab capacity primarily in China also contributed to the volume increase in the second quarter. Overall Semi fab utilization improved from the first quarter, with average utilization in the mid-70s.\nWithin Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up low-teens driven by mid-teens volume gains reflecting continued broad-based growth, consumer electronics recovery, incremental share gains, and a demand benefit from AI-driven technology ramps. We also saw earlier than expected timing of orders within certain consumer electronics markets that helped volumes in Q2.\nAs expected, organic sales for industrial solutions were down low double digits due primarily to ongoing destocking for Kalrez and biopharma markets. On a sequential basis, sales for industrial solutions increased 9% during the second quarter, including an improvement in Kalrez and biopharma.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $419 million was up 20% versus the year ago period, driven by volume growth and the impact of increased production rates in both Semi and Interconnect Solutions, savings from restructuring actions, and the earnings contribution from Spectrum. These gains were partially offset by lower volume in industrial solutions and higher variable compensation.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 27.8% increased 120 basis points versus the year ago period.\nTurning to slide 8, W&P second quarter net sales of $1.4 billion declined 7% versus the year ago period due to a 6% organic sales decline, of which 4% related to volume and 2% related to price, as well as a 1% currency headwind. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period on lower volume driven mainly by channel inventory destocking for Tyvek Medical Packaging. However, we did see a sequential increase of more than 20% in this end market, confirming a recovery is in process.\nWithin Water Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits versus the year ago period, driven primarily by lower volumes resulting from distributor inventory destocking. Market conditions in Water Solutions also improved during the second quarter with net sales up 12% sequentially, which was ahead of our expectations and driven primarily by an initial recovery in China.\nShelter Solutions sales increased low single digits on an organic basis due to demand improvement in construction markets compared to the prior year period. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $344 million was down 7% due to lower volumes and higher variable compensation, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs, and savings from restructuring actions. W&P saw a nice step up sequentially from the first quarter in both the top and bottom line with nearly 50% incremental margin.\nMoving to our outlook on Slide 9, for the third quarter, we expect net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS to increase sequentially to approximately $3.2 billion, $815 million, and $1.03 per share respectively. For the full year 2024, we are raising our guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS at the midpoint of the revised ranges provided we now expect full year net sales of about $12.45 billion, operating EBITDA of about $3.085 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.75 per share. Our full year net sales guide reflects about $50 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds in the second half of the year versus prior guidance assumptions, which are expected to be partly offset by a sales contribution from the Donatelle acquisition, which closed earlier this week.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nIf you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue.

Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Lori and Antonella. Yeah.\nGood to hear you on the call. Congrats, whoever'd like to take it. I've just loved to, yeah, just love to drill a little bit more into electronics. You know, a couple things you said were quite interesting. First, maybe is there any kind of inventory rebuild that's going on in that market or is this growth, you think, you know, clearly indicative of what end demand is? I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit for us, what, you know, in the context of DuPont AI-driven demand really means, how significant it might be, content per chip, or anything that you could give to provide some perspective on that question.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Good morning, Jeff, maybe to your first question. So, yeah, the majority of the growth that we saw within the Semi and ICS business was just market recovery, but there was probably about $30 million of pre-buy, especially within Asia Pacific as some of the new fabs come online. So you know that that drove the Q2 performance up a little bit and then it will mute a little bit the ramp into Q3 in the back half of the year. But overall still really nice recovery in the electronics space. As we had noted, a lot of it is coming from the AI acceleration that's felt in both the Semi and the ICS business. In total, AI is about $250 million of sales for us today. So a lot of improvement to be able to drive growth there.\nLike I had mentioned, it's built across the board in Semi as well as ICS on the packaging and the thermal management side.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nAlso on the consumer side of electronics. I think there was a comment about orders being stronger. Is that just some timing issues there? You know, there's certainly some hope that there's a stronger iPhone cycle here into the holidays. Is that what you're starting to see? Any other color there would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we did.\nSo the $30 million of pre-buy was probably about $20 million in Semi and about $10 million of Interconnect. So on the Interconnect side, it would be a little bit of a timing shift for some of the premium smartphone deliveries.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nPam, next question please.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning, everybody. Ed and Lori. Antonella. Chris, it's good to.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMorning,\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nLori, Antonella. Good to have you guys leading the call here.\nYou're welcome. I wanted just to dig in a little bit on price. I was expecting price to be down in E&I, but maybe not necessarily in W&P. Is that mostly kind of a pass through in like Tyvek? What are the, I'm trying to picture why price would come down in water, I guess, but perhaps it's just kind of the comps and how you had to raise price into that big inflation pickup at the beginning last year.\nMaybe just some color there would be helpful.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nSure, Scott. Its Antonella. So just a couple quick things that I would mention. I think it's important to keep in mind, particularly in W&P, we had some really strong pricing over the last couple of years, and I would say, you know, particularly there's a few businesses where our pricing over the last two years was about in the mid-teens that more than compensated for any of the cost increases that we saw. So it's not unlikely that we would see a couple of points that we would kind of give back really more just so to maintain share. So to your point, it's really the timing of the price increases that we had.eOkay, that's what I thought. Just going back to Jeff's question, and this is just, you know, I'm not an expert in electronic chemicals at all, but is it the same product mix going into AI applications? Is it AI, I assume it's higher volumes per chipset, et cetera, but is it the same product or are there variations of that?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. It's the same product.\nIt's just more content into the space because of the advanced nodes. So the advanced nodes have more stacks and more thermal management requirements that require more of our material. One rule of thumb that we point out is in the Semi space, MSI is a typical indicator of market growth, and we would be 200 to 300 basis points above market growth because of the advanced node exposure that we have. So they need more material to be able to produce the higher end chips.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, that makes sense. That's what I thought. So thank you. Best of luck.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYou're welcome. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey guys, good morning.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCongrats to everyone in the room there.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nThank you.\nJust on the guidance. What is kind of normal seasonality now for EBITDA? It looks like it should be up mid single digits, quarter-to-quarter, at least that's kind of what it did last year. But you're more in recovery mode, it feels like. So not unclear to me why it would only be up a couple percent like you have it guided.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I think to your point, we haven't.\nYeah.\nSo I think you have to go.back a couple years to kind of see the more normal seasonality pattern that would exist. So if you go back, it's probably more about a $50 to $100 million lift from Q2 to Q3, and then normally about $100 million decline from Q3 to Q4. So this year's recovery is muting that. And also the pre-buy in Q2 is muting that a bit from Q2 to Q3. So about $30 million. But our decline Q3 to Q4 is muted down to about $50 million in the guide because of the continued recovery that we see across the board. So, you know, seasonally is a bit challenging to your point, whenever you're having market inflections, but that's what's baked into our number.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Okay. Got it.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nIf you take away the pre-buy.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYep.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Yeah. Like if you take away the pre-buy, then you would see more of the normal seasonality.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, that makes sense. And then, Ed, you mentioned the change in the PFAS item there. Where do we stand on State AG as well as just remind us what the other major moving items around PFAS actually are, and how significant this South Carolina news is in the context of what's remaining here.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYeah, Steve, there's really two buckets left. Obviously, we settled the big one on the water district cases; the two buckets left are for the State AG cases and the personal injury cases. I think the comment we made this morning on the PI cases is fairly significant because it reduces the cases from about 6,000 down to about 3,000. Remember, this is not like some of the other settlements we did where we had a location and we settled because we had used PFAS. In this case, this is because of firefighting foam again, so only 3,000 cases.\nThis goes back to what the plaintiff also said in our settlement, that we are probably responsible for 3% to 7% as a consortium group and we're only 1/3 of the 3% to 7%.\nSo I think you can wrap your head around a number that's pretty reasonable here.\nI don't think.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nI guess for PFAS more broadly, though, I mean, for the other guys that are involved, the ones with the larger exposures, I mean, I would assume that it's kind of a similar impact to those guys as well. No. Is there any reason why, you know, judging how injured somebody actually is, is different from company to company when it just comes to the basic injury, if you will.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nOh, no, I think the difference is just to distinguish that we didn't make firefighting film.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nSo if you made it, you're in a different little bit of a category. But we did not make it. So which is, I think, why our percent by the plan is just 3% to 7% and we're 1/3 of that.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAnd then any update on State AG?\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nPretty nice news.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nAny update on State AG?\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nI don't expect, Steve, any settlement this year, but we are working hard to settle as much of the rest of PFAS as we can by the time of the spins to get them out, you know, clean. So we're working hard at it.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, you're always working hard. So we appreciate that. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on W&P, just within the guidance and the context, the year-on-year comps get easier. So you're clearly expecting some growth there in the second half, but it kind of seems like you're guiding things somewhat flattish from a sales and EBITDA perspective.\nI'd be curious, are you seeing continued improvement from destocking or are you not? And what are your assumptions around that?\nThanks.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYep. So, hi, this is Antonella. Just a couple of comments there. So, as we mentioned, you know, we did see a nice lift off of Q1 in both medical packaging in Tyvek as well as in our water business where we saw the biggest impacts of destocking, as we move forward, we do continue to expect that there'll be a little bit more lift in medical packaging as we go through the year. For water, as we mentioned, we actually saw a bigger lift headed into Q2 than we were originally expecting. So that'll be pretty consistent as we head into the third quarter and we'll see a little bit more of a lift in the fourth quarter as well.\nSo overall revenue is relatively flattish as we go into the second half of the year for W&P.\nI would just keep in mind, you know, there's probably a little bit of muted seasonality that we built in in the shelter business just given the soft resi market. Just, you know, we're keeping a close eye on the macros out there. So that's a little bit of a cautious view I would say that we have built into our guidance currently.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nThanks. I guess what about margins, kind of the same line of thought there. I mean, that was a bright spot in the quarter here getting back to kind of year ago margins, the volume still down. Is there something incremental negative on the margin sequentially? Because it seems like you're assuming that's a little bit lower versus what you did in 2Q.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nNo, actually, the margins in W&P are expected to be flattish to up a little bit, actually, as we head into third quarter and expect it to continue to improve as we head into fourth quarter as well.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question, this one regarding the split. So you know, you've had the big announcement this past quarter. I guess can you speak to interest that you may be seeing in some of those assets? You know, sometimes there's not a lot of interest until announcements get made, and then all of a sudden people start lining up. So maybe you can, you can help us to think about that, especially around maybe the water business.\nAnd if not, I guess I'd also ask. It does look like the M&A markets are heating up in a certain, in a couple areas, especially in water. Would you consider bolting on businesses, you know, ahead of the split to any of these other, other assets or is that just, just too, too much to deal with for the organization at this point?\nHow should we be thinking about that?\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYeah. Yes, your last point. No, we wouldn't do anything where we bolt something on to the asset. I don't want to get ahead of ourselves on any speculation of what's going on. But as I said on the last earnings call, John, if there is interest in the water business, we obviously will look at it and study it hard. If there's a better path to creating value for our shareholders, we would clearly do that. And I'll just leave it at that for now.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nOkay, fair enough. And then I guess just a question on the PFAS issue. So look, you guys have been doing a pretty good job of cleaning up the liability so far. Earlier this quarter we had the Chevron decision kind of get overruled by the Supreme Court. I guess I'm wondering what does that do in terms of how you think about the liability and the ability to put that to rest? Does it change kind of the strategy or how you're thinking about that, what that liability might, might mean going forward?\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYeah, so you know, it kind of goes back to the whole Superfund CERCLA issue. To make it very clear, manufacturers of products are not responsible under CERCLA. There's kind of four key categories. If you don't mind me telling you these for a minute, just to clarify this issue. The responsible parties are current owners and operators of facilities where substances are located, past owners of facilities where hazardous substances were disposed, aggregators and generators, persons who arrange for disposal of hazardous substance at a site, and transporters who transported it to those sites. So by the way, there's a Supreme Court case on this just to clarify it more.\nAn entity will not be held liable as an arranger merely for selling a new and useful product if the purchaser of that product later and unbeknownst to the seller disposes of the product in a way that led to contamination. So I think it's pretty darn clear, as we've said all along, that we don't have responsibility under this.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the clarity.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYep.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. On the spinoff, will we have to wait until the SEC filings for the income statements and debt allocations to the SpinCo, or do you think DuPont will begin reporting more like a holding company and give us electronics and water at least summary income statements, summary balance sheets before the SEC filings?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we intend to report in the new structure prior to the Form 10. Detailed filings would go out. So we're targeting, you know, sometime early next year to have leadership appointments and then ultimately report on the new segments would be the future spin.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nOkay. Will new DuPont ex-spin report medical or health as a separate segment or is it going to continue to be split across industrial and safety? I think it's going to be over 25% of new DuPont, but it's a little hard to see in the current reporting.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah.\nSo we will most likely have three reportable segments for Remainco, one of which is Healthcare, which would be the combination of Tyvek, Spectrum, the Liveo Biopharma business, and now Donatelle, given that acquisition closed. And the other two reportable segments would be a next-gen mobility which would house all of our EV automotive exposure. And then the remaining would be generally the safety business, the shelter business, and the rest of the printing businesses and industrial businesses, industrial solutions that aren't Semi related.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nFantastic. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC,\n\nGreat.\nThank you so much. Just two quick questions on E&I. The first is, do you mind just kind of, as we enter into the second half? Can you just offer a little bit more color on Semitech? Just given some of your commentary around the broader strokes. But if we dig into pad slurries, you mentioned all the materials in your PR as well as the PowerPoint. Can you just help us conceptualize how we are trending into 2025, 2026, and perhaps into a larger upcycle? Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so we expect nice high single digit growth in the current quarter at E&I as we head into 2025. A lot of that coming from the growth acceleration from AI as well as overall continued pickup within the consumer electronics space. So we think we'll be from a utilization perspective on the Semi front, more in the high 70s as we exit 2024. Overall, it's more like in the low 80s in the advanced nodes and DRAM and then, you know, lower than that in the legacy nodes and some of the more legacy memory applications.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC,\n\nGot it. And Lori, I have to bring it back a couple of years because the follow up is on ICS and specifically Laird. When you originally did that transaction, you kind of mentioned AI as an optionality and obviously you were kind of at the time talking up the shielding, the thermal management portfolio there. Can you just kind of help us think about the ICS business right here as it stands today versus kind of the legacy way of thinking around handsets? It seems like there's perhaps a lot more going on under the hood there in terms of how we should be thinking about sustainable growth rates. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so ICS, I kind of think about it in two big buckets as far as market opportunity is concerned. One is like a powerhouse with respect to Interconnect Solutions and one is a powerhouse with respect to thermal management. And you see opportunity on the three lines of business underneath across both of those segments. And so the Laird acquisition has continued to play out nicely for us and drive opportunity across the ICS portfolio. It's been really timely with the AI boost and the ADAS boost that's coming to have that thermal management business within our portfolio.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nDavid, are you with us?\nPam, you can go to the next.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right.\nOur next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead of Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one on E&I.\nOne on E&I, just strong results mostly across the board with the exception of maybe industrial. You called out the one headwind around kind of ongoing Kalrez destocking. I just wanted to dig into that. So is your volumes, your sense broadly consistent with end market trends for the product or is there any competitive dynamics impacting Kalrez specifically there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo, no, there's no competitive dynamics. It's really just the destock from the 2023 high volumes that went on. So there's nothing competitively. We did see nice sequential improvement in Kalrez as we had expected. We actually do forecast a return to volume growth in industrial solutions in total in the back half. So it's really just us getting through the destock in Kalrez and also in the biopharma, which are both in industrial solutions.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay, great. And then just as a quick follow up, maybe question for Antonella on the cash flow statement this quarter. It looks like cash flow from second qufor discontinued operations was a $400 million use of cash in the quarter. Can you just help us understand that?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So keep in mind, as Ed mentioned earlier, we did have the settlement. So really that's predominantly all the cash out of about $408 million related to the MOU settlement.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nOkay, perfect. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nGood morning and nice result. If I could stay on the cash flow side of things. Lori, when you were wearing your prior hat as CFO, there was an expectation that the second quarter cash flow conversion might be lower than the first quarter in part with interest payments. And obviously it came in materially above or nicely above, I should say. So can you speak to the factors behind that as well as what the outlook is in terms of cash flow generation?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so good memory. I had signaled that usually Q2 is a little muted because of the interest payment, which we did pay. It was really a reflection of better working capital performance for the most part. So we had 8% sequential revenue, but we're really able use the working capital headwind. So we've done a really nice job primarily on the inventory front around driving productivity across our businesses to get better at cash. So we're still in that, you know, 90% target range for the year. We're at about 96% quarter to date.\nSo we're in good shape to be able to deliver against the target that we have out there.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nAll right, terrific. Thank you. And then maybe just a second or two in terms of the corporate line, you know, sales were relatively flat sequentially, yet EBITDA picked up materially. Can you talk about the factors there and what your outlook is? Thank you.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, really, that was driven by a bit of our corporate expenses. So there's always a little bit of timing from quarter to quarter. So I would say when you take a look at kind of corporate expenses, we're probably a little heavy in Q1, a little light in Q2, and on average kind of expected where we would typically be. As you kind of look into the second half of the year, as you look at corporate as a segment, we did point out in the materials that we do expect overall less income coming from corporate in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nTerrific. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Huang\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nHi, this is David Huang here for Dave. I guess first Industrial Solutions, when do you expect volumes to recover and turn positive here?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we expect volumes to be up low single digits in the third quarter year-over-year for Industrial Solutions and then more in the low double digit range for the fourth quarter. So we saw a nice inflection sequentially and then we'll see a return to year-over-year volume growth in the second half.\n\nDavid Huang\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nJust on the potential water sale, there is some interested parties there, and sounds like PFAS continue to progress positively. When you talk to potential interested parties, what's the initial thoughts from them in taking over some of the PFAS liabilities? And is there a threshold they're willing to accept or is it in general still a big hurdle for them? And you think if that scenario were to play out, it will not involve any PFAS liability allocation at all?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so we haven't had any conversations on selling the water business. Our intent is still to spin. Each of the three spins will pick up their pro rata share of the EBIT, of the PFAS liability per their trailing 12-month EBITDA underneath the sharing agreement with Corteva\n\nDavid Huang\n\nVice President of Equity Research, Deutsche Bank\n\nOkay, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. Can you give a little bit more detail on the sequential momentum in water and safety solutions sort of into Q3 and how much visibility, is the visibility improving in those two businesses or lead times improving?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nFor the water business, as we mentioned from Q2 to Q3, we do expect it to be, you know, relatively flat. As we get into the fourth quarter, we do expect a sequential increase in terms of the top line, and some of that is just driven by some project-related activity that we have there. In terms of Safety, we did talk about that's where our medical packaging business is within Tyvek. We do expect to see some sequential improvement there as well. I think there, the growth will be a little less muted as we go through the course of the year because there's just a couple, a little other puts and takes within that business.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mike Sison of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. Nice quarter on outlook. Ed, just one question. How do you expect the agencies to assign sort of industry codes for each of the entities of the spin?\nMaybe that would help investors assign the right multiple or comps longer term. I assume you don't expect the entities to get assigned materials or chemicals, but any color on how you think you can help them sort of make that right decision.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nI'll just say it this way, we are going to work hard. You know, the electronics is very clear where that should be and we will work that issue.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nI mean, they're pure play comps in those industries, and there's only a couple key competitors against them that have their market in the water businesses the same way. So that'll be worked.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. And we'll work to get the Remainco SIC code changed as well. So we've been trying ever since we've spun out of DuPont to get a change more to the, you know, multi industrial diversified SIC code. And so I think we continue to make our case that we should not have the chemicals SIC code anymore, and so we'll work that one as well.\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious on the guidance. So you know, you're raising it by looks like around $110 million or so on the EBITDA line for the full year. The Q2 beat was around you know, 80-something million. So $88 million. So you know that remaining kind of $22 million does, you know, it seems like there has, there could be a little bit of seasonal drop off and maybe some moderation in growth.\nI know you mentioned the pre-buy $30 million but anything else you'd call out there as to why you're not raising guidance maybe by a little bit more. Thanks.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nActually, I would say, you know, our raise in our guidance when you kind of take a look at it is not only adding in the Q2 beat but actually a bit more than that as well. So kind of the way to look at it is if you look where our previous guidance was, and to your point, kind of add the beat that we had in the second quarter of around $150 million on the top and $90 million on the bottom. I think you need to keep in mind that FX is an incremental headwind from when we previously gave guidance to the tune of $75 million. And clearly there's an EBITDA impact associated with that as well that is only partially offset by the Donatelle acquisition that's going in.\nSo on a true underlying basis, if you put, you know, FX and acquisitions aside, in addition to the Q2 beat, we are raising the top line close to $100 million and the bottom line, you know, around $30 million or so.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOkay, perfect. Thanks for that clarification. And then I guess just as a quick follow up, as you look into 2025, where are you kind of in that recovery, maybe on E&I, you know, would you say, like, where do you expect fab rates to kind of utilization rates to end the year and do you see those kind of continuing to move up as you move into 2025? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I think we'll end the year overall in utilization in the high 70s. That'll be different between advanced nodes and more legacy nodes. So the advanced nodes should be in the, you know, in the low 80s, and the more mature nodes, which would not quite be at the average. So it sets up well for 2025 to get back to the more normal utilization patterns that exist in the Semi space. As I had noted earlier, we overall probably see high single digit growth in E&I in total in 2025, with a lot of growth coming from continued acceleration with AI on both the data center side as well as on the ICS side.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Alexi Yefremov. Please go ahead.\nMr. Yefremov. Okay.\nNext question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham of Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. Just on the Donatelle acquisition, you know, first maybe talk about the strategic fit there and you know, even potential cross-selling opportunities where it's complementary in the portfolio. And then can you also help us size the transaction and how much earnings contribution we should expect in the second half?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so we'll quote we closed Spectrum earlier this week or Donatelle earlier this week\nIt'll dovetail really nicely with our Spectrum acquisition that we're actually lapping a year on here, August 1st. And so they've got nice exposure to some of the large medical device OEMs that Spectrum did not have. So there's a lot of cross selling opportunity to come in there. They've also got some really nice machining and tooling competencies that will add to the portfolio. In total, the revenue is about 75 million from Donatelle.\nIt's got slightly better margins than what the Spectrum acquisition did. So a nice addition there.\nYeah.\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThe only thing I would add is the $75 million is a full year number, just to clarify.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nYep.\nThank you.\nThen maybe just a clarification on corporate earnings. I think there was a sizable step up into 2Q. I know you mentioned there were some expenses that moved around, but were there.ny areas of strength on the underlying retained businesses, you know, that that helped 2Q, and you know how much lower should back half earnings be on the corporate line?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont",
    "content2": "Yeah. So I would say in the second quarter, in addition to the timing of expenses, we did have, you know, a good strong margin performance in terms of the retained businesses as well. As we shift into the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier, we do expect the overall earnings in corporate to come down. There is a little bit of pressure that we have in terms of our solar business that we have within the retained businesses. So a little bit of earnings headwind related to there and, as I mentioned earlier, a little bit of timing related to actual corporate expense.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. Could I ask quickly on electronics, the timing differences that you called out in the quarter that were favorable to the quarter; are you seeing in your Q3 order book that those are indeed shifted to Q2, or are you just assuming that and then we'll see how the quarter plays out? And then separately, Ed, if I could ask you on the PFAS on the personal injury cases, just a little bit of clarification in terms of sounds like we'll go from 6,000 to 3,000 cases, but has that case count been increasing or has it been static around those levels?\nFirstly, and then secondly, on your comments that DuPont is sort of, I think you said 3% to 6% or 3% to 7% sort of the assumed liability. Is that to mean that that would be your sort of exposure to any payout, should there be any or is that your exposure to the amount of cases?\nAnd lastly on that, how do you expect this to proceed in terms of will something actually go to trial will be the typical MDL where you pick one, and they pick one, and you see what the outcomes are, and then maybe you try to settle, or is there a path to settling ahead of time, or just sort of what you think the process is going to be?\n\nEd Breen\n\nExecutive Chairman, DuPont\n\nYeah, so the cases have crept up over time, but the slope has obviously changed, you know, come down and remember, it's predominantly firefighters. It's, you know, not other individuals. The drop will be at least down to 3,000 cases. And I would just say overall, because it's firefighting foam, it goes back to the last settlement we did where we never made the firefighting foam, but we had one surfactant that went in for 10 or 11 years. So net net, you know, was determined that the exposure of Corteva, Chemours, and us was in the 3% to 7% range. And so I think you can do the math, like we were able to do when we settled the water cases and kind of get this into a certain box. And remember, we're only a 1/3 of 3% to 7%, as I mentioned earlier.\nSo, and by just your kind of one of your last points, obviously, we always try to settle these as a class, like we did the water cases. You know, we'll work hard to do that. I said we would love to clean a lot of this up before the actual separations occur.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, maybe on your order question. So our order book is trending alongside the guide that we had given, so we feel like we're in good shape there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nIt's your cost of goods were down 2% in the quarter.\nCan you provide a little more detail on that such as, were raws down more than that? Your volumes being a little higher might suggest that, you know, raws were down more than that. But more importantly, where do you think that cost of goods year over year is likely to go as we move forward?\n\nAntonella Franzen\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Hi. So it's incidental. So a couple things that I would mention there to keep in mind. So, one, obviously, we are seeing a bit of an impact from the deflation of costs that's in there. Secondly, I would also mention in terms of restructuring, we took a lot of actions as we announced the program last year towards late November. Some of those actions have actually been accelerated. So we are seeing even more of a benefit this year than we were originally anticipating. So, as you may recall, we were first expected we'd have about 100 million of restructuring savings in 2024. We now expect that to be closer to 115 million or so for the year. So that's also helping from a COGS perspective and kind of bringing our costs down.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThen you mentioned on slide 14, a lot of products in development. You mentioned your water business has some standJust a question on that. Is this, you know, one lithium project at a temperate latitude that could be many, many years from now or is there some breadth to this opportunity that you see in lithium?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWe continue to see a nice opportunity. We're actually investing in a facility in Europe to be able to take advantage of as well from a production perspective. So it's still a little early. I mean, the potential market opportunity, you know, on the low end is probably in the $250 million range as we position ourselves as a component supplier into the space.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nSenior Chemicals Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI will now turn the call back over to Chris for closing remarks.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nThank you for joining the call today.

Chris, over to you.\n\nChris McCrae\n\nHead of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q4 2024 Financial Results Conference Call.\nJoining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other Non-GAAP measures.\nA reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included in our press release and presentation materials that have been posted through DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our Q4 2024 financial review. Our results for the period exceeded our expectations, driven by better-than-expected volumes in all segments. Broadly, the first quarter confirmed that we are past the bottom in electronics and on the road to recovery. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 8% in the first quarter and 10% year-over-year, driven by a pickup in underlying chip demand and normalization of customer inventory levels, both slightly earlier than expected. In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a second straight quarter of year-over-year volume growth, with volumes up 4%.\nWe did, however, continue to see channel inventory destocking as expected, resulting in year-over-year revenue declines in certain industrial-based businesses, but we believe those conditions have bottomed and our assumed recovery timing is also consistent with our previous expectations. That said, and given Q1 performance, we are raising our full-year 2024 guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. Lori will further detail the outlook shortly. Compared to a year-ago period, Q1 reported sales of $2.9 billion, declined 3%; operating EBITDA of $682 million, declined 4%; and adjusted EPS of $0.79 per share, declined 6%. We continue to prioritize working capital and delivered significant year-over-year improvement in cash flow during the quarter.\nIn late April, we completed the $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction, launched in February, retiring a total of 6.9 million shares in this tranche and bringing total share repurchases to over 15% of our outstanding shares since November 2022. Turning to slide four, I want to reiterate that we remain excited about the growth potential of our businesses centered around five secular high-growth areas. We are excited about the through-cycle strength of our portfolio as end markets recover from recent destocking headwinds, and our teams continue to focus on operational excellence. Almost 1/3 of sales exposure for our portfolio today is focused on electronics, including leadership positions and strong customer relationships serving semiconductor manufacturing primarily via consumables used in the chip manufacturing process, as well as serving broader consumer-based electronics markets with films, displays, and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs, and tablets.\nWe are very pleased to participate in the AI-driven growth acceleration within electronics via our semi-related products geared towards advanced node chips for data centers and other key AI applications such as mobile products. Electronics end markets have positively inflected, and we expect continued volume pickup in both semi and ICS over the course of 2024. Our water business, at 12% of our portfolio, constitutes a broad range of filtration technologies and operates in markets expected to generate strong growth driven by evolving wastewater regulation and the global response to concerns around water scarcity and circularity. We believe demand for filtration products, which have been impacted by slower project work in China in the last year and associated distributor destocking, has bottomed and will begin to recover later in Q2. We have excellent leadership positions in various end markets within protection and industrial technologies.\nWithin industrial technologies, about 10% of the DuPont portfolio is geared to growing healthcare markets, including Spectrum medical devices, Tyvek medical packaging, and Liveo biopharma consumables. We have seen ongoing solid demand for devices and expect to see recovery in medical packaging beginning later in Q2. Biopharma product demand is expected to recover beginning later in the year after bottoming in recent periods. DuPont's next-generation auto market participation constitutes about 10% of total sales and is geared to advanced technologies enabling secular demand trends for hybrid and electric vehicles within battery, motor, and other applications. Demand for our advanced auto-related products has remained healthy, and we have a global customer base that includes EV customers in each region. We see excellent longer-term opportunity across our auto-related portfolio. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning.\nOur Q4 results were clearly encouraging, with further signs of electronics recovery matched with bottoming across our industrial-based end markets. Additionally, a commitment to drive productivity and operational excellence has minimized incremental margins and has helped to produce significant cash flow improvement in recent quarters. Our results have and will continue to benefit from the restructuring actions announced last November. Turning to slide five, I'll cover our Q4 financial highlights. Net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 3% versus the year-ago period, as a 6% organic sales decline and a 1% currency headwind was partially offset by a favorable portfolio benefit of 4%, primarily from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price.\nLower volume was driven by the impact of continued channel inventory destocking in water solutions, mainly in China, in safety solutions, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging, and in industrial solutions for Kalrez parts and Liveo biopharma products. These declines were partially offset by strong growth in electronics, where semi and interconnect solutions volumes increased 8% in aggregate versus the prior year period. On a segment view, W&P and E&I organic sales declined 10% and 2%, respectively, while organic sales in corporate increased 1%. From a regional perspective, sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year-ago period, with Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific down 8%, 7%, and 4%, respectively. In China, sales volumes were up 3% year-over-year, as growth in E&I more than offset declines in W&P due to continued pressure in water markets.\nQ4 operating EBITDA of $682 million decreased 4%, as volume declines were partially offset by the impact of lower product costs, and Spectrum earnings contribution. Operating EBITDA during the quarter of 23.3% was down 40 basis points versus the year-ago period. I am pleased with our cash flow improvement as we focus our efforts on optimizing working capital performance. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $493 million, plus capital expenditures of $207 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $286 million in the first quarter, a significant increase versus $173 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 86%, significantly ahead of last year. Turning to slide six, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.79 per share decreased from $0.84 in the year-ago period.\nLower segment earnings, higher net interest expense, and higher depreciation more than offset a $0.06 benefit from a lower share count. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, up from 23.4% in the year-ago period, driven by geographic mix in earnings. Our full-year 2024 base tax rate outlook of 23% to 24% remains unchanged. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide seven. E&I Q4 net sales of $1.4 billion increased 5%, as the Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was partially offset by an organic sales decline of 2% and a 1% currency headwind. The organic sales decline reflects a 1% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price due to the pass-through of lower metal prices. Effective with our Q4 reporting, I will highlight that we realigned certain product lines within our three E&I lines of business.\nThe changes streamline our cost structure while also optimizing certain product offerings to better focus on our customers. Additional detail has been provided on slide 15 in the appendix. For the Q1 of 2024, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were up 10% versus the year-ago period due to the start of overall semiconductor market demand recovery, along with normalization of customer inventory levels, and continued strong demand for OLED display materials. We expect underlying semi demand to continue to improve throughout the year and note that our forecast continues to call for semi fab utilization rates to increase from the low 70% that we saw in the first quarter to a Q4 exit rate in the low 80s. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales were up slightly, as mid-single-digit volume gains were mostly offset by the impact of lower metals prices.\nThis was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year volume growth for ICS, as broad electronic markets continued to recover. Organic sales for industrial solutions were down about 20% due primarily to ongoing channel inventory destocking for Kalrez O-rings and for our Liveo product lines within biopharma markets. We continue to expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business, and our Liveo biopharma business is also still expected to recover later in the second half. Operating EBITDA from E&I of $374 million was up 3% versus the year-ago period, driven by strength in semi and interconnect solutions and the earnings contribution from Spectrum, partially offset by the impact of lower volumes in industrial solutions. Turning to slide eight, W&P Q4 net sales of $1.3 billion declined 11% versus the year-ago period due to a 10% decrease in volume and a 1% currency headwind.\nWithin safety solutions, organic sales were down low teens on lower volume, driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. We believe our customers' inventory is close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging. Within water, organic sales were down mid-teens, driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand in China. We continue to have active communication with our distributors and believe orders will pick up towards the end of the second quarter. Shelter solutions were flat on an organic basis compared to the year-ago period, and we expect sequential lifts in the second quarter. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $295 million decreased 14% due to lower volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower product costs. Turning to slide nine, I'll provide an update on our full-year 2024 guidance, as well as our expectations for the second quarter.\nWe are raising our full-year guidance for net sales, operating EBITDA, and adjusted EPS. At the midpoint of the revised ranges provided, we now expect full-year net sales of about $12.25 billion, operating EBITDA of about $2.975 billion, and adjusted EPS of $3.60 a share, which now indicates expected year-over-year earnings growth. For the second quarter of 2024, we expect net sales of about $3.025 billion, operating EBITDA of about $710 million, and adjusted EPS of $0.84 per share. The sequential sales and earnings lift in the second quarter assumes volume improvement driven by favorable seasonality in both ICS and shelter, continued electronics recovery, and reduced destocking impacts in water and medical packaging.\nYear-over-year sales and earnings growth in the second half, embedded within our full-year guidance, is expected to be driven by further electronics market recovery, including continued improvement in semiconductor fab and PCB utilization rates, along with a return to volume growth in W&P. Second-half earnings drivers include both volume improvement as well as expected mixed benefits. With that, I'll turn it back to Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Lori. I'd like to note that we published our annual sustainability report earlier this week, highlighting the work of our global team to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG, and I'm pleased with the progress and speed with which we are advancing our 2030 goals. There are three dimensions to our sustainability strategy: innovation, protecting people and the planet, and empowering employees and communities. I'd like to mention just a few recent accomplishments.\nMore than 80% of our innovation portfolio is expected to advance our customer sustainability roadmap. This is a critical metric that aligns our product development with customers' expectations for both performance and sustainability. We were pleased to be recognized for this commitment by Samsung Electronics, which awarded us as a Best ESG Partner this past year. On climate, we delivered another year of strong performance, surpassing our 2030 goals, which are aligned with the ambition of the Paris Accord. This past year, we achieved a 58% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from a 2019 baseline, exceeding our 2030 goal of 50%. And we achieved a 39% reduction from the 2020 baseline in Scope 3 emissions, also ahead of our 2030 goal.\nThis past year, we made strong progress in the continued deployment of a company-wide operational excellence framework designed to drive continuous improvement and productivity, including deployment of standardized tools, best-in-class technologies, and practices that enhance workflows, reduce errors, minimize waste, and improve safety. Related to this, 2023 was our safest year on record for employees and contractors. Finally, our strong governance practices underpin our sustainability strategy, as we remain committed to transparent reporting on our policies and performance with oversight from our board. A key focus in 2023 was strengthening the DuPont Supplier Code of Conduct with our new Responsible Supplier Program. These are just a few of the many great examples in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you wish to ask a question, please press Star followed by number one on your telephone keypad. That is Star one to ask a question. We please ask that you please keep it to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning again, Lori. I hope everybody's well. Good morning, Jeff. Hey, good morning. Hey, Ed, good to see the bottom is apparently in here. And really, the nature of my question is, you did a lot of hard work trying to protect margins and minimize decrementals through this protracted period of volume declines.\nNow that we're heading the other way, I just wonder if you could give us any perspective on, I don't know, costs that need to come back or how you feel about structural costs? And maybe the punchline is just a little bit of guidance on your incrementals as we think about volumes going the other way in E&I. \\\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Jeffrey, so the cost actions we took, the bulk of them will stay in place. I would say out of the $150 million we did and we announced in November, we'll get about 100 of that cost savings this year.\nI would say out of the 150, though, if you get into 2025 and we're really cranking along in all our end markets, we probably bring back about $30 or 40 million of cost, which is kind of on the factory footprint side, where we'll weed out a little bit of cost there. So that would be it. A little bit probably in 2025 on comp because we didn't pay out at 100% on our bonus plans. And probably won't be. It could be 100% this year, so maybe that comp year-over-year won't be that different, but certainly from last year, 2023, a little bit of that headwind there in 2024, potentially not in 2025. Incrementals in the second half of the year, maybe just give you that for us as we start bouncing back here.\nRemember, we get some absorption benefit, obviously, because of the improvement in our sales rate. Our incrementals are planned to be around 56% in the second half of the year. I also think, Jeff, we've de-risked the second half of the year now with the baseline we're working off of now. We only have to ramp $340 million in sales first half to second half, which is 6%. Our EBITDA is planned in our guidance to ramp about 14%. That gets you to 56% incremental. So I think it's significantly de-risked from potentially where we were.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, and the 56% is first half, second half. If you look at our margin profile in the second half versus the first half in the applied guide, it is up almost 200 basis points into the low 25% range, which is a nice tailwind as we head into 2025.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, and Jeffrey, maybe just one other because the electronics is bouncing back nice. We've always consistently quarter in, quarter out ran that business at like 31% to 32% EBITDA margins. Going forward, remember with Spectrum in there, we pressed the EBITDA margins just because it's a great business, but they're a little bit lower than the average. So it brings it down to like 100 basis points. But having said that, we should be able to run that business as we're cranking back at like 32% EBITDA margin as we get into 2025.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. And actually, the follow-up question that's going to play into the margin calculus also. Just think about kind of electronics over time, parts of it sort of being a price-down market, naturally, nature of the business.\nBut when we think of some of the more sophisticated things going on in semi and the like, and maybe other places in the E&I portfolio, how do you feel about your ability to get price or to avoid price down over time in these businesses?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Well, Jeffrey, usually the price down is 1%. That's kind of what we've averaged, so it's not really significant. Having said that, more and more of this portfolio over the next set of years is going to be advanced nodes with all the AI coming. And by the way, the AI then moving down into mobile devices. And as you know, we're advantaged there. That's how we always outgrow MSI by 200 to 300 basis points. So as more of the business skews there, hey, that helps our margins just from a mixed perspective.\nBut we also get price on the more advanced platforms that we have in electronics. So ICS will probably still lose price. That's more our PCB stuff, the laminates, displays, and all that. We'll lose a little bit of price, but I got to think we'll do a little better on the chip side.\n\nJeffrey Sprague\n\nManaging Partner and Senior Equity Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. Thanks for the color.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYep. Thanks, Jeffrey.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHi, good morning. Hey, good morning, Steve. I think you guys had said you expected like a 10% sequential bounce off the first quarter. This is a little the EBITDA, I mean, good first quarter, but the EBITDA in quarter over quarter is a little bit lower than that, more like 4% or 5%, I guess, on your guide. And anything that changed that view?\nWas there anything pulled forward in the first quarter that kind of takes out of the second quarter, or just conservative?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nNo. Yeah, no, I think it was more a reflection of the overdelivery of Q1. So originally, when we said a 10% sequential lift, we were guiding to Q1 of $610. So it got you roughly to $670. So delivering the $682 mutes the ramp a little bit, but we still are now at $710 versus the original $670. So no, actually some upside to the expectations that we had back in February when we gave that number.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. And is there anything that is a little worse than you would have expected? It seems like, obviously, electronics is coming along really nicely. The other stuff may be a little more sticky on the industrial side.\nAnything that is kind of standing out is just not coming along as you would have expected on the industrial business recovery?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo, Steve, it's pretty much as we said last quarter. Shelter will be up sequentially first to second, mostly because of seasonality, but that clearly had bottomed out already. The water, by the way, we just had our manager of our water business over in China the last two weeks, and they're saying they're going to start placing more orders towards the back end of this quarter. So that feels the same. Same with the healthcare medical packaging business towards the end of this quarter, beginning of next quarter. And the only two that are delayed on their bottom, by the way, but they haven't recovered yet.\nBut this is no change from what we said before: our biopharma business looks more like the back half of the calendar year, and our Kalrez business looks like a second-half recovery. So pretty much in line. By the way, the one other bright spot I liked, we had been negative on growth in China through last year, and we had 3% growth in China. So that market has been slowly turning back up for us. And by the way, that 3% was predominantly because the electronics business turned. We were up 15% in E&I in China in the first quarter. So that's turned nicely for us. And our semi customers in China were ordering at about that; that was about that same rate, sales rate, about 15% growth, including the local China semi customers, not the multinational. So that was good to see.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nOkay. And then just to ask quickly, any updates on price ROS spread for you guys? I know it's less important these days, but any update there? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we did have a little more favorability than what we thought in Q1 that we believe will hold for the year that contributed partially to the Q1 beat. So if you look at the Q1 beat, it was about 110 million or so on revenue and then about 70 million on earnings. So obviously, we got some upside there outside of volume, and that was primarily better price cost spread.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research LLC\n\nHey, good morning, Ed, and Lori, and Chris.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nMorning, Scott.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research LLC\n\nThis may be hard to define explicitly, Ed, but you've mentioned a couple of quarters in a row, the AI chip and data center benefit in E&I. Help us understand the materiality when you think about new chip designs and such and the content of your product that's going to be needed. Does it structurally raise the growth rate, do you think, over, call it a five-year period, or is there enough to stuff get cannibalized and it kind of nets out to a slight positive, but perhaps I don't know? I just have no idea. So I'll ask you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So the data center size for us is about $700 million of our revenue and $250 million of that, a ballpark. It's kind of hard to tell exactly, Scott, but about $250 million of that is AI-specific, and that is growing north of 20% right now, that base.\nI do think it's skewed. Look, I think we're going into a super cycle in semiconductor here over the next decade because of all this AI. And remember, the AI now, everyone's going to push it down into your devices. So it's going to be a pretty broad-based growth market. My gut is in next year, I don't want to get into forecast yet for 2025, but I got to imagine the E&I business is going to grow high single digits in 2025. And we're expecting Fab utilization to start the year in the low 70s, exiting the year in the low 80s. And I would think we're probably in the low 90s by the middle of next year. And that would give us that high single-digit growth rate.\nAnd then the AI chips, by the way, really help us because it's a higher margin business in our mix. So it should tee up for a really nice 2025. But that market's going to continue to grow north of 20% here, and it's got a long cycle coming up.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research LLC\n\nOkay. So material for sure. So just to back up a little bit in Water Solutions in China, I know it's a little minutiae, but was there a pre-buy or some sort of, I don't want to call channel stuffing because that's not what I mean, but was there some sort of weird behaviors that that customer ended up with so much excess inventory? Is it purely just the macro turned a little sideways or down on the folks, and they were caught with extra inventory?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So it wasn't one customer, Scott, just to clarify.\nI don't know if you meant it that way. We have many distributors, but four main distributors in China that do the bulk of our business that we don't do direct, by the way. We do a lot of direct business too. I think what I mean, what they verbalized to us, obviously, and again, our team was just there with them this past week, is industrial production slowed down. They were ordering at a higher rate, and they had to go through a destock. The destock, by the way, is not as long as some of the other destocks. It looks like if it's ending here at the end of this quarter, it was about five, six months of kind of working their inventories back down. So we think we're in pretty good shape going into Q3 here.\nAnd again, we expect orders to start coming in kind of in the June timeframe to start picking up there. So it was more of the macro, I guess I would say, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research LLC\n\nOkay. Fair enough. Thank you, Ed, Lori, Chris. Appreciate it. Good luck this year.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThank you.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research LLC\n\nNext quarter.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nAll right. See you.\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Roberts of Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThank you. Just one from me. Maybe Lori, you could give us an update on adhesives, multibase, and Tedlar. I would have thought they'd be down like your industrial segment, and they've got some auto exposure there, which was probably weak. But actually, corporate sales were up 1% year over year. What's going on there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we continue to see strength on the EV side of auto.\nSo as you had mentioned, overall auto builds are weaker right now, but there's still a lot of upside within the EV side. So that was up double digits in the quarter, and we expect that to stay for the year. A lot of the upside in the volume in the quarter came from Tedlar, which is in the photovoltaic space. So we had really nice volumes within Tedlar that gave us the 1% organic for the quarter.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho Financial Group, Inc.\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question from Chris Parkinson of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. Just want to turn to the ICS side. You've seen a bit of a market share shift between Chinese OEs versus the Americans and the Northeast Asians. And I know you have exposure everywhere. And at the same time, you've also seen an increase in the sophistication of Chinese handsets.\n\nDavid Brown\n\nAnalyst, Aiera\n\nSo can you just kind of parse through that in terms of where the market is right here, right now, and how the street should be thinking about your relative content exposures and how we should think about that business recovering throughout 2024 and perhaps 2025? Thank you so much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWell, I think it's, Chris, maybe just high level. If you go back to the middle of last year, the PCB utilization rates were kind of all the way down in the mid-40s. In the first quarter, they're kind of in the mid-50s. We think we exit the year in the low 60s. In the second half of the year, we'll kind of be in the low 60s. And normal, by the way, for PCB utilization rates is kind of low 70s. They never run in the 90s like the semis do.\nSo you can kind of see the progression of that plan out here kind of over the next year.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We continue to see wins within the metallization space more on the circuitry side. So we've seen a nice volume lift in the first quarter, and we expect that to be maintained for the rest of the year. And we have had some share gains outside of that in the premium smartphone space on both the phone side and then the other device side as well with PCs and others.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nGot it. And Lori, my favorite question as a follow-up is on W&P margins. I mean, obviously, over the last few quarters, there have been a bunch of put and takes, inclusive of the destocking.\nBut with that progressively improving throughout 2024, can you help us just give us the latest and greatest on how you're thinking about the long-term margin optionality in terms of op efficiencies, leverage, mix, so on and so forth? Thank you so much.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We still see the entitlement for W&P margins in that 27% range. And so, as you know, they've been challenged in the first quarter, really a function of the lower volumes. There's a lot of heavy assets in that business that take a hit when the volumes are down. We've done a nice job controlling costs to minimize the decrementals to low levels, but that is impacting it. And then the larger impact comes from just the mix side.\nSo the Tyvek business is down primarily because of the medical packaging destock that's going on that we expect to start to see resolution here at the end of this quarter and then improvement as we head into the back half. And so when you start to see those two items wane, we do see nice margin improvement, first half, second half. So the first half margins will probably stay at that 23% level. And then we see them ticking up about 100 basis points as we get to the back half of the year.\n\nChris Parkinson\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Wolfe Research, LLC\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nEd, you only raised the four-year guidance by the amount of the Q1 beat.\nIs that because it's still early in the year, or are you a little more cautious on the back half demand environment?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. David, no change on our thinking on the back half. It's just, as I said earlier, I feel good. We've de-risked the ramp in the year. So I don't feel any different about it. And hopefully, it ends up being a little bit conservative, but.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nVery good. And can you just provide us another update on PFAS right now? Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Nothing significantly new there, David. The next thing coming up that we would want to settle is the state AG cases. I don't think that'll be a 2024 event. I think it's more of a 2025 event. And then there's probably a couple of states that we will settle separately from the class action. It's where we had locations set.\nSo I think you might potentially see one or two of those get settled maybe during this calendar year. So that's where it's at. I think, David, the good news with the settlement, by the way, the other settlement is done now. The water district is totally done, signed off by the judge. And I think the nice thing about that when it comes to all the firefighting film is that it became very clear in that litigation and in what was written about it that the exposure of the consortium of Corteva, DuPont, and Chemours is 3% to 7% of the total exposure. And then remember, DuPont's 1/3 of the 3% to 7%. So I think that helps box in what these numbers are going to be as we settle the other cases.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question from Michael Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you. Good morning, guys.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Barclays\n\nFirst question I wanted to ask on W&P, I wanted to ask about price. It seems like it's holding in, I'd say, fairly well despite double-digit volume declines the past few quarters. So what's your expectation for price? Should we expect this to stay relatively flat as we move through the year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So yeah, we delivered flat price overall in W&P in the quarter. We still have some expectation to give back 1% or 2% primarily in the shelter business as we go throughout the year. But we have done a really nice job, as you had mentioned, holding on to price.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then bigger picture, Ed, how is Spectrum performing relative to your initial expectations?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nRight on what we told our board. It's nice to see they are basically not going through a destock, which is good. And I think we've told you this before. The business is growing nicely, but there's also a major ramp going on with one key medical device company. And that ramp, by the way, it was a very significant ramp. So that was the one area we've been watching really close. And they are ramping very nice with that customer. It's more of a manufacturing ramp we had to go through that was pretty significant. And that's on track also. So feeling good about that. And it's clearly an area we like. It's between Tyvek medical packaging, the Spectrum business, and the Liveo business. It's a really nice percentage of our portfolio now, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks. So it's 10% of the company.\nAnd it's just a nice end market, stable end market to be in with a very solid, steady growth rate. So we're really liking that business.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector and Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Spector of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question here. Curious if you could talk about your expectation on buybacks versus M&A. I know you talked about no M&A in 2024 kind of through the September period. Can you extend that through the rest of this year and maybe think about '25 in terms of your total capital allocation?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I would think, so we're not planning on any acquisition this year. If when we do one, I would think it's more in the tuck-in size. We're not looking at anything big. We would love to add to the healthcare platform.\nThere's a fair amount of what I call tuck-in opportunities there. So I mean, it's possible we could do one this year, but it's not really in our plans. Our team, Lori and I have said that the team's all hands on deck operationally as we were going through the destock. That was our focus area. We still have an outstanding ASR. We just completed the one $500 million ASR. We have one more to do. We would plan on doing that, obviously, this year. Then after that, I think we'll be a nice mix of some tuck-in acquisition. Depending where our stock price is, I've always been a pretty big share repurchaser when I feel our stock or our multiples not where it should be. I don't think you'll see any change in our thinking there.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nDirector of Equity Research, UBS\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Josh.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question from Michael Sison of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi. This is Michael. So I just wanted to ask in terms of the guidance for the full year and what you're seeing in terms of demand and destocking coming to an end, should we expect year-over-year volume growth starting in the third quarter? Or how are you looking at volumes in the second half of the year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. In the guide that we gave, we do see a return to volume growth in the second half. It ramps as you go from Q3 to Q4, really just a comp because Q4 was our weakest quarter last year. But yeah, we will be returning to growth from both a volume and an earnings perspective in the second half.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Great.\nAnd then just in terms of your comments on China recovering, was that more specific to E&I? Or maybe we can talk about what you're seeing on the water solution side because you do cite that industrial demand remains weak in China. But I guess you're saying it's recovering better than you thought?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. No change there. The volume uptick that we saw in China in Q1 was primarily E&I. As Ed had mentioned, we are up kind of mid-teens for volumes in China. We still do see industrial weakness that's impacting W&P primarily in the water space. No change to our expectations that we will get the orders in from the key distributors towards the end of this quarter and be able to ship those to see a ramp sequentially in water and then a further ramp as you head into H2.\n\nMichael Sison\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question from Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Your line is open. Yes.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Fermium Research LLC\n\nHi. Good morning. Lori, if I could follow up on a free cash flow question. What are your expectations? You did 86% free cash flow conversion in Q1. What are your expectations for 2024?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I think we'll be at or near our target of greater than 90%. So I was really pleased with the Q1 performance of 86%. That's a sizable improvement from where we were last year, which was around 45%. I do expect to take a little bit of a dip down in Q2, really reflecting the payment of our biannual interest expense. So that's about $200 million. We pay it in May and in November. So we'll see a headwind in Q2.\nBut overall, I expect us to deliver nice free cash flow conversion for the year, really around the target.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Fermium Research LLC\n\nTerrific. And Ed, you commented multiple times on how progress that you're seeing, the progress in Asia, especially in China. The year-over-year negative deltas has been lessening down to 4% organic decline in Q1. Are you anticipating that to be flatter up in Q2 and beyond in terms of the year-over-year comp?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We expect overall China to be both price, volume, and currency headwinds about flat for the year. So as you had mentioned, the Q1 numbers, we were up in volume, but overall, it was about flat with the currency headwinds. So yes, improvement in volume that we expect to see and then some currency headwinds as the year goes on.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Fermium Research LLC\n\nUnderstood. Thanks so much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Frank.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Patrick Cunningham of Citi. Your line is open.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nLet's go to the next one.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nYes. Thank you. The three-year stack on volumes in your Water and Protection segment is flat. The losses over the last four or five quarters essentially offset the gains in 2021, and you had kind of flat volumes in 2022. So just a question about that. Do you see that as suggesting just modest underlying volume growth, or do you think that there might be some losses to generic products in that segment? And did you have visibility on those inventory levels that have been destocked now?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I mean, I think the history has been impacted a lot by COVID.\nSo we saw an unwind of the garments that were a sizable benefit during the 2020 timeframe. Then you saw an unwind, not unlike most of the peers out there that saw a run-up from the garment perspective. And then once we moved through that, then we transitioned into the general industrial destock. So I think we need to look into 2025 to really get a good read on the volumes in that business. And right now, we're expecting low to mid-single-digit volume growth in 2025 off of a more normal macro. So no concerns overall around the efficacy of those products in the market. It's really just getting beyond those chunky one-timers around COVID and then the broader industrial destock to be able to see the true growth profile of that business.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAnd then Kalrez and Tedlar, these are both fluoropolymer products. Just a question for you on that.\nDo you have any customers that are saying, \"I'm going to switch to something else just to avoid the fluoropolymer issue\"? And how are you managing your own wastewater from the manufacturing of those products?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nNo. I mean, in fact, in Tedlar, we're actually seeing some questions around it as a PFAS-free. So there's some opportunity there to maybe pick up some share on the advanced materials side or the PV side and be opportunistic. So no, no direct feedback from customers. And obviously, we published our sustainability report earlier this week. There's a lot of examples in there around our commitments to that, as well as just overall water key drivers around the sustainability footprint.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our last question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies LLC. Your line is open.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\nGood morning. Just a quick one on the electronics side.\nHow far do you see the growth trajectory for that business, or how much can you expand it before you need to do a significant round of CapEx additions?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. The good news on the E&I side, by the way, which is very different than the W&P side, is they're not heavy assets. More of our CapEx on the electronics side, Laurence, actually goes into our testing equipment. We have to have very state-of-the-art testing equipment in the key regions where our customers are. And so that's where we'll add some CapEx over time. But we kind of modularly upgrade the electronics manufacturing location. So that's not going to be a big CapEx spend for us. But my gut is we'll be looking at some expansion work here as we see this kind of supercycle coming on the semi side.\nSo that's, by the way, if this were our Tyvek business, as you know, we're launching line eight over in Luxembourg. We've already done our first test runs of product, by the way, which has gone very well. But that project was $450 million. We don't have anything like that on the electronics side. So that's good. And it's quicker to upgrade the manufacturing capacity also on the electronics side. So we'll stay on top of that as we see this growth over the next set of years come.\n\nLaurence Alexander\n\nEquity Analyst, Jefferies Financial Group Inc.\n\nOkay. Great. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThank you, Laurence.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. So I'd like to hand the call back to Chris McRae. Okay.\n\nChris McCrae\n\nHead of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nThank you, everybody, for joining the call. We appreciate your interest. And as always, we'll post a copy of the transcript on the DuPont IR website. This concludes the call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat does conclude our conference for today.

I will now turn the call over to Chris Mecray. You may begin your conference.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q4 and Full Year 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We've prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the investor relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We'll also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials and has been posted to DuPont's investor relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining our Q4 and full year 2023 financial review. This morning's earnings release is consistent with the preliminary results announced on 24 January and we have added our customary segment detail and end market color while also providing incremental detail on our 2024 financial forecast. Broadly, we continue to see encouraging stabilization within electronics markets. Our Semiconductor Technologies business reported sequential sales growth of 2% in the Q4 as expected as the first sign of getting past the bottom at chip production. In Interconnect Solutions, we saw a return to year-over-year volume growth with volumes up 2% versus the prior year after sales bottomed earlier in 2023.\nHowever, as we finished 2023 we did see additional channel inventory destocking within many of our industrial based businesses as well as continued weak demand in China with incremental weakness in our China water business. This resulted in Q4 net sales which declined 7% year-over-year, falling below our guidance expectations. We have already noted that we see a continuation of similar volume trends into Q1 and I will come back to this, but we are encouraged that we see signs of market stabilization, bottoming of customer inventories, and a pickup in orders in the month of January that support a view of recovering sales and earnings through 2024.\nQ4 operating EBITDA of $715 million was down 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued pressure across many of our largely short-cycle businesses. We remain very focused on managing what we can control, including discretionary spending levers and also executing the restructuring actions announced last November. This focus helped to contain margin impact in the period despite a 9% drop in volume. Looking into 2024, we continue to target annualized cost savings of $150 million, which we will begin to realize later in Q1 and which should further bolster our go-forward margin profile. I am pleased we finished the year with strong cash generation as we continue to prioritize working capital improvement and discipline following the inventory build seen during the supply challenge 2022 period.\nFor the full year adjusted free cash flow was $1.6 billion with conversion at 100% versus our target of greater than 90%. This included Q4 adjusted free cash flow of $501 million, which represented 133% conversion. Adjusted EPS for the year of $3.48 per share increased over last year as benefits from our ongoing capital allocation and share repurchases more than offset substantial volume decrements.\nTurning to Slide 4, we continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities. First, this morning we announced that we completed the $2 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last September. At the conclusion of the ASR transaction, we retired an additional 6.7 million shares with the true-up, bringing its total to 27.9 million shares retired under the $2 billion ASR. Completion of this ASR wraps up the $5 billion program that we announced in November 2022, enabling the repurchase of approximately 15% of our outstanding shares over this time period.\nWe also announced that our board approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program and we intend to launch a new $500 million ASR transaction imminently. We expect to complete the full $1 billion program by the end of this year. Finally, today we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share, or a 6% increase. We will continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 35% to 45 over time and expect to increase our dividend annually in line with earnings growth. We exited 2023 on a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position with an adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.1x and with no long-term bond maturities due until November of 2025. We also repaid $300 million of debt due during Q4 with cash on hand.\nFinally, we also continue to invest in innovation and our Operational Excellence program to support long-term organic growth in 2024. We expect capital spending at about 5% of sales and target R and D spend at about 4% of sales for Total DuPont. Regarding our innovation and growth pipeline, we were pleased during Q4 with our electronics portfolio to be selected by a leading US OEM for our Microfill metallization product, which offers improved plating uniformity for advanced computing in water. Our team significantly advanced commercialization of the OxyMem Membrane products for wastewater biological treatment within industrial. Our Kalrez business opened a new facility in Delaware to support growth for its global semiconductor products, and finally, within adhesives, we launched a new structural epoxy adhesive specific for larger scale energy storage system.\nBefore I turn it over to Lori, let's review our expected demand outlook by business based on active conversations that we have had with customers recently for electronics. Our ICS business serving printed circuit boards already bottomed in mid 2023 and continues to gradually recover alongside global electronics demand. We expect utilization for our customers in this area to increase this year into the 60s% from the mid-50s% in Q1 for semiconductor industry. Forecasts for chip production that were pushed out several times in 2023 are signaling a firmer 2024 recovery, and our outlook assumes chip fab utilization increasing through the year to exit at a run rate around the low 80s% from the low 70s% in Q1.\nThis inflection also includes stabilization for end market consumption in smartphone, PC, and tablet markets driven in part by replacement demand as well as improved data center demand bolstered by AI-driven growth. These trends bode well for DuPont's strength within electronics materials and our customers are pointing to improved volume in both semi and ICS during 2024.\nWithin our industrial based businesses. While inventory destocking impacts have continued into Q1, customer feedback indicates a positive order inflection as the year progresses. Let's review specific end markets. First, Shelter, which sold notable destock in 2023, now sits with inventory back to normal levels and we expect a slight positive volume compare in 2024 beginning in Q1. In safety, we believe our customers' inventory is also close to normal at this point for Tyvek medical packaging, and we expect sales to recover during Q2 and into Q3. Further, we expect reduced destock impact within Safety Solutions across a couple of industrial end markets in the second half. In water, we have communicated with our distributor customers in China, and we expect a sequential pickup in sales towards the end of Q2.\nDistributor inventories have declined substantially from the peak last year. Finally, I would mention that we expect to see order improvement over the next several quarters in our Kalrez business with Industrial Solutions. Our Liveo Biopharma business is anticipated to recover later in the second half, so we have firm signals from a wide range of businesses within the DuPont portfolio that support a sales bottom in early 2024. This is reflected in stronger orders during the month of January after continued weakness in December to wrap up. We remain confident that our key end markets are well positioned for long-term growth and our teams are extremely focused on operating discipline and site-level execution, which positions us well to accelerate growth as inventories normalize. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori to cover the financial results and outlook in detail.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. Our financial results in 2023 were clearly impacted by significant destocking and demand pressure in China, but our focus has remained on sound operational execution across the business. I'm very pleased that our team's effort to drive productivity and operational excellence clearly minimized the contraction in margins and help drive substantial cash flow improvement in 2024. Our continued proactive approach to managing the business will yield impactful cost reductions beginning later in Q1 and building from there, from the restructuring actions announced last November. We anticipate yielding at least 2/3 of the total $150 million in restructuring benefits during 2024, with the balance realized next year. Like Ed, I'm also encouraged by the expected trajectory of demand and volume based on direct customer feedback and data supporting the bottoming of channel inventory in key end markets.\nOur current forecast assumes a bottom for total company sales and earnings in the Q1, followed by steady recovery as the year progresses, with a return to year-over-year growth in the second half. I'll come back to the outlook later, but first I'll cover our results regarding our Q4 financial highlights on Slide 5. Net sales of $2.9 billion decreased 7% versus the year-ago period as a 10% organic sales decline was partially offset by a 3% portfolio benefit due primarily to the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 9% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. Lower volume included the impact of channel inventory destocking within W&P's Safety Solutions line of business, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging. We also saw accelerated volume decline within Water Solutions in China driven primarily by distributor destocking and weaker demand.\nOn a segment view, WP and E&I organic sales declined 15% and 7% respectively while organic sales in corporate declined 4%. From a regional perspective, DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period with North America, Asia Pacific, and Europe down 13%, 11%, and 9% respectively. China sales were down 14% versus the prior year. Q4 operating EBITDA of $715 million decreased 6% versus the year ago period as volume declines and the impact of reduced production rates to better align inventory with demand were partially offset by lower input costs, discrete items which benefited earnings by about $40 million, and Spectrum earnings contribution.\nAbout $25 million of the discrete item benefits were reported within the WP segment, reflecting a land sale and other credits, with the remainder reflected in corporate operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.7%, increased 30 basis points versus the year ago period. In the Q4, driven by continued challenging construction market conditions coupled with ongoing channel inventory destocking, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of about $800 million. The charge relates to our Protection reporting unit, which consists of the Shelter and Safety Solutions lines of business within W&P, and is excluded from our adjusted operating results. As a reminder, the carrying value of the legacy DuPont assets and liabilities were marked as fair value, and significant goodwill and intangible balances were recorded in connection with the Dow DuPont merger.\nDespite the write-down, we maintain long-term confidence in the protection brand offering, and our market-leading positions remain strong. We continue to invest in and expand our application development expertise in these markets, and we have taken actions to improve our cost structure to enhance our competitiveness as destocking ends. Regarding cash flow, we are very pleased with our continued cash flow improvement as we worked hard in 2023 to optimize working capital performance and especially to right-size our inventory levels following the supply chain disruptions of 2022. On a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $646 million, less capital expenditures of $145 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $501 million in the Q4, a significant increase versus $188 million in the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 133%, significantly ahead of last year.\nTurning to Slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.87 per share decreased from $0.89 in the year ago period. Lower segment earnings and certain below the line items, including a $0.05 headwind from foreign exchange losses led by devaluation of the Argentine peso, more than offset an $0.08 benefit from a lower share count and a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate. Our tax rate for the quarter was 19.2%, down from 22.2% in the year ago period and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance driven by certain discrete tax benefits. Our full year tax rate for 2023 was 22.8% and our 2024 outlook assumes a base tax rate of 23% to 24.\nTurning to segment results beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I Q4 net sales of $1.4 billion increased 1% as the Spectrum sales contribution of 8% was mostly offset by an organic sales decline of 7%. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume and a 2% decrease in price at the line of business level. Organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were down high single digits versus the year ago period, resulting from reduced semi fab utilization rates as customers work to reduce finished inventories. We did see sequential improvement within semi as sales increased 2% in the Q4, signaling stabilization for the business. Our customer interactions and reduced channel inventory levels point to continued recovery expected in semi during 2024, with sequential sales up slightly in the Q1 and increased lift from the Q2 onwards.\nWithin Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined mid-single-digit as low-single-digit volume gains were more than offset by price decreases driven by lower metal pricing. Demand continues to stabilize, and this is the Q1 since the downturn started where we saw year-over-year volume growth. Organic sales for industrial solutions were down mid-single-digits due primarily to channel inventory destocking within our Liveo product lines for biopharma markets, and for products such as Kalrez O-rings, which are primarily used in semiconductor equipment. These declines were partially offset by continued strong demand for OLED display material. Operating EBITDA for E&I of 378 million was down versus the year-ago period due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by Spectrum earnings contribution.\nTurning to Slide 8, W&P Q4 net sales of $1.3 billion declined 15% versus the year-ago period due to volume decline within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down 20% on lower volume driven mainly by channel inventory destocking, most notably for Tyvek medical packaging products. Within water, organic sales were down high teens driven by distributor inventory destocking and lower industrial demand. In China, Shelter Solutions sales were down mid-single digits on an organic basis. The year-over-year decline has continued to improve, and we believe channel inventory destocking for construction has been completed based on distributor inventory now being back at normal levels. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter of $314 million decreased 13% due to lower volumes and reduced production rates, partially offset by lower input costs and certain discrete items benefits of about $25 million.\nTurning to Slide 9, I'll review our Q1 2024 outlook and full-year guidance expectations. For the Q1 of 2024, we expect net sales of about $2.8 billion and operating EBITDA of about $610 million. On a volume basis, we are seeing similar inventory destocking trends from Q4 continue into 2024 driven by Water Solutions in China and in several of our industrial-based businesses. Recovery timing is expected to vary by end market as the year progresses, but we expect Q1 is the bottom on a consolidated basis. The expected sequential decline in operating EBITDA includes the absence of discrete items which benefited Q4 as outlined earlier. The Q1 outlook also includes certain costs that further impact period margins primarily within W&P related to new capacity and safety as well as the impact of lower volume.\nFor Q2 we expect mid single digit sequential sales improvement and an approximate 10% increase in operating EBITDA from Q1. This assumes volume improvement driven by reduced inventory destocking impacts in water solutions and medical packaging, continued electronics recovery, and favorable seasonality in ICS and shelter. Sequential EBITDA should benefit from this volume growth and additional realization of restructuring cost savings. For the full year 2024 we expect net sales to be between $11.9 and 12.3 billion, with operating EBITDA expected to be between $2.8 and 3 billion year-over-year. Sales growth in H2 2024 is expected to be driven by ongoing electronics market recovery, including improvement in semiconductor fab utilization rates and continued utilization improvement for PCB manufacturing within ICS, along with further abatement of channel inventory destocking in our industrial businesses.\nFor second half, earnings drivers include volume improvement outlined above, alongside expected mix benefits, as well as ongoing realization of cost savings. Our current outlook also includes a neutral net impact from price costs for the year as slight price declines are expected to be offset by the carryover benefit of lower input costs. We expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.25 to 3.65 per share, which assumes the benefit of a lower share count is mostly offset by lower interest income, higher depreciation, and a higher tax rate as detailed on our outlook slide. With that, we are pleased to take your questions and I'll turn it back over to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time we will open the line for questions. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. We kindly ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up question. Your first question comes from Scott Davis with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nGood morning. Not a lot, I mean no huge surprises here but some of the commentary around kind of price versus cost seemed a little bit incrementally cautious.\nIs that just a function of kind of weaker demand? You know, general just sloppy demand that's out there? Is it kind of a mix just given how weak China is, you know, just level set maybe. I'm over reading this a little bit so if we can just talk about kind of pricing power versus maybe what you're expecting overall in 2024 that'd be helpful.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So overall full year we have about a 1% price decline in total on the top line, and we expect carryover benefit from further raw material logistics and energy savings to offset that to be neutral from a spread perspective for a year. So I wouldn't say it's any material change. We had always been in that camp in the raw material side with the pricing. Maybe we're being a little bit cautious just based on where the volume sits in the first half. But overall no material change, and I don't know that 1% total price is all that material to the total company.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nScott, I'd also say I think we said on last earnings call there's a couple end markets we would probably have to give up a little price to maintain our market position. I don't want to get into the details what they are on the call, but generally speaking we have been holding price across the platform and we continue to hold price across the platform. So really no change there at all.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And guys, I think one change at the margin just that we've seen this quarter is just China continues to be really weak and perhaps maybe even outlook for 2024 degrading a bit as we speak. But can you give us a little bit more color on your, you know, your confidence in your guide as it relates to just the degradation in China being kind of over and we're perhaps at a bottom here.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So Scott, it was very interesting. I just kind of give you an overall DuPont comment on orders and then specifically the water business in China where we've seen our real significant destock. By the way, overall it was really interesting to watch. We were still declining, as we said in Q4 on our order rates, but through the month of January we've had high single digit growth pretty much across the platform, except for Kalrez and Biopharma, which we expect to come back later in the year before they pick up. I'll give you two other data points which are really interesting. The water business declined in Q4, but through the first month of January, our orders were up 13%.\nA chunk of that was the water business in China. Interestingly there, as you look at the order pattern of that increase, most of that starts May on, which is about what our distributors have been telling us when they bottom out on their inventory. So, and by just another data point, because it was one of the other ones we saw destock as we went through the back half of the Q4, was our safety orders, which include medical packaging, which was another one that had a significant destock. Those orders were up 10% in the month of January. And that, by the way, is a shorter cycle book than water. Water is the only one we kind of get booked out three, four months because people are accustomed to having to book out that far. But most of our other businesses are very short cycle.\nSo the 10% up on the safety orders and medical packaging would bode well for the lift that we're expecting to see from Q1 to Q2 on the top line. So it was really interesting. We were going still negative going into the end of the year and now pretty broadly positive for the month of January.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. And I would say on volumes in China specifically, they did, they are still down on a full year basis, but we did see less of a decline as the year went on, and it varied by business. So obviously E&I was kind of first into the China downturn, and they actually delivered 1% volume growth in China in Q4. And then as the year went on, we saw primarily the water business in China decelerate, per Ed's comment. So it is still a tough market in China, but it looks like E&I is on the upswing, and we expect further improvement in the W&P business in water starting towards the tail end of Q2.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nOkay, helpful. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Good luck this year.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Scott.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nYeah, thanks. Good morning guys. I just want to follow up. Morning. I just wanted to follow up on the inventory dynamics in W&P. I guess you maybe help us better understand how the Q4 unfolded. Did your customers just stop buying at some point or just kind of what caught you so off guard with the declines there, and then around the January improvement you just talked about, Ed, I guess? What do you make of it? Does it seem like it was just delayed orders from year end or do you think end and demand is truly getting better there?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWell, I think it was a couple things. I think we got hit a little harder than we were expecting in Q4 simply because it was most people's fiscal year end and they're aggressively trying to work down inventories. By the way, as DuPont did, you know, we were aggressively doing it. We accelerated it as you could see from our cash flow, our inventory position even more in Q4. So I think it was just trended a little more than we expected. I'd also say, I would add to that, remember that in W&P specifically 50% of our business goes through distribution. So they can easily tell you just shut it off for two or three months, you know, and don't ship to me, you know, and that's what we saw a little bit more of than we were expecting. But, but very interesting.\nAs I said, it is a month; it's not a quarter yet. But most of those. And those distributor orders turned around in the month of January. And again it was pretty broad-based across the portfolio except a couple of these end markets that I talked about, and specifically, by the way, in Safety, the distributor orders started coming in in January. Shelter were very heavy through distribution. And we know we've talked about that we actually expect slight growth this quarter, and that to build a little bit more as the year goes on. And then I mentioned the Water one already. That's 40% globally through distribution. And it was mostly our distributor customers that delayed orders, not our end customers. So that's kind of the dynamic.\nBut very interesting to see this January thing now.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat. That's super helpful. And then maybe a question and just.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nMike, is it just an overall comment? We're 90% a short cycle company. It can go down pretty quick on you. It can go up pretty quick on you. You know, a lot of this is hangover from COVID excess inventory people working it off, and you know, so you can see the bounce back also.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nNo, makes a lot of sense. And then second, maybe just a quick question for Lori. Can you talk about your expected cash flow conversion in 2024? You gave us CapEx, but should we expect any material cash needs for restructuring, pension, or just some other key items there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So the pension should be around the $50 to 60 million of a cash funding. So no material difference from where it was in 2023. We had noted the CapEx, which also isn't a material change from 2023.\nWe would expect to be again around the target of 90% conversion for 2024. We'll see how the timing of the volume lift unfolds. You know that that could create a receivables headwind as you get into the back half of the year as you see that nice volume lift year-over-year. So I expect us to still deliver strong cash flow. We made a lot of progress on one of the areas that we really focus on with respect to inventory in 2023, and we're not going to give back that benefit that we saw. We'll work to hold on to those gains.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Spector with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, good morning. Good morning.\nJust on the second half expectations, so obviously visibility is pretty low, but I mean at the high end of your guide, you know, you're kind of projecting that you could see EBITDA up about 15% maybe in the second half. What needs to happen for that to play out? Kind of what's the expectation on the volume or restocking dynamic that would see you get to that end of the range?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so by the way, just a few bullet points on kind of first half, second half ramp there, obviously the increased semi fab and PC utilization rates. Remember, semi is a very high margin business for us. So we see that coming back and we've already started to see, as we just commented slightly, we're seeing improvement. It was about 2% in the quarter. So you know, we clearly bottomed out there and will now lift. Destocking will be mostly complete in the second half of the year.\nThe only ones that might slip into the Q4, and we've taken that into account, is Biopharma and Kalrez, although many in Biopharma think that's going to lift by the inflection point at the middle of the year. We're a little more cautious that it's maybe more of a Q4, and then clearly improved factory absorption, you know, from the hits we've been taking there to keep inventory in line, and then we'll have more of the cost savings or the restructuring program. So I'd say that that's the big items that kind of build first half, second half, and obviously just volume ramp in general, you know, because of destock ending.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks. No, that's helpful. And just to maybe follow up just more on the first half, are there discrete items we should be thinking about Q1 to Q2? So that 10% lift you potentially see, I guess is there a headwind baked in there in Q1 because you're taking additional inventory action that's X or something else that actually absent a material demand improvement, improves earnings or is this more destocking volume driven? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so sequentially a lot of it is volume driven. So we see about $150 million of revenue ramp Q1 to Q2. That's primarily volume. We also see a little bit of a build in the cost savings program. So we had mentioned it'll really kick in at the end of Q1, so you'll see some ramp as you head into Q2. Those are the biggest items. The largest improvement is going to be the volume increase though, Q1 to Q2.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Roberts with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThank you. Just one for me in Shelter Solutions. Now that the channel is destocked, are you expecting a normal seasonal sequential improvement or below normal in that segment?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nWe would expect normal. So normally Q2 and Q3 are the best quarters for shelter, with Q1 and Q4 being lower than those averages.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, John.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning, Ed. Good morning. You're a very valuable electronics business that's not being valued by the market. What are the options in your mind to unlock or have that value being realized?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWell, David, I think, look, we got it. We're working our way through this destock and I think the year is going to lift very nicely. I think we just have to be patient, see how it looks as we're kind of exiting 2024. And I think we haven't seen stability here with the destocking going on in the short-cycle nature. But to your point, David, it's a phenomenal franchise. We're in the sweet spot of it, we got a lot of upside coming with this, the AI opportunity. All these new facilities, fabs we have built are mostly advanced chips, which plays even more to our strength. So, you know, when people can really see these numbers cranking again, you know, as we're going through the second half of the year, we'll see how the company's valued.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery good. And just on PFAS, Ed, what's your expectation for improvement on that issue this year?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWell, I think we're within days or a couple weeks of the judge finally getting the whole, you know, water district thing done at all. I think it was just. They're probably waiting. I think what's going on is they're just waiting to get one announcement from all the companies out. And I think 3M just last Friday had their kind of, I'll call it a preliminary hearing. So I think that's, you know, very, very close to being, you know, finalized here. And then you.\nNothing will happen on the personal injury cases most likely this year.\nHowever, you know, our kind of take is we like to settle these things, you know, before, you know, there's any trial. But they're going through picking some of the who would be the initial ones that would go to trial. I think there's 28 of those on the list right now, and the judge and all will narrow that down to a smaller. But I don't think that's a 2024 issue on that.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nResearch Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nVery good. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, John.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nSo, Ed, we have a lot of new fabs coming on. I mean, just kind of looking at kind of high level. It looks like almost double digit coming on this year and then again in 20 and 26, I guess. Can you help us or remind us when you get those wins, like when you see that and how much of that cake is baked at this point, and then maybe any commentary on share wins or shifts that you might have seen on some of these fabs that are coming up?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, the sales process works. We do a lot of application engineering and development directly with the top. Really it's about 10 major customers in the semi side. So it's really the win we get there. Where it's processed at a fab is somewhat irrelevant to us. Although we like the fact that these fabs are coming on because the world thinks there's a lot of demand coming over the next cycle here in the semi world, which there should be because everything needs a chip nowadays and more of its advanced chips. But our win rate is really at the design stage with the 10 large customers around the world, and again where they make it doesn't really matter that much to us, but still a very good sign. I'd say overall market share does not shift much in this business.\nThere's a couple of key players, especially on the higher end chips, and you know, market share is pretty steady across the board year in and year out.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Fair enough. And then on the Shelter Solutions side of the business, can you help us to think about what the utilization rates are now that it looks like you've kind of bottomed out in that business and then how we should think about the incrementals on that as volume starts to really come back?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYes, we had mentioned we saw an improvement in volume as the year went on. The volumes in Shelter were kind of down about 4% in the Q4, and we expect them to be slightly up in the Q1 and then build from there to about 4% by the time we close out the year. So the utilization rates will definitely improve. This is not a high fixed cost plant fixed cost business. So when we talked about the absorption headwinds that we saw throughout 2023, that was primarily in the E&I side, and then it started to kick in a little bit on the safety side with the heavy assets in that portfolio. So there isn't a huge absorption headwind within Shelter.\nBut we will see some benefit from volume that would have a little bit of benefit absorption as the year goes on.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the caller.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good morning.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nIs there any reason? Over the course of this recovery, why your business should decouple from broad electronics trends? Are you guys less exposed to what's going on in AI and data center?\nHave you guys? Do you think you've lost share anywhere because a different technology is required in those applications? I mean, it just seems like electronics right now is kind of a multi-speed world and.\nI think I would have expected a little more out of you guys so far. But maybe just some comments on how kind of coupled you're going to be to that recovery.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nI think we're very coupled to it because one of the big demand drivers next year is data center and that's a lot of advanced chip applications. I won't say the customer's name, but there's one that's been out there very steadily that is requiring a lot of advanced chips that is a key customer of ours. So that that whole drive towards AI data center and the need for advanced chips plays right to the sweet spot of our portfolio. So no, we won't decouple at all. There's, you know, there's no area that's going to grow faster in the semi side that we will participate in. That's, that truly is our sweet spot as we go forward here. Remember, and at typical times, we've consistently outgrown the market to 300 basis points because of that dynamic.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I think too. On the semi, you know, around the $2 billion business for us, about $700 million of that is data center. It's a pretty large chunk.\nIf you look at the results and the forecast that the OEMs are providing, it's oftentimes skewed by the price of the cheaper, which has no impact on our volumes and our revenue. That's one thing. Maybe just to clarify, to make sure that if you're seeing lift in some of the OEMs, it's probably right now more coming from price, especially on the memory side. Our portfolio is about 30% memory, 70% logic foundry from a disposition perspective as well.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nSorry, you said $700 million of that as to what you can see clearly as being, like, you know, data center related customers.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYep.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYes, yes.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHow fast did that grow in like the Q4, or did it?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGrow in the Q4?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYes. Overall, semi volumes in the Q4 were down in the high single digits as some of the OEMs continued to destock. That's one other piece too, as they could still be producing and they're producing out of inventory versus buying new materials to add to their inventory. If you compare our results that have been released year to date versus the peers that sell materials in those sub segments, they are in line.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nOkay, great. All right, thanks a lot for the color. Appreciate it.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYou're welcome.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Alexei Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nSenior Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to water filtration and in China, do you have visibility into the underlying demand? You know, apparently you do have destocking, but what data points are you tracking to understand how healthy the actual market is?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, actually it's a great question. I would say true demand is down 3% or 4 negative. If you look at our direct customers we sell to over there, they have a little bit of destocking going on at their end. By and large, when you look at their demand again, they're in the 3% to 4, some are 5% down, somewhere right in that range. If you go to our distributor customers, they were down over 30%. That's where we started to see orders come back through January.\nFor deliveries kind of in the May, June, July time frame. As I mentioned earlier, the water orders in January were up 13%, and a big part of that was the China orders from the distributors. The market is definitely down a little bit. If we could just get all the destocking to come back, that's a huge swing for us, even if the market for a little bit stays down. The inventory in China on water will bottom in that kind of May, June timeframe. That's why I think we're starting to obviously then see these orders, at least preliminarily in January, come in kind of for that time period.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nJust from a logistics perspective.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, go ahead, maybe just real.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nQuick on the logistics perspective. Ed had mentioned an expected bottoming at the distributor inventory levels in China in the May, June time frame. We ship from the US to them primarily, so there's about a 60-day lag between when they need the material at their facility versus when we ship it, and then we recognize the revenue when we ship it. There will be a bit of a favorable impact from our perspective on revenue versus when it arrives at their facilities for use in China.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nSenior Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nWhat is the sort of two to three year growth rate for the water business? Will it step down, you think, because China is slower, or is this temporary?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we think it should still be in the mid single-digit range. We think that China is just.\nResolving some higher inventory levels. If you look back at the volumes before we started to see a downturn globally, I'm going to talk about global volumes. Water was up 8% in full year 2022, and in the first half it was up 4% in Q1 and 9% in Q2. We started to see the downturn in Q3. We think it's a temporary dislocation. There's still a lot of confidence and opportunity for outsized growth versus GDP in the water business.\n\nAleksey Yefremov\n\nSenior Research Analyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks a lot.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks Aleksey.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Equity Research, Citi\n\nHi, good morning. I'm just curious on your expectations for the retained businesses in the corporate segment into the year. Maybe we're starting to see a. Challenging auto and EV backdrop into the first half of the year.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, 2023 was very favorable for the auto industry, kind of up in that high single-digit range, and we would outperform that in the EV space just by about 25% to 30 of our portfolio is now EV on a full-year basis. For 2024, we do see it about flat from a volume perspective, in line with where auto builds are. Obviously, China is going to slow down a bit in 2024 off of a really strong 2023, especially the tail end of 2023. Longer-term, we're still very confident in the EV expansion opportunity and the pace of the EV growth, and we have a really nice position to continue to benefit from that, not only in the corporate retained businesses, primarily with adhesives, but also within the W&P portfolio.\nNomex, we've got a really nice opportunity on the e-motor side of the house with it using Nomex as an insulator.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Equity Research, Citi\n\nGot it. Very helpful. Just on Spectrum, you know, how is it performing relative to expectations. Has it been hit by any. You know, residual destocking or deterioration in primary demand?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, it's in line with our expectations. It's ramping nicely with the new customer win that we highlighted when we acquired the business. That's going very well. We've actually integrated the business within the company and combined it with our Liveo healthcare business to further take advantage of those commercial synergies. That continues to be a nice opportunity for us.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVP and Equity Research, Citi\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Patrick.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. First, can I just clarify on the full year remarks. When you talk about sales and profit growth in the back half, are you talking Q3 and Q4 or maybe not Q3 but definitely Q4.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nIt starts in Q3. It's greater in Q4 from a year-over-year perspective.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Ed, can I ask you, the destocking is what it is and it's going to be what it's going to be. Thereafter, in managing these businesses and investing in them and presenting them to the investment community, how do you think about, you know, shipments versus demand and making sure that we don't get into another situation where the supply chain winds up, you know, with more product than it will ultimately want? Or is that not something that you can really have the visibility on to control and that too will just be. What is it going to be?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nVincent, only twice in my, like, I think 26 years now doing this has this happened. It is a very rare event. I mean, it was obviously, I mean, look, you know, the semi story, it just, they overshot so much on inventory. A lot of this was Covid driven, the craziness of the supply chain. It is just not something that would normally happen. It really is kind of one of those once in a, you know, opportunities or dislocations, let me say it that way. By the way, interestingly, it goes down rapidly in a short cycle and can go up rapidly. It happened by the little bit of 2008-2009 was destocking. It was mostly true recession where demand was down. I say about 1/3 of that then turned into destocking because of the situation.\nIt got worse quicker than people were expecting, but that recovered also fairly quick. I just don't see something like this happening again. We are almost, as I said, almost all a short cycle business, so we really solve it, you know, across a lot of the portfolio. In normal times, you're just not going to overshoot.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thanks very much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nWe'll overshoot once in a while, but not to the extent of what we saw here, the severity of it.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you again.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please go ahead.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nYes, hi, good morning, Ed. You indicated that obviously you made a proactive decision to work down your inventories, and you've mentioned a couple of times the negative impact of factory absorption in Q4 and in 2023. I was wondering if you could size that for us. Obviously, the expectation is that that's not necessarily going to continue in 2024, so that should be a nice tailwind for you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Frank, we had a little north of $200 million of absorption headwinds in 2023, most of that in E&I did kick in a little bit towards the tail end of the year in 2023 for W&P, and that will continue Q1 as well. We do see absorption headwinds in Q1 right now. Given that our full year midpoint guide of $12.1 billion is about flat with this year on a year-over-year basis, we don't really see material absorption tailwinds because volumes aren't materially improving. There will be improvement first half, second half because the volume story is different, first half, second half. In the guide that we had provided, we didn't bake in material benefits. Obviously, if that plays out differently, that could be a change, a positive change. Initially, that's where we sit.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nOkay, gotcha. Perhaps there's some conservatism built in there, which I kind of got the sense when you're talking about price cost for, you know, for 2024 being neutral. I would assume that you saw some benefits from price cost in the Q4. Could you size that for us?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont",
    "content2": "Yeah, we did see benefits in the Q4 in the $50 to 75 million range. We do see some, some further tailwinds year-over-year in Q1, just really from that carryover benefit of the raws that we were buying that were stuck in inventory and are now coming out. You know, right now our view is that we would still see those benefits, about $100 million on a full year basis in 2024. We expect about a 1% price give back, with a lot of it being in the shelter business, as we had kind of been flagging all along. That's where we got the most price to begin with in the 2022, 2023 time frame.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident and Senior Analyst, Fermium Research\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Frank.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, a lot of the questions have been answered, but just wanted to reconfirm. I know that you made the statement that your volumes could snap back quickly. Is that, are you at all concerned with that happening now with maybe China growing at a slightly lower structural growth rate going forward? Maybe you can just comment on what you're hearing, you know, out of China.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I mean, even if China potentially is at a lower structural growth rate year-over-year, it's coming off a pretty, so, you know, full year volumes in China were down in the mid teens. You know, it's not a high hurdle to jump off of as you head into 2024 to deliver growth. We still have a lot of confidence longer-term in those markets that are highly rooted in China, especially on the electronic side, and on the water side, we expect improvement.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, just turning to the electronic side, I don't think we're being overly aggressive. We've talked to all our large customers. When you look at the fab utilizations, we're basically going from the low 70s, we said, to the low 80s. In really good times, they run in the 90s, so we probably still have more upside that would kick in in that part of the business even going into 2025.\nIt's not all, we're not assuming it all snaps back in 2024 to where it had been running.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nRight. Given that we have experienced, you know, a fair amount of volatility here and cyclicality, you know, one of the transformation kind of strategies was to, you know, reduce that peak to trough cyclicality. Do you still feel the same way about the current portfolio as far as lowering that cyclicality, you know, post transfer?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nI totally do.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nOther businesses that would qualify for disposition at this point?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo, no, I totally feel in normal times it'll be a more consistent portfolio. Again, unusual time here with the destock and the inventory built from COVID and all short cycle. These are good secular businesses. We've got good market positions, so we feel good about where we're at. Just gotta get through this period and start lifting.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you. Your businesses within W&P heavily rely on distributors. I'm curious, how much visibility do you have, not just on your own products in inventory at these distributors, but competitor products? The reason I ask is I'm just wondering whether or not you're seeing the potential for a shift to competitor products, perhaps in water in China. Anything that you're seeing there that is a concern on the competitive front?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo, no, Steve. By the way, we're tracking well because of the services, we're tracking way closer with our distributors. The good news, it's our distributors in China. There's a handful of really big ones. If we can get our arms around that, we've asked the competitive issue, and, you know, we're very close to them. I don't see any issues there at all.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nOkay, how would you look at your businesses and highlight any opportunities for, you know, a new technology or a new application of your products that could really drive growth? Anything that you would highlight, an example would be, you know, like water moving into lithium extraction. Do you see?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Steve, I would give you two. You just said the one, the lithium opportunity could be substantial for us because that needs a ton of filtration, as you guys know. The other, I would just say big trend out there that we've already talked to, but has a real good opportunity for us because it's in our sweet spot, is the whole AI thing. I would say they would be the two big ones.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nThank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGreat, thanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question comes from Mike Sisson with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning, Ed. When you think about, you know, the earnings power of DuPont, you look at H2 2024, the run rate EBITDA is going to be much higher than the first half. When we think about growing into 2025 and beyond, should we take that second half run rate, and then where do you think the earnings power is, you know, longer-term? 2026, 2027. In terms of EBITDA?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I mean we often see exit at a higher margin than where we start the year. Our current expectation is that we, as we would exit, you know, butting up against 26% EBITDA margin in the Q4. We've always said that we think the EBITDA margin profile for the total company should be in that 27%, 28% range. We don't have a change to that, you know, with E&I being in the low 30s and W&P being in the kind of mid 20s. We exit the year, as I had mentioned, butting up against 26%, kind of in the low 800 range. If you look back to our peak earnings in late 2022, they were more in that 850 range and they didn't have Spectrum in them.\nYou know, there's still clear opportunity for us to continue to expand beyond that run rate that we'll expect to see at the end of this.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYear, and maybe just add one for the longer-term, you know, again, in stabilized times, half this portfolio should outgrow GDP, and the other half should grow with GDP. Just to give you a feel, you know, that would be the magnitude, and one of the things that, as I mentioned a minute ago, still has to come back even more in 2025 is the semi industry, and the utilization rates still decline from where we would exit 2024.\n\nMike Sison\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYep, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back to Chris Mecray for any closing remarks.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont\n\nWell, thank you all for joining the call. For your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website. As usual, this concludes our call. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."

Chris, over to you.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont de Nemours\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Q3 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward looking statements. Our Form 10K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials, and have been posted to DuPont's investor relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our Q3 2023 Financial Review. This morning, we announced Q3 results and delivered solid earnings accomplished through strong operating execution by our teams. Despite ongoing volume headwinds, including channel inventory destocking and continued weak demand in China, we reported sequential operating EBITDA growth of 5% and margin improvement of 140 basis points in Q3. We also produced strong cash flow during the quarter, with adjusted free cash flow almost 50% higher than the year-ago period, highlighting our efforts to prioritize working capital improvement in a challenging global business environment and normalizing after last year's global supply chain difficulties. Compared to Q3 2022, organic revenue declined 10% due primarily to the impact of incremental channel inventory destocking, along with lower volumes from semiconductor and construction end markets within our electronics portfolio.\nOur Interconnect Solutions business recorded a second straight quarter of sequential sales lift as underlying demand improvement and normal seasonality contributed to an 8% sales increase. We also saw signs of stabilization within semiconductor markets and expect some sequential sales improvement from Semiconductor Technologies in the Q4. Q3 volume was lower than expected primarily due to incremental Channel Inventory destocking including with our distributor customers, which was evident in the Water Solutions and Safety Solutions lines of business. In this environment, we remain focused on controlling discretionary spending and are also planning additional restructuring actions to continue to ensure we can drive sound operational and financial performance, targeting at least $150 million in annualized run rate cost savings which we expect to be seeing later in the Q1 2024.\nIt's always difficult to precisely time market inflections. The current industry forecasts within electronic submarkets call for recovery during 2024. This includes forecasts for PC shipments to grow mid single digits driven by replacement demand, smartphone shipment growth in the mid single digits, also driven by replacement demand and new product launches, and for server demand to gradually improve next year. This growth is supported by the rapid surge in demand for AI servers as well as replacement for traditional servers. In general, demand for high performance and high density memory chips is accelerating supported by AI growth as well as overall growth for new mobile product launches. This directly correlates with DuPont's product strengths within the semiconductor and consumer electronics markets.\nDespite the near term headwinds we are experiencing, we are confident that our key end markets are well positioned for long term growth, and we expect these structurally attractive markets will provide the foundation for DuPont's value creation. Looking ahead, turning to slide 4, we significantly advanced our strategic and capital allocation priorities during the quarter to drive shareholder value. First, we closed the acquisition of Spectrum on 1 August, which fits nicely alongside our Liveo Healthcare related product line within our Industrial Solutions line of business within E&I. We are pleased with Spectrum's operating results to date, which are aligned with our modeled estimates. We are excited to welcome the Spectrum team, which is currently focused on executing new revenue growth opportunities stemming from significant customer wins earlier in the year.\nSecond, I am pleased to announce that we are in the process of closing today the previously announced sale of our roughly 80% ownership interest in the Delrin business, the remaining piece of the former M&M segment held for sale to the private equity firm TJC, and a transaction value in the business at $1.8 billion. This deal was structured to maximize value for our shareholders. It provides significant upfront cash proceeds with minimal expected tax impact, which can then be deployed in line with our strategic priorities. It also provides an opportunity for us to participate in future upside returns upon the exit of our retained interest in Delrin. TJC has an excellent track record of creating value, and we look forward to leveraging their talent and focus to continue to grow the high quality Delrin business.\nRegarding share repurchases, in September we completed the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November. We then launched a new $2 billion ASR which we expect to complete during Q1 2024.\nCombining these two ASR transactions, we have repurchased approximately 15% of our outstanding shares when complete, reflecting our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders as part of our balanced financial policy. Including these ASRs and the proceeds from the Delrin sale, we anticipate finishing the year close to our target net leverage ratio of about 2.1x. Further, we anticipate using a significant portion of excess cash during 2024 for incremental share repurchases once the ASR is complete. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. Our teams continue to execute well in a softer volume backdrop driven by broad-based inventory destocking, demonstrating strong financial discipline and focus on operational excellence. I am most pleased with the sequential margin improvement registered by each of our segments in Q3 as well as our strong cash performance in the period given volume headwinds.\nThe delivery of stronger margins and better cash flow are attributed to execution around lowering our input costs, coordination with the operating teams to right-size our inventory position, as well as overall progress with productivity via operational excellence initiatives. We are very focused on operating discipline and pleased that site-level operating execution is positively positioning us for solid margin upsides. As volumes recover, we expect to see evidence of this in 2024 given expected recovery in key end markets including electronics.\nTurning to our financial highlights on slide 5, Q3 net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 8% versus the year ago period. A 10% organic sales decline was slightly offset by a 2% portfolio benefit due primarily to revenue contribution from Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflects a 10% decrease in volume resulting primarily from semiconductor and construction end markets as well as the impact of channel inventory destocking. E&I and W&P organic sales declined 13% and 8% respectively, while the retained businesses and corporate reported 1% organic sales growth including mid single digit growth in the adhesives portfolio. From a regional perspective, consolidated DuPont sales decreased on an organic basis globally versus the year ago period with Asia Pacific, North America, and Europe down 12%, 10%, and 2% respectively.\nChina sales were down 16% on an organic basis versus Q3 2022, though E&I sales in China increased sequentially in the quarter and saw smaller year-over-year declines in each of the last three quarters. Q3 operating EBITDA of $775 million decreased 9% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates primarily within E&I as we align inventory with demand partially offset by lower input costs related to raw materials, logistics, and energy along with the portfolio benefits from Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 25.3% was down 50 basis points versus the year ago period driven by volume pressure in the high margin semi business and reduced production rates primarily within the E&I segment, offset partially by cost deflation benefits which increased somewhat from Q2 levels.\nOn a sequential basis, operating EBITDA was up 5% and operating EBITDA margin improved 140 basis points. Decremental margin for the quarter was 31%, enabled by cost deflation and aggressive actions taken year to date to reduce spending. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with our cash flow improvement during the quarter. Optimizing working capital performance continues to be a top priority for us.\nOn a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations of $740 million less capital expenditures of $119 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $621 million in the Q3, a 47% increase versus the year ago period. Adjusted free cash flow conversion during the quarter was 151%, an increase versus last year and much improved compared to the first half of this year. We currently expect to finish the year with conversion around our targeted level of 90%.\nTurning to Slide 6, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.92 a share increased 12% compared to $0.82 in the year-ago period. Below-the-line benefits, including a combined $0.16 benefit related to a lower share count and lower net interest expense, more than offset lower segment earnings. Other below-the-line benefits, including a lower tax rate and lower foreign exchange losses, contributed $0.06 to adjusted EPS improvement versus the year-ago period. Our tax rate for the quarter was 24.6% down from 26.2% in the year-ago period driven by the impact of a rate true-up in the year-ago period and lower than our previously communicated modeling guidance. As discrete tax headwinds were lower than expected, our expectation of a full-year 2023 base tax rate of 24% remains unchanged.\nTurning to segment results beginning with E&I on slide 7, E&I, Q3 net sales of $1.4 billion decreased 9% as organic sales declined 13%, offset partially by a portfolio benefit of 4% from the Spectrum acquisition. The organic sales decline reflected a 12% decrease in volume and a 1% decrease in price. At the line of business level, organic sales for Semiconductor Technologies were down high teens versus the year ago period resulting from a continuation of inventory destocking across the channel and, to a lesser extent, ongoing weak end market demand and the impact of China trade restrictions. On a reported basis, Semiconductor Technologies sales were flat sequentially in Q3. Within Interconnect Solutions, organic sales declined 11% year-over-year due to both volume and price decline driven by the pass through of lower metal pricing.\nVolume continued to be impacted by weak smartphone, PC, and tablet demand, particularly in China, along with more moderate inventory destocking, which we believe is largely complete on a sequential basis. The Interconnect business reported a second straight quarter of sales improvement with sales up 8% driven by seasonality, as well as some underlying demand improvement within PCB markets.\nOrganic sales for Industrial Solutions were down high single digits versus the year ago period due primarily to destocking within biopharma applications for our Liveo product line, and continued lower demand in electronics-related end markets. These declines were partially offset by increased demand for OLED display materials. Operating EBITDA for E&I of $383 million was down versus the year ago period primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, slightly offset by a portfolio benefit related to Spectrum. Operating EBITDA margin increased 140 basis points sequentially during Q3.\nTurning to slide 8, W&P, Q3 net sales of $1.4 billion declined 8% versus last year as volume decline of 9% was slightly offset by a 1% increase in price due to the carryover impact of actions taken last year. Within Safety Solutions, organic sales were down high single digits due primarily to channel inventory destocking. Shelter Solutions sales were down high single digits on an organic basis driven by continued demand softness in construction markets, and ongoing channel inventory destocking on a sequential basis. From the Q2, shelter sales increased slightly, and we expect narrower year-over-year declines in Q4. Organic sales for Water Solutions were down mid single digits versus the year-ago period due primarily to inventory destocking, including with distributor customers, and lower industrial project demand in China mainly impacting reverse osmosis.\nWe expect generally flat sequential volumes in the Q4 versus the Q3. Operating EBITDA for W&P during the Q3 of $362 million decreased versus the year ago period due to lower volume partially offset by the impact of net pricing benefit. Operating EBITDA margin of 25.6% increased 70 basis points year-over-year and 100 basis points sequentially from the Q2. Turning to Slide 9, I will close with a few comments on what we are seeing in the Q4 and how that translates to our full year 2020 guidance. Underlying consumer electronics demand in the Q4 is expected to be generally similar to the Q3 with some sequential sales lift expected in semiconductor technology.\nAs mentioned earlier, we saw additional channel inventory destocking and slower industrial demand in China, mainly impacting Water Solutions compared to prior expectations, and we assume these same trends that continue through the end of the year. As a result of this incremental volume softness, we are adjusting our net sales and Operating EBITDA guidance and now expect full year net sales to be about $12.17 billion and Operating EBITDA to be at about $2.97 billion, which is at the low end of our prior range. For Q4, we expect net sales of approximately $3 billion with a sequential decline versus Q3 driven predominantly by additional inventory destocking in the Safety Solutions line of business and to a lesser extent by the impact of seasonality and incremental currency headwinds.\nWe expect full-year 2023 adjusted EPS to be approximately $3.45 per share, which is the midpoint of our prior guidance range. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q and A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of time, please keep to one question and one follow up question per person. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q and A roster. Your first question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone.\nGood morning, Ed. A lot going on in these channels, obviously. Do you have any kind of sense or how do you measure, you know, kind of your sell in versus sell through? Trying to kind of understand, you know, kind of what that incremental headwind is from inventory versus just kind of general demand trends, and you know, maybe just a little bit of color on, you know, how much more you might have to do on inventory or production to kind of get things where you need them to be balanced out.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, Jeff. So we did a pretty detailed analysis of it, and I think a good way to look at it is what is our distributor customers doing versus our direct end customers? So maybe just to give you a couple numbers on the W&P side of our business, about 50% of our volume goes through distribution, and the other 50% we sell direct to customers. And so we did a whole analysis, obviously, because, you know, the distributors, you can see quick what's going on with them. And almost across the board, the distributor network is destocking pretty broadly, and it's on a percentage basis down significantly more than our direct customers. So by the way, just one, because it hit us this quarter, our water business in China, which is mostly reverse osmosis was down.\nAt 36% of it goes through distribution. The rest we sell direct to customers. But the 36%, 1/3 of our sales that go through distributors in China, it was down 36% through distribution, was down about 12% direct to the customer base. So if you do that analysis in our safety business, you get very similar trends going on. So clearly the distributors are going through a destocking. And I'm sure as we're approaching year end, everyone's trying to get their inventories kind of where they want them.\nNow by the way, having said that, my take is that the destocking obviously goes into the Q1, if we just started to see it in some of these W&P businesses. But I would think the distributors work it down, you know, fairly quickly, you know, after we're kind of exiting the Q1. But that same trend applies almost across the board when you do that analysis. It's the distributors are way, way down vis-à-vis the direct customer channel.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nOn the absorption question, we're still in the same general ballpark in the H2 as where we were in the first half. There's a little bit of a mix. What we'll be taking a little less absorption headwinds in E&I and a little more in W&P as we see the GSOC continue as we head into Q4. But in total the number is about equal to the first half.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat. I was wondering if you could give us a little color on restructuring also, Ed. I think you mentioned $150 million run rate. Wasn't sure if that was full year 2024, but maybe just give us a sense of how much restructuring tail you have in 2023, the incremental benefit you expect in 2024, and as volumes kind of hopefully improve into 2024. Is some of that just kind of discretionary temporary stuff that kind of comes back into the P&L?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah. So on an annual basis, Jeff will be about $150 million of savings, kind of spread between plant fixed costs and functional costs, or mostly G&A expense, not touching R&D and all. But by the way, just to back up on that, Lori and I have been looking at this kind of how we can do some restructuring for over a year. So we're not doing it just in response to what's going on. I think I said on other earnings calls, we started looking at it actually a summer ago. You know, how could we streamline a little bit more? So we're ready with that.\nWe'll start seeing the benefits of the restructuring towards the tail end of Q1. We'll get going on it by the middle of December. So, you know, by the time it hits, we get things going. You'll start to see the benefit then. So you'll kind of get 3/4 of the benefit for a big chunk of that in 2024. A little bit of that would potentially come back on the fixed costs, the plant fixed cost side as volumes pick up, but not all of it. So you get a little bit of it coming back in as we see the volumes lift. But that's basically the program.\n\nJeff Sprague\n\nFounder and Managing Partner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nThanks, Jeff.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Melius Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Ed and Lori.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nHey, Scott.\n\nScott Davis\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nChris, good morning. Couple things, I mean, just to follow up on Jeff's question, because it just seems like it's so important and topical for you guys. I mean, there's two reasons why people destock inventory, right? I mean, one is maybe lead times come down and they feel like they can get it fast. And two is they're really worried about their customers not wanting product. And I'm talking at the distribution level, not your direct.\nWhat do you think? You know, what do you think are the main drivers of this kind of incremental? Because we've been talking about the inventory destock for several quarters now, and this quarter seemed like it almost got a little bit worse, particularly in water and protection.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah. You know, Scott, I just give you a ballpark. My thinking, I think 2/3 of it, or 75%, something like that is really that the supply chain healed itself. It's pretty darn normal for everybody again. So everyone sat on excess inventory. I mean, look, we're doing the same thing. We had 151% cash conversion. We're lowering our inventory levels because we have built up more than we normally would during COVID. And every other CEO I talk to is doing the same thing.\nAnd by the way, I think it's the pressure you're getting near the end of your year. You're really trying to get things in line for 2024. So I think a big part of the fact, but there certainly is a percent of people just more worried. Is there a recession coming? You got an inverted yield curve for 18 months. People start getting nervous.\nThere's always been a recession, so I can't say that's not if that's in there. But I think the bigger part of it is we just all build excess inventory. You know, we got what we could get, you know, during COVID, and by the way, I'll give you one example because we're seeing some destocking on the metal packaging side.\nA year ago, I had most of the CEOs of the medical device companies personally call me pleading that we could ship more Tyvek material for packaging so they could ship their products out. I remember telling them, in fact, I sent a letter to the trade industry. I said, our shipments to you are up 18% so far this year. I mean, I can't do much more. You know, that was everyone scrambling to get it and then they overshot. Now I probably shouldn't be surprised, we're seeing some destocking on the medical packaging side. So I think that's just a great example. That has nothing to do with a recession. That's just everyone had too much.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah, that's great color and makes a lot of sense. I want to ask about price, and I know the two segments are just way different. E&I, you kind of manage price versus cost. And W&P, maybe there's a little bit of a different price strategy. But when you think about like this new normal of higher inflation, wages, other costs, you know, not, not explicitly material costs, but other costs, how do you think about price in kind of a future construct, meaning maybe entering into 2024? It's probably more of a valid question for W&P, but maybe you can address for both segments and give us a little bit sense of what you think.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, Scott, I don't think 2024 will be what you'd consider a normal year in a normal environment a few years in a row. Just normal things which we haven't had in four years. And for anybody, I would. We would always get like 1.5% to 2% price lift in the W&P business. Our goal in 2024 is to hold on to as much pricing as we can. And you obviously see us and others; we're getting benefit from price cost spread. And we saw it in Q3, which helped us out. We'll obviously see it in Q4. So our goal is to really manage that well for 2024 because there's still, you know, quite a bit there. Now we're not going to get all the costs back by renegotiating contracts. Everyone's trying to hold price of.\nOur vendors are trying to hold it too. But you know, we're still up to about $225 million that we've gotten back. So, I mean, that's pretty significant for us. And so we're hoping to hold that for next year. My gut is we're going to give up some pricing in the shelter business because we don't want to lose market share. But a lot of the other businesses will really be managing that tightly. But then if we ever get back to normal times, hopefully 2025, we would look at that 1.5% to 2% price increase. And then electronics, we just try to hold about flat and usually we're flat to down 1%. But you get nice volume lift.\n\nScott Davis\n\nChairman and CEO, Melius Research\n\nYeah. Good color. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Appreciate it.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nScott, good talking to you. Thank you.\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes in line of Steve Tusa of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nGood morning.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nCan you just update us on what you actually expect for what was the price cost spread this quarter, and what you expect now for the year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so our full year number, we ticked up to $225 million versus the last quarter. We had expected about $140 million. So we're seeing that deflation benefit come through in the back half. So in Q3 we saw net about $75 million benefits. We'll see that tick up to around the $100 million in Q4.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nDoes some of that carry into next year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYes.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nOkay. Then I guess.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, the spread will continue into next year with the caveat of we don't quite know, to Ed's earlier comment, what the price is going to do, but we do expect that deflation benefit to continue because it took its time to get through inventory this year.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nGot it. Just kind of a philosophical question on how you think about next year. Your exit rate now on some of these businesses, just from a revenue perspective, is more negative. You're taking revenue down. You talked about some of it being destock, which is effectively an easier comp next year in the second half of the year. Do you think with this profile that you guys can still grow revenues next year?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, yeah, I think Q1, Steve, to your comment, will be light. You know, more similar to the Q4 because I don't think the destock will end that quick, but the distributors will move very fast. They just stop ordering for a while. You know, they literally, we talk directly to them and they're like, just don't ship me something for a few months and then we'll be back on track.\nSo. So yeah, I think Q1 will be on the light side, but I think after that we'll see some nice lift. Certainly by then the electronics part of our business, which, you know, is highly profitable, I think we'll be back to a really nice lift. You know, just on the semi side, the fabs are running a little below 70% utilization. I think if we do the math on what the industry's thinking, they're going to kind of get up as the year goes, more to 80% utilization the following year, more like the 90% where you would run them at.\nSo you'll start to see some, on a percentage basis, some pretty nice lift. And we've had two quarters in a row of ICS lifting, so it's clearly off the bottom, you know, that will, I think, continue to grow as we go through next year. So I think, you know, you're kind of through the electronics one, although, you know, we're kind of now doing a destock on the W&P side. And remember, we're mostly short cycle, so, you know, we'll see it first and then I think by Q2 you'll see a lot of that destock over with and you'll see the volume lift.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nEd, one last one for you. I mean, you've been through a few cycles. DuPont having, I guess high single digit to even double digit organic volume declines. I mean, are we already in a recession here in your mind?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nI'm kind of one foot in, yes. I've been there for a while. By the way, I track a lot of economic indicators. I said earlier, you know, when you see the yield curve, where it's been and all, there's always been a recession. So I like to manage. I guess conservatively. So I've been telling the team for a long time, just prepare for a softer environment. And if we're wrong, great. You know, we'll have done all the right actions to position ourselves. But yeah, I think there was this quarter. Just reading all the results from companies I saw, they were, they were pretty mixed.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nRight, great, thanks.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nPeople were mostly missing on the volume and not on their EBITDA.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, J.P. Morgan\n\nRight? Yep. Thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nOkay, Steve, your next question comes online with Michael Leithead of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, guys. Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nMorning.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nOn the Delrin sale, can you maybe speak to why this monetization structure was sort of the best ultimate outcome? And then relatedly maybe for Lori, when should we expect a note receivable to accrue? Or I guess, when do you get that $350 million in cash?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so we like that look. We sold Delrin in a tougher environment than when we sold the rest of M&M. So this optimized what we could get for the assets over a few year period. You know, we're getting $1.2 billion up front. We're riding 20% equity in it. TJC has a phenomenal track record. So my gut is we have some nice upside coming from the retained interest that we have in the business. That's to be proved out. But I'm highly confident in that it is a good business. It should do well over the next few years. So we think that optimizes our position. So we sold it at $1.8 billion in value. My gut is we can end up nicely above that with the equity that we have. So.\nBy the way, it just goes to our whole capital allocation strategy. It was not a business we wanted to be in long-term. Even though it's a good business, we're taking the volatility out of the portfolio, and you know, we'll redeploy that cash. And as we said in our prepared remarks, we will actually do more share repurchase after the ASR ends next year because we're in a great balance sheet position and we'll have good free cash flow, and we plan on buying back more shares.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, and Michael, on the debt. So we gave them a $350 million loan. It's an eight-year loan if the venture were to go that long. So, like, you know, normally they would monetize quicker than that. Then we would get the repayment of the loan. So if it went to the longest haul, it would be eight years, but that's most likely not the reality.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, that's super helpful. And then second, I was hoping maybe you could give us a bit more color on the moving pieces within the corporate and other segment. I assume the retained businesses are doing fairly well in the auto backdrop. So can you speak to what's kind of the moving pieces there and should we expect that business to continue to deliver some level of double digit millions of EBITDA?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah. So the businesses, just for refresher, that are in corporate are primarily the automotive adhesives business. And then we have Tedlar and MULTIBASE. But the largest end market served is automotive, and there's a large EV exposure there. So we saw nice mid-single-digit volume growth. Again, we expect for a full year, from a volume growth perspective, the automotive adhesives to grow up in the high single digits. And we continue to expect really great things from that business with the EV penetration that we've seen. So from an earnings perspective, they were up very nicely as well. We saw nice earnings growth and margin appreciation in the Q3.\nIn the Q4 we have a little bit of a deceleration. Just a lot of their exposure is in the US with automotive. So there's some headwind from the strike that fortunately is now over. But there will be a little bit of a headwind from the October impact. And then the US car builds right now from IHS are expected to be down. But overall the trajectory of this business is really strong. They had a great 2023 and we expect a really strong 2024 again.\n\nMichael Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of John McNulty of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nYeah, thanks for taking my question. So it looks like the electronics end market seem like they're starting to stabilize a little bit. You expect semi technologies to be up quarter-over-quarter. Can you add some color on what you expect from the other two subsectors in the E&I division? Do you see normal Q4 seasonality? Is there maybe a little bit of destock in the industrial solution side, I guess? Can you help us to think about the trends there?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so semi will lift a little bit. So I would still say bouncing along the bottom but getting through the destock. And when I say a little bit, you know, a few percentage points sequentially up in the business, the ICS business will be down some, but that's all seasonality. If you look at it just the normal drop you see in seasonality, it's less. So the business continues, maybe a few more points to improve after the last two quarters of improvement. So kind of less seasonality because the business is recovering. And then on the industrial part of E&I, we'll definitely see a little bit of destocking there.\nThe biopharma destocking, which is in that business, picked up some during the quarter. So I expect that to continue into the Q4 and hopefully be kind of done by then with that. There's just a little bit of other destocking going on with some of our distributors in that business. So, you know, nothing significant, but yeah, I think that'll see a little bit of softness.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGot it. Okay, thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up, I think, you know, as we get to kind of mid-December, the opt-out period should be kind of done on the, on the PFAS side, I guess. Can you give us any update on the water district, water district settlement? Is there anything that you can speak to at this point? It seems like that should put a lot of, a lot of kind of the pressures behind you, but I guess any update there would be helpful.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah. So, the date that's coming up here is the deadline for the opt out is 4 December, and then we will see a list of who the opt outs are on 6 December. And then there's a final fairness hearing in South Carolina on 14 December. So it's all kind of happening in the, you know, first two weeks of December, and I really can't add any other color. I just don't have any other facts in front of me. We're feeling obviously very good about it, highly confident that this will get signed off and get done. And I just add, obviously, people are talking to the key water districts around the country. So, you know, you know, we're feeling good, and hopefully we're close to getting that cemented.\n\nJohn McNulty\n\nManaging Director and Chemical Analyst, BMO Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks very much for the color.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes to mind of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Good morning, Ed and Lori, restructuring. Do you have any more, you know, any more colleagues can provide some more concrete examples of where that 150 is going to come from?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so we had mentioned that it'll primarily come from plant fixed costs and then the SG&A or the functional cost to the overhead structure of the company. So you know, the plant fixed cost is really a function of the destocking and what we can do from a volume perspective. So looking hard at contractors, looking hard at the plant fixed cost, and looking, looking hard at making sure that we can temporarily adjust our cost structure to align with the volume environment that we're seeing. And then on the, on kind of the SG&A side or the functional cost, general administrative, that's just continued cleaning out.\nSo as Ed had mentioned, we're constantly looking to make sure that we're running as efficient an organization as possible. So that's where the focus will be. We really won't be touching R&D, marketing, and sales. So you know, we believe this destocking period is temporary, and so we really need to be prepared when it comes back on the other side to be able to take advantage of the upside. So that really won't be the focus. It'd be more on the plant cost and the functional spend.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nUnderstood. Then just on interconnects and semis, did you gain any share this year or is there any new technology? Products down the pipeline that you think can grow share this year or next year?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so there's examples in both. So within semi really around the packaging side, we've seen some nice share gains. And also just in general, we've seen an uptick on the advanced node components. And so if you actually look at our performance in the quarter, we had nice growth with TSMC as they continue to expand their advanced nodes and take advantage of the AI revolution. So we saw nice growth on the semi side. And then within ICS we had a new application with one of the large smartphone producers which took advantage of a material that crossed over our metallization business to be able to have a key win there.\nSo that was part of the sequential growth that we saw in the quarter and we continue to see it's on every single model of the phone for the one producer. So it was a nice win for us.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director and Senior Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst] (KeyBanc Capital Markets)\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nThanks. Good morning everyone. This is Ryan for Aleksey. My first question comes around the Shelter Solutions business. Just in terms of where do you think we are in the destocking cycle there and demand, and how good. Is your visibility into 2024 here?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so we saw less of a year-over-year headwind in shelter in Q3 versus what we saw in first half. So we feel like things are starting to normalize a little bit. And then our expectations for Q4 are to see less volume declines than we're seeing year to date. So it feels like things are normalizing a little bit. You know, obviously there's a little bit of disparity from a market perspective between the resi and the commercial side. A lot of the growth that was on the commercial side is more in commercial applications where we don't have a big footprint, like for example around the data centers. Our exposure in commercial is more around education, healthcare, and government where there hasn't been that step change both. It's really been more on the data center side.\nBut in general, it feels like we're nearing the end of the significant downturns. We expect the volumes in the Q4 to be more down in the mid single digits versus the double digits that we've seen all year. So it feels like it's starting to normalize, and we do believe the destock is now behind us. So now it's just a function of when the demand returns.\n\n[Analyst] (KeyBanc Capital Markets)\n\nAnalyst, KeyBanc Capital Markets\n\nOkay, very helpful, thank you. Then, you know, just a question from me. You mentioned China trade restrictions and the impact it had on the Semiconductor Technologies business. Wondering if you might be able to quantify that impact there. And then just any updated view on. The recently announced restrictions there. Thank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so no change to our current view of about $60 million of a revenue headwind from the exposure. So a lot of our.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nFor the year.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nFor the year, yes.It's about $15 million forward or so. A lot of the restrictions have more been in the advanced node spaces that we don't have a huge footprint with the Chinese players from that perspective. So it's only about $60 million for us.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Josh Spector of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to ask on Q4. I mean, it kind of seems like the puck's moving around in different areas in terms of destocking. But if I heard you right, your sales guidance is kind of flattish in the different segments sequentially. Semi's is picking up, which has the highest drop through, and you're expecting some higher raw material benefits. So what would drive EBITDA down sequentially $2,025 million versus flat top.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so we see the underlying revenue down about $100 million once you on an organic basis. So we will get another quarter of the Spectrum business in Q3. But if you take that out, we see underlying organic revenue down about $100 million. So it's about split between seasonality and currency, being about half of the headwind, with the seasonality being within primarily the smartphone and consumer electronics business, ICS, and Shelter as they shrink throughout the summer months. And then currency we do see as a bit of a headwind sequentially. And then the other half of it is from the medical packaging piece that Ed had mentioned earlier. So we do see some medical packaging pullback in Q4 as those device makers destock from the overbuy that happened.\nOver the recent quarters. So it's really just, and then the EBITDA you have a net benefit from additional spreads we had mentioned. There's about $25 million of additional benefit from spread. But that $100 million impact from the volume decline kind of net you out to the rounding the 750 that we guided to for the Q4 versus the 775 that we posted in the Q3.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks. No, I appreciate that. And I mean just if you kind of come back to electronics and semis, I think Ed, you said utilization rates in the mid-70s. I think we've maybe troughed in the high 60s. So you guys haven't really felt as much of that pickup. I guess as you look at things improving. How much does semi's reconnect in your business year on year just from a reconnection to where the rate is now? I mean is that mid single digits or higher just on where we're run rating now past inventory or would it be a different math to get to a different level? Thanks.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nWell, the facts have been, to your point, running kind of, if you lump them all together, I think you would average out in the high 60s. And I think if you go through all the projections out there and us talking to our customers, that high 60s is going to ramp through 2024 up to, by the time you get maybe end of Q3, beginning of Q4, up to maybe a little over 80, 80%.\nSo you still won't be back according to projections kind of over 90% till you enter into 2025. But again, going from high 60s to 80% is a nice lift over in a year, and then more of that, that production will be advanced nodes, which back to Lori's point a minute ago, you know, plays to our strength. You know, that's usually why we outgrow 2 to 300 basis points what the market's doing. But you know, it's also, by the way, you also got to look customer by customer on the semi side because some are still shipping. We're shipping out of inventory. But all the signs I saw from all their reporting publicly, you know, they're starting, they've seen their bottom, it looks like pretty much across the board.\nBut I don't think the lift will be, you know, dramatic in the, you know, at the beginning of the year. But I think as the year sequences, we'll see nice lift occurring in that business.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYep, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes online to Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. A couple of questions here. First on, you know, the distributor part of the supply chain, not just for you, but for pretty much everybody seems to have taken it more on the chin with the overstocking and then the destocking. Do you have a sense of whether that was just they were a little too overzealous with principal risk loading up and then on the way back down? Is the issue just that they don't have the same access to credit or just the higher, the higher rates?\nAnd I guess what I'm getting at is do you think over time your terms with distribution and maybe some of your other customers are going to need to change in a way that might require you to hold more working capital or to give them incentives to move it along? I guess I'm just sort of asking. What's going to ultimately break the logjam of the game of hot potato, of nobody wanting to hold inventory?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, I don't think it's. I really think it's just, you know, we all over build inventory, you know, direct vendors and distributors through the COVID period. I mean, we all talked about it and you know, I go back to my example on the medical packaging side. The customers were just yelling for us to get more to them. And usually when that happens, you see an overshoot happen, you know, and some of them probably even double order. I've been through that before in my career. And you know, and then you get the snapback. So I think that's all we're going through, is that they're adjusting inventory back to appropriate levels.\nThey don't have to worry about carrying excess inventory, you know, because supply chains are normalized again and again. We're doing the same thing. We're feeling confident about, you know, being able to get supply of all our different components. So we're working our inventory levels down from what were elevated levels because of the COVID stuff. So I don't think we'll have to worry about different terms or anything with it, with our distributors.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, good to hear. Lori, can I just ask you what's updated thoughts on minimum cash levels that you want to keep? Just as we think about next year and your free cash flow generation versus what you might do from a share repurchase perspective?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours",
    "content2": "Yeah, so we'll start still target about $1.5 billion of minimum cash levels. As we had mentioned on the call, we'll look to return a significant portion of our cash flow to shareholders next year through share repurchases. So we'll be done with the existing ASR at some point later in Q1 and then that'll give us the ability to get back into the market underneath a new program. As Ed had mentioned, we have the Delrin proceeds coming in at some point today. So we'll have that cash come in the door and then when we're in an open window again, we'll be able to do more share repurchase.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch of Fermium Research. Your line is open.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nGood morning. Wanted to follow up on. Hey Ed, how you doing? Wanted to follow up on Spectrum. You indicated that financially it was performing in line with your projections. I was just curious. I think you indicated that you expected like something like 45 million of EBITDA for the balance of 2023 since you closed it on 1 August. And also I think you guys indicated you get about 20 million of synergies. Are those numbers still accurate? What's your take on Spectrum so far?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, so Spectrum's performing according to plan. They've got nice growth on a year-over-year basis, especially within the medical device side. So the majority of the business is medical device. There is a piece that goes into industrial, and it's really based on some nice key wins that they've had with some of the large medical device producers. So we're pleased with the performance that we've seen. The numbers that you had cited earlier are still on track. And then the synergy delivery is $60 million in total. It's over, you know, a couple year time frame for us to realize those synergies, but that continues to remain on track as well.\nObviously the initial synergy delivery will come from some. Overhead consolidation, and then we'll get after the procurement related synergies and maybe some of the site related synergies over time.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nVery helpful, thank you Lori. If I could follow up on Semiconductor Technologies. You indicated that AI growth is going to help this business in the future. Can you give us an idea of the size that you anticipate AI to grow to over 2024, 2025 in terms of your semiconductor business?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nWell, I would go Frank, more high level. I think a lot of the growth we'll get will allow the semiconductor business. Again, once we get through this, the downturn here and all that, this business can grow kind of mid to high single digit, which by the way it was doing before all the destock hit. Again, if the market grows 5 to 6 to 7 points, we'll grow 200 to 300 basis points above that. And that 200 to 300 basis points is mostly because of that high-end chip, because of AI enablement and all that. And you know that plays to our sweet spot. So that's how we get that outsized growth usually over the market, and AI plays right into that.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, maybe just to help describe it for you too. So within our semi portfolio we have about a $700 billion business in data centers overall, and about a little more than 1/3 of that is direct to AI. So that's really a nice portion of growth that we can continue to see above the overall MSI projections.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nVery helpful. Thanks so much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nThanks Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Your line is open.\n\nRock Hoffman\n\nEquity Research Associate, Bank of America\n\nHi, I have Rock Hoffman on for Steve Byrne. Just going back to the Spectrum business. Now that you've had the business for a couple months, do you see any opportunities for cross selling to these medical device companies?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, that was one of the large theses for the revenue synergy upside, that they are very strong and have great relationships on the medical device side, and we're very strong and have great relationships on the biopharma side. And how can we bring those two? Pieces together to generate revenue synergy? So it's been a couple of months in that thesis as we initially saw it continues to play out, and we don't have the revenue synergies in hand right now, but we see nice opportunities as we continue to integrate these two businesses together.\n\nRock Hoffman\n\nEquity Research Associate, Bank of America\n\nI see. That's great. And then which of your businesses do you see the most potential for share gains and new product introduction versus volumes that are driven primarily by cyclical recoveries?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, I mean I think we see. If we take it by segment within E&I, we've mentioned that we should see 2 to 300 basis points of outsized market growth within semi, and that's a combination of share gain and just where our exposure is and advanced nodes in the areas that are growing faster than others. We also see a step change opportunity within the general consumer electronics space. We have seen some nice share gain on the metallization side. It'll continue to show in the top line as the PCB providers start to ramp up their utilization rates to more normal levels. But we have seen, we have seen our performance versus some of the peers in the metallization space be better. Then within the W&P portfolio, we continue to expect nice growth within water.\nYou know, obviously we're in a destock right now, but we'll see nice growth more from a secular basis. So just that water industry is generally growing in mid-single digits, which is a nice market for us. And on the. Safety side, it's really going to be we've added capacity now and we have to. We'll get step change growth from utilizing that capacity. So we're nearing the completion of an additional line for Tyvek.\nWe've constrained the Tyvek market for years, and so we'll see some nice lift there as we fill up that asset. And we recently expanded some capacity within a new technology in the Kevlar space. So it's a new opportunity for us to bring a lighter weight Kevlar to the market, and we look for good things from that business as well. And Shelter generally should be more along a GDP type grower.\n\nRock Hoffman\n\nEquity Research Associate, Bank of America\n\nUnderstood, thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question today comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks for that question. Hey, just wanted to take a quick try at maybe kind of mid-cycle or longer-term earnings growth. If you think about volumes kind of maybe double digits below normal in electronics and then some leverage on a recovery, there, you're exiting the year at around $3 billion of annualized EBITDA. Would that imply something in the 3.3% to 3.6% kind of range as far as when you take a look at longer-term or mid-cycle where you want to get to? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont de Nemours\n\nYeah, I mean, longer term, you know, you should get back into the. We were running the E&I portfolio. I think is where your focus was in the more of the 32% margin range, and we should see, you know, the volume kind of return there over time as the utilization rates at the large PCB guys and the semi guys return. But if we look more near term as far as headwinds, tailwinds as we head into 2024, there's definitely tailwinds from volume growth, from the electronics recovery and normalization of the destock, and there's obviously incremental tailwinds from the deflation we had mentioned as we go forward, and then the benefit of the restructuring actions that we are now taking, and we'll start to see the benefit of at some point later in the Q1.\nAnd then, just from an EPS perspective, we do continue to lower our share count. So, what we'll see lower Q4 share count versus the full year, which will carry us into 2024, and then we'll have the incremental benefit of the $2 billion program that we'll complete in the Q1, and then advance new shares, new share takeout as well. We'll see a nice EPS benefit that we've seen.\nAs we took shares out throughout 2023. The headwinds though are, you know, I think we will continue to see the industrial destock impact the water and safety businesses primarily in Q1. So that'll be a headwind to the Q1. We will see most likely some price moderation or give back primarily in the shelter businesses Ed had mentioned. So we'll try and maintain that as long as we can. But we will be cognizant of a potential share loss and potentially have to be giving some back there. And then just we have taken some aggressive actions on the compensation side in 2023. So we are paying a below target variable compensation payout this year, and so we would most likely see normalization of that as we head into 2024.\nSo those are the big puts and takes with the one extra exception from a below the line perspective around interest income. So we did see about $145 million of interest income this year just as we held the proceeds from the selling each transaction in the first half before we could deploy them to Spectrum and then the full share repurchase program. So we would see a step down in 2024 from interest income from about $145 million this year to probably $20 million next year.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nI would like to hand the call back over to Chris Mecray for closing comments.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nVP of Investor Relations, DuPont de Nemours\n\nOkay, thank you all for joining our call this morning, and for your reference a copy of our transcript will be posted on our website.

Chris McRae, you may now begin your conference.\n\nChris McRae\n\nInvestor Relations, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont Q2 2023 financial results conference call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer, and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link.\nPlease read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nOur Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today are on a continuing operations basis and exclude significant items.\nWe will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and presentation materials that have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our Q2 2023 financial review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with revenue and operating EBITDA better than our previously communicated guidance.\nThis performance reflects our team's ongoing strong execution while facing continued volume pressure in consumer-driven end markets, mainly electronics. In the Q2, organic revenue declined 4% versus the year-ago period, despite mid-teens organic declines from the interconnect solutions and semiconductor lines of business within E&I.\nWe continue to see broad demand strength in industrial end markets, including water, automotive, aerospace, as well as healthcare, along with continued carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure. Notably, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, and adjusted EPS were all up sequentially from Q1. After nearly a year-long downturn, we also saw a sequential sales lift in interconnect solutions of 7%.\nWe also continue to be proactive in taking additional actions within our control to minimize the impact of volume declines, given near-term slowdown in select end markets, while also focusing on optimizing cash generation. Turning to slide four, we continue to advance a number of strategic priorities for creative and value-added capital deployment.\nYesterday, we announced completion of the Spectrum acquisition, a leader in critical specialty devices for healthcare end markets. This acquisition fully aligns with our strategic objectives of increasing top-line growth through customer-driven innovation and expanding our industrial technologies growth pillar while adding to our current offerings in the high-growth healthcare market.\nSpectrum is being integrated into our industrial solutions line of business, where it fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise. With annual sales of about $500 million, Spectrum, together with Liveo and our Tyvek healthcare packaging business, increases our total revenue in healthcare markets to about 10% of our portfolio, with expected growth rates above the company average.\nSpectrum's year-to-date performance has been solid, and we are pleased that operating results are in line with our deal model estimates, which include an estimated operating EBITDA margin of approximately 22%.\nWe are excited by Spectrum's complementary fit and specifically our ability to leverage incremental growth opportunities, including synergies from cross-selling into complementary accounts, new and faster product development, and deeper design and co-development partnerships with OEMs. Further on M&A, we continue to make progress with our Delrin business divestiture, and our expectation of closing this planned transaction around year-end 2023 remains unchanged.\nThere has been good interest in the asset to date. Regarding share repurchases, we expect we will complete the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction launched last November within a month. We also intend to complete our remaining authorization through a new $2 billion ASR to be executed shortly thereafter.\nRegarding the water district settlement that was announced in June, jointly with Chemours and Corteva, this settlement comprehensively covers PFAS-related claims of public water systems serving the vast majority of the US population. Our portion of the settlement is about $400 million, and we expect final approval about six months following preliminary approval, which we expect to receive shortly.\nRegarding broader capital allocation goals, yesterday's closing of the Spectrum deal and the new $2 billion ASR essentially completes the deployment of excess cash remaining from the M&M divestiture last November. Our current capitalization remains very sound, and as a reminder, we have no significant debt maturities until November 2025.\nWe are comfortable with a net leverage point around 2x as an equilibrium target going forward. Before I turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance, let me add that we remain excited about the visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges.\nTo name just a few, strong growth is expected in the semiconductor industry with the ongoing global investment in new fabs. Overall growth in the semiconductor industry is anticipated to be high single digits over the coming five-year period. We have the leading materials to enable the next generation of advanced chip manufacturing and packaging, which includes significant technology and support from the emerging generative AI revolution.\nWithin water, we continue to drive growth and desalination, and wastewater markets, and in helping customers achieve their sustainability goals. Finally, our auto adhesives business is well-positioned to continue to capture growth with its product offerings and electric vehicles. With that, I'll turn it over to Lori.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. Our focus remains on operational excellence and strong execution, and we are pleased to have delivered financial results ahead of expectations despite volume pressure in some of our most profitable lines of business within electronics. T\nurning to our financial highlights on slide five, Q2 net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 7% as reported and 4% on an organic basis versus the year-ago period. Currency results in a 1% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the won and yen, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes.\nBreaking down the 4% organic sales decline, a 6% volume decline was partially offset by a 2% pricing gain, reflecting continued carryover benefit of actions taken last year to offset broad-based inflation.\nVolume decline primarily reflects continued demand weakness in consumer electronics, coupled with inventory desocking across the channel and some softness, including desocking in North American construction-related markets. Lower volume in these consumer-driven end markets was partially mitigated by continued strength in water, automotive, aerospace, and healthcare markets.\nVolume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down 15% versus the year-ago period, while our remaining industrial-based businesses were up about 4%. From a regional perspective, Europe sales in the quarter were up 4% on an organic basis, while North America and Asia-Pacific were down 3% and 8% respectively versus the year-ago period.\nChina sales were down 14% on an organic basis, driven mainly by the electronics demand weakness, but increased sequentially versus Q1. Q2 operating EBITDA of 738 million decreased 11% versus the year-ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates in electronics as we aligned inventory with demand.\nOperating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.9% was down 110 basis points versus the year-ago period, driven by volume pressure, reduced production rates, and mixed headwinds in the high-margin semi business. On a sequential basis, operating EBITDA and operating EBITDA margin were up from the Q1.\nDecremental margin for the quarter was 40%. Excluding the impact of absorption headwinds related to reduced production rates within electronics, decremental margin was below 20%, enabled by aggressive actions taken year-to-date to reduce discretionary spend. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.85 per share was down 3% versus last year, which I will detail shortly.\nLooking at cash performance, I would first like to highlight that we have made a reporting change effective with today's Q2 results and are now providing cash flow disclosure separated between continuing and discontinued operations. This change is being made to improve visibility into cash flow generation and cash flow conversions of the ongoing businesses.\nOn a continuing operations basis, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $400 million, plus CapEx of $123 million, resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $277 million and associated conversion of 73%. This reflects significant improvement versus last year on a comparable basis, driven by lower inventory.\nAdjusted free cash flow included a benefit of about $80 million in reduced inventory and a headwind of about $200 million related to interest payments. Optimizing cash flow continues to be a top priority for us.\nWhile adjusted free cash flow and conversion improved sequentially, we still have work to do to get to our targeted levels and expect further improvement in working capital metrics by year-end. Turning to slide six, adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.85 decreased 3% compared to $0.88 in the year-ago period. Lower segment results more than offset below-the-line benefits, including a $0.19 benefit related to lower net interest expense, and a lower share cap.\nA higher tax rate and exchange losses during the quarter resulted in adjusted EPS headwinds of $0.08 per share. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.7%, up from 22.6% in the year-ago period, driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide seven.\nE&I's Q2 net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 14% as organic sales declined 12% due to lower volume, along with currency headwinds and an unfavorable portfolio impact of 1% each. At the line-of-business level, volume for semiconductor technologies decreased 19%, while interconnect solutions volume decreased 15% versus the year-ago period.\nThe decline in semi tech resulted from a continuation of lower semiconductor fab utilization rates due to weakened market demand, as well as inventory destocking across the channel. Chip fab utilization rates in Q2 averaged in the low 70s%. The decline in interconnect was driven by continued weak smartphone, PC, and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking.\nOur PCB customers in China operated in Q2 with utilization rates slightly improved from the mid-40s during Q1, which was a cycle low. The PCB market has been in slowdown for a year now, and we are beginning to see signs of improvement within our interconnect business, illustrated by Q1 to Q2 sequential growth of about 7%, with further expected sequential growth in Q3.\nSales for industrial solutions were flat on an organic basis, as pricing and ongoing strength in broad-based industrial markets were offset by lower demand in largely consumer-driven areas such as advanced printing applications and those tied to electronics markets, including OLED displays.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $349 million was down versus the year-ago period, primarily due to volume declines and lower operating rates to better align inventory with demand, partially offset by reduced discretionary spend. Turning to slide eight, W&P's Q2 net sales of $1.5 billion were flat versus last year, as organic sales growth of 1% was offset by a 1% currency headwind.\nOrganic growth of 1% reflects a 5% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, mostly offset by a 4% decrease in segment volumes due to declines in shelter solutions. At the line-of-business level, organic sales growth was led by water solutions, which was up mid-teens, on continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis and ion exchange resins, along with benefits from carryover pricing.\nSafety solution sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis, driven by carryover pricing and volume strength in Kevlar and Nomex within aerospace and automotive markets, especially for EVs, coupled with Tyvek strength in healthcare. Shelter solutions were down 12% on an organic basis, driven by demand softness in construction markets, as well as de-stocking, although we do expect a reduced impact from de-stocking in the second half.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P during the quarter was $368 million, up 6%, while operating EBITDA margin of 24.6% increased 140 basis points versus the year-ago period. The improvement resulted primarily from net pricing gains and disciplined cost control, which more than offset volume decline.\nTurning to slide 9, I will close with a few comments on our outlook and guidance for Q3 and full year 2023. Regarding the demand environment, we continue to expect fairly steady demand in most of our industrial end markets within E&I and W&P, although we expect sales moderation in our water business due to slower demand in China.\nWithin electronics, we saw stabilization and some early lift in our interconnect solutions business, with 7% sequential improvement in sales during Q2, and we expect mid-single digit sequential growth to follow in Q3.\nWe believe semi markets likely bottom during Q2, and we assume that net sales in H2 will improve slightly on a sequential basis. Given ongoing consumer electronics demand headwinds, notably in China, we have tempered the rate of second-half growth from prior assumptions.\nWe are adjusting our full year 2023 guidance to account for the slower cadence of recovery in electronics, including our efforts to continue to reduce production to align inventory with demand. In addition, our Q3 and full year guidance now includes the estimated contribution from Spectrum beginning 1 August.\nFor the full year, we now expect net sales to be between $12.45 and 12.55 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $2.975 and 3.025 billion, and adjusted EPS to be between $3.40 and $3.50 per share.\nFor Q3 2023, we expect revenue of approximately $3.15 billion, operating EBITDA of approximately $755 million, and adjusted EPS of approximately $0.84 per share. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO\n\nHi, good morning. This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Maybe on the water business, the water business tends to be a bit less cyclical compared to your other businesses. Can you add some color on what is driving the softness in China? What changed there since maybe last quarter, and what kind of recovery do you expect maybe over the next couple of quarters?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, we think the next couple of quarters are just a little bit lighter because of China, and it's really a slowness in the industrial economy in China right now, which obviously should rebound here at some point, but we're expecting that to be a little softer in the second half of the year. By the way, that's growth that we've had in our business is a double-digit growth, so we're just saying it's going to moderate some, still growth, but just lower growth on the second half of the year.\nBut as that business has done quarter and quarter out, it grows at a pretty nice clip, and I expect as China improves some, that growth rate will pick up also. And remember, 70% of that business is renewable business that's steady. So I think a couple of quarters, maybe a little lighter in China is what we're seeing.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO\n\nGot it. And then in electronics, great to see the inflection coming in Interconnect Solutions. We have also seen some positive MSI data points. What are you hearing in semi technologies? When do you expect an inflection there? And maybe any color on your order books for electronics that you're seeing this quarter so far?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so just by the way, just back to the ICS one. That started to decline, and destocking started about the middle of 2022. So it's almost been kind of 10 months that's been in a downturn. In the Q1, it was really when it bottomed. And then we did see 7% sequential pickup, and we're expecting mid-single digit pickup by the forecast we had for the Q3.\nSo obviously, that's starting to come nicely off the bottom. The semi one is the one we tempered a little more in the second half. We look like we hit the bottom in the Q2. We're not seeing much upturn in the Q3 in semi. We're assuming we have another quarter kind of near the bottom or just very slightly up from that.\nAnd then we think somewhere the inflection point is more in Q4, but it's hard to tell what month you actually see it. So we did pick it up a little bit in the forecast in Q4, but not significantly. So that's the thing we kind of tapped down when we gave you the guidance here today. But I think we've seen the bottom in semi, and we're seeing the lift begin in ICS.\nNow, remember, ICS is still negative. It has a ways to come back still, but it was down over 20%, and we're starting to ride it back. Those will still be negative in Q3 and Q4 year-over-year compare.\n\nBhavesh Lodaya\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, BMO\n\nAppreciate the time. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho Securities.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nGreat. Thank you so much. If we just circle back very quickly to the ICS side, there's been a bit of a difference between how China handset sales have been trending of late versus the rest of the Western world in terms of how to think about that. I'd love some comments on how to think about that into the second half of the year, as well as you do have a few customers with some potential new launches in the second half.\nSo just in terms of the normalization process, it would be very helpful to get some commentary on how to think about that as it trends more into the second half, but probably more importantly, even into 2024, based on kind of the renewed, I'd say, much lower bar than we've seen in the past, let's say, year and a half or so. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, let me comment on, turn it over to Lori Koch. I don't want to say customer names, but we're in good shape this year on the new models being introduced by a couple of the large cell phone players. So from a market share standpoint, we know which phones we're in, and we're in a better position than we were last year. Not that we were in a bad position at all last year, but we feel like we're in a good position with the launch of the new models coming in.\nWe know what we're in in those phones. And by the way, clearly, one of the things I think you all know we're in is the Kapton technology for the 5G antenna, is a key component for us, along with some other components, but that's a key one. Lori, you want to just talk about the timing of.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, on the smartphone and broadly the consumer electronics recovery, that was part of the revision that we had in the second half. So our original expectations on a full year basis for smartphones were to be down about 1% and PCs down about 7%. We've revised expectations on each of those and aligns with industry forecasts for smartphones down to be more in the 5% range and PCs probably low double digits.\nBut that does embed year-over-year growth in the Q4. So it sounds like one more quarter of year-over-year down in the Q3 and then recovery in the fourth into a more normal market and most likely setting up for a strong 2024 as those markets are completely through the destock and returning to more of a normal demand and growth pattern.\n\nChristopher Parkinson\n\nSenior Analyst, Mizuho\n\nThat's very helpful. Just as a very quick follow-up to some of the W&P side, you've seen some very, very solid growth out of water solutions, but you did have some comments as it pertains to the kind of the second half based on some fairly difficult comps, my understanding. Can you just hit on kind of what's the outlook for this business?\nIs your commentary solely a function of just the difficult comps, and you'd expect kind of a reacceleration in 2024? If you could just hit on that kind of that cadence and how we should be continuously thinking about that business in the long term, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, I think the way to look at it, that business is consistent. It is choppy some quarters. Just, we have a big installation we're doing and all that. So it's not going to be every single quarter, but generally that business grows kind of mid to high single digits pretty consistently. Now, this past quarter, we had even a better quarter than that on the growth rate.\nSo again, it can be lumpy, but when you kind of smooth out the whole year, I think that's the way to look at it. You're kind of in that 6% to 8% growth range when you smooth out the year. And look, I expect China activity will pick up, but it's hard to tell if there's a little bit of excess inventory also that is part of it. But we're, again, expecting a couple of just lighter quarters.\nBy the way, quarters with growth in Q3, but just lighter than we had in Q2. And I think, again, it's a consistent business, and it has been since we've had it. So I would expect it to continue to grow in that range.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, and to add comment on the lumpiness, if you put a two-year stack on the volume, we're up high single digits every quarter. So there is lumpiness from comments around sometimes some project work going on, but in general, it's a really strong growth for us.\nAnd there's no change in our so forward forecast, especially with the requirements that are going around around sustainability and the access to clean water. Those are the key growth drivers for us.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThe key here is there's a replacement business that's 70% of the business. That adds to the consistency of it.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nUS Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you. Ed, is it fair to say that Delrin will be a private equity transaction? It would seem to be hard for a strategic to do a closing by year-end at this point.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We're pretty confident we'll close it by year-end. I would just say private equity has been interested along with strategic, but I don't want to get into any more than that at this point in time. I think we're highly confident we'll have a deal. There's been nice interest in it.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nUS Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nAnd then secondly, there has been some challenges to the 3M PFAS settlement. Are you anticipating having to go through a similar process with your settlement?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, John, what happened here was very typical of these bigger type of settlements that happened, these class actions. If you go back and look at any of the other big ones, you always get that. I think what you're referring to is the challenge from some state AGs and all that.\nI don't think by what we're hearing that there's going to be a problem here. We're thinking in the very near future we get preliminary approval from the judge. And as we said in our prepared remarks, it would be about six months after that preliminary approval from the judge where we would then be finished with that and make the payment.\n\nJohn Roberts\n\nUS Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Tusa from J.P. Morgan.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nHey, good morning, Steve.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nCan you just give us a bit of an update. I know these businesses aren't the most raw material-centric anymore, but maybe just a bit of an update on the raw material outlook for this year. I'm not sure if you called it out in the beginning of the call. The $100 million you were talking about before?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah, so that was a net headwind between price and ROS. And so we did increase that to about $140 million from our prior view of $100 million. So we have seen a step up in the expected benefit from deflation. To remind you, it was roundly $800 million last year of a headwind that we saw.\nAnd so we've got obviously a fair bit of room to go to get all of that money back, but we're making really nice progress. Initially, a lot of the deflation is coming from the energy and logistics side. So you can see what the natural gas prices have done from the peaks that we saw in the Q3 of last year. And with the stabilization in the supply chains, we're seeing nice improvement in logistics.\nThe one piece that we're working through is just the timing of when that falls through the P&L. We actually, in Q1 predominantly, a little bit in Q2, actually saw some headwinds from the carryover from the escalation in 2022 from a P&L perspective. As we head into the back half of the year, we'll start to see those benefits that we've been getting from a procurement perspective drop into the P&L.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah, Steve, it kind of takes four to five months on the ROS to work its way through into our system that we build a customer. So some of this we're obviously going to see now in 2024. But the procurement team has been working very aggressively, and Lori and I meet with them on a very consistent basis because it's a big part of teeing up 2024 for us. By the way, Steve, just as a side note, the margins on E&I, remember, not much of the ROS were in E&I.\nWe only raised prices 2% there. The predominant part of it is going to become in W&P. And the thing that affected the margins in E&I is really the absorption charge that we've taken. By the way, we're going to take it again in Q3.\nWe're probably going to take it in Q4 just to make sure everything's teed up for 2024. That's affected our—like in Q2, that affected our margins in E&I by about 400 basis points. Without the absorption, we know we're running that business north of 30, even in a reduced volume environment. I feel very confident. You all watched us run that in that 32%, 33% EBITDA range. I'm very comfortable when I look at our math that we're in good shape there as we rebound.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nIs there any risk around anything you're seeing in pricing in W&P that, when you look out to the second half or into next year, any aggression on pricing in those businesses?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nSo very small. The one area we're going to give up some price that we forecasted in the second half of the year is in the construction-related markets. We also had to raise them very significantly in those markets because of what the ROS did last year. So we've made an assumption in this forecast that we'll give up some of the pricing there. Otherwise, we're feeling pretty solid across the rest of the portfolio.\n\nSteve Tusa\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nOkay. Great. Thanks a lot.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you. Ed and Lori, how much did Spectrum add to Q3 and 2023 guidance?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So in total, it'll give you about a little north of $200 million in sales at a 22% margin. It's pretty consistent across the month. So you'll take two months of it in Q3 and then the full three months in Q4. From an EPS perspective, though, it's really only about $0.01 on a full-year basis once you factor in the loss of the interest income from the cash that we paid for the deal. So it's more of an EBITDA function versus an EPS position.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nGot it. And just on destocking and shelter, where do you think we are? I know you said we're close to the end here or it's moderating. How much further do you think we have to go in shelter solutions destocking?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nI think it's mostly done destocking by the end of this Q3. And that's talking to a couple of our key distributors and customers. One of the big box guys, by the way, was doing a rebalancing of all their inventory by moving it around to different stores and regions. That's how they were doing it. And they're pretty much through that process. So I think in the Q3, we're kind of there.\n\nDavid Begleiter\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYep, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Leithead from Barclays.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question, your corporate and retained business came in a bit better than it historically has. Can you just help us unpack what happened this quarter there and just how that should trend going forward?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So we had a really strong growth within corporate M&M. It was driven by the adhesive piece, which is the largest segment of it. And it's really from the EV growth and the overall auto build growth. So auto builds were up about 16% in Q2. We would have posted a similar number. And we see really nice performance in the EV piece. So that's what drove the improvement year-over-year primarily.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. And then second, just on E&I, you talked about reducing production rates to help manage inventory. Do you expect that to still be some degree of drag in the second half to earnings? And then just relatedly, how should we expect working capital to finish out this year?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. No, we're definitely going to take the absorption this quarter. We're in now Q3, about $40 million, and the same in Q4 is our plan. So we're really getting inventory aligned up very well with demand. So we just feel it's the prudent thing to do right now. So that's what's baked into the plan that we give it here today.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. We saw a nice improvement in inventory in the Q2, about $80 million of a reduction. We'll look to continue to drive that down as we get into the end of the year. We had an improvement sequentially in both cash generation and cash conversion. We'll look to continue to improve that as we get into the back half of the year.\nOur Q3 is typically our strongest quarter for cash generation because we don't have an interest payment, which we have in the Q2 and the Q4. We typically pay our annual bonus in the Q1. So the Q3 is the cleanest from that perspective. And just the note that I had mentioned on the script is to make sure that you caught it. We will move to a continuing ops basis presentation in cash flow.\nSo we'll take out all the noise from the discontinued ops components, which are primarily, in this year, the funding of the escrow account, which will take place at some point in the second half, and then the funding of the other MOU items. So we'll pull that out and just kind of focus on continuing operations and remain cash generation.\n\nMike Leithead\n\nDirector of Equity Research, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess first, I wanted to ask on the Q3 guidance. So if we look organic sales and EBITDA, you're kind of guiding flat sequentially, but you're talking about ICS up mid-single digits. Sounds like raw materials could be a little bit better of a help.\nTypically, with ICS up, you get a mixed benefit there. So what drives that flat EBITDA? What are some of the offsetting items that would keep EBITDA flat versus having it up sequentially on an organic basis?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So the three biggest items that we had mentioned, first being the water deceleration. So we see some moderation in water as we get into the back half of the year coming off of a really strong quarter in the Q2. We had also mentioned that we do expect to have to give back some price primarily in the shelter business within water.\nAnd then the third, probably smallest piece, but something worth raising was we do see some small de-stocking within biopharma. So it's been pretty well telegraphed across some of the other players. And we are starting to see that a little bit within our Liveo business and the industrial solutions business in E&I.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. No, that's helpful. I guess when I think about ICS and look into 2024, so I haven't done the full math, but maybe organic, you're down something like 10% this year. I guess when we look at smartphone growth, PC growth, there's not a massive inflection next year. There's better growth forecasted, maybe low single digits.\nI guess how do you think about that ICS business performing relative to that? Do we overbuild some inventory so we don't get the full bounce back, or do you expect it stronger? If you could frame that, that'd be helpful. Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I mean, it's kind of hard to say at this point how the restocking potentially could happen in those two spaces. We would expect it to perform nicely alongside the market. The one tailwind that will happen for us in a year-over-year perspective on EBITDA, we won't have those absorption headwinds that we had in 2022. So the predominance of those absorption happens within both ICS and semi. So those both create tailwinds for us as we head into 2023.\n\nJosh Spector\n\nExecutive Director of Chemicals Equity Research, UBS\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. And good morning. Wondering if you can speak just a little bit about the cost work you've been doing, kind of past, present, and future. Just looking at the income statement, I've got SG&A down about $76 million year to date, R&D down $32 million, and then sundry expense down $40 million.\nAnd maybe you can kind of contextualize those decreases and how they'll play out over the balance of the year and which segments presumably we're seeing the most and the ones that are having the most macro concerns. And maybe just also remind us what sundry expense actually is.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So the predominance of sundry is really not even in operating EBITDA. So it's where our interest income comes in. It's also where some gains on asset sales that don't get reported in operating EBITDA or adjusted EPS come in. So it's not really primarily related to our operating business itself. And there's detail in the Q when that comes out tomorrow about what all of the other specifics are.\nBut that's not really a reflection at all of any of our efforts to control discretionary spend. From that perspective, though, we have been very aggressive on controlling the discretionary spend to minimize the decrementals that we've been posting. And I think we've done a nice job doing that. So in the first half, our decrementals as reported were 40%.\nBut if you take out the headwinds from the absorption that we've been driving to reduce inventory, we're more down in the mid-20s. And so that's really a reflection of the aggressive actions we've taken from both. We did a small restructuring to be able to reduce some headcounts primarily in the G&A space. So we're really trying to keep R&D, marketing, and sales pretty clean.\nAnd then we have been taking some reductions to our annual discretionary compensations or bonus. And so that's what you're seeing more so coming in through the R&D line. That would be a piece of that. And then on the SG&A line, it would be the small actions that we took to reduce headcount as well as the discretionary spend.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. By the way, we're out there, and we've been tightening real good. It's our travel and entertainment budgets. We're trying to keep them. The salespeople are traveling, the application engineers, but we're really being careful on people holding management meetings all over the world and all that. So we're just being. We've really put the word out to our team, \"Hey, while we're in a tougher environment here, we'll come out of it nice, but just watch anything on the discretionary side.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. And then just as a follow-up, Ed, nothing happening presumably on the bolt-on M&A side of the table for the rest of the year or any thoughts there?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo. No, I don't think you'll see anything, obviously, the rest of this year and at least well into next year. I think I said on the last call, a good year pause. We love where we've got the balance sheet at. As I think Lori mentioned on the call or I did, we're going to have leverage exiting here somewhere around 2x. That's where we want to be. And we're in a great spot. And I don't feel like we need to do anything. So we are where we got to where we need to be.\n\nVincent Andrews\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Excellent. Thanks very much.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nHey, good morning. Ed, I had the River House Benedict at Odette's on Sunday. It was very nice. So congrats on that.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nOh, thank you. I haven't had it yet.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nOh, you haven't had it yet? I highly recommend it. I highly recommend it. Hey, following up on the M&A question, auto adhesives is still in your corporate line item. When might we expect that to be folded back into one of the businesses, and/or is that a candidate for divestiture?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nNo, it's not a candidate for divestiture. It's very core to us. We like the position we have, especially with the EV opportunity we have. And we're already obviously seeing a lot of wins there. The growth rate's been phenomenal. So we like that business.\nAnd by the way, I don't think we're going to make any move short-term on pulling it out of there where we're reporting it at this point in time. We've got everything running the way we want. So you won't see anything in the next couple of quarters.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nOkay. Thank you. And then if I look geographically, I mean, Europe has been up year over year based on price. What are your thoughts in terms of volume growth in that region?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So volume growth in general in Europe is about flat. I would expect a similar performance as we get into the back half of the year. Really, the region that's been the toughest for us has been Asia-Pacific, which we've been highlighting, which obviously the dominance of it is China.\nThe price piece, though, it will start to wane as we get into the back half of the year. So we saw it kind of cut in half as we went from Q1 to Q2. And then as we get into Q3 and Q4, it would be flat to slightly negative given some of the price that we would have to give back primarily in the shelter space that we had mentioned.\n\nFrank Mitsch\n\nPresident, Fermium Research\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nYes. Thank you. The EPA has estimated several thousand water districts that would need to comply with the proposed MCLs. My question for you is, Ed, you mentioned you think you could get final approval on the settlement in six months or so. Do you need a certain fraction of those water districts to opt in?\nAnd can you comment on how that is going? And do you have a view on how they will comply? Do you expect they will mostly use carbon, or do you think some of them might employ RO or ion exchange, your technologies?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So look, there's a percentage that have, I'll call it, opt-in or we can walk away from the settlement. So by the way, that's a very high percentage. And we think just to tee it up that that will not be a problem. Remember, a lot of these water districts have been being talked to by the plaintiff side of this. This hasn't been done in a vacuum.\nSo they've been talked to along the way here to get to this, what I'll call, preliminary settlement. So I think shortly, as I said, we will get it approved by the judge on a preliminary basis. And then you work all the opt-ins to make sure you get that done. And then you have final approval once you hit that threshold.\nSo it's really up to each of the different water districts how they're going to handle that, to clean up any PFAS that's in there. So I don't want to comment on that.\n\nSteve Byrne\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Bank of America\n\nAnd then you mentioned that 70% of your water business is renewables. I was just curious. What fraction of that are you selling directly to the customer versus going through an intermediary service provider? And do you have interest in changing that fraction by getting more aggressive in your own salesforce?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nNo, I don't see any change in our go-to-market strategy. The predominance of it is direct as we go to the customers and put the projects in place. And we're just replacing the filters, which is where the recurring revenue base comes from. So this is a, as we had mentioned earlier on the call, kind of a mid-to-high single-digit grower for us. A lot of opportunities we go forward around the sustainability and then the access to clean water.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nThanks, Steve.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about the electronics market here. Could you just elaborate on the destocking, the volume trajectory, I guess, from here? I think previously you'd expected this year to be the main volume negative hit. You'll be facing easier comps next year. Do you think you should grow in kind of, say, the mid-single-digit level for next year, or where do you expect electronics volumes to be next year? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So as we had mentioned, we believe within ICS that we'll continue to see sequential improvement as we head into Q3, and then maybe a little bit of potential improvement as we head into Q4. In the semi, we don't see a material bump in sequential sales until we get into the Q4. But definitely, the year-over-year volume headwinds will start to ease, and we see full-year overall E&I organic growth of about 10%.\nAnd that's primarily a volume reflection. There's not a lot of growth within that segment. So it's probably a little early to call what 2024 looks like. I think there's a pretty good sense that it would be positive just given that you won't have the destock going on. And even if the demand is flat, which would be hard to see, you don't have that headwind from a destock year over year.\nWe're really encouraged as we head into 2024 from the tailwinds that we'll see from not only market recovery and electronics, but also the lapping of the absorption headwinds that we've taken this year to control inventory. The further benefit from deflation as it fully runs through our P&L are kind of the key components that we're keeping track of.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nGreat. Thanks. Just real quickly on the share buyback plans. So you'll be completing the $3.25 billion very soon. Could you just describe how we should think about the other $2 billion that you commence shortly thereafter? Would that be done ratably, or how should we think about that, how it flows in? Thanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So it'll be a similar structure as to the first 3.25. Yes, we'll complete that within a month. And then shortly thereafter, we'll execute the $2 billion ASR. So you'll get 80% of the shares upfront. And then you'll get the 20% cleanup in the back. And it probably will take us about six months to complete that full program. It's usually about a quarter for every billion dollars of shares that you're taking out.\n\nArun Viswanathan\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, RBC Capital Markets\n\nThanks.\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Mike Sisson from Wells Fargo.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, good morning. In terms of semi-technologies and interconnect solutions, I think historically, after a destocking event, you do see some restocking. But given it's taken so long for the destocking to end, how do you think that plays out this time around? Are there any differences between the regions on that?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. I mean, it's hard to say what everyone's going to do with respect to the restock after coming through such a significant destocking. So they might change their normal patterns just given how heavy this one was. So probably a little too early to say what's going to happen from a restocking perspective. But it looks like all things are probably pointing to a nice recovery next year.\nI mean, everyone's destocking. And listen to most calls, and it doesn't even matter what point you all are to with the stabilization that's happening in the supply chain. Generally, everybody seems to be in that zone.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Then just a quick follow-up. E&I has historically been above 30% for EBITDA margins. Sort of get back there, is it just simply getting all the volume back?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. It's really two things: to get the volumes back. But remember a point I think I made earlier when Steve Tusa was on. The EBITDA margins ex the absorption in the Q2 were already over 30%. So the absorption is what pulled it down. The charge we took there could have been the 26.6-ish number.\nSo we know we can, even in a softer volume environment, we're running it a little north of 30. And as you said, and I said earlier, we run this business 32%, 33% EBITDA margins. And we'll get nice throughput if the volumes continue to come back.\n\nMike Sisson\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from Patrick Cunningham from Citibank.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Citibank\n\nHi. Good morning. Is there any updates to your expectations for $20 million in synergy capture from Spectrum? And what should we expect for the cadence there?\n\nLori Koch\n\nCFO, DuPont\n\nYeah. No updates to that. So we still expect $20 million. It probably will take the better part of 12 to 18 months to get the full $20 million out. I mean, obviously, for us, this is more of a revenue synergy opportunity as we bring the two portfolios together and merge our expertise in biopharma with their expertise in medical device from a revenue synergy perspective.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Citibank",
    "content2": "Got it. That's helpful. And how do you expect the healthcare business to trend throughout the year, both on the legacy and the Spectrum side? There's been some commentary pointing to pockets of destocking as companies deplete safety stocks. Have you seen any of that from any of your businesses?\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYeah. So our Liveo business, I think Lori mentioned this a little while ago, on the biopharma side, we're seeing some destocking there. I heard, I think, six other companies in the last week when they did their results that they were seeing some destocking in biopharma.\nMy gut is that lasts a couple of quarters, just to correct that a little bit. It was another one of those markets just like semi. I remember I was getting calls from CEOs in the healthcare business that, \"We need more. We need more.\" I think just like semi, everyone overshot. There's a little bit of a correction going on there. But I'd say that's probably the Q3 and Q4 little correction there. As Lori mentioned earlier, the Spectrum numbers are kind of right around where we thought they would be.\nSo they look like they're teed up for the year we thought they were going to have in the second half of the year here. And I would expect, again, that the growth in our healthcare businesses will be above company average, certainly above GDP.\n\nPatrick Cunningham\n\nVice President and Senior Equity Analyst, Citibank\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nEd Breen\n\nCEO, DuPont\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI now turn the call over to Chris McRae for concluding remarks.\n\nChris McRae\n\nInvestor Relations, DuPont\n\nOkay. Thanks, everybody, for joining our call. Just for your reference, a copy of the transcript will be posted on our website once available. This concludes our call. Thank you."

I would now like to turn the call over to Chris Mecray. Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nChristopher H. Mecray\n\nVP of IR, Treasury & Strategy, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements.\nOur Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure included in our press release and presentation materials and have been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website. I'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nChief Executive Officer, DowDuPont and Executive Chairman for future DuPont, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our First Quarter 2023 Financial Review. This morning, we announced quarterly results with operating EBITDA in line and revenue and adjusted EPS slightly better than our previously communicated guidance. This performance reflects our team's continued strong execution while facing short-term volume pressure in select consumer-driven short-cycle end markets, including electronics and construction.\nFirst quarter organic revenue declined 3% versus the year ago period, despite double-digit declines from electronics lines of business of interconnect solutions and semiconductor technologies, mitigating the weakness in electronics and construction markets, was ongoing broad demand strength in areas, including water, automotive, aerospace and health care, along with the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year to offset inflationary pressure.\nAdjusted EPS was up 2% as we continue to realize benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy. As expected, operating EBITDA declined versus the year ago period driven by lower volumes. Given the near-term slowdown in short-cycle end markets, we continue to be proactive in taking actions within our control to minimize volume pressure while also focusing on optimizing cash flow generation. As a result, we expect to continue to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio and expect that our financial results will generate returns commensurate with top tier multi-industrial assets.\nIn addition to our commitment to generating value through delivery of consistent operating performance, we also continue to focus on accretive and value-added capital deployment. This morning, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Spectrum, a leading manufacturer of critical components and devices for medical end markets for $1.75 billion or $1.72 billion after certain tax attributes. This deal fits with our strategy to focus on the Industrial Technologies growth pillar expanding our offerings into the fast-growing health care market.\nTurning to Slide 4. We have had our eye on Spectrum which is a current DuPont customer for a long time, and our team is extremely excited for this opportunity. Spectrum is a recognized leader in advanced manufacturing of specialty medical devices and components serving 22 of the top 26 medical device OEMs with relationships that date back decades and a strategic focus on fast-growing therapeutic devices and components. Their business is predominantly North American focused and has demonstrated consistent growth over many years. We expect them to generate revenues of about $500 million in 2023.\nAs you can see on Slide 5, DuPont's existing health care portfolio is quite strong today. As a reminder, our current health care portfolio is comprised of Liveo medical device and biopharma consumables business, which is a key part of the Industrial Solutions line of business and our Tyvek Healthcare Packaging business reported through Safety Solutions. Together, these businesses represent $800 million of total revenue and grow at rates exceeding the company average and well above GDP at solid rates of profitability. The Spectrum business fits nicely with our existing Liveo franchise and will complement our established position in biopharma consumables, bringing world-class manufacturing capabilities and deep OEM customer relationships.\nOn Slide 6, you can see the addition of Spectrum to our portfolio is impactful and the combined presence in healthcare will now represent approximately 10% of DuPont's total sales. The transaction adds higher growth while further reducing cyclicality in the portfolio. Also worth noting the transaction significantly increases the total addressable market we serve within health care devices. These businesses are expected to grow at high single-digit rates over time and even faster in 2023 due to specific business wins in place.\nThis transaction has compelling strategic rationale, as you can see on Slide 7. The Spectrum business expands DuPont's growth strategy of customer-centered innovation and strengthen our existing stable position in fast-growing health care end markets. We are excited by the complementary fit and specifically, our ability to leverage the strengths from each side to generate incremental growth opportunities on top of already growing core markets.\nAs an example of this on the biopharma side, DuPont Liveo has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs in the biopharma space and has a proven design and build co-development model. The added advanced manufacturing capabilities enabled by Spectrum will expand its product and capability set to meet stringent customer specifications essentially adding a new pipeline for the Spectrum side by adding new customer relationships.\nOn the medical device side, as an example, Spectrum has extensive direct relationships with leading OEMs including with 22 of the top 26 players, adding Liveo silicone offerings and DuPont's material science technology will enhance Spectrum's depth of cooperation with customers and expand its product offerings. Spectrum is expected to accelerate top line growth for Industrial Solutions and DuPont as a whole.\nRegarding deal terms, the net purchase price of $1.72 billion after certain tax adjustments, represents a 15.6% EBITDA multiple based on 2023 estimates, or 13.2x after moderate expected cost synergies of $20 million. In line with our return hurdles for capital deployment, the acquisition is expected to deliver high single-digit ROIC by year 5, excluding revenue synergies that we described, we believe the combined growth opportunities I just mentioned, can add incremental value to the business combination. We expect this transaction will close by the end of the third quarter this year, and we do not anticipate significant regulatory hurdles. We plan to finance the transaction with cash on hand.\nGiven a lot of moving parts on our capital allocation over the last 6 months, let's briefly review our status on Slide 8. From closing of the M&M sale in November through today, we have deployment actions and plans in place to account for the full $11 billion of gross cash received from the sale through a disciplined capital allocation process. In the fourth quarter of last year, we announced a $5 billion share repurchase authorization and took actions to deleverage our balance sheet by paying down $2.5 billion in senior notes and reducing commercial paper from $1.3 billion to 0 at year-end and remaining undrawn through the first quarter.\nRegarding share repurchases, we still expect to complete the $3.25 billion accelerated share repurchase program launched last November, in the third quarter of this year and remain committed to completing the remaining $2 billion of authorization as an ASR shortly thereafter. Today's announcement to acquire Spectrum with cash on hand, essentially completes the deployment of any remaining excess cash from the M&M transaction. In terms of additional cash sources, I will note that we are progressing with our plans to sell the Delrin business and continue to expect the planned transaction to close by year-end 2023.\nOur current capitalization remains very sound with no significant debt maturities until November 2025. Looking through all currently communicated deployment actions inclusive of the Delrin sale, we expect net leverage to finish the year around 2x. We are comfortable with that leverage point which is more in line with our multi-industrial peers, and we expect to remain at that level as an equilibrium target going forward. With that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. Our first quarter financial results reflect our team's ongoing strong focus on execution and operational excellence as we began 2023. In a pressured volume environment within consumer electronics and construction, we are focused on the operational levers within our control to drive solid operating EBITDA and minimize margin impact despite volume decrements in some of our most profitable lines of business.\nTurning to our financial highlights on Slide 5. First quarter net sales of $3 billion decreased 8% as reported and 3% on an organic basis versus the year ago period. Currency resulted in a 3% headwind from dollar strength against key currencies most notably the Yen, Yuan and Euro, and we also saw a 2% headwind related to portfolio changes. Breaking down the 3% organic sales decline. 4% pricing gains were more than offset by a 7% volume decline. Pricing reflects the carryover impact of actions taken during 2022 to offset broad-based inflation related to raw materials, logistics and energy. Volume decline reflects weakness in consumer electronics, resulting from decreased consumer spending, channel inventory, destocking and softness in construction. Lower volume in these consumer-driven short-cycle end markets was partially mitigated by ongoing strength in water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare markets.\nTaken in combination, volume within electronics and construction end markets during the quarter was down high teens in the aggregate versus the year ago period while our remaining businesses were up low single-digits. From a regional perspective, Europe and North America sales in the quarter were up 5% and 1%, respectively, on an organic basis while Asia Pacific was down 10% versus the year ago period. China sales were down nearly 20%, driven principally by the electronics weakness.\nFirst quarter operating EBITDA of $714 million decreased 13% versus the year ago period, driven by lower volumes and the impact of reduced production rates in electronics as we scale back production to better align with demand. Currency was also a headwind. Operating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 23.7% was down 130 basis points driven by volume pressure and inclusive of mixed headwinds related to lower volumes within the high-margin semi business. Decremental margin for the quarter was 41%. Given the high teens volume declines in our electronics portfolio, our overall decrementals were disproportionately impacted as these businesses are some of the most profitable within the DuPont portfolio.\nAdjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% versus last year, which I will detail shortly. Looking at cash performance. Cash flow from operations during the quarter of $343 million less cash paid for CapEx of $241 million resulted in adjusted free cash flow of $102 million.\nIncluded within free cash flow are transaction cost headwinds of about $75 million related to those cash payments associated with the M&M deal closing and ongoing Delrin Divestiture Cost. Turning to Slide 10.\nAdjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.84 per share increased 2% compared to $0.82 in the year ago period. Headwinds related to overall volume declines were more than offset by the low the line benefits, including an $0.11 benefit related to lower net interest expense and a $0.09 benefit due to share repurchases including the upfront benefit of our ongoing ASR program initiated last November. Our tax rate for the quarter was 23.4%, up from 21.8% in the year ago period resulting in a $0.02 headwind to adjusted EPS, driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings. Turning to segment results, beginning with ENI on Slide 11.\nENI first quarter net sales of $1.3 billion decreased 16% as organic sales declined 13%, along with currency headwinds of 2% and unfavorable portfolio impact of 1%. The organic sales declines reflect a 15% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in price. The organic sales decrease for ENI was driven by Interconnect Solutions, which was down 21% and in Semiconductor Technologies, which was down mid-teens.\nThe decline in interconnect was driven by weak smartphone, PC and tablet demand along with channel inventory destocking. Our [ PCP ] customers in China operates in the first quarter with utilization rates in the mid-40s, which is an expected cycle low. The decline in semi tech resulted from reduced semiconductor fab utilization rates due to weak end market demand as well as downstream destocking of finished chip inventories.\n[ Semi chip fab utilization ] rates in the first quarter averaged around 80% which we expect to dip somewhat in the second quarter as these customers work down inventories. We expect recovery in fab rates began during the third quarter. Sales for Industrial Solutions were up low-single-digits on an organic basis as pricing and ongoing strength in Vespel aerospace products and in healthcare for applications such as biopharma consumables were partially offset by lower demand in largely consumer-driven areas, such as advanced printing and lighting applications.\nOperating EBITDA for ENI of $362 million was down versus the year ago period primarily due to the drop-through impact of volume declines, which correspond to the lower customer utilization rates just referenced and our lower operating rates, as also mentioned. Turning to Slide 12.\n[ WP ] first quarter net sales of $1.45 billion increased 1% as organic sales growth of 4% was mostly offset by a 3% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects a 6% increase in price resulting from the carryover impact of pricing actions taken last year, partially offset by a 2% decrease in segment volumes. Organic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which was up low-double-digits on strong pricing and continued demand growth for water filtration led by reverse osmosis product lines.\nSafety Solutions sales were up mid-single-digits on an organic basis on pricing and volume gains. Volume growth was driven by Kevlar and Nomex demand in aerospace and automotive markets, especially for EVs coupled with Tyvek strength in healthcare. Shelter Solutions was down mid-single-digits on an organic basis on greater than 10% volume decline due to softness in construction markets, partially offset by pricing.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P of $344 million increased 1% as pricing and disciplined cost control were largely offset by inflationary cost pressure, primarily related to higher raw material and energy costs currency headwinds and lower volume. Before I turn it back to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for second quarter and full year 2023 on Slide 13.\nAs we look at the current demand environment, we continue to expect ongoing strength throughout the year in areas such as water, automotive, aerospace and healthcare. Within electronics markets, we continue to see weakness in channel inventory destocking in the near term. Based on recent customer feedback, echoed by their public commentary and third-party market forecast. We expect customer utilization rates to bottom relatively near term and to improve during the third quarter, which is about a quarter later than previously expected.\nTo highlight these assumptions, we've included current market forecasts for semiconductor and smartphone market on Slide 14. For semiconductors, third-party research now suggests MSI will be down 13% for the full year 2023 compared to estimates last quarter, indicating down mid-single-digits, with fab utilization expected to ramp back up above 80% beginning in the fourth quarter. For both of these end markets, you can see the expected improvement beginning during the third quarter, which reflects a later and somewhat more gradual pace than the assumptions last quarter.\nDue to the delay in the near-term recovery, we are adjusting the high end of our full year guidance ranges for net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS. We now expect full year net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.5 billion, operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.1 billion and adjusted EPS to be between $3.55 and $3.70 per share. For the second quarter 2023, we expect similar results for the first quarter as overall market conditions are anticipated to be generally consistent. On a longer-term view, historical data suggests downturns in these markets are short, lasting about 3 to 4 quarters which gives us confidence in the longer-term growth for electronics as we get through this year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nChief Executive Officer, DowDuPont and Executive Chairman for future DuPont, DowDuPont, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori. Before we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report yesterday, highlighting the ongoing work of our employees across the globe to meet our commitments across all aspects of ESG. As a reminder, our sustainability strategy is grounded in 3 pillars: innovation, protecting people on the planet and empowering employees and customers. I continue to be proud of the progress we are making on our 2030 goals and remain impressed at the speed in which we are advancing.\nOn climate change, we exceeded our 2030 acting on climate goal to reduce Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 30%, well ahead of schedule and we have set a new goal, which has been validated by SBTI to reach a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. Regarding innovation, 80% of our top innovation programs deliver sustainability value for customers. Within water, we've helped to enable seawater to be used as a source of potable drinking water with our reverse osmosis technology. We are also helping reduce carbon emissions through building materials innovation and protection.\nIn auto markets, we're making electric vehicle battery safer with our materials for thermal management. And within electronics, we directly enabled increased performance requirements in semiconductor manufacturing.\nIn our community, we engaged over 500 community projects with over 300 nonprofit partners across 30 countries focused on STEM education. From a DE&I standpoint, many aspects of our inclusive culture continue to be recognized. 2022 marked our second year on Forbes Magazine's world's top female-friendly companies list as one example. There are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability.\nOverall, our teams have done a tremendous job. With that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.",

My name is Rob, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the DuPont Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nChris Mecray, Vice President, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher H. Mecray\n\nVP of IR, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer.\nWe have prepared slides to supplement our remarks, which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and has been posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial review. We posted strong quarterly top and bottom line results, in line with our previously communicated guidance in an uneven global economy.\nFourth quarter revenue included a 5% organic growth versus the year-ago period. Strong volume in water and auto adhesives as well as ongoing strength in industrial end markets, such as health care and aerospace, helped mitigate volume declines in consumer electronics end markets and softening conditions in North American construction markets.\nStrong pricing growth in the quarter reflects actions taken largely prior to the fourth quarter to offset persistent inflationary pressures in raw materials, logistics and energy. We sold over $800 million in year-over-year inflation headwinds for full year 2022.\nWe delivered year-over-year operating EBITDA growth in the fourth quarter despite a slight volume decline, currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio divestitures. We also saw a margin improvement of 120 basis points, demonstrating solid operational execution, and focused on items we can control within the highly diverse end markets where we participate.\nThe closing of the M&M sale was a milestone event in the fourth quarter and our last contemplated large-scale divestiture. The transaction further transforms our portfolio to concentrate in more stable, secular, higher-growth and higher-margin end markets.\nAs you can see on Slide 4, our transformation actions have significantly strengthened our balance sheet, increased our financial flexibility and positioned the company to continue to generate shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation.\nFollowing the M&M sale, we acted quickly in accelerating return of capital to shareholders. We authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program in November and launched an accelerated share repurchase transaction worth $3.25 billion of common stock, allowing the retirement of about 39 million common shares in the fourth quarter. We anticipate completing this ASR in the third quarter of 2023 and plan to execute share repurchases under the planned remaining authorization as soon as we can.\nIn the quarter, we also retired $2.5 billion of long-term debt, which is due to mature in November 2023, and reduced our commercial paper balance to 0 as of year-end. The long-term debt retirement reduced refinancing risk and generated pretax annualized interest expense savings of approximately $100 million.\nWe also announced today an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share or a 9% increase versus last year. Going forward, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of between 35% and 45% and expect to increase our dividend annually alongside earnings growth.\nIn total, we deployed more than $7.5 billion of capital in 2022 through significant share repurchases, deleveraging and dividend payments, which reflects our overall balanced capital allocation strategy. We exited the year in a favorable balance sheet and liquidity position, and we look to further allocate excess capital over time to maximize value creation through both opportunistic M&A and incremental share repurchases.\nOur M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends that we have highlighted. Further, our disciplined approach to portfolio management will ensure that DuPont focuses on growing businesses where we are the best strategic owner.\nRegarding the Delrin sale process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest the business. We are being prudent with the deal process to ensure suitable market conditions and still expect to have a completed sale in 2023.\nFinally, we also continue to invest internally in innovation and incremental operating capacity to fuel and support our organic growth. In 2023, we expect to allocate CapEx at about 5% of sales as we wrap up some larger-scale projects this year, and we target R&D spending at about 4% of sales on a consolidated basis longer term, investing differentially within our business lines based on growth potential.\nTurning to Slide 5. Before I hand it over to Lori, I want to thank our teams who remain focused on operational execution in a difficult environment, which allowed us to produce solid revenue and earnings growth this past year. I also want to thank our teams for the continued efforts made during 2022 in transforming our portfolio.\nWe are excited about the longer-term growth potential of our business in its newly constituted form, centered around the secular high-growth pillars of electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive. Our end market mix is notably tilted towards electronics at about 1/3 of our portfolio.\nWithin electronics, we have a key presence in consumer-based end markets, namely chips, films, displays and printed circuit board materials used in smartphones, PCs and tablets. The bulk of our remaining electronics exposure is in areas such as data centers and telecommunications as well as industrial and automotive applications, primarily consumables used in the semiconductor chip manufacturing process.\nDespite short-term volume pressure, we are pleased with our electronics market position and confident this exposure will help generate strong growth over time. Our presence in electronics is enviable with higher margins versus the company average and a solid competitive position across the key products we supply.\nLikewise, our water business at 12% of our portfolio operates in markets that are expected to grow mid- to high-single digits, driven by the global response to concerns such as water scarcity and circularity.\nAdditionally, our participation in the auto market at about 13% of sales is much more connected to high-growth advanced technologies, enabling long-term secular trends like hybrid and electric vehicles for items such as battery applications. A solid portion of our other exposure is aligned to EVs, which are growing at a significant pace.\nGiven these and our equally strong market positions in many other end markets, including within our protection and industrial technologies pillars, we believe that our financial results over time will bear out the view that the new DuPont will grow and generate returns on par with the best industrial assets in the public markets.\nIn response to nearer-term, short-cycle end market slowing expected in the first half of 2023, we have been doing scenario planning for some time now and are proactively taking actions within our control to minimize volume impacts on margins. As a result, we expect to be able to show the resiliency of the new DuPont portfolio this year. I look forward to providing you with updates as we progress through 2023.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Lori to review our financial performance and outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. The quality of our portfolio was highlighted this quarter as strong top line results across the majority of our business lines offset weaker conditions in consumer electronics and construction. The global economy remains challenging, but our team's focus on execution drove solid fourth quarter earnings growth and operating EBITDA margin expansion against the prior year period.\nTurning to our financial highlights on Slide 6. Fourth quarter net sales of $3.1 billion decreased 4% as reported and increased 5% on an organic basis versus the year-ago period. Global currency volatility resulted in a 5% headwind from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, most notably the yen, yuan and euro. We also saw a 4% portfolio headwind driven by the impact of noncore divestitures.\nBreaking down the 5% organic sales growth, 7% pricing gains were partially offset by 2% volume declines. Continued strength in Water Solutions and over 20% volume gains in auto adhesives were more than offset by further softening in smartphones and personal computing within Interconnect Solutions, a slowdown in semiconductor and construction markets as well as continued lower year-over-year volume from Tyvek protective garments within Safety Solutions.\nAs we exited the year, we saw lower volumes in areas we have highlighted with total December organic sales up 2% year-over-year, including down high single digits in China, driven by acceleration of COVID disruptions, and low single-digit organic sales growth in the U.S. and Canada due to muted demand in construction and destocking by customers.\nFrom an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $758 million increased 1% versus the year-ago period despite currency headwinds and the impact of portfolio. Organic earnings growth was driven by pricing and disciplined cost control, which more than offset inflationary cost pressure and lower volumes, including the impact of production rates.\nOperating EBITDA margin during the quarter of 24.4% increased 120 basis points versus the year-ago period. Adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16%, which I'll detail shortly. Cash used in operations during the quarter of $126 million, less capital expenditures of $185 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $213 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $98 million.\nThe transaction-related adjustments consist of $163 million termination fee related to the intended Rogers acquisition, with the remainder from a tax prepayment for the M&M divestiture. Further headwinds to free cash flow during the quarter included transaction costs related to closing the M&M deal of about $200 million and an approximately $100 million cash outflow related to prepaid accounts payable in advance of the M&M deal closing, which was subsequently reimbursed to us at closing and reported as an inflow within investing activities.\nI call out these items to provide visibility into our underlying cash flow performance. Additionally, free cash flow included a working capital benefit during the quarter of about $120 million related to inventory reductions, resulting both from our productivity efforts and from our decision to slow production in certain lines of business given the lower volume environment.\nTurning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS for the quarter of $0.89 per share increased 16% compared to $0.77 per share in the year-ago period. The strong EPS growth came primarily from below-the-line items as organic earnings from our ongoing businesses were mostly offset by the absence of earnings from noncore divestitures as well as currency headwinds. Ongoing share repurchase continues to drive earnings per share growth, providing a [$0.07] benefit to adjusted EPS.\nLower net interest expense provided a $0.05 benefit to adjusted EPS, driven by both interest income resulting from additional cash on hand from the M&M divestiture and also lower interest expense resulting from the paydown of $2.5 billion of senior notes during the quarter.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, up notably from 18.6% in the year-ago period, resulting in a $0.06 tax headwind to adjusted EPS, driven primarily by geographic mix of earnings and currency. Our full year base tax rate for 2022 was 23.2%, and our 2023 outlook assumes a base tax rate in the range of 23% to 24%.\nTurning to Slide 8. Just to note a few metrics on a full year basis, net sales of $13 billion in 2022 increased 4% for the full year. On an organic basis, full year sales increased 8% due to a 7% increase in price and a 1% increase in volume. W&P and E&I delivered organic sales growth of 11% and 5%, respectively, and net sales in all 4 regions increased organically.\nFurther, we delivered high single digits or better organic sales growth in 5 of our 6 lines of business as well as in the retained businesses within corporate, led by auto adhesives. Interconnect Solutions was the only business line down organically due to the slowdown in smartphones and personal computing since last summer.\nFull year operating EBITDA of $3.26 billion increased 3% due primarily to volume gains as pricing gains were mostly offset by continued pressure associated with higher raw material, logistics and energy costs. Operating EBITDA margin was flat at 25.1%, inclusive of price/cost headwind of about 150 basis points.\nFull year adjusted EPS of $3.41 per share increased 12% versus 2021. The increase was driven by a lower share count from share repurchases, higher segment earnings and lower net interest expense, which was partially offset by a higher tax rate.\nCash flow from operations for the year of $588 million, less capital expenditures of $743 million and transaction-related adjustments totaling $328 million for items that I mentioned earlier resulted in free cash flow for the year of $173 million. Full year [discrete] headwinds included in free cash flow totaled about $650 million, which mainly reflect transaction costs.\nTurning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 9. E&I fourth quarter net sales decreased 8% as organic sales declined 2%, along with currency and portfolio headwinds of 5% and 1%, respectively. The organic sales decline reflects a 5% decrease in volume, partially offset by a 3% increase in average price.\nThe organic sales decrease for E&I was led by a 10% decline in Interconnect Solutions, driven by volume linked to further weakening in smartphone, PC and tablet demand, along with channel inventory destocking and the negative impact of COVID-related disruptions in China.\nIn Semiconductor Technologies, lower volumes resulted from reduced semi fab utilization rates due to weaker end-market demand along with channel inventory destocking. End-market weakness was seen mainly in smartphones and personal computing.\nIn Industrial Solutions, volumes were muted as lower demand in consumer printing and weakness in LED silicones for conventional lighting in China more than offset ongoing strength in broad-based industrial end markets, including Vespel product lines, and aerospace and for applications in health care markets.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $407 million decreased 4% in the quarter as volume declines were partially offset by disciplined cost control with operating EBITDA margin up 150 basis points from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, E&I net sales of $5.9 billion increased 7% versus 2021, up 5% on an organic basis as the portfolio benefit from last year's Laird acquisition was partially offset by currency headwinds. Organic sales growth for the year of 5% consisted of a 3% increase in volume and a 2% increase in price.\nFrom a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semi Tech, up low double digits; and Industrial Solutions, up high single digits, partially offset by mid-single-digit declines in Interconnect Solutions related to weakness in smartphones and personal computing end markets during the second half of 2022.\nFull year operating EBITDA of $1.8 billion increased 4% as volume gains a full year of earnings associated with the Laird acquisition and higher pricing more than offset inflationary cost pressure and weaker mix in Interconnect.\nTurning to Slide 10. W&P fourth quarter net sales increased 6% as organic sales growth of 12% was partially offset by a 6% currency headwind. Organic growth reflects broad-based pricing actions taken across the segment to offset cost inflation as WP volumes were flat.\nOrganic sales growth was led by Water Solutions, which increased over 20% on strong global demand for water technologies, led by Reverse Osmosis membrane as well as capacity increases and pricing gains. Water continues to be an area of consistent strength with long-term top line growth expectations in the mid- to high-single digits.\nSales for Safety Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were somewhat offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the demand shift from garments to other applications and the resulting impact of line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwind, total W&P volumes increased approximately 2% in the quarter.\nIn Shelter Solutions, sales were up high single digits on an organic basis as pricing gains were partially offset by volume declines, primarily in North America construction market.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P of $360 million increased 11% as pricing actions and disciplined cost control more than offset inflationary cost pressure and currency headwinds with operating EBITDA margin up 100 basis points from the year-ago period.\nFor the full year, W&P net sales of $6 billion increased 7% versus 2021 as organic growth of 11% is partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Organic sales growth for the year consisted of a 12% increase in price, slightly offset by a 1% volume decline. Excluding the year-over-year garment headwind, total W&P volumes increased 2% for the year.\nFrom a line of business view, organic sales growth was driven by mid-teens growth in Shelter Solutions, low-teens growth in Water Solutions and high-single-digit growth in Safety Solutions. Full year operating EBITDA of $1.4 billion increased 3% as higher pricing and disciplined cost more than offset inflationary cost pressure as well as currency headwinds.\nI'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for 2023 on Slide 11. We expect solid top line growth trends to continue into 2023 in businesses such as water and auto adhesives, as well as stable demand across diversified industrial end markets, including aerospace and health care.\nWe do, however, anticipate lower volumes during the first half of 2023 in consumer electronics and semiconductors, resulting from decreased consumer spending, inventory destocking and COVID-related impacts in China, largely within E&I. We also expect ongoing softness in construction end markets within W&P during 2023.\nFor the first quarter of 2023, we anticipate continued weakness in these consumer-driven, short-cycle end markets, resulting in a first quarter net sales expectation of about $2.9 billion or down mid-single digits on an organic basis versus the year-ago period. As 2023 progresses, we assume stabilization of consumer electronics demand, normalization of customer inventory levels and improved China demand to drive sequential quarterly improvement in operating results, most notably in the second half of the year.\nWithin the Interconnect Solutions business, where the printed circuit board market has been down since mid-2022, we anticipate that channel destocking and customer production rates will begin to improve during the second quarter. Within Semiconductor Technologies, fab utilization rates are also expected to bottom during the first half of this year and improve around midyear. As a result of these assumptions, coupled with expectation of improvement in China across our product lines, we expect full year 2023 net sales to be between $12.3 billion and $12.9 billion.\nIn response to the expected lower-volume environment, we are focused on minimizing decremental margin impacts. To achieve this, we are focused on the operational levers within our control, including appropriate actions to increase productivity at our plant sites, reduce discretionary spending and realization of savings enabled by cost actions initiated during the fourth quarter.\nFor first quarter 2023, we expect operating EBITDA of about $710 million. For full year 2023, we expect operating EBITDA to be between $3 billion and $3.3 billion, expecting to hold full year operating EBITDA margin flat at the midpoint of the ranges provided compared to last year. These same midpoints imply a decremental margin of 27% for the full year despite a mix headwind resulting from volume pressure in our higher-margin business, mainly semi.\nOur first quarter adjusted EPS expectation of about $0.80 per share and full year adjusted EPS guidance range of between $3.50 and $4 per share assumes continued growth from below-the-line benefits related to a lower share count and lower interest expense. The midpoint of our full year adjusted EPS guidance implies growth of 10% versus last year, driven by these benefits from our ongoing capital allocation strategy.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.",

Please note, today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nChris Mecray, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\n\nChristopher H. Mecray\n\nVP of IR, Axalta Coating Systems Ltd.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We have prepared slides to supplement our remarks which are posted on DuPont's website under the Investor Relations tab through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\nDuring this call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance or results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2021 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties which may cause such differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and also posted to DuPont's Investor Relations website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our third quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results, above our previously communicated guidance, in an extremely challenging environment due to uneven macro conditions and persistent inflation globally.\nOur revenue growth of 4% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 11%. Customer demand remains strong across most of our key end markets, during the period, highlighted by double-digit volume increases in select areas, including Kalrez, Vespel, Laird, Semi, Water and Auto Adhesives.\nTo combat persistent inflationary headwinds in raw materials, logistics and energy, we continue to implement necessary pricing actions, which have fully offset such headwinds to date.\nGiven continued energy cost inflation, we now expect full year 2022 inflation of about $800 million year-over-year, which we anticipate will be fully offset by pricing actions.\nOur third quarter results also demonstrated year-over-year operating EBITDA growth and margin improvement, reflecting DuPont's unique business mix, innovative solutions and highly diverse end markets as well as strong operational execution during the period. We are pleased to have reported strong performance during each of the first 3 quarters of 2022, and we remain firmly committed to continued strong execution in the coming periods.\nTurning to Slide 4, I will comment on the details of our transformation progress. First, last week's announcement that we completed the sale of the majority of our M&M segment to Celanese marks the completion of our last contemplated large-scale divestiture for which we received $11 billion in gross cash. The M&M business is an excellent set of assets that we know will prosper, and we are confident that Celanese is the right owner going forward.\nWe are excited by the prospect of proving to the market that our multiyear transformation has brought DuPont to a truly different place. After the Dow merger, followed by the spins that created the new DuPont, we have further transformed our business with large-scale deals, including the N&B split-off and now the M&M transaction. We further sold 8 smaller businesses over the last 3 years, with proceeds totaling over $2 billion.\nWe are starting the next phase of our growth from a position of strength, leveraging highly profitable businesses with strong and leading market position centered in growing markets as well as a healthy balance sheet. These assets include some of the best intellectual property in their respective industry verticals with globally recognized brands familiar to us all as well as the thousands of long-time B2B industrial customers.\nFor DuPont, we are confident that our remaining mix of businesses offers a different dynamic with significantly lower volatility and higher expected long-term growth given our revenue mix. This is driven by a focus on secular tailwinds, including the 5G build-out and other electronics drivers, the global clean water infrastructure development, continued demand for safety and personal protection solutions, secular growth across multiple industrial technology verticals that we serve and from next-generation automotive growth. We believe we have built a portfolio that can perform alongside the best diversified industrial companies. Our businesses are aligned with secular growth trends, we deliver top-tier levels of profitability and we should clearly benefit from dampened business volatility compared to our portfolio from just a few years ago. These advantages are clear and will help us to generate superior shareholder value over time.\nRegarding the Delrin divestiture process, we continue to advance our internal work required to divest that business. We are being diligent with our overall marketing process to ensure we maximize value in proper market conditions and expect to have completed a sale in 2023.\nBefore I move on, I'd like to briefly address the intended Rogers acquisition. We terminated this deal on November 1, which was the outside date of the transaction agreement originally signed a year ago. This was an unfortunate outcome in that the potential strategic fit of Rogers with our business was strong and we saw a lot of opportunity, but we're unable to secure regulatory approval for the transaction. We wish the Rogers team well.\nFor DuPont, the inability to close the acquisition has no material impact on our ongoing business outside of the obvious loss of opportunity. We remain confident in the quality of our portfolio and its growth potential, and we'll look to be opportunistic with select and targeted M&A moving forward.\nShifting to capital allocation on Slide 5. With the receipt of the proceeds from the M&M sale, we are now able to accelerate our capital return options and further strengthen our balance sheet, while maintaining flexibility to continue to grow the business through disciplined and targeted M&A.\nToday, we announced that our Board has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program which expires June 30, 2024. We intend to act immediately and enter an accelerated share repurchase agreement for $3.25 billion of common stock which includes the remaining $250 million under the previous authorization. We anticipate completing this ASR within about 9 months, with 80% of the shares retired upfront during the fourth quarter. We currently expect to complete the full $5 billion of repurchases within the authorization period.\nIn addition, we will retire $2.5 billion of our senior notes due 2023 in the fourth quarter. The prepayment reduces refinancing risk in a rising rate environment, while generating pretax annualized savings of over $100 million. Further, we plan to reduce our commercial paper balance to 0 by year-end, of which we had $1.3 billion outstanding at the end of the third quarter.\nIn combination, the significant share repurchase authorization and our deleveraging plan demonstrates our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our approach remains balanced and in line with our overall capital allocation strategy. We expect to finish the year with a leverage ratio significantly below our longer-term target, maintaining balance sheet capacity to further allocate excess capital through a combination of bolt-on M&A and potential share repurchases over time. Our M&A focus remains on targets that fit within our growth pillars and are aligned with key secular growth trends.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss third quarter details as well as our financial outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning. As mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in most of our end markets, with organic growth better than our expectations coming into the quarter. The global economy remains challenged in some respects, but our team's focus on disciplined pricing and operational execution contributed to operating EBITDA margin expansion on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to our financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 4% as reported and increased 11% on an organic basis versus the prior year quarter. Global currencies remained highly dynamic as we saw a 4% headwind resulting from U.S. dollar strength against key currencies, including the euro, yen and yuan. The 3% portfolio headwind reflects the impact of noncore divestitures.\nBreaking down organic sales growth, we saw 8% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand, most notably in semiconductor, water and general industrial, reduced somewhat by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions and ongoing softness in smartphone and personal computing markets globally within Interconnect Solutions.\nOn a segment basis, third quarter organic growth was 15% for W&T, 7% for E&I, and I'll highlight 25% organic growth for the retained businesses that we report in Corporate (inaudible) representing the adhesive portfolio from the former M&M segment.\nOn a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all 4 regions, led by volume increases in North America and Asia Pacific.\nFrom an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $856 million increased 5% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share increased 4%. These increases were driven primarily by volume gains as pricing actions were offset by higher inflationary cost pressure. Adjusted EPS in the quarter included a higher-than-expected tax rate, which I'll detail shortly.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 25.8% increased 30 basis points year-over-year on stronger volumes and productivity. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter, adjusted to exclude price cost, was over 27%. Finally, incremental margin was 33% on a as-reported basis.\nCash flow from operations during the quarter of $419 million, adjusted for capital expenditures of $172 million and the $115 million tax prepayment related to the M&M divestiture resulted in free cash flow of $362 million. We continue to experience significant headwinds from transaction costs related to the M&M separation as well as working capital headwinds primarily from the divested M&M business.\nFree cash flow conversion in the quarter for the total company was 73%. For the ongoing portfolio, if M&M was excluded, free cash conversion in the quarter would have been in line with our target of greater than 90%.\nTurning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 increased 4% compared to $0.79 in the year ago period. Stronger segment results versus the prior year contributed 8% to adjusted EPS growth or $0.06 driven primarily by volume growth. Benefits from ongoing share repurchases continue to drive earnings growth, providing a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS.\nThe absence of earnings related to noncore business divestitures and the impact of currency headwinds negatively impacted third quarter results, and we expect both to be more significant headwinds to year-over-year earnings in the fourth quarter.\nOur tax rate for the quarter was 26.2%, up notably from 23.5% in the prior year, resulting in a year-over-year headwind to adjusted EPS of $0.03 and a $0.05 headwind in the quarter compared to the midpoint of our previous modeling guidance. Our full year base tax rate is now expected to be about 24%, with the increase driven by currency and mix and geographic earnings.\nTurning to segment results, beginning with E&I on slide. E&I delivered third quarter net sales growth of 3% and organic growth of 7%, including a 4% increase in volume and a 3% increase in price, partially offset by a 4% currency headwind. Sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens organically as strong demand continued led by the ongoing transition to more advanced new technologies and high semiconductor fab utilization along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.\nIndustrial Solutions posted another strong quarter with organic sales growth of high single digits led by ongoing strength from Kalrez semiconductor-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets, OLED materials for new electronic displays related model launches and for health care applications such as biopharma tubing. Interconnect Solutions sales decreased mid-single digits on an organic basis due to volume decline.\nComing into the quarter, we expected a return to positive organic growth within Interconnect, but continued softness in consumer electronics specifically smartphones and lower PC and tablet demand globally, more than offset strong demand for Kapton film product applications in industrial end markets such as rail and defense and strength in Laird product offerings, including electromagnetic shielding and thermal management. Given this demand softening, we now expect Interconnect Solutions organic sales for the full year to be down mid-single digits.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $473 million was relatively flat as volume gains in semi and Industrial Solutions were offset by lower volumes and weaker product mix in Interconnect Solutions, along with lower JV earnings.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 31.3% was down 110 basis points from the prior year due primarily to the impact of price cost.\nTurning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 10% as organic sales growth of 15% was partially offset by a 5% currency headwind. Organic growth for W&P reflected a 13% increase in price and a 2% increase in volume. Organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens driven by pricing actions and further aided by volume growth on continued demand in North America commercial construction.\nSales for Water Solutions were up an impressive mid-teens organic growth rate on strong global demand for reverse osmosis and on-exchange resin technologies as well as pricing gains.\nSales for Safety Solutions were up low double digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were slightly offset by lower Tyvek volumes given the shift from garments to other Tyvek applications and the resulting impact of manufacturing line changeovers on production efficiency. Excluding the year-over-year Tyvek garment headwind, total W&P volumes would have been up approximately 5%.\nI will also acknowledge the dedicated work of our teams for safely and promptly restoring operations at our Spruance plant earlier in the third quarter from an unforeseen utility disruption with minimal impact on the quarter's results.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P of $382 million increased 8% versus last year as pricing actions and volume gains more than offset higher product costs driven by inflationary pressure, weaker product mix and currency headwinds.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 24.9% included a 170-basis point headwind related to price cost. Excluding this price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin would have been 26.6% during the quarter.\nI'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook and guidance for the full year 2022 on Slide 10. We expect solid demand trends to continue in the fourth quarter in many of our key end markets such as Water, Industrial and Auto Adhesives, to name a few. That said, we anticipate continued softness within Interconnect Solutions related to smartphones and personal computing globally and expect some slowing in customer fab production rates in our semi business. Additionally, we expect some impact from reducing our production to drive down inventories on a consolidated basis. Lastly, we expect further currency headwinds to negatively impact both top and bottom-line results.\nBased on these assumptions, we are adjusting the midpoint of our full year 2022 net sales guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect net sales to be about $13 billion. Compared to our previous midpoint, this change reflects about $150 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, with the majority of those headwinds impacting the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year, we now expect foreign currency to be approximately a 4% headwind to reported net sales. Our organic net sales growth expectation of high single digits for the full year remains unchanged.\nDue to the same factors just noted, we are adjusting the midpoint of our operating EBITDA guidance to the low end of our previous range and now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be about $3.25 billion.\nWe now expect full year adjusted EPS to be about $3.30 per share, within our previous range. The higher-than-anticipated base tax rate for the full year that I discussed earlier, which equates to a $0.09 headwind versus our previous guide, is expected to be offset by a lower share count and net interest benefits resulting from a higher cash balance and the capital deployment actions we are taking in the fourth quarter.\nIn closing, our team remains focused on operational execution and expect to use the levers within our control to meet our financial goals and continue to drive value for our shareholders.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nChris Mecray, you may begin your conference.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for review of DuPont's Second Quarter 2022 Financial Results.

Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter financial review. We posted strong quarterly results above expectations in a difficult environment. Our top line revenue growth of 7% versus the year ago period included solid organic growth of 9%.\nOverall, customer demand remained strong across our key end markets as E&I delivered a 6% volume increase, driven by ongoing strength in Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions.\nIn terms of inflation, our pricing actions continue to fully offset higher costs associated with raw materials, logistics and energy. Early in the quarter, our expectation for full year 2022 was about $600 million of increased costs, and that number has now risen to over $700 million, mainly due to higher energy and logistics costs. We still expect to remain price/cost-neutral in the second half and for the full year based on pricing actions we have taken.\nOverall, our second quarter results reflect year-over-year and sequential earnings growth. These results highlight the strength of our end markets and our team's efforts to successfully navigate a challenging macro environment, which was further complicated by China's COVID lockdowns during the quarter. We were very pleased with the lockdowns alleviated by mid-June and that our China-based colleagues who operated diligently under difficult circumstances have been able to return to some form of normalcy. More broadly, our focus on execution continues to drive results as we increase our use of digital tools and other plant site investments to drive additional productivity and capacity release.\nFinally, with regards to sustainability, I am pleased to highlight that last month, we announced our commitment to setting targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the Paris Accord Science-Based Targets initiative, or SBTi. This is an important step toward reducing our overall climate impact, and it builds on our existing commitment to protect the planet by reducing the carbon footprint across our value chain in partnership with customers and suppliers.\nTurning to Slide 4. I'd like to update you on key initiatives for 2022 stakeholder value creation, namely our portfolio transformation and our balanced approach to capital allocation. In addition, I will highlight our continued focus on growth execution on the following slide.\nFirst, as it relates to the Rogers acquisition, the progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews, with China being the last jurisdiction outstanding. We expect the deal to close during the third quarter. Regarding Rogers' first quarter 2022 performance, we were satisfied with top line progress for the business, with growth in the high single digits, and we're especially pleased to see new wins and ongoing growth in the electric vehicle space. Rogers' business in the period was impacted by a price/cost gap and several operational challenges that held back full earnings potential, but we remain confident in the actions that the Rogers team is taking, and we expect improvement as we move forward.\nFor the M&M transactions, we are on track regarding timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese, with a completion anticipated around year-end. We continue to make the necessary progress to separate the business, and we were pleased to see Celanese secure permanent financing in the last few weeks. We also continue to move forward with plans to divest the Delrin business and affirm our expectation for completion around midyear 2023.\nThis past July 1 marked the 1-year anniversary of our acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. I've commented previously on how successful this acquisition has been for us, including overall financial performance ahead of plan on both the top and bottom lines. We also continue to advance commercial synergy opportunities on top of cost synergies previously noted.\nFinally, we completed the sale of the Biomaterials business at the end of May, which was the last of our previously announced noncore business divestitures. Since 2019, we generated gross proceeds of over $2.2 billion by divesting 8 noncore businesses, which collectively produced lower growth, lower margins and overall higher volatility in earnings. We received solid value for these divestitures, selling them at a low double-digit EBITDA multiple.\nShifting to capital allocation. We continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as bolt-on M&A. During the second quarter, we repurchased $500 million of shares, bringing our year-to-date total to $875 million, which represents 2.5% of total shares outstanding. We anticipate completing the $500 million of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program during the remainder of this year.\nAs I noted during our last earnings call, given the magnitude of anticipated proceeds from the M&M divestitures, we expect there will be room to execute substantial, incremental share buybacks while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority over time as we continue to seek accretive and opportunistic transactions that can leverage our existing growth even further.\nFinally, our balance sheet remains strong. And this remains a key priority, particularly in uncertain, volatile macro environment.\nTurning to Slide 5. Another key value driver for us is innovation-led growth. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, protection, industrial technologies and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our organic growth execution. We continue to invest actively in both advancing the technology within our existing product portfolio and also introducing new products around the pillars highlighted here, with an overall R&D investment rate of around 4% of total sales, in line with best-in-class peers. This investment is coupled with substantial application engineering focus where our technical personnel have a seat at our customers' table in the design phases of their products.\nThis past quarter, we had a number of highlights, which we note on the slide, but I'd emphasize that we are proud to have won 4 Edison Awards across different technology platforms, and we continue to make progress in introducing new technologies, such as applications and EV batteries, which have strong growth potential.\nWith that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets, with volumes higher than our expectations coming into the quarter. Cost inflation intensified further compared to previous estimates, but additional pricing actions are anticipated to fully offset these higher costs. These factors, along with our team's continued strong execution focus, contributed to both top and bottom line results well above expectations for the quarter. We also delivered a consistent operating EBITDA margin on both a year-over-year and sequential basis.\nFocusing on financial highlights for the quarter on Slide 6. Net sales of $3.3 billion increased 7% as reported versus the second quarter of 2021 and increased 9% on an organic basis. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by noncore divestitures, provided a 1% net tailwind in net sales, while currency was a 3% headwind during the quarter as the U.S. dollar strengthened against key currencies, including the euro and the yen.\nOrganic sales growth included 8% pricing gains and 1% higher volume. Volume growth reflects continued strong demand in key end markets, namely semiconductor, general industrial, water and construction, muted primarily by lower volumes for protective garments within Safety Solutions. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter, up 9% for W&P, 8% for E&I and 15% for the retained businesses of the former M&M segment they report in corporate, which predominantly reflects our adhesive portfolio tied to next-generation auto.\nOn a regional basis, we delivered organic sales growth in all 4 regions globally, including volume increases in Asia Pacific, North America and Latin America. In China, organic sales growth was up slightly versus the year ago period, and volumes in China were up low single digits sequentially from first quarter despite government-mandated lockdowns in parts of the country into early June.\nFrom an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $829 million was up 6% versus the year ago period, and adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, stronger earnings contribution from the Laird acquisition and volume gains, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 25% was slightly better than our expectations set earlier this quarter and flat on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Our pricing actions have fully offset cost inflation on a dollar basis but have impacted EBITDA margins.\nOur operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price/cost with 26.6% or 150 basis points higher than the year ago, driven by productivity and higher volume. Our incremental margin was 22% on an as-reported basis. Excluding the impact of price/cost, incremental margin for our core businesses was almost 60%, demonstrating strong cost discipline and operational productivity.\nFrom a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $86 million and capital expenditures of $135 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $49 million. Working capital was an additional headwind during the quarter as we continue to secure inventory given tight supply chains and incur higher inventory costs related to inflation. We expect improvement in free cash flow during the second half of the year, consistent with our typical pattern and factoring in a reduction of working capital level. As we separate the M&M business, we continue to encourage transaction-related expenses, with over $100 million of transaction costs incurred during the second quarter and about $700 million in costs related to the M&M separations expected in full year 2022. These costs, combined with higher working capital related to the M&M business that we are divesting, are significant headwinds to our 2022 cash flow.\nTurning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $0.88 per share increased 11% compared to $0.79 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and earnings from Laird provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains were partially offset by weaker mix in W&P related to lower garment production and Kapton's plant start-up costs totaling $0.03 per share. A lower share count from ongoing share repurchases provided a $0.04 benefit to adjusted EPS, while other below-the-line items, including a higher tax rate and exchange gains, netted to a $0.03 headwind.\nOur base tax rate for the quarter was 22.6%, up slightly from 21.8% in the first quarter and up notably from the year ago period given certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the prior year, resulting from tax law changes. We are maintaining an expected base tax rate range for the full year 2022 of 21% to 23%.\nTurning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 8. E&I delivered net sales growth of 16%, including 8% organic growth, an 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 3% headwind from currency.\nOrganic growth for E&I included a 6% increase in volume and a 2% increase in pricing. The line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Semiconductor Technologies, which increased mid-teens as strong demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies and ongoing high semiconductor fab utilization, along with growth in 5G communications and data centers.\nWithin Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up high single digits, led by continued demand for OLED materials for displays, ongoing strength for Kalrez semi CapEx-related product offerings, Vespel products serving recovering aerospace markets and for health care applications such biopharma tubing.\nInterconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis as expected due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by lower smartphone volumes due to the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order pattern compared to last year and the including softness in China smartphones. The business was also impacted somewhat by lower global PC and tablet demand and continued constraints in automotive production.\nLooking forward, we expect similar growth patterns for Semiconductor Technologies and Industrial Solutions to continue into the second half of 2022. Within interconnect, we expect to return to positive organic growth in the second half given seasonal strength and added capacity from our Kapton expansion.\nFor the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up low to mid-single digits on an organic basis. This reflects a slight decline from our previous expectations as supply chain constraints and softer consumer demand are expected to mute volumes for smartphones, PCs and tablets.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $480 million increased 13% as strong earnings from Laird, volume gains and pricing actions were partially offset by higher raw material and logistics costs.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 31.4% reflects sequential improvement of 40 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points due primarily to a 100-basis-point headwind from price/cost.\nTurning to Slide 9. W&P delivered net sales growth of 6% as organic sales growth of 9% was partially offset by a 3% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects a 12% increase in price and a 3% volume headwind. Pricing gains reflect broad-based actions across the segment, most notably in Shelter and Safety Solutions. Volume declines were driven by Safety Solutions.\nFrom a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which increased high teens, driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North America residential construction as well as ongoing growth in commercial construction and strength in repair- and remodel-related demand during the quarter.\nWithin Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower Tyvek volumes, given the shift from garments to other end market applications and the resulting negative impact of increased manufacturing line changeovers on overall production.\nSales for Water Solutions were up mid-single digits on an organic basis on pricing gains and continued steady demand for water filtration technologies, muted by supply chain constraints in Asia Pacific due to COVID lockdowns in China and an earthquake in Japan impacting our production.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P of $348 million declined 1% versus last year as pricing actions taken to offset higher costs are more than offset by volume declines.\nOperating EBITDA margin of 23.2% was 170 basis points below the year ago period as the impact of price/cost was an approximate 200-basis-point headwind to margins. Excluding the price/cost impact, operating EBITDA margin was over 25%.\nI'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 10. We are still seeing solid demand, and our order book is sound in most of our end markets. However, future uncertainties continue to exist in the macro environment driven by inflationary pressure, challenging supply chain and U.S. dollar strength. Our teams remain focused keenly on execution, and we are concentrated on a leverage within our control in order to continue to drive value for our shareholders.\nFor the full year 2022, we are narrowing our adjusted EPS range while maintaining the midpoint of our previous range. We now expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $3.27 to $3.43 per share versus our previous range of $3.20 to $3.50 per share.\nWe are updating our full year '22 net sales guidance range to be between $13 billion and $13.4 billion reflecting a $200 million of incremental foreign currency headwinds, along with the removal of about $120 million in net sales related to the Biomaterials business, given its divestiture at the end of May. We continue to expect organic sales growth for the year to be up high single digits.\nAfter adjusting the high end of our operating EBITDA guidance primarily for incremental currency headwinds and the removal of the Biomaterials business, we now expect full year 2022 operating EBITDA to be between $3.25 billion and $3.35 billion.\nFor third quarter 2022, we expect net sales to be between $3.17 billion and $3.37 billion and operating EBITDA to be about $810 million. We expect third quarter net sales and operating EBITDA to be slightly weaker than the second quarter as sequential volume increases are expected to be offset by further foreign currency headwinds and the absence of the Biomaterials business. We are also expecting impact during the third quarter on operating EBITDA of approximately $15 million from unplanned downtime at our W&P screw-in site in Virginia associated with an unforeseen utility disruption from a third-party supplier.\nOn a year-over-year basis, we expect third quarter net sales to be up 2% at the midpoint and up high single digits on an organic basis. We expect third quarter 2022 adjusted EPS of approximately $0.81 per share.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions, and let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.",

(Operator Instructions) Thank you.\nChris Mecray, you may begin your conference.\n\nChris Mecray\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for a review of DuPont's first quarter 2022 financial results. Joining me today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. We prepared slides to supplement our comments during this review, which are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the webcast link. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\nDuring this financial review, we'll make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risks and uncertainties, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2021 Form 10-K as updated by current and periodic reports includes a detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause differences.\nUnless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We'll also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining our first quarter financial review. We posted strong results this quarter. But before we discuss that, I would like to thank each of our employees for their continued dedication and strong commitment to our customers. Their perseverance in the face of many obstacles is what made our results possible.\nI'd especially like to express our appreciation for our China-based colleagues, many of whom have endured weeks of lockdowns, but have continued to operate and get necessary work on. Also, our hearts go out to those affected by the war in Ukraine, and we sincerely hope this conflict can be ended as soon as possible.\nOur first quarter results from continuing operations included a strong 9% organic sales increase from the prior year or 14% growth, including the layered acquisition contribution. Organic volume increased 3%, led by an 8% increase in the E&I segment. Overall customer demand remains strong across the vast majority of end markets, led by low double-digit volume growth in both semiconductor and industrial technologies with the E&I segment and mid-single-digit volume growth in water and shelter solutions within the water and protection business.\nOur top line growth included 6% average pricing increases that we took to offset the continued cost inflation that we are experiencing. We realized price increases in all businesses totaling about $190 million and a fully offset raw material, logistics and energy cost deflation. I continue to be impressed by the job our teams are doing as we remain -- target to remain price cost neutral for the full year 2022, including the incremental actions taken in March, largely in reaction to the conflict-driven spike in energy and related costs during the period.\nTurning to Slide 4, I'd like to update you on key focus areas for 2022 stakeholder value creation, including our portfolio transformation, our balanced approach to capital allocation and our continued focus on growth execution. First, we believe we are on track with what we noted previously regarding the timing associated with the M&M divestiture to Celanese. The M&M transaction is anticipated to be complete around the end of the year, and we are also continuing with the process to divest the Delrin business.\nFor the Rogers acquisition, progress is being made on the required regulatory reviews while we remain optimistic by closing by the end of the second quarter. The process could extend into early third quarter. We continue to see no issue that would prevent a close of this transaction.\nI'd like to reiterate that DuPont's financial profile -- pro forma for these transactions will firmly position the company with top quartile revenue growth, operating EBITDA margins and low cyclicality relative to top tier multi-industrial companies. Greater focus on secular high-growth end markets in electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation automotive will serve as a sound basis for our innovation-led organic growth execution.\nRegarding the Laird Performance Materials acquisition, we are also on track to achieve cost synergies of $63 million, somewhat ahead of initial expectations. The deal has been a success so far, including overall financial performance ahead of plan for both top and bottom line results and early progress to achieve commercial synergies on top of the cost synergies noted. As one example, we are starting to see some nice synergies with Laird process and equipment technology, enabling more effective solutions for downstream customers, including auto OEMs as well as consumer electronics applications.\nRegarding future capital allocation and namely the net cash we will receive from our planned divestitures, we will continue to pursue a balanced strategy that includes prioritizing the return of excess capital to shareholders as well as strategic M&A. This is consistent with our actions taken over the last year during which we increased our share repurchase and dividend allocation as well as completed the Laird acquisition.\nOnce the Rogers and M&M transactions are completed, we will be poised to continue to improve our portfolio and financial position as well as accelerate capital return options. Given the magnitude of the anticipated deal proceeds, we expect that there will be room to execute substantial incremental share buybacks while disciplined M&A will also remain a key deployment priority.\nRegarding our existing $1 billion share repurchase program authorized during Q1, we anticipate completing that authorization during 2022, ahead of the 1-year duration initially guided.\nTurning to core growth, we continue to focus on execution of our innovation-based organic growth opportunities. We are pleased with 3% volume growth in the quarter given production constraints due to lack of raw material availability and supply chain challenges. We are excited about visible growth drivers enabled by our technical innovation teams and application engineers who are squarely focused on helping customers solve their most complex challenges.\nIn E&I, continued top line growth momentum this year is being driven by growth in semiconductor, health care and displays end markets by cyclical recovery in aerospace markets and by new share gains and innovation wins muted somewhat in auto by supply chain constraints. Key examples of recent new product successes driving growth and strong margin performance include newly launched mechanical planarization pads for semiconductor manufacturing as well as new lithographic photoresist for the high-performance computing market.\nIn W&P, we expect growth in 2022 coming from each of the lines of business. Safety has seen market growth across major segments including aerospace, electrical infrastructure, oil and gas and health care, but muted by lower demand for protective garments.\nShelter continues to experience growth opportunities from strong construction and remodeling trends. Water is experiencing strong mid- to high single-digit growth globally across all technologies. Examples of new innovation drivers for this segment include several new membrane product families within water to drive growth in desalination and wastewater markets as well as the launch of a new building insulation product offering increased sustainability solutions for customers.\nWe also have a strong adhesive business that is positioned well to capture growth with its product offerings in next-generation auto and electric vehicles, especially through the commercial synergy opportunities that we expect through the Rogers acquisition.\nWith that, let me turn it to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, we saw continued strong demand during the quarter in key end markets. Global supply chain challenges and cost inflation have persisted and even intensified during the quarter due to the war in Ukraine.\nIn response to inflation, we continued our strategic pricing actions and were able to fully offset higher costs during the quarter related to raw material, logistics and energy. These factors, along with our team's continued focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results well above expectations.\nFocusing on financial highlights on Slide 5 for the quarter. Net sales of $3.3 billion were up 9% on both an as-reported and organic basis versus the first quarter of 2021. The acquisition of Laird, partially offset by non-core divestitures, provided 2% net tailwind to net sales while currency was a 2% headwind during the quarter.\nOrganic sales growth included 6% pricing gains and 3% higher volume. Pricing gains reflect the actions taken to offset overall cost inflation, including the spike in energy costs that we are seeing at our site. Volume growth reflected continued strong customer demand with order patterns remaining solid, led by electronics, industrial technologies, water and construction end markets. These factors resulted in organic sales growth during the quarter of 10% and 9% for W&P and E&I, respectively.\nOn a regional basis, organic sales growth was broad-based globally with W&P driving growth in North America and EMEA and E&I driving growth in Asia Pacific.\nFrom an earnings perspective, operating EBITDA of $818 million was up 2% versus the year ago period and adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19%. The increase in operating EBITDA was driven by pricing actions, volume gains and strong earnings from the Laird acquisitions, which more than offset higher inflationary cost pressures as well as weaker product mix in W&P and the absence of a gain on asset divestiture in E&I last year.\nOperating EBITDA margin during the quarter was 25%, which was better than our expectations set earlier this quarter, about 160 basis points below the year ago period, which I'll explain further.\nNavigating cost inflation was a key focus during the quarter, and our success in doing so was a significant driver in our results. While the majority of the raw material inflation that we have discussed in the past related to the M&M businesses, which are now part of discontinued operations, our Remainco businesses also have inflation exposure, and we saw a spike in energy costs during the quarter, most notably in W&P. We fully offset about $190 million of cost inflation during the quarter, which kept our results whole on a dollars basis. While these pricing actions enabled us to maintain a neutral earnings profile, price cost dynamics resulted in 150 basis point headwind to operating EBITDA margin during the quarter.\nOur underlying operating EBITDA margin adjusted to exclude price cost factors was 26.5% or essentially flat compared to the year ago period. Further, as you adjust margins in the prior period to exclude the onetime gain related to the asset sale in E&I, our underlying margin of 26.5% would have increased about 70 basis points from last year.\nAnother key metric that we track is incremental margins. On a reported basis, incremental margin for the quarter was 6% from the year ago period. However, I indicated previously the importance of evaluating our results on an underlying basis. If you remove the impact of price cost, incremental margin was over 20%, and if you also exclude the headwind from the onetime asset sales. On top of that, incremental margin was almost 60%. I mentioned these data points to illustrate the volume strength we are seeing within the portfolio.\nFrom a cash perspective, cash flow from operations during the quarter of $209 million and capital expenditures of $251 million resulted in a free cash outflow of $42 million. The cash outflow was the result of variable compensation payments to our employees, which were approximately $100 million more this year than our normal payout, and higher working capital trade includes set of actions taken to increase inventory in reaction to continued product supply constraints. We expect significant improvement in free cash flow as we move towards the second half of the year consistent with our typical seasonal pattern.\nTurning to Slide 6. Adjusted EPS of $0.82 per share was up 19% compared to $0.69 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird collectively provided a benefit to adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.11 per share. These gains more than offset other previously disclosed portfolio related actions, weaker product mix in W&P and additional tax Kapton start-up costs in E&I totaling $0.09 per share in the aggregate. A lower share count and reduced interest expense from deleveraging actions continue to benefit our EPS results.\nOur base tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%, and we continue to expect our base tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 21% to 23%.\nTurning to segment results, beginning with E&I on Slide 7. E&I delivered net sales growth of 18%, including 9% organic growth and 11% portfolio benefit from Laird and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for E&I includes an 8% increase in volume and a 1% increase in price. For A line of business view, organic sales growth was led by semiconductor technologies, which increased mid-teens as robust demand continued, led by the ongoing transition to more advanced nodes, growth in high-performance computing and 5G communications as well as share gains.\nWithin Industrial Solutions, organic sales growth was up low double digits on a continuation of strong volume growth led by OLED materials for new phone and television launches, ongoing strength for Kalrez product offerings, most notably for semi CapEx and strong demand for health care applications such as biopharma and tubing.\nInterconnect Solutions sales decreased low single digits on an organic basis, due to a slight volume decline. Volume gains for films and laminates in certain industrial end markets were more than offset by declines in consumer electronics, primarily related to China as well as the anticipated return to more normal seasonal order patterns for smartphones. For the full year, we expect Interconnect Solutions to be up mid-single digits on an organic basis, led by strong demand in the second half and additional capacity coming online later this year from our Kapton expansion. From a regional perspective, E&I delivered sales growth in all regions with high single-digit organic growth in Asia Pacific, noting China was down slightly.\nOperating EBITDA for E&I of $476 million increased 9% as volume gains, strong earnings from Laird and pricing actions more than offset the absence of a prior year asset sale gain, higher raw material and logistics costs and a continuation of start-up costs associated with our Kapton capacity expansion. Operating EBITDA margin of 31% reflects sequential improvement from the fourth quarter of more than 200 basis points. On a year-over-year basis, the primary driver of the decline in operating EBITDA margin was the absence of a prior year gain. Adjusting margins in the prior year to exclude the onetime benefit, operating EBITDA margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year as a result of price cost and Kapton start-up costs more than offsetting volume gains.\nTurning to Slide 8, W&P delivered net sales growth of 8%, consisting of 10% organic growth and a 2% headwind from currency. Organic growth for W&P reflects broad-based pricing actions across the segment implemented to offset cost inflation. Volumes were flat as gains in shelter and water solutions were offset by declines in safety. From a line of business view, organic sales growth was led by Shelter Solutions, which was up high teens driven by pricing actions and continued robust demand in North American residential construction for products such as Tyvek, Kalrez as well as ongoing improvement in commercial construction for quarry and surface products. Sales for Water Solutions were up high single digits on an organic basis on volume and pricing gains. Global demand remains strong for all water technologies and across all regions.\nWithin Safety Solutions, sales were up mid-single digits on an organic basis as pricing actions were partially offset by lower volumes of Tyvek as we shifted production from garments to other end market applications. Volumes were up slightly for aramid fibers on continued improvement in industrial end markets.\nOperating EBITDA for W&P of $341 million declined 4% versus last year due to a weaker product mix. Operating EBITDA margin was better than our expectations set earlier in the quarter, but the impact of price cost was about a 210 basis point headwind to margin. Excluding the price cost impacts, operating EBITDA margin was about 26%, approaching more normalized levels for W&P.\nBefore I turn it back over to Ed, I'll close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 9. Despite the strong start to the year and solid demand, the macro environment remains volatile with several key and certain factors. Based on our expectations and in consideration of these uncertainties, our full year guidance ranges for operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS remain unchanged at $3.25 billion to $3.45 billion and $3.20 to $3.50 per share, respectively. These ranges include a $35 million earnings headwind as a result of suspending operations in Russia. We are increasing our guidance range for net sales to be between $13.3 billion and $13.7 billion to reflect price increases needed to offset cost inflation, which we now anticipate at $600 million in year-over-year headwinds.\nAlthough underlying demand in key end markets such as electronics, industrial technologies and water remains strong, we are seeing further supply chain constraints, primarily from additional government-mandated lockdowns in China, which will likely impact volume growth in the second quarter. Based on these anticipated headwinds as well as an element of previously projected Q2 sales realized in the first quarter, we expect second quarter 2022 sales to be between $3.2 billion and $3.3 billion or up about 5% year-over-year at the midpoint. Based on these same assumptions, we expect second quarter operating EBITDA between $750 million and $800 million, and adjusted EPS decrease $0.70 and $0.80 per share.\nAt the midpoint of our guidance, second quarter operating EBITDA margin is expected to decline just over 100 basis points sequentially as supply chain constraints are assumed to impact production rates. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to improve on typical seasonal volume strength and improved plant utilization as we clear COVID-related production challenges impacting the first half of the year. This outlook assumes moderating China lockdown impacts as we get into mid-May, given the positive trajectory in the Shanghai region and our limited exposure around Beijing. However, further outlook risks could be triggered as the lockdown spreads to Shenzhen and the Pearl River Delta region, given the concentration of manufacturing and shipping there for DuPont as well as our suppliers.\nWith that, let me turn the call back to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nBefore we take your questions, I'd like to highlight that we published our annual sustainability report this week, and I'm really proud of the progress we made on our 2030 goals. Our sustainability strategy is grounded in 3 pillars: innovation, protecting people and the planet and empowering employees and customers.\nI'll just note a few highlights. DuPont is leveraging our innovation focus to help customers meet their sustainability goals. A great example of that is the new formulations within our building installation products that helped increase energy efficiency as well as new technologies from our Water Solutions business that reduced process energy intensity. We're also focusing on renewable energy as part of our integrated climate and energy approach.\nLast year, we signed a virtual power purchase agreement that will supply about 25% of DuPont's total electricity starting in 2023. Additionally, Apple just announced that DuPont was selected to join their supplier clean energy program. which is an example of DuPont working with industry partners to drive sustainability progress at scale. We continue to advance our commitments to DE&I. We are excited about the newest female nominee to our Board of Directors, Christina Johnson. Also the strong gender and ethnic representation of our leadership teams continues despite competitive labor markets.\nThere are many great examples and stories in the report of how our teams are delivering on our purpose and driving sustainability. Overall, our teams have done a tremendous job.\nWith that, we are pleased to take your questions. And let me turn it back to the operator to open the Q&A.",

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Pat Fitzgerald, from Investor Relations.\n\nPatrick Fitzgerald\n\nHead of IR, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for DuPont's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. We are making this call available to investors and media via webcast. We have prepared slides to supplement our comments during this conference call. These slides are posted on the Investor Relations section of DuPont's website and through the link to our webcast. Joining me on the call today are Ed Breen, Chief Executive Officer; and Lori Koch, Chief Financial Officer. Please read the forward-looking statement disclaimer contained in the slides.\nDuring our call, we will make forward-looking statements regarding our expectations or predictions about the future. Because these statements are based on current assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, our actual performance and results may differ materially from our forward-looking statements. Our 2020 Form 10-K, as updated by our current and periodic reports, includes detailed discussion of principal risks and uncertainties, which may cause such differences. Unless otherwise specified, all historical financial measures presented today exclude significant items. We will also refer to other non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is included in our press release and posted to the Investor page of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. In addition to discussing our fourth quarter results and outlook for 2022, this morning, I'll also comment on the progress of both our intended acquisition of Rogers and our process for divesting a majority of the M&M segment.\nOur fourth quarter results were highlighted by 6% volume gains, including a 9% increase in the E&I segment and a 12% increase in W&P. M&M delivered top line results ahead of expectations, including volumes well ahead of global auto builds in the quarter. Customer demand was broad-based across the portfolio, led by greater than 20% volume growth in semiconductor technologies and high teens volume growth in water. Our top line performance also reflects significant pricing actions we took to offset $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter. We are seeing increases in all businesses with about 3/4 of the impact in M&M. Our teams have done an outstanding job monitoring our input costs and quickly translating that into price increases to remain price cost neutral for the year.\nWe are taking additional actions as we work to offset logistics costs, which during the fourth quarter were a $50 million headwind, mostly in W&P. I want to recognize and thank our employees who show up every day in our factories to keep our lines running and supplying the necessary products and solutions to deliver results that we reported today. Their unwavering commitment in the face of a relentless pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions and logistic challenges deserves our gratitude.\nTurning to Slide 3. I will provide an update on our portfolio transformation, and we'll review how our focus on those strategic actions, balanced capital allocation and innovation-led growth position us extremely well heading into 2022 to continue unlocking value for our shareholders, innovating for our customers and creating opportunity for our employees.\nIn November, we announced our planned acquisition of Rogers Corporation as well as our intent to divest a significant portion of our M&M segment. These portfolio actions will position DuPont among the top of the multi-industrial peer set with top quartile revenue growth, EBITDA margins and low cyclicality, all hallmarks of top-performing companies. Going forward, our business will be centered around the secular high-growth pillars of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation automotive. Our team sees strong customer demand across these pillars driven by megatrends such as the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles, clean water, sustainability and the move to 5G.\nThe preparation for the Rogers acquisition is well underway and on track for end of second quarter closing. Several significant milestones in the path to closing have already been achieved. In mid-December, the waiting period under the HSR expired here in the U.S. and regulatory processes in other parts of the world are underway. Just 2 weeks ago on January 25, Rogers shareholders voted to approve the transaction.\nExcitement is building for combining this business with our portfolio of electronics offerings, which includes our recent acquisition of Laird Performance Materials. Our teams are anxious to get to the point where we could start working with the application engineers, R&D and sales teams at Rogers to map out the revenue synergy opportunities in the areas of next-generation auto, 5G infrastructure, defense electronics and clean energy. Combined with Laird, these acquisitions increase the total addressable market of our E&I business by approximately 50% and will deepen our penetration into markets such as electric vehicles, consumer electronics and industrial technologies.\nA lot of work has been done to plan for the cost synergies associated with the Rogers acquisition, which we expect to be approximately $115 million. We also have line of sight to about $63 million of cost synergies from the Laird acquisition from last summer, which is ahead of our target. We are looking across both of the acquisitions as well as our existing E&I business to maximize our synergies through G&A and footprint optimization, along with procurement savings.\nWe also announced that we have initiated a process to divest the majority of the M&M segment. Our work here is also on track and progressing well. As I had expected, there is a significant level of interest in this market-leading asset, and I am pleased with how the process is progressing. Our target is to have a signed agreement by the end of the first quarter with the closing in the fourth quarter of this year.\nIn addition to positioning the company as a top-performing multi-industrial, these transactions enable us to transform the portfolio while maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing with a balanced financial policy. Today, we announced that our Board has approved a 10% per share increase to our dividend which is consistent with our commitment for a dividend payout in the range of 35% to 45% and to grow the dividend annually in line with earnings. In addition, our Board has also authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which enables us to continue returning value to our shareholders as we expect to complete the remaining $375 million under our existing authorization in the first quarter, ahead of the planned expiration.\nAfter paying down the financing associated with the Rogers acquisition, we expect to deploy a significant portion of the remaining M&M proceeds to do further M&A to build on our core areas of strength as well as additional share repurchases. We will also generate strong cash flow this year in addition to the $240 million gross proceeds from the biomaterials divestiture, which is the last of our noncore divestitures. Our strong balance sheet positions us well to deliver for all stakeholders through investment in our business, dividends, share repurchases and additional M&A.\nFinally, we will deliver shareholder value through staying focused on innovation, which is at the core of DuPont. The 6% volume growth we delivered in the quarter and 10% volume growth for the year benchmarks well against our top peers. For the quarter, our volume gains, excluding M&M segment were up 10%. These results are proof point that the work of our R&D teams and application engineers who spent countless hours working alongside our customers, solving their most complex challenges is an advantage in the marketplace.\nOur focus on innovation is also at the core of our ESG strategy through both innovation and our own processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at our factories as well as new product innovations that support and advance our customer sustainability goals in areas such as clean water, clean energy, electric vehicles and connectivity. The levers of portfolio transformation, balanced capital allocation and innovation-led growth is a powerful combination to create long-term shareholder value at DuPont.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Lori to discuss the details of the quarter as well as our financial outlook.\n\nLori D. Koch\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed, and good morning, everyone. As Ed mentioned, customer demand in our key end markets remained strong in the fourth quarter. We continue to face unprecedented global supply chain challenges and rising inflation. However, the swift pricing actions that we continue to implement are benefiting top line performance and maintaining earnings on a dollars basis. These factors, along with our intense focus on execution, contributed to net sales, operating EBITDA and adjusted EPS results above our guidance. In addition, we had solid cash flow generation and returned over $650 million in capital to shareholders during the quarter through $500 million in share repurchases and over $150 million in dividends. For the year, we returned more than $2.7 billion in capital to shareholders through $2.1 billion in share repurchases and $600 million in dividends.\nTurning to Slide 4. Net sales of $4.3 billion were up 14% versus the fourth quarter of 2020, up 13% on an organic basis. Organic sales growth consists of 7% price gains, reflecting the continued actions we are taking to address inflationary pressure and 6% volume growth. A 2% portfolio tailwind reflects the net impact of strong top line results related to our acquisition of Laird and headwinds from noncore divestitures. Currency was a 1% headwind in the quarter.\nOverall sales growth was broad-based and reflects double-digit organic growth in all 4 regions and high single-digit to double-digit organic growth in all 3 reporting segments. From an earnings perspective, we reported fourth quarter operating EBITDA of $973 million and adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share, up 5% and 54%, respectively, from the year ago period. Our incremental margin in the quarter was pressured by price costs and logistics. Net of these impacts, our incremental margin was about 33% in 4Q.\nEd mentioned earlier, the pricing actions that we took throughout the year, resulting in us offsetting about $250 million of raw material inflation in the quarter, and we also ended the year price cost neutral. The raw material inflation coupled with about $50 million of higher logistics costs in the quarter were headwinds to our margins. I will provide more detail of the margin compression we saw in the quarter in a few minutes.\nFrom a segment perspective, E&I delivered 10% operating EBITDA growth on volume gains and earnings uplift from Laird, which more than offset raw material and logistics segments as well as start-up costs associated with our Capline capacity expansion. In W&P, operating EBITDA increased 7% as pricing gains and volume growth more than offset higher raw material and logistics costs. We will remain disciplined in our pricing approach as we move into 2022 to address continued inflation. M&M operating EBITDA declined 3% as net pricing gains were more than offset by lower equity earnings due to higher natural gas costs in Europe.\nIn the quarter, cash flow from operating activities was $621 million, and CapEx was $184 million, resulting in free cash flow of $437 million. Free cash flow conversion was 100%. In addition, we received gross proceeds of about $500 million during the quarter from our Clean Technologies divestiture, which was closed at the end of December. Before we go to the next slide, I would also like to make a few comments on our full year performance. Full year net sales of $16.7 billion grew 16% and were up 14% on an organic basis. The organic growth consists of a 10% increase in volume and a 4% increase in price.\nOrganic sales growth reflects double-digit growth in all 4 regions and in all 3 reporting segments. Further, all 9 of our business lines had organic growth in 2021 and 7 of the 9 business lines grew double digits. The 10% increase in volume for the year consists of gains in all 3 reporting segments and within all 9 business lines, reflecting robust global customer demand in secular growth areas such as electronics and water, along with recovery in end markets negatively impacted by the pandemic in prior year, such as automotive, commercial construction and select industrial markets.\nFull year operating EBITDA of $4.2 billion increased 21%, reflecting 1.3x operating leverage, operating EBITDA margin expansion of about 100 basis points and an incremental margin of 32%. Operating EBITDA increased for all 3 reporting segments during the year. Full year adjusted EPS of $4.30 per share was up about 95% from prior year on higher segment earnings, a lower share count and lower interest expense.\nSlide 5 shows the impact that price cost inflation had on our operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. As costs continue to rise throughout 2021, our fourth quarter results reflects the largest headwind to quarterly margins for the year. In total, pricing actions fully offset about $250 million of raw material inflation, which was higher than our expectations for input costs coming into the quarter and mainly in the M&M segment. While our pricing actions have enabled us to maintain earnings, the price cost inflation resulted in a significant headwind of about 150 basis points to operating EBITDA margins versus the year ago period. Additionally, higher logistics costs of about $50 million in the quarter resulted in a margin headwind of about 120 basis points. Offsetting the headwinds from raws and logistics was a 70 basis point improvement and operating EBITDA margin, which includes volume growth in E&I and W&P and the benefit associated with the Laird acquisition.\nIf you exclude the price cost and logistics headwinds in the quarter on an ex M&M segment basis, our operating EBITDA margin was above 26.5% in the fourth quarter, further illustrating our strong performance and putting an emphasis on our planned portfolio actions.\nTurning to Slide 6, which provides more detail on the year-over-year changes in the net sales for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, organic sales growth of 13% during the quarter consists of 7% pricing gains and 6% volume growth. In E&I, volume gains delivered 9% organic sales growth for the segment, led by higher volumes in semiconductor technologies of more than 20%. Semiconductor technologies demand was driven by the ongoing transition to more advanced node technologies resulting from growth in electronics megatrends. Semi Tech was up mid-teens for the full year and we expect to continue to outpace MSI growth as we head into 2022. We are seeing more investments in semiconductor capacity, which we expect to be a positive for us in the long term.\nIndustrial Solutions was up mid-teens during the quarter on volume growth, which was driven by ongoing strength for Caleres and Vesta within electronics and industrial end markets along with strong demand for medical silicones and biopharma and health care applications. Organic growth for Industrial Solutions was up mid-teens for the full year as well. As expected, organic sales growth for Interconnect Solutions was down in the quarter, reflecting the anticipated impact of the shift in demand related to premium next-generation smartphones to the first half of 2021, along with softness in automotive end markets related to the semi chip shortage. For the full year, organic SaaS growth for our Interconnect Solutions was up mid-single digit, and we expect to return to a more traditional seasonality in 2022.\nIn addition, we recently completed our Capton expansion project here in the U.S., which expands our production of polyamide film and flexible circuit board materials. We will begin qualifying materials in the first half of this year for high-value applications, which will start to accelerate in the second half of 2022. For W&P, 17% organic sales growth during the quarter consisted of a 12% increase in volume, including volume gains in all 3 businesses and 5% pricing gains. Sales gains were led by high teens organic growth in Safety Solutions as continued recovery in industrial end markets resulted in significant volume improvement for Nomex and Kevlar Air and mid fibers.\nWithin Water Solutions, high-teens organic sales growth reflects strong global demand for water technologies, primarily in industrial and desalination markets. Shelter Solutions sales increased on mid-teens organic growth, driven by continued strength in North American residential construction and continued recovery in commercial construction led by higher demand for quarry and services. Year-over-year pricing gains of 5% during the quarter relate primarily to actions taken in safety and shelter in response to raw material inflation and also reflects sequential price improvement from all 3 business lines and W&P versus the third quarter.\nFor the full year, W&P delivered 10% organic sales growth on 8% volume improvement and 2% pricing gains. Safety and Shelter Solutions were up low double digits organically, and Water Solutions was up mid-single digits for the year. The global demand for clean water technologies remained strong and expanding our capacity remains a priority for us. For M&M, 13% organic sales growth during the quarter was driven by a 16% increase in price, offset slightly by a 3% decline in volumes. M&M within the segment within our portfolio, most significantly impacted by raw material inflation. The 60% local price increase during the quarter reflects continued actions taken to offset higher raw material and logistics costs. Volume declines reflect softness in global auto production due to supply constraints, primarily the semiconductor chip shortage.\nFor the year, m&M organic sales growth was 24% on 12% higher volume and 12% pricing gains. All 3 business lines within M&M delivered organic sales growth of greater than 20% for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 7. Adjusted EPS of $1.08 per share was up 54% from $0.70 per share in the year ago period. Higher volumes and strong results from Laird more than offset higher logistics costs and other operating items such as cat time start-up costs. Below-the-line items continue to benefit our EPS results compared to the year ago period, primarily a lower share count. Lower interest expense was mainly offset by a higher tax rate. For full year 2022, we expect our base tax rate to be in the range of 21% to 23%.\nLet me close with a few comments on our financial outlook on Slide 8. We expect continued top line strength across the portfolio in 2022, led by ongoing strength in semiconductors as the industry continues to operate near capacity to meet demand, and consistent demand in areas such as industrial technologies, smartphone sales, housing starts and water filtration. Our plan assumes these market dynamics will lead to solid volume growth in 2022.\nIn 2022, we are planning that raw material and logistics costs will remain at elevated levels with approximately $600 million of year-over-year headwinds versus 2021, primarily in the first half. Once again, the raw material inflation will be predominantly in our M&M segment. In response, we are implementing more price increases in all businesses, which will enable us to offset raw material and logistics costs on a full year basis, but we will lag in the first quarter. We expect our operating EBITDA margins to improve throughout 2022, driven by volume growth, productivity, acquisition synergies and full implementation of pricing actions.\nIn the first quarter, we expect net sales between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion and operating EBITDA between $940 million and $980 million. At the midpoint of our guidance range, we are anticipating first quarter operating EBITDA margins to be about flat sequentially with the fourth quarter 2021. We expect sequential improvement in E&I and M&M to be offset by W&P as manufacturing cost increases stemming from the Omicron variant and ongoing logistics cost headwinds lead to sequential margin decline.\nFor the full year, net sales of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion and operating EBITDA of approximately $4.4 billion at the midpoint reflects volume growth and acceleration of additional pricing gains throughout the year to offset the impact of both raw material and logistics cost increases. We expect operating EBITDA margin in the back half of 2022 to return to more normalized levels as impacts from the Omicron variance subsides as well as gains from volume improvement, productivity actions, acquisition synergies and full implementation of price increases.\nIn closing, I want to note that our guidance is based on the current DuPont portfolio today, including the businesses and scope of the planned M&M divestiture. Once we sign a deal, the in-scope M&M businesses will move to discontinued operations, and we will reset the guidance for remaining DuPont. With that, let me turn the call back to Ed.\n\nEdward D. Breen\n\nCEO & Executive Chairman, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Lori. Let me close by summarizing why I am excited about 2022 at DuPont. Our results demonstrate that our businesses deliver the solutions our customers demand and a tight supply chain and challenging logistics environment, we delivered 6% volume growth well ahead of our expectations coming into the quarter. Our teams continue to work closely with our customers to understand their complex material challenges and to win business by delivering innovative and sustainable solutions.\nYou can also see our teams are managing every lever within our control. This is evident through our delivery of pricing gains to offset every dollar of raw material inflation in 2021, and these actions continue into 2022. In addition to having our fundamentals in place, we are on track to complete a few substantial steps in the transformation of DuPont in 2022 with the planned Rogers acquisition and the M&M divestiture. These transactions as well as the potential for additional M&A in strategic areas, position DuPont as a premier multi-industrial company, focused in the areas of electronics, water, industrial technologies, protection and next-generation auto.\nAnd finally, because of our ability to complete this transformation while maintaining a strong balance sheet, we will be in a position to generate value for all stakeholders through organic and inorganic investment in our businesses and by staying committed to our dividend and share repurchases as we announced today. I look forward to providing you updates on each of these areas as we progress through 2022. With that, let me turn it to Pat to open the Q&A.\n\nPatrick Fitzgerald\n\nHead of IR, DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. Before we move to the Q&A portion of our call, I would like to remind you that our forward-looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following Q&A. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please provide the Q&A instructions.",

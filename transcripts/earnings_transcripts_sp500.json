It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Beth Roberts. Please go ahead, Beth.\n\nBeth Roberts\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Josh Weinstein, our CFO, David Bernstein; and our Chair, Micky Arison.\nBefore we begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I will refer you to today's press release and our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors and risks that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. We will be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures, including yields, cruise costs without fuel, EBITDA, net income, ROIC and related statistics for all, which are on a net basis or adjusted as defined, unless otherwise stated. A reconciliation to U.S. GAAP is included in our earnings press release and our investor presentation, which are available on our corporate website. References to ticket prices, yields and cruise costs without fuel are in constant currency unless we know otherwise. Please visit our corporate website where our earnings press release and investor presentation can be found.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua Ian Weinstein\n\nPresident, CEO, Chief Climate Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Beth. This was a truly outstanding quarter with our business continuing to fire on all cylinders, outperforming and taking us to new heights. Once again, we delivered record revenues, yields, operating income, EBITDA and customer deposits. This quarter, we also achieved all-time high net income of $2 billion, surpassing our pre-pause benchmark by nearly 10%. This is a significant milestone with strong operational execution more than compensating for a nearly 600% increase in net interest expense compared to 2019. On a unit basis, both operating income and EBITDA reached the highest levels in the better part of 20 years. These record results were delivered on 2.5% lower capacity as compared to the third quarter last year, yet another proof point on our successful delivery of same-ship yield improvement and its marked impact on the bottom line.\nIn fact, yields increased 4.6%, all of which was achieved on a same-ship basis. Yields were also over a point better than guidance again due to the strength in both close-in demand and onboard spending. Unit costs beat guidance by 1.5 points on continued cost discipline. The outperformance on revenue and costs, alongside our refinancing efforts, enabled us to take up our full year guidance for the third time this year. These fantastic results and our team's consistently strong execution delivered ROIC of 13% for the trailing 12 months. This is the first time since 2007, nearly 20 years ago, that returns have reached the teens; another clear testament to the fundamental improvements in our operational performance.\nOur leverage is now down another notch to 3.6x net debt to EBITDA, closing in on investment-grade leverage metrics. This positions us even closer to using our strong and growing free cash flow to not only continue to responsibly delever, but also to return capital to shareholders. In fact, just today, we called the remaining converts using $500 million of cash that David will touch upon. To fuel this over the longer term, we believe we have much more opportunity to increase same-ship yields and further close the unbelievable value gap to land-based alternatives, pushing margins and returns even higher over time.\nIn fact, booking trends have continued to improve since our last update nicely outpacing capacity growth at higher prices and setting a record for bookings made on sailings 2 years out. And with nearly half of 2026 already on the books at higher prices, we feel pretty good about next year. We just welcomed Star Princess into the fleet, sister to the highly successful Sun Princess previously awarded Conde Nast 2024 Megaship of the Year. This new ship class will now represent over 15% of the Princess fleet, a nice tailwind for the brand next year.\nOf course, we also have the full benefit of Celebration Key and the continued rollout of our destination development strategy as we progress through next year. Celebration Key is as phenomenal as we expected and open to rave reviews. I could not be prouder of both the Carnival Cruise Line and our destination development teams for not only getting this fantastic development done on time and on budget, but also delivering an amazing guest experience right from the start. Since our late July opening, nearly 0.5 million Carnival Cruise Line guests have already passed through the Sunshaped Arch in Paradise Plaza, soaking in the largest freshwater lagoon in the Caribbean, heading up to the top of the world's largest sandcastle, zipping down our racing water slides or enjoying a cool cocktail at the world's largest swim-up bar. While early guest feedback from Celebration Key has been fantastic. We are paying close attention to our guest suggestions, and we'll continue to fine-tune operations and strive for continuous improvement to make the experience for our guests even better. As you may have seen, the media coverage for our new destination has been overwhelmingly positive. Even before opening, we were amongst the most search cruise destinations and we have clearly built on that success. Our marketing teams have been working\n[Audio Gap]\nAs beaches are the #1 destination for vacation in Americans are miles upon miles of some of the most beautiful beaches in the world are the perfect fix. By making targeted incremental investments and stepping up our marketing efforts to support this broad destination portfolio, we believe we have further opportunity to monetize these strategic assets by using them to drive consumer consideration and conversion, taking share from land-based alternatives.\nAltogether, our exclusive Caribbean destinations will capture over 8 million guest visits next year, almost equal to the rest of the cruise industry combined. And let's not forget our strategic portfolio of brands and assets stretch far beyond the Caribbean.\nWe have, by far, the most assets in and capacity dedicated to Alaska, which has been incredibly strong this year as well as the biggest reach into Europe, which has likewise been performing incredibly well for us. Our portfolio of brands and land-based assets are clearly the largest and most diverse in the industry and getting even better every day. While getting to 13% ROIC so quickly is a significant achievement, it's certainly not a ceiling. We have been disciplined in deploying capital towards our highest returning brands with 7 ships on order for Carnival and AIDA combined. But keep in mind, we have many other brands that are quickly progressing up the internal leaderboard. This year, the overwhelming majority of capacity will be at brands delivering double-digit returns. Yes, this is already well above our cost of capital, but our brands have much more room to significantly improve. In fact, several of our brands are not yet back to either 2019 levels or the record highs they've reached in the past 2 decades. So we know the latent potential they have. And even the 2 stars currently a top that internal leaderboard, AIDA and Carnival Cruise Line have road maps to progress. AIDA will continue to benefit from its hugely successful evolutions program, which coupled with new ship orders, will modernize its current fleet.\nNext month, AIDA Luna will enter drydock, the second of 7 ships to receive this proven upgrade. Carnival will also be launching a fantastic new marketing campaign just ahead of wave season, an enhanced loyalty program mid next year and of course, stands to disproportionately benefit from the step-up we're making in our Caribbean destinations, given their large year-round Caribbean presence. So while it is incredibly rewarding to see the great progress our teams have made in such a short amount of time, I am equally excited about the opportunities ahead as we create shareholder value through continued progress on profitability and returns.\nAt the same time, further balance sheet improvement should continue the transfer of enterprise value from bondholders back to shareholders. I would like to again thank our team members, ship and shore for the dedication and execution which enabled us to deliver happiness to nearly 4 million guests this past quarter by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sell, place we visit and life we touch, and special thanks to our travel agent partners, destination partners, investors and of course, our loyal guests for their continuing support.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2025 third quarter results. Next, I will provide some color on our improved full year September guidance as well as some key insights on our fourth quarter. Then I'll provide you with a few things to consider for 2026 and finish up with an update on our efforts to rebuild our financial fortress through refinancing and deleveraging.\nTurning to the summary of our third quarter results. Net income exceeded June guidance by $182 million or $0.13 per share as we outperformed once again and achieved our highest ever net income for the quarter. The outperformance was mainly driven by 3 things: first, favorability in revenue worth $0.04 per share as yields came in at 4.6% compared to the prior year, and that was on top of last year's robust increase of nearly 9%. This was 1.1 points better than June guidance, driven by continued strong closing demand, resulting in higher ticket prices and the continuation of strong onboard spending. The increase in yields was driven by improvements on both sides of the Atlantic.\nSecond, cruise cost without fuel per available lower birth day, or ALBD, were up 5.5% compared to the prior year. This was 1.5 points better than June guidance and was worth $0.03 per share. The favorability was driven by cost-saving initiatives, which we firmed up during the quarter. These will flow through to our full year September guidance. And third, favorability in fuel consumption and fuel mix was worth $0.02 per share as our efforts and investments to continuously improve our energy efficiency of our operations leveraging technology and best practices paid off once again.\nThe balance of the favorability $0.04 per share was a combination of improved depreciation expense and better fuel prices as well as favorable interest income and expense. Customer deposits at the end of the quarter were at a record for the third quarter at $7.1 billion, up over $300 million versus the prior year, driven by higher ticket pricing and increased sales of pre-cruise onboard revenue items.\nNext, I will provide some color on our improved full year September guidance. Our net income guidance of approximately $2.9 billion or $2.14 per share is a $235 million or $0.17 per share improvement over our June guidance. The full year improvement of $0.17 per share was driven by 3 things: first, flowing the $0.13 per share third quarter favorability through to the full year; second, an additional $0.03 per share of fourth quarter interest expense favorability as the actions that impacted third quarter interest expense are also creating favorability in the fourth quarter; and third, $0.01 per share from improved fourth quarter fuel prices.\nYield guidance for the fourth quarter remain the same as the prior guidance. Cruise costs without fuel for the fourth quarter are flat with June guidance. However, our cruise costs for the fourth quarter did benefit from some of these cost savings we solidified during the third quarter, but were offset by higher variable compensation driven by improved operating results. All of this results in over $7 billion of EBITDA, a 15% improvement over 2024, virtually all of which is being driven by same-ship yield improvement as our capacity is only up approximately 1% year-over-year.\nNow a few things for you to consider for 2026. We are forecasting a capacity increase of just [ 0.8% ] compared to 2025. As Josh indicated, booking trends have continued to improve since our last update and we now have nearly half of 2026 on the books at higher prices. As we highlighted on our last call, Carnival Cruise Line's new loyalty program, Carnival Rewards, will start in June 2026, impacting results for the second half of the year. As a reminder, while the program will be cash flow positive from day 1, it does impact our yields in 2026. The year-over-year impact is expected to be about 0.5 point. It should also be noted that we do not anticipate any meaningful impact on cost from the new loyalty program when compared to the current program. Our game-changing destination celebration key, which opened in July 2025, has been delivering an amazing guest experience with a full year of operation in 2026 along with the mid 2026 opening of our new peer at RelaxAway, Half Moon Cay, we expect that the operating expenses for these destinations in 2026 will impact our overall year-over-year cost comparisons by about 0.5 point. While it is still early in our planning process, we are expecting to do more work during our 2026 drydocks. The additional expenses will impact our overall year-over-year assumptions by up to 1 percentage point.\nNow I'll finish up with an update of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. During the quarter, we continued our refinancing strategy to reduce interest expense and manage our maturity towers while also reducing secured debt by nearly $2.5 billion, leaving just $3.1 billion remaining. We issued 2 senior unsecured notes and completed 1 bank loan. The combined proceeds of $4.6 billion from these financings, together with cash on hand, were used to repay over $5 billion of debt, continuing our deleveraging efforts. We have been working aggressively all year long to delever as well as to simplify and strengthen our capital structure, rebuilding our investment-grade balance sheet.\nSince January, we refinanced over $11 billion of debt at favorable rates and prepaid another $1 billion, accelerating our path to investment-grade credit metrics. We are pleased that our efforts have been recognized with the recent Moody's credit rating upgrade and the maintenance of their positive outlook. Based on our September guidance, we are expecting to end the year with a marked improvement in our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio going from 4.3x at the end of 2024 to 3.6x at the end of 2025.\nLooking forward, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of under 3x. Given the progress we have made and while still a top priority, it is great to be able to say that debt reduction no longer has to be priority 1, 2 and 3. We can soon pivot to diverting some of that effort to returning capital to shareholders as well. In fact, just today, we provided a redemption notice for all of our outstanding convertible notes, which if converted, will be settled using a combination of $500 million of cash and equity as we continue to rebuild our financial fortress. The convert redemption will be settled on December 5, just 5 days after year-end and will result in a $600 million improvement in net debt.\nPro forma for the convert redemption, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio, is forecasted to be 3.5x very early in our fiscal year 2026. This transaction will also result in a lower share count used in the calculation of our fully diluted EPS for 2026 by approximately 13 million shares at a $30 share price. As we near completion of our current refinancing strategy and with no ship delivery scheduled during 2026 and just one delivery per year for several years thereafter, looking forward, we expect our leverage metrics to continue to improve as our EBITDA continues to grow, and our debt levels continue to shrink.\nWith strong investment-grade metrics in our future an upgrade to investment grade should not be far behind, which will result in security release on our remaining secured debt. All of this continues to move us further down the road, rebuilding our financial fortress while continuing the process of transferring value from debt holders back to shareholders.\nNow operator, let's open the call for questions."

P D and ROI see.\n\nAfter just one year down with two to go we're already over 80% of the way towards achieving both of these targets, calling for a 50% increase in EBITDA for a L. B D from our 'twenty to 'twenty three starting point.\n\nAnd ROIC of 12% both of which would be the highest the company has seen in almost 20 years.\n\nAnd with Rois see ending 'twenty 'twenty four at 11%.\n\nComfortably above our cost of capital we are already delivering long term value for our shareholders. As we lay the foundation will build upon in 'twenty or 'twenty five and beyond.\n\nAt the outset and with about two thirds of the year already on the books 20 twenty-five is shaping up to be another banner year with yield growth exceeding 4% far outpacing historical growth rates and again exceeding unit cost growth delivering more than $400 million incrementally.\n\nto the bottom line.\n\nIn fact booking trends even accelerated during the quarter.\n\nDespite less inventory for sale as compared to the same time last year 'twenty twenty-five booking volumes over the quarter were actually higher year on year at higher prices for each quarter, including the period, leading up to the election bookings.\n\nBooking volumes for 2020 six also continue to break records, reflecting sustained demand even for further out ceilings.\n\nThe ongoing strength and demand reinforced our record breaking book position.\n\nWith price and occupancy are higher for each of the four quarters of 2025, and we managed to increase both our price and occupancy advantage for 'twenty twenty-five book position. Thanks to our outstanding efforts. This past quarter I can actually now report that our north American and Euro.\n\nOpinion segments are each at their longest advanced booking windows on record.\n\nAll core deployments are also better booked at higher prices than the record levels. We achieved at the same time last year, so with a good amount less inventory to sell for 2025, I cannot stress enough to our customers and trade partners that if you wanted to sell with US This year book now.\n\nWhile there is still space available and .\n\nKeep in mind, our 'twenty 'twenty four results and book position for future sailings are being driven by improved operational execution across our brands and are essentially on the same ship basis now don't get me wrong, New ships are great. In fact, we welcomed three amazing new ship.\n\nIn 2024.\n\nArnold you believe the third of five X L class vessels for Carnival cruise line.\n\nProudly sailing out of the great state of Texas.\n\nSome Princess Princess cruises next generation flagship was just awarded Nast travellers 'twenty 'twenty four mega ship of the year, beating out all other mega shifts that entered service this year.\n\nAnd last but not least came the spectacular Queen Anne Qunar. Its first ship in 14 years and a beautiful addition to Queen Victoria, Queen Elizabeth and the Venerable Queen Mary two.\n\nWhile new ships do command a nice premium the vast majority of our yield growth was driven by fundamental demand improvements for the existing ships across our portfolio of world class brands.\n\nEven excluding our new builds 'twenty 'twenty four is yields were still up almost 10% over 2023 that's because we're achieving demand growth well above our modest supply pipeline through ground up efforts to improve execution across the commercial space, we've been investing in both .\n\nand tools .\n\nIn on each of our brand's unique target markets crafting marketing campaigns that speak directly to them and in the most effective forums, where success really enticing new cruise gas away from land based alternatives in fact, both new to cruise and repeat guests were each up double digits.\n\nWe're centered just this past year at.\n\nAt the same time, our marketing efforts are continuing to deliver growth and web visits natural and paid search that far outpace our limited capacity growth keeping the pipeline of new demand full simultaneously with augmenting our performance from top of funnel consideration.\n\nTo closing the deal in generating the bookings we've been sharpening our yield management techniques to optimize our booking curves and drive ticket prices in onboard spending higher.\n\nAll of these efforts are already in flight and clearly working we have even more in store to continue the momentum.\n\nWe're launching new marketing campaigns across all our brands.\n\nPrincess Cunard and seaborne have already debuted spectacular new creators this month and princesses case, it's fresh take on its incomparable love both theme featuring Hana wanting them of Ted last time Fame already help to produce record booking volumes for the black Friday through cyber Monday period and.\n\nStay tuned for new campaigns from Aida Carnival, Costa Holland America M. P. N O cruises in the U K all launching shortly to coincide with wave season, our peak booking period, we're aggressively working to increase awareness and consideration for cruise travel globally.\n\nWe're also actively working on an enhanced destination strategy to provide guests with yet another reason to take a cruise vacation with us and that is sure to help us continue to excel.\n\nWhile we retained by far the largest footprint in the Caribbean with six owned and operated destinations that captured six and a half a million guest visits in 'twenty 'twenty four.\n\nWe believe we have a meaningful opportunity to expand and capitalize on this strategic advantage. These destinations are amongst our highest rated guest experiences today.\n\nAnd we have plans to lean into these assets even further.\n\nWell historically, the marketing of our own assets have really focused on the ships, we have untapped potential to create demand for these amazing destination experiences.\n\nI have never been more excited about these prospects as we begin to unfold. This multi year strategy with the opening of celebration key in just about six months.\n\nThis will be by far our largest and most carnival centric destination in our portfolio with five awesome portals built for fun.\n\nFamily friendly to exclusive Beach club experiences now.\n\nNot only will celebration key be the closest destination in our portfolio saving fuel costs and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The only way you can get the celebration key is on one of our cruises. Moreover.\n\nMoreover, we just recently announced a change that signals more about this shift in our destination asset strategy half Moon Cay, the highly rated and award winning exclusive Bahamian destination known for beautiful beaches, and Crystal clear waters is being renamed relax away.\n\nHalf Moon Cay to better reflect the experience guests can expect as they are immersed in this tropical Paradise enhancements will include an expanded beachfront experience lunch venues a variety of bars and other features created with intentionality to reinforce this.\n\nnatural beauty and pristine appeal.\n\n[noise] ready in summer of 2026.\n\nNewly constructed peer on the north side will allow two ships to dock, including carnivals XL class ships that will be able to visit the private island for the first time.\n\nWe'll be positioning these jewels of the Caribbean with consumers in a way that will encourage guests to actively seek out. These specific destinations offered exclusively by our brands and many of Carnival cruise lines itineraries will feature both relax away half Moon Cay.\n\nAnd celebration key providing guests with complementary experiences enjoying both the idyllic Andy Ultimate Beach days.\n\nWe believe developing and promoting these unique assets will help us cast the net wider and capture even more new to cruise demand were already in flight with preparation for branding and marketing campaigns for these amazing destinations with more to come in the future.\n\nAs it is for 2025, we expect to hit our 2026 EBITDA per a L. B D target a full year early while raising Rois C to just shy of our 12% 20 twenty-six target.\n\nSo considering all of the progress we've made without this in place. It's clear we have a tremendous amount of headroom remaining to create more demand to cultivate more guest loyalty and capture more pricing for the incredible ship and shore side experiences we provide our guests.\n\nAt the same time, we're making meaningful progress on the sustainability front.\n\nWe achieved about 17, and a 5% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity versus 2019 on track to achieve our target of 20% by the end of 2026. Our goal that was previously pulled forward by four years improve.\n\nImprovement Hasnt just been in emission intensity levels. Despite.\n\nDespite the fact that we're over 9% larger than we were in 2019, we've actually lowered our absolute greenhouse gas emissions by almost 10% over this time.\n\nAnd of course, we're also making huge strides in rebuilding our financial fortress.\n\nIn under two years, we've paid down over $8 billion of debt off our peak and significantly reduced interest expense, which coupled with our improving EBITDA has improved our leverage metrics tremendously.\n\nOur current 2025 guidance will put us at three eight times net debt to EBITDA closing in on our expectation to reach investment grade leverage metrics in 2026.\n\nAgain.\n\nThank you so much to each of our team members, who have delivered a step change improvement in 'twenty 'twenty, four and set us up for a fantastic 2025 and beyond.\n\nAnd as has always been the case and always will be thank you. So much to our travel agent partners, who have contributed immensely to this success. We also appreciate the support we've received from our loyal guests investors destination partners and other stakeholders.\n\nLet's not forget.\n\nThese efforts were really all about the main thing.\n\nLivery unforgettable happiness to over 13, and a half million people in 2024 by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations, while honoring the integrity of every ocean. We sell places we visit and life, we touch with that I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nThank you Josh I'll start today with a summary of our 2020 for fourth quarter results next I will provide an update on our refinancing and deleveraging efforts.\n\nAnd then I'll finish up with some color on our 2025 full year December guidance.\n\nLet's turn to the summary of our fourth quarter results.\n\nNet income exceeded September guidance by $126 million as we outperformed once again, the outperformance was essentially driven by three things.\n\nFirst favorability in revenue were $77 million as yields came in up six 7% compared to the prior year. This was 1.7 points better than September guidance, driven by close in strength in ticket prices as well as strong onboard spending.\n\nSecond cruise costs without fuel per available lower birthday, or a L. E D 2 million up seven 4% compared to the prior year. This was six tenths of a point better than September guidance, which was worth $13 million and third favorability in interest expense.\n\nOther income and expense and tax expense all of which were partially offset by higher fuel prices.\n\nAdded to a $38 million improvement.\n\nPremiums for the fourth quarter improved over 5% versus the prior year, which I would remind you we're up over 10% last year with improvements on both sides of the Atlantic driven by higher ticket prices and improved onboard spending.\n\nStrong demand allowed us to once again report records delivering fourth quarter record revenues record yields record per Dms record adjusted EBITDA and record customer deposits.\n\nNext I will provide an update about refinancing and deleveraging efforts.\n\nOur full year 2020 for yield improvement of 11% was over three times or 3.5% cost increase.\n\nThis drove improved margins and cash flow, which resulted in a strong EBITDA of $6 1 billion in cash from operations of about 6 billion.\n\nAll of this propelled us on our journey to pay down debt and proactively manage our debt profile.\n\n'twenty 'twenty four we made debt payments of Gulf of $5 billion, which included Opportunistically prepaying over 3 billion of debt reducing secured debt.\n\nMoving the secured second lien layer from our capital structure and paying off some of them more expensive debt.\n\nWe ended 2024 with 27 and a half billion of debt over 8 billion cost the January 2023 peak.\n\nOur leverage metrics continued to improve in 2024, as our EBITDA continue to grow and our debt levels continue to shrink.\n\nWe achieved a 4.3 times net debt to EBITDA ratio nearly a two and a half turn improvement from 2023 positioning US reports the way down the path to investment grade leverage metrics in just one year with.\n\nWith demand up there that well manage near term maturity towers and improved leverage metrics, we expect to opportunistically capitalize on improved interest rates, while proactively managing our maturity towers for 2027 M beyond with various refinancings.\n\nNow I'll finish up with some color on our 2025 full year December guidance on.\n\nOn top of 2020 fours, 11% yield growth, we are expecting to deliver strong 2025 yield improvement with our guidance forecasting an increase of approximately 4.2% worth over 60 cents per share when compared to 2024.\n\nThe strong improvement in 2025 yields as a result of an increase in higher ticket prices higher onboard spending and to a lesser degree higher occupancy with all three components improving on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nWe are well positioned to drive 2025 ticket pricing higher which significantly less inventory remaining to sell that at the same time last year.\n\nNow turning to costs.\n\nCruise costs without fuel per a L. B D is expected to be up approximately three 7% costing 28 cents per share for 2025 versus 2024.\n\nWe are looking forward to the introduction of our game changing exclusive Bahamian destination celebration K in July 2025.\n\nWe anticipate that celebration K will be a smash hit with our guests and provide an excellent return on our investment however.\n\nHowever, operating expenses for the destination will impact our overall year over year cost comparisons by about half a point.\n\nIn 2025, we are expecting 687, Drydock days, an increase of 17% versus 2024, which will also impact our overall year over year cost comparison by about three quarters of a point.\n\nIn 2024, there were several onetime items that we benefited from impacting our overall year over year cost comparisons by about a quarter of a point.\n\nThe remaining 2.2 point increase in cruise costs are driven by inflation and higher advertising expense, partially offset by efficiency initiatives and further leveraging our industry leading scale.\n\nAn increase in depreciation expense and lower interest income is partially offset by an improvement in interest expense from our refinancing and deleveraging efforts for a net impact of four cents per share.\n\nThe net impact of fuel pricing currency is expected to favorably impact 2020 high by approximately four cents per share with fuel prices favorable by approximately nine cents per share while the change in foreign currency exchange rate goes together way by five cents per share.\n\nYeah.\n\nLet's not forget that the European Union allowance or EUA regulation in 2025 increases to 70% of carbon emissions from 40% in 2024.\n\nAs a result, we would expect the impact of higher EUA costs on a year over year fuel expense to be about three cents per share.\n\nIn summary.\n\nAll these factors together, our net income guidance for full year 2025 is over $2 3 billion, an improvement of more than $400 million versus 2024 or 28 cents per share.\n\nRobust demand for our brands and continued operational execution is driving our strong financial results along with our increased confidence in achieving investment grade leverage metrics.

[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Beth. You may begin.\n\nBeth Roberts\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. I'm joined today by our CEO, Josh Weinstein; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Chair, Micky Arison.\nBefore we begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I will refer you to the forward-looking statement in today's press release. All references to ticket prices, net per DMs, net yields and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. References to diems and yields will be on a net basis. Our comments may also reference cruise costs without fuel, EBITDA, net income, earnings per share, free cash flow and ROIC, all of which will be on an adjusted basis unless otherwise stated.\nAll these references are non-GAAP financial measures defined in our earnings press release. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures and other associated disclosures are also contained in our earnings press release and in our investor presentation. Please visit our corporate website where our earnings press release and investor presentation can be found. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua Ian Weinstein\n\nPresident, CEO, Chief Climate Officer & Director\n\nThanks, Beth. Inside of 2 years, we've made incredible strides in improving our commercial operations, strategically reallocating our portfolio composition, formulating growth plans, and strengthening even further our global team ship and shore the best in the business. Off the back of these efforts, we've closed yet another quarter delivering records. This time across revenues, operating income, customer deposits and booking levels, exceeding our guidance on every measure. Yields increased over 12% in Q2, over 1.5 points more than March guidance as we continue to drive strong per diem growth, up over 6%, and this is on over 10% more passenger cruise days, which is a combination of capacity growth and sailing at historical occupancy levels.\nOur European brands experienced extraordinary yield improvement again this quarter, up over 20%, while North America continued to improve on last year's high, up a healthy 7%. We had record second quarter adjusted EBITDA, roughly $150 million more than guidance. Encouragingly, on a per ALBD basis to highlight operational improvement and even with significantly higher fuel prices, adjusted EBITDA not only surpassed the second quarter of 2019, it was also our highest second quarter mark in over 15 years, coupled with flat cruise costs, excluding fuel, on a unit basis, which David will elaborate on. We delivered $500 million more to the bottom line year-over-year and outperformed our earnings guidance by $170 million. Based on continued strong demand trends, we are also taking up our expectations for the full year by $275 million, driven by double-digit yield growth.\nNow this would get us to double-digit ROIC this year. And while that will be a strong outcome for 2024, it is nowhere near what our business is capable of delivering. Our current booking trends are a testament to that. We are hitting records on top of previous records, which clearly tells us the strength and demand we have been building is continuing into next year and beyond. In the near term, pricing on bookings taken in the second quarter has continued to run considerably higher for each of the third and fourth quarters. And again, that's on top of record per diems last year. This strength has enabled us to take our yield guidance for the year by another 75 basis points. We expect to deliver consistent mid-single-digit per diem growth through the balance of the year which would mark 8 consecutive quarters that we are achieving mid-single-digit or higher per diem improvements.\nOur continued focus on optimizing our yield curve is not just a near-term benefit. We entered the second quarter with much less 2024 inventory to sell and have been able to lean even more into future periods. Accordingly, in the last 3 months, not only did we take more bookings for post-2024 sailings than we did for in-year sailings, we set yet another record for the most future bookings ever taken during the second quarter. The unprecedented level of demand for 2025 [indiscernible], coupled with flat capacity growth next year, translates into meaningful pricing power. And while it is still early for 2025, both price and occupancy are already ahead of where we were last year, leaving us in a position of strength with less inventory remaining for 2025. It also shows in our more than $8 billion of customer deposits, which shattered last year's record by $1.1 billion. You have heard me say this before. This is not pent-up demand, it is the compounding effect of building increased consideration in our cruise brands over time and improvement in our yield management techniques to translate that demand into higher ticket prices and it is further evidence of the strength of our consumer.\nEncouragingly, we're enjoying consistent growth in both repeat guests and new guests with each segment up 10% this quarter over last year. We also continue to actively manage our portfolio to further accelerate our underlying execution improvements. As previously announced, early next year, we will sunset the P&O Cruises Australia brand selling the 28-year-old Pacific Explorer and transferring P&O Australia's 2 remaining vessels to Carnival Cruise lines. Of course, we will still retain our leading presence in the Australian market, carrying over 60% of all Aussie cruisers. It is a great market for us, especially since the Australian summer coincides with the Northern Hemisphere winter, enabling our seasonal ships to capitalize on 2 summer periods. And now we get to optimize our presence in this market by consolidating into Carnival Cruise Line. Not only will we gain operational, administrative and back-office scale, we will ultimately have greater deployment flexibility compared to a dedicated Australian brand.\nAt the same time, this move will further boost capacity for our highest returning brand, bringing the total to 9 new ships joining Carniable Cruise Line fleet since 2019, including the successful shift of 3 vessels from Costa Cruises. These actions, combined with the 2 XL class ships scheduled for delivery in 2027 and 2028 will grow Carnival Cruise Lines capacity by about 50% over 2019. By 2028, the Carnival brand will represent 37% of our portfolio, up from 29% as we continue to reshape our portfolio to maximize ROIC. Of course, our amazing destination experience, celebration key purpose built for Carnival Cruise Line will soon support that growth and bolster returns to incremental revenue uplift coupled with improved fuel efficiency given its strategic location. We're introducing voyages the celebration key beginning in the second half of 2025 and ramp up to 18 ships calling Celebration Key in 2026. This quarter, we also delivered Queen [indiscernible], Cunard's fourth Queen with an amazing naming celebration in Liverpool, England Cunard's birthplace. The streets of Liverpool were wall with tens of thousands of people joining the festivities as the city of Liverpool became the ships official godparents. It was a historic moment and the first time an entire city ever [indiscernible].\nThe event generated overwhelming coverage and as intended, broke booking records on the back of it. The new Queen is a step forward in every way for Cunard, while still retaining the DNA of British elegance and refinery that the brand is known for. We enjoyed another high-profile naming event for [indiscernible] Princess in Barcelona with Godmother Hanna Waddington of [indiscernible]. [indiscernible] Princess has had great media coverage leading up to and following the naming ceremony with particular focus on its expansive specialty dining and beverage offerings and one-of-a-kind Magic Castle experience. [indiscernible] Princess, the first of its class has also been a big hit with guests as evidenced by outsized yields and high guest satisfaction scores.\nLast but not least, we held a naming event for Carnival [indiscernible] in Long Beach, California, home for Carnival second ship featuring fun Italian style with Godfather, Jonathan Bennett, [indiscernible] Broadway [indiscernible] starring and [indiscernible]. Welcoming fun Italian style to the West Coast generated nearly 2.5 billion media impressions to date, and of course, triggered a step up in bookings. While these amazing new ships all contributed to the strong yield improvement we generated in the second quarter, even excluding them, yields on our existing fleet were up double digits demonstrating fundamental strength on a same ship basis. In addition, we completed the rollout of Starlink this quarter, another revenue uplift opportunity and a real game changer for our onboard connectivity experience, enabling us to deliver the same high-speed WiFi service available on land throughout our fleet.\nNot only does this technology provide our guests with more flexibility to stay connected. It enables our crew to stay in touch with friends and loved ones, and it enhances our onboard operational systems, a win-win-win. Also, our consistent track record, our book position, our focus on commercial activity improvement, our portfolio management and the yet to be realized future benefits will receive from our Celebration key destination development, build increased confidence in achieving the low to mid-single-digit yield growth set out in our long-term targets. In fact, based on our upwardly revised guidance, we will be, on average, 2/3 of the way to achieving our [indiscernible] targets. [indiscernible] per ALBD of $69, 12% ROIC and a 20% reduction in carbon intensity after just 1 year with 2 years remaining it gives us even greater confidence in achieving our targets.\nAt the same time, we continue to aggressively manage down debt and interest expense while reducing the complexity of our capital structure which David will elaborate on. The number of actions we've taken to improve our balance sheet this quarter puts us further down the path on our return to investment-grade credit ratings over time. It's hard to believe in just over a month, it will have been 2 years since I had the privilege of stepping into the role of CEO. I am very proud of all we've accomplished in such a short time. Credit for our achievements go to our global team, 160,000 strong. Everyone has worked very hard to deliver yet another strong quarter, solidifying an amazing 2024 and setting us up well to top it in 2025. Equally important, they've all had a hand in delivering amazing vacation experiences and unforgettable happiness to 3 million guests yet again this quarter. [indiscernible] to our amazing team, thank you. And of course, we couldn't do it without the support from our amazing travel agent partners and so many other stakeholders. Thanks to all of you. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2024 second quarter results. Next, I'll provide the highlights of our third quarter June guidance and some color on our improved full year guidance. Then I'll finish up with an update on our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. Let's turn to the summary of our second quarter results. Our bottom line exceeded March guidance by nearly $170 million as we outperformed once again. The outperformance was essentially driven by 3 things: first, favorability in revenue worth almost $65 million as yields came in up over 12% compared to the prior year. This was more than 1.5 points better than March guidance, driven by closer strength in ticket prices as well as onboard spending. Second, cruise cost without fuel per available lower birthday or ALBD, came in flat compared to the prior year and were 3 points better than March guidance which was worth over $85 million. Some cost savings were identified during the quarter, which flowed through as improvement to our full year June guidance. However, most of the favorability in cruise cost for the second quarter was due to the timing of expenses between the quarters.\nAnd third, Other operational improvement slightly offset by higher fuel prices and currency were worth $20 million. Per diems for the second quarter improved 6% versus the prior year driven on both sides of the Atlantic by considerably higher ticket prices and improved onboard spending. At the same time, our European brands on their path back to historical occupancy saw outside growth in their occupancy of over 10 percentage points as compared to the second quarter of 2023. Our second quarter was fantastic across the board with strong demand, delivering record revenues, record yields, record prelims and record operating income. Now one thing to highlight about our third quarter June guidance. The positive trends we saw in the second quarter are expected to continue in the third. Yield guidance for the third quarter is set at a strong 8%. The difference between the yield guidance for the third quarter and the second quarter yield improvement of over 12% is simply the result of the greater occupancy opportunity we had in the second quarter 2024 as we began sailing within our historical occupancy range in the second half of 2023.\nIt is great to see that we anticipate continued strong premium growth in the third quarter, which we are forecasting will drive the majority of the 8% yield improvement. Turning to our improved full year June guidance. June guidance for net income is $1.55 billion, an improvement over our March guidance of approximately $275 million. This improvement was driven by 3 things: first, [indiscernible] increase in yields to approximately 10.25% based on the considerably higher prices we have been seeing in booking trends so far this year and the continued strength in demand we anticipate going forward. All of this is expected to drive an increase in net revenue of about $190 million.\nSecond, as I previously mentioned, we identified cost savings that we flow through to our full year June guidance. However, they will be partially offset by higher variable compensation driven by our forecast for improved operating income. Net we are flowing through $25 million of cost savings for the full year. And third, an improvement in net interest expense of $60 million, driven by our second quarter refinancing, repricing and debt prepayment activities. The strong 10.25% improvement in 2024 yields is a result of the increase in all the component parts, higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending and higher occupancy at historical levels with all 3 components improving on both sides of the Atlantic. We recognize that even within our industry-leading cost structure, -- there will always be cost opportunities, which we can focus on and harvest over time. While we identify cost savings opportunities during the second quarter, we will not stop there. We will continue our endless quest for greater efficiency in our cost structure. I will finish up with a summary of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts.\nDuring the second quarter, we generated cash from operations of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.3 billion. We took delivery of 1 spectacular new [indiscernible] and drew on her associated export credit facility, continuing our strategy to finance our new build program at preferential interest rates. Our efforts to proactively manage our debt profile continued throughout the quarter. We prepaid $1.6 billion of secured term loan facilities. We also repriced approximately $2.75 billion of the same secured term loan facilities. And we issued $535 million of unsecured notes due 2030, refinancing our unsecured notes due 2026, extending those maturities and reducing interest expense. These transactions simplified our capital structure reduced net interest expense in the second quarter by $10 million will reduce net interest expense for 2024 by $55 million and $85 million on an annualized basis.\nOur decision to prepay $1.6 billion of debt during the second quarter was based on our strong liquidity, our improved financial performance and our optimism about the future. We will continue to look for more opportunistic refinancings over time. Our leverage metrics will continue to improve around 2024 as our EBITDA continues to grow and our debt levels improve. Using our June guidance EBITDA of $5.83 billion, we expect a 2-turn improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA leverage compared to year-end 2023, approaching 4.5x and positioning us 2/3 of the way down the path to invest in grade metrics.\nLooking forward, we expect substantial free cash flow, driven by our ongoing operational execution and the lowest new build order book in decades to deliver continued improvements in our leverage metrics and balance sheet, moving us further down the road to rebuilding our financial fortress while continuing the process of transferring value from debt holders back to shareholders. Now operator, let's open the call for questions."

This is Beth Roberts, SVP Investor Relations, Carnival Corporation plc. Welcome to our first quarter 2024 earnings conference call.

Please visit our corporate website where our earnings press release and investor presentation can be found.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua Ian Weinstein\n\nPresident, CEO, Chief Climate Officer & Director\n\nThank you, Beth. Before we begin, I would like to express my support and heartfelt sympathy for all those impacted by yesterday's event at the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore and extend our appreciation to the [ CoStar ] and all first responders. The city and the Port of Baltimore have been our longtime partners and a home to many loyal guests, as well as business and community colleagues. We proudly sail year-round out of Baltimore through one of our Carnival Cruise Line ships which was scheduled to return this weekend. Fortunately, our team has quickly secured a temporary home board in [ Norfolk ] for as long as needed, which should help to minimize operational changes. So we look forward to getting back to our home in Baltimore as soon as possible.\nNow given that this happened just yesterday and the situation is fluid, we did not build this into our earnings materials or full year guidance. However, we did provide a current perspective that we expect the situation to have less than a $10 million impact on a full year taxes. With that, I'll turn to our prepared remarks, which address the accomplishments included in our strong results and outlook.\nThe first quarter has been fantastic across the board and yet another set of records. We delivered record -- record bookings and record customer deposits again this quarter, a great start to the year. I want to acknowledge our global team right off the bat. Everyone has worked very hard to deliver another strong quarter and a very strong win. In fact, we outperformed our first quarter guidance on every measure, yields, cruise cost, ex-fuel and EBITDA, enabling us to take our expectations up for the full year.\nYields increased over 17% year-over-year, another and more than double the increase in unit costs. This was driven not only by closing the occupancy gap but also through solid mid-single-digit price increases. Customer deposits [indiscernible] last year's record by another $1.3 billion, contributing to our strong cash flow and enabling us to prepay another $1.8 million of debt already this year which is on top of the $4 billion we prepay last year. This is meaningful progress on our return to investment-grade credit.\nMost important we achieved all-time high booking volumes at considerably higher prices. In fact, our North American and European brands, both set booking records in the first quarter with pricing strong across all core deployments and across all quarters.\nPrices ran up double digits on limited inventory left for Q2. They ran considerably higher for our peak summer period in Q3, and they were also considerably higher for Q4, while still building on our occupancy advantage. Our record book position and activity did not just happen and it is not the result of pent-up demand for repeat guests built up during the [ pause ], which is now years in the rearview mirror. It is because we have been created [ broader ] consideration and broad-based demand for cruise travel in all of our source markets across our well-balanced portfolio. And as a result, we are capturing more new guests than ever before, which coupled with our growing base of repeat guests delivers greater overall demand. Our brands are delivering sustainable revenue growth that hit the bottom line.\nAt the same time, our brands are continuing to pull the booking curve forward in line with our yield management strategy to base load bookings and ultimately support higher local pricing over the course of the booking curve. As you know, before even entering the year, we already have the best book position on record with less 2024 inventories in [indiscernible] for sale after absorbing double-digit guest growth, half of which was from closing the occupancy gap and half from higher shipping capacity. Those efforts have enabled us to maintain price integrity on the remaining [ '24 ] inventory and sets us up nicely to deliver a nearly double-digit improvement in yields this year.\nThis also allowed us to focus more of our efforts through [ wave ] on further out bookings, helping to make the foundation for an early build in 2025. It is remarkable that we are even better positioned now for 2025 than we were last year at this time, heading into what is shaping up to be a phenomenal 2024.\nTo aid in that effort, we have been rolling out enhancements [indiscernible], our [ zeal ] management tool designed to facilitate an even more optimal booking curve and which will continue to pay dividends well due to the future. Of course, we have more in the pipeline to sustain our momentum and capitalize on this untapped revenue opportunity.\nFirst, we have 3 fantastic new ships driving increased consideration and demand to their respective brands. Carnival Jubilee, Carnival Cruise Line third [ EXL ] class ship was recently [indiscernible] by Gwen Stefani at our [indiscernible] home port in Galveston, Texas. Sun Princess was recently delivered the first of its class in a real game changer for Princess and soon to be delivered as [ Queen Air ], a new flagship for [indiscernible] and its first new ship in 14 years. Of course, as you heard me say before, we do not need new shifts to increase yield as we continue to position our brands to drive demand in excess of supply and address the reasonable value gap to land-based alternatives.\nWe are also continuing to invest in the existing fleet with AIDA Evolution, the largest modernization program in that brand's history. The planned enhancements to the guest experience are designed to deliver a meaningful revenue uplift across the brand, while further reducing its [indiscernible] footprint and bolster the performance of one of our highest returning brands and speaking of brands that truly outperform. We are also continuing to strategically invest in growth for Carnival [indiscernible]. Celebration Key, our exclusive destination, purpose-built for that brand's target guest is really starting to capture the imagination as they launched a new marketing campaign right in the heart of wave season. Although early days, Celebration Key has already delivered initial halo for bookings in the second half of 2025 across 18 Carnival Cruise Line ships a party from 10 home ports.\nWe also announced the second phase of development for Celebration Keys for the peer extension that convert 2 additional ships in future years, further leveraging will be a best-in-class asset for us. We expect ticket revenue uplift from this incredible destination as the guest experience delivers unmatched funds as well as incremental in core spending. And this will be coupled with cost benefits driven by considerable fuel savings as it will be the closest destination of our 7 owned and operated ports in the [ grid ]. This destination is designed to support the continued growth plan for Carnival Cruise Line including the 2 recently announced additions to its highly successful [indiscernible] class for delivery in 2027 and 2028.\nAll of these investments demonstrate our disciplined capital allocation strategy. We continue to prioritize our investments towards our highest returning brands and biggest opportunities. This includes investments to reduce our carbon footprint which will not only have a measurable impact on the environment, but also improve our bottom line. Our strategic investment in advertising can also take dividends, driving demand across our portfolio with several new campaigns launched during wave. In fact, our [ wave ] business are up for a very strong 2023, with increases in both natural search and paid search. We increased our [indiscernible] efforts around our strategic foothold in last -- Alaska has long [indiscernible] the lifeblood for both Princess and Holland America, and they have launched new campaigns to build even greater awareness for our unmatched land key experiences.\nThis initiative isn't just U.S.-based. We have stepped up our marketing efforts across Europe with new campaigns for all our major European brands. i.e., the new campaign experience yourself differently, launched in Germany to [indiscernible] reduce. P&O Cruises new campaign, holiday like never before, really at home with its British best base and Costa's newly released campaigns, focusing on moments where guests are left speechless, has been met with much success in its core markets of Italy, France and Spain. These campaigns have contributed to the continued strength of our European brands, which has been a meaningful driver of our [indiscernible] outlook. It is particularly rewarding to see our European brands flexing their muscles across their core European deployments. It is a real testament to the strength of our portfolio. The outperformance we've experienced this quarter has been a continuation of the strong demand in experiencing for all our core plans. The Caribbean, Alaska and Europe have all over 1 point of incremental yield improvement. This more than offset the impact of the resi rerouting as well as changes in the price of fuel and currency exchange rates since our last update.\nIt has also able us to raise our full year guidance for EBITDA and net income. Our improving operational performance, coupled with excess liquidity and the lowest order book in decades leaves us well positioned to continue to opportunistically manage down debt and interest expense while reducing the complexity of our capital structure. This is very much aligned with our return to investment-grade credit over time. And our treasury team has been quick to capitalize on this trajectory with an ongoing stream of well-executed transactions to strengthen our balance sheet.\nWith the vast majority of this year's business outlook, we have even more conviction in delivering record revenues and EBITDA along with a step change improvement in operating performance lasting well beyond 2024. While we continue to optimize yield on the limited inventory, we have remaining and still manage down costs we have been turning more of our attention to delivering an even stronger in 2025. We're gaining traction on improvement across the commercial space along our path of continued margin enhancement and increased returns.\nAgain, I would like to thank our team members, ship and shore, the best in all the travel [indiscernible] for delivering unforgettable happiness to another 3 million guests this past quarter by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations. Of course, we couldn't do it without the support from our travel agent partners and so many other stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2024 first quarter results. Next, I will provide a couple of highlights about our second quarter and some color on our improved full year March guidance. Then I'll finish up with an update on our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. Let's turn to the summary of our first quarter results. Our.\nBottom line exceeded December guidance by $100 million as we outperformed once again. The improvement was essentially driven by 2 things: payability in revenue from higher ticket prices and yields were up over 17%, nearly 0.75-point better than December guidance worth almost $30 million while cruise costs without fuel per available lower berth day or ALBD, came in over 2 points better than December guidance due to the timing of expenses between the quarters which was worth over $50 million.\nPer diems improved 5% with improvements on both sides of the Atlantic, driven by considerably higher ticket prices. At the same time, we saw outsized growth in occupancy of nearly 20 percentage points at our European brands on their path back to historical occupancy. Our North American brands occupancy decreased strong mid-single digits. The difference in occupancy growth on the 2 sides of the Atlantic resulted in a sizable mix impact on our consolidated onboard revenue per diem since as we have discussed in the past, our North American brand customers naturally spend more on board than their European counterparts.\nHowever, the underlying fact is that we saw an increase in onboard revenue per diems on both sides of the Atlantic, driven in part by the acceleration strong pre-crude sales growth. In fact, we saw a continuation of strong consumer behavior by guest onboarders trips, much like our booking trends this past quarter.\nAs Josh indicated, first quarter was fantastic across the board with strong demand for our brands delivering record revenues, record yields and record per diems. Before I discuss our second quarter and full year guidance, I would like to add that given the timing of yesterday's event in Baltimore that Josh mentioned, our guidance does not include the current estimated impact of up to $10 million for the full year 2024 from the temporary change in home port.\nNow a couple of things to highlight about our second quarter March guidance. The positive trends we saw in the first quarter are expected to continue in the second. Yield guidance for the second quarter as [ said ] a strong 10.5%. The difference between the yield guidance for the second quarter and the first quarter yield improvement of over 17% is simply the result of the greater opportunity we had in occupancy in the first quarter 2024. With the improving trends we experienced during the first half of last year, 2023 second quarter occupancy was already 7 percentage points higher than the first quarter.\nIn addition, I did want to point out that nearly 3/4 of the full year impact from the Red Sea rerouting is expected to occur in the second quarter with the remainder expected in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to our improved full year March guidance. We are now forecasting a capacity increase of 4.5% compared to 2023. March guidance for net income of $1.28 billion is an $80 million improvement over our December guidance. The improvement was driven by 2 things: more than 1 point increase in yields to approximately 9.5% based on the considerably higher prices we have seen in booking trends so far this year; and the continued strength and demand we anticipate going forward worth about $200 million.\nIn addition, we are forecasting a collective improvement in all our cost lines, excluding fuel of over $50 million, including an improvement in cruise costs without [ fuel ]. This improvement of over $250 million is partially offset by the Red Sea rerouting impact of $130 million and the net impact from higher fuel price and currency of almost $45 million. The strong 9.5% improvement in 2024 yields is a result of an increase in all the component parts, higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending and higher occupancy at historical levels with all component parts improving on both sides of the Atlantic.\nI did want to point out that cruise costs, excluding fuel, is expected to be better than December guidance due in part to cost savings related to Red Sea rerouting as certain ships repositioned without guests as well as other efficiencies we identified that are included in our March guidance. While absolute costs are lower, the change in cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day of 0.5 point from December to March guidance is simply the math of spreading all costs over the lower ALBDs resulting from the Red Sea rerouting as certain ships reposition without guests.\nWe recognize that even within our industry-leading cost structure there are opportunities which we can focus on and harvest over time. A great example is our Maritime Asset Strategy Transformation System or what we refer to internally as MASTS. As previously mentioned, MASTS is a centralized system developed to optimize the management of equipment and machinery across all brands and all our ships. As we continue to roll out MASTS it will allow us to leverage spare parts more effectively across the entire fleet and optimize our maintenance schedules and practices, all of which will strengthen our efficiency and reduce costs from unplanned maintenance over time.\nI will finish up with a summary of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts. During the first quarter, we generated cash from operations of $1.8 billion and free cash flow of $1.4 billion. We took delivery of 2 spectacular new ships and utilized 2 export credit facilities, continuing our strategy to finance our new build program at preferential interest rates. Also during the quarter, we successfully extended the maturity of our forward starting revolving credit facility by 2 years to August 2027 and upsized the borrowing capacity by $400 million bringing the total commitment to $2.5 billion.\nWe will continue to look for opportunities to upsize the facility through its accordion feature that allows us to add new banks and grow the commitment. Our efforts to proactively manage our debt profile continue throughout the quarter between open market repurchases early in the quarter and then our call of the remaining 9.9% second priority secured notes, we redeemed over $600 million of debt, removing the secured second lien layer from our capital structure.\nIn addition to our second lien notes, we were able to repurchase almost $400 million of debt at a discount adding power to our deleveraging efforts. We expect to continue our open market repurchase program on an opportunistic basis.\nWe will continue to call some of our existing debt. In fact, yesterday, we prepaid our EUR 837 million term loan due in 2025, removing higher-than-average interest rate debt and another secured instrument from our capital structure. This further demonstrates our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet.\nOur leverage metrics will continue to improve throughout 2024 as our EBITDA continues to grow, and our debt levels improve. Using our March guidance EBITDA of $5.63 billion, we expect a 2 turn improvement in net debt-to-EBITDA leverage positioning us more than halfway down the path to investment-grade metrics.\nIn summary, continued execution coupled with strengthening demand for our brands is driving increased confidence in our ongoing performance. We are pleased this has been recognized by S&P and Moody's with their recent upgrades as well as by our banking partners with a recent upsizing and 2-year extension of our revolving credit facility.\nLooking forward over the next several years, substantial free cash flow will significantly reduce our leverage, moving us further down the road to rebuilding our financial fortress while continuing the process of transferring value from debt holders back to shareholders.\nNow operator, let's open the call for questions."

This is Beth Roberts, SVP Investor Relations. Welcome to our Fourth Quarter 2023 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by CEO, Josh Weinstein, our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Chair, Micky Arison.\nBefore we begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. All references to ticket prices, net per diem, net yields and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.\nReferences to per diems and yields will be on a net basis. Our comments now also reference cruise costs without fuel, EBITDA, net income, net loss, earnings per share, free cash flow and ROIC all of which will be on an adjusted basis, unless otherwise stated.\nAll these references are non-GAAP financial measures defined in our earnings press release. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and other associated disclosures are also contained in our earnings press release and in our investor presentation. Please visit our corporate website where our earnings press release and investor presentation can be found.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to Josh.\n\nJoshua Ian Weinstein\n\nPresident, CEO, Chief Climate Officer & Director\n\nThank you, Beth. It's safe to say we ended the year on a high note and closed another quarter with record revenues, record booking levels and record customer deposits. In fact, we consistently set records in all 4 quarters this past year. We also achieved per diem EBITDA and net income for the fourth quarter that all exceeded the high end of our September guidance range with cruise cost ex fuel in line with expectations.\nFourth quarter yields continued on a positive trajectory. Significantly higher than a very strong 2019 and even higher than we had anticipated and enabled us to overcome 4 years of high cost inflation to deliver per unit EBITDA that eclipsed 2019 holding fuel and currency constant.\nIt was encouraged to see both North American and European brand occupancy levels exceed 101% in the fourth quarter. with per diems for our North American brands up double digits over 2019, and our European brands just shy of a double-digit increase. We delivered for deal improvements of more than 7 points for the full year with even stronger acceleration in Q4 and while closing the double-digit occupancy gap at the start of the year to reach historical levels for the second half of 2023. An absolute spending on board was consistent across all 4 quarters as we drove improvement in ticket prices.\nWe delivered $85 million more to the bottom line in the fourth quarter than forecasted, which pushed us through to positive adjusted income for the year. Strong EBITDA and cash from operations also propelled us on our journey to reduce the debt load necessitated during the post operations.\nWe made debt payments of $6 billion this year alone. And we still have well over $5 billion of liquidity, on top of strong and improving cash flow, which will contribute to further debt reduction over time.\nAll of this leaves us firmly placed on our path back to achieve investment grade leverage metrics by 2026. And most importantly, our brands delivered happiness to over 12 million guests this year. Laying the foundation upon which all of our SeaChange margins are built.\nTurning to bookings. We reached an all-time high in booking volumes for the 2 weeks around Black Friday and Cyber Monday and ended the year in the best booked position we have ever seen on both price and occupancies setting 2024 off to an amazing start. We now have nearly 2/3 of the business on the books for 2024 and at considerably higher prices.\nAnd during the fourth quarter, we essentially maintained the significant occupancy advantage we have built for 2024 going into the quarter, while improving year-over-year price position of our booked business even further. At this point, much of the first half is already behind us, with approximately 85% of the business on the books, we've essentially closed with double-digit occupancy gap to historical levels on higher capacity and at higher prices.\nFor our peak summer period, all major products are better booked at higher prices benefiting from improving trends in both occupancy and price during the fourth quarter.\nOur yield management strategy, the baseload bookings has clearly set us up for another record year. And again, we have seen no sign of our business slowing. The book position for our North American brands remains as far out as we have ever seen and well ahead of last year at pricing that is considerably higher.\nOur European brands just delivered record fourth quarter booking volume at considerably higher prices and with a booking window now fully back to historical norms. As expected, our European brands are poised to become an even greater contributor to our 2024 operating improvement.\nAt the same time, we are continuing to pull forward onboard revenue through bundling and pre cruise sales. This strategy, coupled with even more features onboard our newer shifts for our guests to enjoy positions us well for further onboard revenue growth next year.\nVolatile we expect occupancy for the full year to return to historical levels on 5% higher capacity while delivering nicely higher per dam building on this year's record results. In 2023, we captured over 3.5 million new-to-cruise guests and remain well positioned to continue to take share from land-based alternatives. In other words, we are gaining momentum in our ability to close the unwarranted value gap to land-based alternatives. And to aid in that effort, we can further chances of the fact that while many land-based alternatives have pulled back on service levels. We still deliver incredible service to our guests, thanks to our amazing crew. This pairs exceedingly well with the expansive amount of guest-pleasing amenities offered on board our newer fleet.\nIn fact, while almost 4 years have passed since the pause in our operations. Our fleet actually came out of the fog a year younger through our fleet optimization efforts. This past year alone, we benefited from 3 fantastic new ships. Including Carnival Celebration and P&O Cruises, Arbian, both of which are flagships for their respective brands yet leverage our scale as the 7 and 8 vessels in our popular and exceptionally efficient series of XL class ships, and we welcome seaborne Pursuit, our second expedition ship. Seaborne has truly raised the bar for expedition cruising in extreme luxury.\nAnd while not technically new, Carnival Cruise Line also welcome Carnival Venecia into its fun Italian-style platform via the transfer from Costa and it has been going gangbusters. It's the biggest example yet of how we leverage our scale and we'll be doubling down when we bring over her sister ship Carnival Forenza in 2024.\nLooking forward, this year is set to match the excitement level with the introduction of Carnival Jubilee a new icon for Carnival Cruise Line and which no doubt will be the pride of Texas as she has her inaugural home in Galveston. The innovative sub-princess the first of its class and a real game changer for Princess. And Queenan, a new flagship for Cunard and its first new ship in 14 years. With all of these additions, roughly 30% of our capacity will be newly delivered ships.\nWe also made meaningful headway on other strategic asset projects. We began construction on celebration e which will be the largest and closest exclusive destination in our destination portfolio and a real game changer for Carnival Cruise Line. We'll bring 18 Carnival ships departing from 9 home ports to Celebration Key. And while we are still about 1.5 years from go-live, we are already ramping up the awareness and the excitement around this fantastic destination.\nWe've also started the process for a significant upside in guest traffic at Half Moon Cay our exclusive and beautiful pristine island destination in the Bahamas with the creation of a pure side berth that can accommodate even our largest vessels. We've begun work with our Grand Bahamas shipyard partners, on the construction of 2 floating dry docks, one of which will have the largest lifting capacity in the World. This will result in significant benefit in the future as we reduce travel time, preserve revenue days, and, at the same time, reduce our fuel consumption.\nAs you know, we've also been investing more in advertising over the last 18 months, and it has definitely paid off with elevated awareness and consideration for our brand and record booking levels and revenue results.\nIn fiscal 2023, our web visits were up over 35%. Our paid search was up roughly 50% and our natural search was up almost 75%, all many, many multiples of our 5% capacity growth.\nIn the fourth quarter, we carried more new-to-cruise, and more new-to-brand guests than we did in the fourth quarter of 2019. Given our success on generating demand at this point in time, we plan to maintain a similar level of advertising on a unit basis in 2024 compared to 2023, optimizing around each brand. This will help us continue to build demand and bookings well outside of the current year.\nWe're working aggressively to keep our strong momentum going through waves and beyond. Just to list a few examples, Costa recently launched spectacular new campaign in its core markets, focusing on moments, where guests are less species. Poland America launched a sequel to its highly successful time of your life campaign and AIDA just kicked off its new campaign experience yourself differently in conjunction with the holiday Carnival will launch a new marketing campaign highlighting celebration key in time for P&O Cruises new campaign, holiday like never before, launches Christmas Day in the U.K. and Cunard has planned to welcome fit for our Queen introduce Queenan early next year, which is short to capture huge fanfare. We've been talking about upping our game across the commercial space and we've made good progress. Of course, we're not done. And as you'd expect, we never will as there is always room to improve.\nThere's much more to come as we roll out advancements to our yield management tools and lead generation techniques continue to invest in sales and sales support and build on already strong relationships with our trade partners.\nTurning to costs. As we previously indicated, unit cruise cost ex fuel for 2024 are expected to be higher than inflation due to the impact of closing the occupancy gap and the higher volume from dry dock [indiscernible] . David will walk you through in more detail.\nWith that said, we have been working aggressively to mitigate inflation through our cost optimization initiatives, including leveraging our scale. In some cases, we're investing today for future benefits. Just to cite a couple of examples of initiatives underway, we're essentially complete with the rollout of Starlink across the fleet. This will produce more than a 20% reduction in cost per megabit in 2024 and significantly increased our bandwidth pipeline, resulting in both better guest experience and higher onboard revenues, a clear win-win. And with our new vendor-neutral platform, we are positioned to quickly capture cost savings in future years.\nWe've also launched our maritime asset strategy transformation for what we refer to internally as MAS. MAS is a centralized system developed to optimize the management of equipment and machinery across all brands and all of our ships. MAS will allow us to leverage spare parts more effectively across the entire fleet and optimize our maintenance schedules and practices, all of which will strengthen our efficiency and reduce unplanned maintenance over time.\nWhile we won't see the P&L benefits from MAS this year as we ramp up implementation in 2024, we expect a multiyear benefit well in excess of $100 million that really begins to ramp up in 2026. All of the efforts we're making to drive revenue and manage costs are expected to lead to a 4-point margin improvement in 2024.\nWe're guiding to record EBITDA of over $5.5 billion which is 30% higher than 2023. Thanks to a strong second half of 2023, we're already tracking ahead of our plan to achieve fee change, our 3-year financial targets calling for the highest ROIC and EBITDA for ALBD in nearly 2 decades, and our 2024 guidance delivers another step change toward these deliverables. EBITDA for birthday is expected to be up by more than 25% over our target starting point, hence, more than halfway to the 50% increase expected in our SeaChange targets.\nToday's guidance will also deliver 9% ROIC, a 4-point increase from the starting point of our target. This leaves just 1.5 point annual increases in 2025 and 2026, to hit our 12% target. Not surprisingly, our brand dedicated to a single market, Carnival, AIDA and P&O Cruises in the U.K. are again leading the charge with the highest ROIC levels in the company.\nAnd with regard to our greenhouse gas target included in our 2026 echange program, our GHG intensity in 2024 is expected to be just shy of the 20% reduction from 2019 or targeted. It is worth noting, this was a 2030 goal we had already pulled forward by 4 years. We have been and continue to work aggressively to reduce our environmental footprint and fuel costs at the same time. This deep commitment has not only resulted in industry-leading fuel efficiency, it has also resulted in lower absolute GHG emissions. Our absolute emissions are over 10% lower than the 2011 peak and that's despite capacity growth of 30% since then.\nLast year, we also exceeded our industry-leading shore power capability goals. We are ahead of the curve and now have twice as many ships capable of shore power than there are ports around the world available to plug in.\nAgain, I credit all of these important achievements to our people, ship and shore. Collectively, they continue to outperform, allowing us to make good headwind on our SeaChange target. We're poised for another step change in operating improvement this year with nearly 2/3 of the business on the books at considerable higher prices, ongoing momentum from improvements across the commercial space, the amazing vacation experiences we deliver day in, day out at way too good of a relative value to land-based alternatives and an even greater experience gap, all while growing onboard revenues and managing costs. All of this combined sets us up well to deliver another year of record revenues and record EBITDA.\nOur cash flow strength, coupled with excess liquidity, the return of credit card reserves in a few weeks and the lowest order book in decades will allow us to continue to actively manage down debt and aggressively reduce interest expense over time. To allow also for pellets, our path to deleveraging, investment-grade credit rating and higher ROIC. I remain confident in our continued execution with an unparalleled portfolio of best-in-class brands and amazing fleet that just keeps getting better and better, and our greatest assets are people.\nThis has been a truly remarkable year, and we've come a long way in an incredibly short amount of time. I would like to thank our team members, ship and shore the best in all of travel and leisure for delivering unforgettable happiness to over 12 million guests this year by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations. For honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch. And thank you for the strong support from our travel agent partners as well as our loyal guests, destination partners, investors and many other stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a summary of our 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. Next, I will provide a recap of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts during 2023. And finish off with some color on our 2024 full year and first quarter December guidance.\nOur fourth quarter bottom line exceeded the better end of our guidance range as we outperformed our September guidance. The $85 million improvement was driven by favorability in revenue from higher ticket prices as net per diems were up over 10%, and Three points better than the midpoint of our September guidance range. In fact, fourth quarter revenues of $5.4 billion were a fourth quarter record and net yields were up nearly 8% as compared to 2019, a great way to close out the year and another indication that we do not see a slowdown in our consumers.\nFor the full year, thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team members, ship and shore, we closed the books on 2023 with positive adjusted net income. That is a party from our March guidance as we delivered over $550 million to the bottom line, which was partially offset by a drag of fuel price and currency exchange rates of over $100 million.\nThe improvement was driven by delivering a 7.5% increase in net revenue per diem versus 2019, which was over double the 3.5% midpoint of our March guidance while closing the double-digit occupancy gap at the start of the year to reach historical occupancy levels.\nAbsolute spending per diems on board were consistent across all 4 quarters as we drove improvements in ticket prices on both sides of the Atlantic and ended the year with net yields of nearly 1% over 2019.\nNext, I will provide a recap of our refinancing and deleveraging efforts during 2023. As Josh indicated, our full year 2023 strong EBITDA of $4.2 billion and strong cash from operations of $4.3 billion, propelled us on our journey to pay down debt and reduced the debt effort necessitated by the pause in guest cruise operations.\nDuring 2023, we made debt payments of $6 million and ended the year with just over $30 billion of debt which is $3 billion better than we forecasted just 9 months ago during our March conference call and almost $5 billion of the first quarter peak, transferring enterprise value from debt holders to shareholders.\nDuring 2023, we proactively addressed our debt profile as we successfully started our refinancing and deleveraging program. We accelerated our debt repayment efforts and aggressively manage down our interest expense.\nIn 2023, we effectively stretched out a 2025 maturity on favorable terms by replacing it with a $1.3 billion term loan B facility to 2027 and a $500 million offering of senior secured notes in 2029. This refinancing, along with our optimism about our future and the return of customer deposit reserves gave us the confidence to accelerate our debt repayment by calling $1.2 billion of our highest cost debt.\nIn addition, we opportunistically prepaid $2.8 billion of additional debt for a total of $4 billion of debt repayments, including the $1.2 billion of debt cost.\nOur credit card processes returned to us $800 million of credit card reserves and we now expect an additional $800 million to be returned this current quarter, representing substantially all of the remaining credit card reserves at year-end.\nWe took actions in both 2022 and early in 2023 to increase the fixed rate percentage of our debt portfolio to over 80%, up significantly from our 58% fixed levels at the end of 2021, which provided us protection from rising interest rates.\nOur overall average interest rate is just over 5.5%. All these actions to address our debt profile alongside our improved business performance, drove $200 million of interest savings compared to our March guidance.\nOur maturity towers have been well managed in 2026 with just $2.1 billion of debt maturities next year, $2.2 billion in 2025 and $3.2 billion in 2026. And looking forward, we will continue to evaluate refinancing opportunities and opportunistically prepay additional debt. So in 2024, we will be replacing higher cost fixed rate debt with lower-cost export credit financing as we take delivery of ships during 2024.\nOur leverage metrics will also continue to improve throughout 2024 as our EBITDA continues to grow.\nNow turning to our 2024 full year December guidance. We are forecasting a capacity increase of about 5.5% compared to 2023. We are expecting to deliver strong 2024 net yield improvement with our guidance forecasting an increase of approximately 8.5% for the full year 2024 when compared to 2023. And that is on top of our improved 2023 results where we delivered a 7.5% increase in net revenue per diem versus 2019.\nThe strong improvement in 2024 net yields is a result of the increase in all the component parts, higher ticket prices, higher onboard spending and higher occupancy with all 3 components improving on both sides of the [indiscernible] .\nWe are well positioned to drive 2024 ticket pricing higher with significantly less inventory remaining to sell as the same time last year despite a capacity increase of over 5%. Occupancy for the full year 2024 is on track to return to historical levels.\nKeep in mind, 2019 was a high watermark occupancy. For 2024, we forecast to be well within our historical occupancy range as we balance pricing value to optimize total revenues and achieve record deals.\nNow turning to costs. cruise costs without fuel per available lower bird may or ALBD, is currently expected to be up approximately 4.5% for 2024 versus 2023.\nBroadly speaking, there are 4 main drivers of the cost change. First, our forecast is for decelerating inflation but nonetheless, inflation with an average 3.5% increase across all our cost categories globally. Second, with occupancy returning to historical levels, the impact on cost should be 1.5 to 2 percentage points higher in 2024 as compared to 2023. Third, in 2024, we are expecting 586 dry dock days, an increase of 14% versus 2023, which is expected to impact of overall year-over-year cost comparisons by about 3/4. And four, countering these headwinds, we expect these cost increases will be somewhat mitigated by a couple of points, given the economies of scale of our capacity growth which is enhanced by taking delivery of larger, more efficient ships, along with various other cost optimization initiatives.\nFuel consumption per ALBD is expected to decrease another 4%, and that is on top of the 15.5% reduction achieved from 2019 to 2023. And that impact of fuel price and currency is expected to favorably impact 2024 by $90 million with lower fuel pricing favorable by $94 million while the change currency exchange rates slightly goes the other way.\nAnd finally, a few things to note about the outsized increases in the first quarter 2024. A higher net yield guidance for first quarter 2024 of 16.5% versus the full year, 8.5% is driven by the larger improvement in first quarter occupancy.\nIt's not to get that we did not reach historical occupancy levels until the second half of 2023. So there is much more occupancy-driven net yield opportunity in the first half.\nOn the cost side, the higher cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day guidance for the first quarter of 2024 and 9.5% is driven by 4 main factors. First, the largest improvement in occupancy will occur in the first quarter. And while it drives greater yield increases in the first quarter, it also drives greater cost increases, which means a total of 3% to 4% cost drag in the quarter.\nSecond, while dry dock costs impact our full year guidance, the seasonality of dry dock costs in the first quarter 2020 as compared to the prior year drives a cost increase of about 1.5 points for this quarter.\nThird, the seasonality of advertising expense and a variety of other expenses between the quarters differs in 2024 as compared to 2023, which will put a total cost increase of approximately 3 points into this quarter. Advertising alone is 1 of the 3 points.\nAnd fourth, like the full year inflation mitigated by economies of scale from our capacity growth, along with various other cost optimization initiatives. Given the higher first quarter cruise costs without fuel for available lower berth day, the implied guidance for the cost in the second to the fourth quarter is approximately 3%.\nIn summary, putting all these factors together, our net income guidance for the full year 2024 is approximately $1.2 billion with EBITDA forecasted at $5.6 billion a significant improvement from 2023. For those of you who are modeling the EPS, let's not forget that when you calculate diluted EPS, you need to add back the $94 million of interest expense related to the company's convertible notes, our improved financial results and our successful refinancing and deleveraging efforts in 2023, along with our 2024 December guidance leaves us firmly placed on our path to achieve our 2026 SeaChange goal, moving us further down the road to rebuilding our financial fortress and delivering long-term shareholder value.\nAnd now, operator, let's open up the call for questions"

This is Josh Weinstein. Welcome to our third quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm joined today by our Chair, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts. Before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I will refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nAnother quarter and another set of milestones and records. This quarter, we reached net income well in excess of $1 billion and EBITDA well over $2 billion. We also achieved revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted net income that all exceeded the high end of our June guidance range with constant currency adjusted cruise costs in line with expectations.\nFurthermore, customer deposits and booking volumes, both important forward indicators, hit record levels for the third quarter. Thanks to the efforts of our amazing team, ship and shore, we exceeded the midpoint of our adjusted net income guidance by $175 million this quarter. The outperformance was driven by strength in demand for our brands, with both our North American and European segments equally outperforming expectations. The result was yields that were higher than anticipated that exceeded 2019's strong levels and that reached an all-time high.\nOn the European front, occupancy came in better than anticipated for Costa and AIDA, with both brands hitting 119% occupancy in August. Not to be outdone, P&O Cruises achieved its highest occupancy in over a decade, despite a 40% capacity increase from 2019. And as for pricing, our third quarter per diems were 5 points higher than 2019, also hitting record levels and more than overcoming the absence of St. Petersburg, which was among our highest-yielding itineraries and weighted to the third quarter.\nNormalizing for this impact, we estimate per diem growth would have been up about 7 points, which is consistent with each of the first 2 quarters and our upwardly revised fourth quarter guidance, which David will elaborate on. Essentially, we've consistently been delivering pricing well in excess of 2019 levels, while closing the occupancy gap by 11 points over the course of the year.\nContinued strength in demand has allowed us to take up our expectations for full year per diems by a full point. This is a meaningful accomplishment given how much of fiscal 2023 was already behind us. At the same time, we're working to stay within our narrowed cost guidance range while managing down interest expense as we accelerate our deleveraging plans.\nThe higher revenue alone more than offset the recent spike in fuel prices, which is currently forecasted to step up by 20% heading into our fourth quarter. I would note but while we've experienced volatility in fuel prices before, there's only been one other period in the last 15 years that our fuel price has reached this level. In this case, changes in fuel prices and FX rates combined are a $130 million drag compared to June guidance and masked much of our significant underlying business improvement that is delivering an additional $200 million plus to the bottom line for the second half of the year.\nAs a result, we still expect our 2023 adjusted EBITDA to be $4.1 billion or more, which is well within our prior guidance range, and we're raising our net income expectations for the year. As I've done in the past, to give you a sense of how we're faring operationally without noise from fuel price or currency rates and without the benefit of increased capacity, I'll share our EBITDA per ALBD progress holding fuel price and currency constant to 2019 levels.\nWe reached 59% of 2019 levels in the first quarter, 73% in the second quarter, 90% in the third quarter, which was better than the 85% we expected, and we're striving to hit 2019 levels in the fourth quarter. Of course, in reality, we're not ignoring the impact fuel is having on our business. In fact, it's been a focus for years. We continue to work aggressively to manage fuel costs the best way possible by consuming less.\nHeading into 2023, we already had the most fuel-efficient fleet of our public peers by a wide margin, and we're looking to widen that gap. We're on track to achieve a step change reduction in fuel usage and resulting carbon intensity in 2023 with fuel consumption per ALBD nearly 16% lower than 2019. The even better than the 15% we had anticipated. I know this is stating the obvious, but not only is this effort benefiting our bottom line by hundreds of millions of dollars, it's also better for the environment and something we'll keep pushing on for 2024 and beyond.\nSpeaking of 24, I'm still pleased with our revenue trajectory heading into next year. Our brands have been working aggressively to build a strong base of business as we position for further revenue yield improvement next year.\nWe're now significantly ahead of same time last year by about 10 points and well ahead of where we were in 2019. In fact, we already have less inventory remaining for sale at the same time last year, despite 5% more capacity and sailing with occupancy at historical levels. Our booked position is as far out as we've ever seen it. With our European brands booking curve now essentially back to 2019 levels and our North American brands exceeding historical highs. And importantly, we've been able to achieve this 10-point occupancy advantage at higher ticket prices for the same time last year.\nBy all accounts, it's a great start to 2024. While we see no signs of demand slowing for our brands, at some point, booking volumes for 2024 will recede as we simply run out of inventory to sell. Now we appreciate there are heightened concerns around the state of the consumer as of late. But the fact is we just haven't seen it in our bookings or our results, and we believe consumers are continuing to prioritize spending on experiences over material goods. And the vacation value we offer will continue to resonate with those seeking more for their vacation dollar.\nAs you know, we have been leaning into that message given the unprecedented and unwarranted value to land-based vacation alternatives. Further, our revenue base is recurring, with over half our guests being repeat cruisers, is visible with well over 50% of the next 12 months booked at any given time and is predictable with 40% of our onboard revenues now pulled forward by pre-cruise sales, which is an 11-point increase over 2019.\nHow is all this trending by region? Well, North America consistently remains strong with Carnival Cruise Line, our highest returning brand, continuing to outperform. Accordingly, and due to our portfolio optimization efforts, 2/3 of our capacity growth next year is weighted to Carnival Cruise Line. And while our European brands were on a delayed trajectory for reasons we've discussed at length, they are world-class brands in fantastic markets that we are dedicated to for the long term.\nSo it is incredibly gratifying to see them impressing so nicely and now keeping pace with the improving trends we've seen for our North America brand. In fact, in Q3, each of our Continental European brands, AIDA and Costa delivered higher yields than 2019, again overcoming the outsized [indiscernible] from the absence of [indiscernible] And finally, there's Australia. I am pleased to say that with the recent lifting of protocols in Australia, like the U.S., they too saw a spike in bookings in response to the great news. Our demand generation efforts are clearly working across all regions. As you can see in our results, our forward guidance, our book position and our booking trends. We are also seeing other positive forward indicators that suggest we're continuing to generate healthy demand.\nFirst-time cruisers reached 170% of prior year levels in the third quarter. In fact, we've taken well over 2.5 million guests on their very first crews so far this year. Web visits are running at 135% of 2019 levels. Paid search is at 150%, and natural search is at 185%. Suffice it to say, all are consistently running at multiples of our capacity growth. The effects of our myriad of commercial enhancement activities will compound over time. And our ongoing investments in advertising and lead generation should keep that funnel of demand building.\nWe're also creating excitement around our new ships and new destinations. This quarter, we welcomed our second ultra-luxury expedition ship Seabourn Pursuit. Pursuit marries the same yacht-like small ship experience Seabourn guests have come to expect with an unparalleled range of expedition activities and expert 24 person expedition team and unique features like custom-built submarines. We are looking forward to showing her off later today at her inaugural stop in Miami.\nAnd we are about to embark on a drumbeat of news around our new destination in Grand Bahama Celebration Key expected in the second half of 2025. Just yesterday, Carnival Cruise Line announced the opening of hundreds of sailings to Celebration Key ultimately across 18 different ships departing from 8 different home ports. You'll have to stay tuned for more details on this amazing destination and the fantastic experiences our guests can expect.\nBut what I can say today is that not only will Celebration Key deliver Carnival's patented brands of fund, its strategic location close to so many of our home ports is also designed to advance our fuel and carbon reduction efforts. It's truly a win-win-win for the environment, for our guests and for our great hosts, the people of the Bahamas.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We have been actively managing down our debt and reducing interest expense. With improving performance, positive cash flow and $5.7 billion of liquidity, we anticipate ending the year with debt just under $31 billion, already over $4 billion off the peak and counting. I'll take the opportunity to remind those naysayers that, as we stated 6 months ago, this debt reduction happened without issuing incremental equity.\nThat said, we recognize we still have a ways to go to reach investment-grade leverage metric in 2026. The strong demand we're seeing certainly builds confidence in our return to meaningful free cash flow generation and our reduced newbuild should amplify that opportunity. Once again, I attribute the outperformance this quarter to our greatest asset, our people. Our shipboard team members who are consistently exceeding our guests' expectations, our shoreside team that supports the ships, generate strong demand and attract new-to-cruise guests along with our travel agent partners, and of course, support from all of you, our investors, our loyal guests and our many other stakeholders.\nI think I can speak on behalf of all 160,000 team members when I say that it is a privilege to work at a company whose purpose and mission is to deliver unforgettable happiness to our guests by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch. It motivates us to do our jobs well and responsibly and will help us keep our strong momentum as we head into 2024.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. Before I begin, please note all of my references to ticket prices, net per diems, net yields and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2023 third quarter results, then I'll give some color on our 2023 full year September guidance. Next, I will provide a recap of our 2024 cumulative advanced book position, along with a few other things to consider for 2024. And then I will finish up describing our financial position.\nAs Josh indicated, our third quarter adjusted net income exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by $175 million as we outperformed our June guidance. The improvement was driven by 3 things. First, $90 million of favorability in revenue from higher ticket prices as net per diems were up almost 5%, nearly a point better than the midpoint of our June guidance range, while our brands outperformed on occupancy, achieving 109% for the quarter. In fact, Third quarter revenues of $6.9 billion were a record, and net yields were once again positive as compared to 2019.\nSecond, we had $40 million of favorability in net interest expense. A successful refinancing gave us the runway to core $1.2 billion of our highest cost debt, and we prepaid an additional $1.1 billion of debt, which reduced interest expense during the quarter. Additionally, we had $900 million of customer deposit reserves returned to the company during the quarter, generating additional interest income and higher overall interest income rate than forecasted also contributed to this favorability.\nAnd third, $45 million of favorability in fuel consumption, depreciation and income taxes drove this final piece. Next, I will give some color on our 2023 full year September guidance. For the full year 2023, we now expect the midpoint of our adjusted net loss guidance to be $100 million, an improvement of $75 million versus the midpoint of June guidance, despite the unfavorable net impact of higher fuel prices and currency costing $130 million in the fourth quarter.\nSo our full year September guidance includes over $200 million of actual and forecasted improvements driven by 2 things. First, over $150 million of higher revenue for the full year. On the pricing front, we now expect net per diems to be up approximately 7% for the full year 2023 compared to a strong 2019, which is 1 point higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance range. The fourth quarter is expected to build on our third quarter improvement. For the fourth quarter, we now expect net per diems to be up 7% to 8%, resulting in a net yield forecast up over 5%. The improvement in net per diems versus our previous guidance is driven by passenger ticket revenue on both sides of the Atlantic.\nWe do see a continuation of the strong onboard and other revenue trends we have been experiencing given the strength we are seeing in the consumer onboard our ships included in our previous guidance. The third quarter trends were very similar to the first half of 2023, and we are forecasting fourth quarter to be similar as well. And second, $80 million of favorability in net interest expense as the benefits of our deleveraging efforts will continue into the fourth quarter.\nFurthermore, we do expect adjusted cruise costs without fuel to be at the high end of our previous guidance range, but somewhat mitigated by the favorability in fuel consumption, depreciation and income tax expense. Turning to our 2024 cumulative advanced book position. The cumulative advanced book position for the full year 2024 is well above the high end of the historical range at higher prices than 2023 levels.\nThis aligns with the company's yield management strategy to baseload bookings, length in the booking curve and optimize net yields. And now a few things to consider for 2024. We are forecasting a capacity increase of 5% compared to 2023. We are expecting to deliver strong 2024 net yield improvement as compared to 2023 with occupancies forecasted to return to historical levels for the full year 2024. We are well positioned to drive 2024 pricing higher with less inventory remaining to sell than the same time last year, despite a capacity increase of 5%.\nWhile the occupancy opportunity will drive favorable revenue trends, let's also remember to model its impact on cost. For example, a 5 to 6 percentage point increase in occupancy could drive adjusted cruise costs without fuel up 1 to 2 percentage points in 2024 as compared to 2023. In addition, in 2024, we are expecting 580 dry dock days, an increase of 18% versus 2023, which will also impact our year-over-year cost comparisons.\nWe expect these cost increases and decelerating inflation but nevertheless, inflation will be somewhat mitigated by economies of scale from our capacity growth and various cost optimization initiatives. I will finish up describing our financial position. We are accelerating our debt repayment efforts and aggressively managing down our interest expense. In just 6 months, we reduced our debt balance by over 10% or nearly $4 billion of peak from the first quarter 2023.\nWe are in a path to end the year with less than $31 billion of debt, which is over $2.5 billion less than I forecasted 6 months ago during our March conference call. Our third quarter successful refinancing was priced at the lowest interest rate given to any cruise company in almost 2 years. This refinancing, which stretched out maturities along with our optimism about our future and the return of customer deposit reserves gave us the confidence to accelerate our debt repayment.\nOur maturity towers have been well managed through 2025 with just $2 billion of debt maturities next year and only $2.2 billion in 2025. In addition, because of our actions, our debt portfolio is 80% fixed and our average interest rate is approximately 5.5%. And looking forward, I expect substantial increases in adjusted free cash flow in 2024 and beyond through durable revenue growth to drive down our debt balance on our path back to investment grade.\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, let me remind you to visit our website for our third quarter earnings press release and presentation. Now operator, let's open up the call for questions."

This is Josh Weinstein. Welcome to our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'm joined today by our Chair, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts.\nBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I'll refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nThere are many milestones we've hit over the last 2 years, and this past quarter is no exception. In fact, there was much to celebrate in the second quarter. We reached a meaningful inflection point for revenue with net yield surpassing 2019 strong level. And on top of that, operating income, cash from operations and adjusted free cash flow were all positive.\nAdding to those achievements, we just hit all-time highs for bookings and customer deposits. And remarkably, we are still experiencing a phenomenal [indiscernible], which started early, gained strength and is still going strong midway through the year. The strength in demand delivered outperformance in the second quarter for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and the bottom line, a credit to the dedicated efforts of our 160,000 amazing team members ship and short.\nNet yields in constant currency turned positive in the second quarter compared to 2019 as we drove cruise ticket prices above 2019 while maintaining record onboard revenue growth and continuing to close the gap on occupancy. In fact, net per diems in constant currency were up 7.5% over 2019 in the second quarter. This was 4.5 points better than the midpoint of guidance which we were able to achieve while meeting our forecasted occupancy. Based on continued strength in pricing, we have also raised our expectation for net for diems in the second half by over 2.5 points while again, maintaining our occupancy expectations, which is supporting our guidance of higher net yields in the second half of 2023 over 2019 in constant currency. This revenue growth will be significantly higher than the increase in our cost guidance, which David will elaborate on.\nAll told, we are bringing another $275 million to the bottom line for the year, thanks to the strength in revenue as well as the interest expense benefit we are capturing from deleveraging.\nOn a per ALBD basis and holding fuel price and currency constant to 2019 levels, we progressed from 59% of 2019's EBITDA in the first quarter to 73% back in our second quarter. We expect to hit about 85% for the third quarter and be all the way back for the fourth quarter. We are now expecting adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 billion to $4.25 billion, above the high end of our prior guidance range. As I mentioned, booking volumes reached an all-time high in our second quarter, exceeding the record levels we achieved in the first quarter, which would normally be our peak period.\nBooking volumes were 17% higher than 2019, which is multiple of our capacity growth. We experienced double-digit growth in booking volumes on both sides of the Atlantic. Demand for our European brands has continued to strengthen and is now outpacing 2019 booking volumes at a rate that's comparable to our North America brands and the strength in demand has carried into June. In North America, the booking curve is as far out as we have ever seen it, while our European brands are quickly catching up to 2019 levels. With over 90% of this year on the books, 2023 is now essentially behind us, and we are strategically building a strong base of revenue for 2024. In fact, our book position for 2024 and also stands at record levels.\nReflecting this performance, our customer deposits are also at an all-time high of $7.2 billion, significantly higher than our prior peak of $6 billion. Customer deposits grew 26% over the prior quarter and are multiples of our measured capacity growth as we strategically push out our booking lead times and pull forward more onboard spend through bundled packages and pre-crew sales.\nOnboard revenues were once again off the chart this quarter as the strategy delivers an added benefit of elevating spending once on board, enabling us to capture more of our guests vacation wallet. Our brands are laser-focused on our strategy to pull forward both ticket and onboard spend, which only enhances the visibility and predictability of our recurring revenue base. We have over 50% of the next 12 months, both at any given time and over 1/3 of onboard revenues now on the books in advance or sailings.\nOur demand generation efforts are in full swing. Our cumulative number of new-to-cruise and new-to-brand guests who sailed with us in the second quarter have already exceeded 2019's level. Our natural search performance is up across the board with an 87% increase over 2019 which is up from a 63% increase last quarter, affirming the success of our new marketing campaigns in driving awareness and consideration.\nOur lead generation efforts are also working with a 60% increase in paid search clicks over 2019, which is nearly double the 35% increase just last quarter. To accommodate the success and our increased demand profile, we've grown our sales and sales support staff by over 50% in recent months. At the same time, we can see the impact it is also having with the trade. As I've said before, in order for us to be successful, we need all of our sales channels to excel, and that certainly includes our travel agent partners who are critical in helping us widen the pipeline for new-to-cruise guests. And I've got great news on that front. The trade is continuing to rebound significantly with sales volumes up 45% year-over-year as we increase training, engagement and support activities. And of course, our advertising investments benefit not only us, but our trade partners as well.\nBy any measure, our decision to increase our investment in advertising is paying off. The sequential improvement in these important KPIs suggests the strength we are seeing in demand will continue. All of this has built confidence not just in our 2023 outlook, but in our ability to launch SEA Change, 3-year targets that will demonstrate our progress towards delivering strong profitability and rebuilding our financial fortress.\nThe acronym S-E-A stands for Sustainability through carbon intensity reduction, EBITDA per ALBD and Adjusted ROIC. Three very important key performance indicators. And for each of these items, we expect to see significant improvements from current level and well above 2019. In fact, the 2 financial measures will be the best we have seen in almost 2 decades and the carbon intensity rate will be unprecedented.\nFor the S for sustainability, we plan to reduce our carbon intensity by more than 20% compared to 2019. Essentially, we plan to deliver on our 2030 decarbonization goal 4 years early. Reducing our carbon intensity has been and continues to be a priority for our company. It is critical to improving our environmental impact and to improving our financial performance. We are widening the gap to peers on what is already the most fuel-efficient fleet out there.\nFor the E, we are targeting a 50% increase in adjusted EBITDA per ALBD compared to our 2023 guidance. This would also represent a 25% increase over 2019 levels both the fuel price and currency constant. EBITDA per ALBD best measures the increasing unit profitability of our business as we execute on our strategy to deliver revenue yield improvement on lower capacity growth.\nAnd finally, for the A, we expect Adjusted ROIC to reach 12% [ or ] more than doubling from 2023 level. We already have the lowest investment base in our industry, and our strategy is designed to deliver outsized returns through high-quality yield-driven revenue growth while maintaining our industry-leading cost structure.\nThese targets are all grounded on low capacity growth of under 2.5% compounded annually which will allow us to use our cash flow generation to pay down debt and rebuild the balance sheet as we work towards investment-grade leverage metrics. Essentially, we pulled forward our most important sustainability goal and expect a step change in both profitability and return on invested capital in just 3 years. And importantly, these targets are not our angle. They are measurable markers of continuous improvement.\nTo make this happen, we have a sense of urgency to further our brand efforts to drive net yield improvement and while it's working, we recognize these efforts do build over time.\nAs mentioned on previous calls, to help support this growth and drive overall revenue generation over time, I've actively been working with each brand on their strategies and road maps to ensure they will truly own their space in the vacation market. This means having clearly identified target markets, capacity that is appropriately sized to the market potential, demand generation and marketing capability to hone in on the target market at the lowest possible acquisition costs, revenue management execution to generate optimized pricing across the booking curve and amazing onboard guest experience delivery to drive Net Promoter Scores and resulting advocacy higher. This will allow us to continue building on our large base of loyal gas as we work to increase awareness and consideration among new-to-cruise guests.\nTo make it happen, we also need to ensure we set our brands up for success organizationally. Accordingly, during the quarter, I completed the restructuring of our global executive leadership and company structure by removing a layer of management between the corporate and brand levels, I now have the leads of all 6 of our major brands representing over 90% of our capacity reporting to me. This is up from one brand and less than 1/3 of our capacity previously. This will facilitate more direct engagement between me and our brand leads to provide me with more bandwidth to do this, I also consolidated several corporate functions under fewer leaders, streamlining our organization. While this leaves me with the same number of direct reports overall, these changes make for a more nimble and accountable organizational structure better able to respond to market opportunities.\nAnd we are also positioned to work smarter, excluding sales and sales [ support ]. Our shore side staff count is down 18% from 2019. And the team is executing across the board at a high level. I recognize that we need to make sure we are doing our part to make Carnival Corporation an amazing place to work and grow each team member's career. And so we are driving initiatives across the board, ship and shore to meet our long-term goal of being travel and leisures employer of choice, and it is really showing. The improvement we've seen in our internal metrics on employee satisfaction and culture improvement have been phenomenal.\nTurning from our most important assets, our best-in-class people to our hardware. We are actively managing our diverse portfolio of world-class brands which are #1 or #2 in each of the largest markets for cruise travel. Following our portfolio and fleet optimization efforts, our capacity growth has been concentrated in our highest returning brand. Carnival Cruise Line, AIDA and P&O Cruises U.K. These efforts have also been driven by a purposeful reduction in our overall capacity growth, which combined with our strong and accelerating demand outlook supports further yield improvement, and we still retain the excitement from 14 newly delivered ships, representing nearly 25% of our capacity.\nJust this month, we completed the transfer of Costa's Venezia to our highly successful Carnival Cruise Line brand, launching Fun Italian style with a spectacular naming ceremony featuring our very first ship godfather comedic icon [indiscernible]. I couldn't think of a better personification of Carnival Cruise Line than [indiscernible] with his unpretentious and gregarious personality which aligns perfectly with the brand's target segment.\nKeep it seamlessly with Carnival Cruise Lines brand ambassadors who help amplify Carnival's messaging and appeal such as its Chief Culinary Officer, [ Emera Legate ], Chief Phone Officer, [ Shaquille O'Neal ]; and the Mayor of [ Leverton ] himself, [ Guy Fieri ]. So far, Fun Italian style has generated 1.5 million earned media impressions.\nThe instant success of Carnival's Fun Italian style supports the entry of [indiscernible], the second cost to ship transferring over to Carnival Cruise Line next year. These transfers are part of our portfolio management strategy, which is contributing to Carnival Cuisine's capacity, growing 22% more than pre-pause expectations and cost us capacity being reduced by 36% compared to pre-pause expectations.\nThe added capacity to Carnival Cruise Line will not only generate outsized returns for the company, but rightsizing the Costa brand is also having the desired effect of supporting its revenue profile confirmed by recent booking and pricing trends. We remain committed to our strategy of owning a portfolio of world-class brands, many of which are truly dedicated to specific markets. And it's clear the strength of this portfolio is now shifting into high gear.\nIn fact, with respect to our European brands, bookings taken in the second quarter for the European deployment for each of the third and fourth quarters, achieved double-digit percentage increases in both volume and price compared to 2019. This is also supported by our home porting strategy that puts nearly 75% of our capacity where our brands guests live. We are also working to further leverage and monetize our industry-leading land-based assets in the Caribbean and Alaska. We are leaning into our strategic advantage in the Caribbean with the expansion of [indiscernible] consistently voted among the best private islands and the development of our largest Caribbean destination yet, Grand Bahama port. It's being designed to deliver wow factors tailored to Carnival Cruise Line guests to drive higher revenue yields and margins. It's also strategically located to deliver a wide array of lower fuel consumption itineraries, furthering our carbon reduction efforts. Our Caribbean destinations already serve about 5.5 million of our brand's guests each year. And upon completion, Grand port will push that to $7.5 million annually.\nWe also own cruising in Alaska with an unmatched strategic footprint across hotels, rail and motor coaches to deliver unique [ lengthy ] packages of a lifetime as well as the most itineraries by far, featuring the iconic [indiscernible] bed. We plan to lean even more into marketing the benefits of all of these assets.\nTurning to our capital structure. As we indicated on our last call, we have now begun deleveraging our balance sheet and are already $1.4 billion off the peak. During the quarter, we used excess liquidity to opportunistically prepay over $1 billion of debt, while still retaining $7.3 billion of liquidity, which we expect to ratchet down as we rebuild our balance sheet over time. We remain disciplined in making capital allocation decisions and our lowest order book in decades provides a pathway for further deleveraging. We are clearly gaining momentum on an upward trajectory, positioning us well to deliver strong profitability and rebuild our financial fortress.\nWe are already executing on our strategy with a demonstrated ability to grow revenue by taking up ticket prices even while maintaining record onboard spending levels, building occupancy and growing capacity. We are implementing a range of initiatives to capture incremental demand for cruise vacations and working hard to close the outrageous and are warranted 25% to 50% value gap to land-based offerings over time. We are well positioned to do so given our high satisfaction and low penetration levels. And we are working hard to mitigate 4 years of inflation, maintain our industry-leading unit costs, all while reinvesting in advertising and sales support to build future demand.\nWe are focused on the durable revenue growth and margin improvement that will deliver on our SEA Change program, propel us on the path to delevering and investment-grade leverage metrics, and drive the continued shift of the enterprise value of our company from debt holders back to equity holders.\nI can't end without once again thanking our travel agent partners for their support and our best-in-class people ship and shore who deliver unforgettable happiness every day by providing extraordinary cruise vacations to our guests while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visits and life we touch.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. Before I begin, please note all of my references to ticket prices, net per diems, net yields and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated. I'll start today with a summary of our 2023 second quarter results. Then I'll provide a recap of our cumulative advanced book position. Next, I'll give some color on our 2023 full year June guidance and finish up describing the impact of our SEA Change program on our financial position.\nAs Josh indicated, in the second quarter, we outperformed our guidance. For the second quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $681 million at the high end of our March guidance range. The improvement was driven by $108 million of favorability in revenue from higher ticket prices.\nNet per diems were up 7.5%, and 4.5 points higher than the midpoint of our March guidance range. In fact, second quarter revenues of $4.9 billion was a record and we achieved a significant milestone with net yields turning positive as compared to 2019. However, our revenue favorability was partially offset by a $13 million unfavorable net impact from higher fuel prices and currency and $52 million of unfavorability in adjusted cruise costs without fuel due to the timing of expenses between the quarters as well as other factors that will impact our cost guidance for the full year.\nTurning to our cumulative advanced book position. For the remainder of 2023, our cumulative advanced book position is at higher prices when compared to strong 2019 pricing. Despite headwinds from the loss of St. Petersburg as a marquee destination due to the suspension of cruises to Russia and normalized for future cruise credits with a booked occupancy position that is near the high end of the historical range. With the strength in booking volumes above 2019 levels, we are in a great position with less inventory remaining to sell for 2023 as compared to 2019 to achieve our guidance despite the 5.7% capacity increase in the second half of the year.\nNext, I will give some color on our 2023 full year June guidance. Full year 2023 occupancy is expected to be 100% or higher as we continue to close the gap each quarter on occupancy levels as compared to 2019 which is at the higher end of the historical range. On the pricing front, we expect net per diems to be up 5.5% to 6.5% for the full year 2023 and compared to a strong 2019, which is 2.5 points higher than March guidance based on the acceleration of booking trends we saw during the second quarter.\nWe increased our guidance for the second half of 2023 by over 2.5 points, substantially all of the second half improvement in net per diems is driven by passenger ticket revenue on both sides of the Atlantic. We do see a continuation of strong onboard revenue trends we have been experiencing, which were included in our previous guidance.\nNow turning to costs. Off the base of our industry-leading cost structure, adjusted cruise costs without fuel per available lower berth day or ALBD, for the full year 2023 versus 2019 are now expected to be up 10% to 11%. This is 1.5 points higher than our March guidance. The change was driven by 3 factors: first, increases in various incentive compensation programs reflecting the expected improvement in the company's current and long-term performance consistent with June guidance and the SEA Change program are worth 0.5 point; second, further investments in advertising were 0.2 point, which we believe will benefit 2024 by multiple times the investment; and third, a slower-than-expected ramp down in inflationary pressures than previously anticipated, particularly in the area of port costs, freight, crew travel due to air cost and crew compensation collectively worth 0.7 point.\nWhile we are disappointed by the slower ramp down in inflation than previously anticipated, our 2.5 point increase in net per diem guidance far outweighs our cost guidance increase, improving margins and the bottom line. There is no doubt inflation has been a significant factor driving costs higher in 2023 versus 2019. However, let's not forget, we are talking about 4 years of inflation and our teams have managed the situation well, mitigating much of the inflationary impact.\nIn fact, crew costs per available lower berth day in our June guidance are up less than 2% versus 2019 despite significant increases in [indiscernible]. This is a testament to the ingenuity and creativity of our teams as well as the benefits of our scale around the globe. The details of depreciation and amortization, interest expense and fuel expense can be found in the earnings press release we issued earlier this morning in the section titled guidance, so I will not take the time to walk you through the numbers.\nHowever, I would like to point out that the increased confidence in our future drove us to use a portion of our liquidity to prepay $1.4 billion of variable rate debt mostly with 2023 and 2024 maturities, which combined with other factors, will reduce our interest expense for the year by over $80 million and leave us with approximately 80% of our debt having fixed interest rates protecting us from rising rates.\nPutting all of these factors together, we expect $4.1 billion to $4.25 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023, which is above the high end of the previous guidance. We expect to reach another milestone in the third quarter 2023 as we return to profitability with adjusted EPS expected to be in the range of $0.70 to $0.77 per share.\nAnd now I will finish up describing the impact of our SEA Change program on our financial position. As I said last quarter, I feel great as I report that we are beyond the peak of our total debt. Total debt peaked at over $35 billion in the first quarter of 2023 when we drew on the export credit for P&O Cruises [indiscernible] at the time of delivery. We believe with over $7 billion of liquidity, our improving EBITDA and our return to profitability in the second half of 2023, we are very well positioned to pay down debt maturities for the foreseeable future. With the debt prepayments announced in today's earnings release, we now expect our total debt at year-end to be below $33 billion.\nNow looking beyond 2023 using the SEA Change program targets as our guide. We expect cash flow from operations will average over $5 billion per year during the next 3 years, 2024 through 2026 and with optimized non-new build capital commitments and the lowest new build order book in decades, annual CapEx, net of the $3 billion of export credits will average less than $2 billion per year during the next 3 years. This will result in an average of over $3 billion in annual adjusted free cash flow to reduce debt, driving more than $8 billion in total debt reduction through 2026, inclusive of the $3 billion of export credit financing drawn during the period and over $10 billion of debt reduction from the $35 billion peak in first quarter 2023.\nAt the end of 2026, with a significantly lower level of debt and a 50% increase in adjusted EBITDA per ALBD, we are expecting to approach investment-grade leverage metrics. Our SEA Change program from debt reduction alone will transfer over $10 billion of enterprise value from debt holders to shareholders, which represents approximately $8 per share. On top of that, it will also deliver improved operating metrics and an adjusted ROIC of 12%, representing the highest level of ROIC in almost 2 decades.\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, let me remind you to visit our website for our second quarter earnings press release and presentation.\nNow operator, let's open the call for questions."

This is Josh Weinstein. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 business update conference call. I'm joined today by our Chair, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts.\nBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nConsistent with our last business update, we remain on an upward trajectory as we further closed the gap to 2019. We are still experiencing a record wave season, which started early, gained strength and has extended later into the year. We expect these favorable trends to continue based on the traction we're making to our ongoing effort to drive demand globally.\nIn the first quarter, we outperformed our guidance on all measures: Revenue, costs, adjusted EBITDA and earnings, while overcoming over $30 million in headwinds from fuel price and currency since our prior guidance, thanks to the dedicated efforts of our 160,000 amazing team members around the world. We had sequential improvement in our occupancy gap to 2019 from 19 points in Q4 to 13 points in Q1 on increasing capacity, which is now above 2019 levels. We anticipate being just 7 points or less away from 2019 occupancies in the second quarter, well on our way to historical occupancies this summer.\nEqually important, we also drove ticket prices higher and continue to throttle back on our opaque channel while also maintaining outsized onboard revenue growth but we have not lost sight on the cost side of the business. We are working hard to mitigate 4 years of inflation while still reinvesting in advertising and sales support to build future demand. We did update our cost guidance primarily to reflect decisions taken during the quarter that have increased our costs but will produce greater EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow, which David will elaborate on. We remain nimble and continue to aggressively seek opportunities to accelerate our path back to strong profitability.\nFor the year, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA of $4 billion at the midpoint. The gap to 2019's record $5.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA is being driven primarily by two items. First is our 2023 occupancy gap to 2019, which we expect to be behind us as we cycle through this year. As we discussed on the last call, this results primarily from longer-duration exotic voyages early in the year that we did not feel given the disparate COVID protocols to land-based alternatives were in place during most of the booking window for these voyages, as well as close-in deployment changes and the slightly delayed but improving European recovery trajectory.\nSecond is a drag due to fuel prices and currency changes compared to 2019. In actuality, the strength of our demand generation resulting in elevated per diems and our fleet optimization efforts has helped us to mitigate 4 years of significant cost inflation which, of course, will continue to work to offset even further.\nOn a per ALBD basis and holding fuel price and currency constant to 2019 levels, we were roughly 60% back to 2019 EBITDA in our first quarter, better than our expectations to be halfway back. We expect to be 2/3 of the way back in our second quarter as we progress back to levels that rival 2019 as we exit the year. Each point of net yield improvement results in $170 million to the bottom line in 2024. With our continuing demand generation seeing us close the occupancy gap entirely and allowing us to pull back further opaque channel activity, we are well positioned to continue to drive ticket prices higher and more than offset the drag from fuel price and currency over time.\nTo that end, wave season has been phenomenal. It started early with record Black Friday booking volumes and has continued to build. We achieved our highest ever quarterly booking volumes in our company's history, and we actually had our best weekly booking volume for this wave the last week in February. And the good news is that strength in bookings has continued into March, supporting our revenue expectations for the remainder of the year. Of course, we're working very hard to do even better.\nIn North America, our Carnival brand continues to propel us forward, breaking new booking records every single week in January and February. Booking volumes for our North American brands have been running in excess of record 2019 levels for the last 6 months and booking lead times are now back to peak levels.\nDemand for our European brands has strengthened more recently and is catching up to the U.S. market in the recovery cycle. Demand trends are improving across all regions as we exit the winter period and home heating concerns fade. In fact, booking volumes reached a record for our European brands as well, evidencing strong close-in demand and producing a continued lengthening in the booking curve.\nAs we previously noted, Australia is about a year behind the U.S. in terms of the recovery cycle. And while Asia is still about 2 years behind, we successfully resumed operations there with the ships now in Japan and one in Taiwan beginning this summer.\nTurning to China. The country still has not reopened to international cruise travel, which accounted for 1 million of our guests pre-pause and was a significant presence for Costa. To address this, we leaned into the mobility of our assets by leveraging our scale as we capitalize on the strength of our brand portfolio while building alternate deployments for the remaining Costa fleet. The actions we've taken to rightsize the Costa brands are working. Following the transfer of Venezia to our highly successful Carnival Cruise Line brand, the launch of Fun Italian Style has received strong support and is already reaching nearly 100% occupancy level for the third quarter. And with strengthening demand, Costa will be able to enter its remaining idle capacity at a faster pace.\nOverall, with normalized onboard protocols, we are on an even playing field to land-based alternatives, enabling us to close the unprecedented and unwarranted 25% to 50% value gap to land-based offerings over time. We are well positioned to capture incremental demand given our high satisfaction and low penetration levels. We're capitalizing on pent-up demand for cruise vacations, building on our large base of loyal guests as we work to increase awareness and consideration among new to cruise guests. This has been helped by the ongoing efforts of our travel agent partners who remain a critical source for new to-cruise guests.\nI am delighted to say that the trade is showing a fantastic rebound in its recovery with us this past quarter with several of our brands trade activity exceeding 2019 levels as we support our trade partners with increased training and engagement. And our investment in advertising and sales support is clearly paying dividends. For example, we've been upsizing our U.K. TV presence for P&O Cruises, the brand synonymous with cruising in the U.K. Not only has P&O Cruise has been enjoying a measurable increase in brand awareness as a result, but the brand has also experienced record bookings over the last 3 months. This is not surprising given the high correlation between TV advertising awareness and propensity to book in the U.K.\nThe awareness of P&O Cruises has been amplified with the unprecedented and well publicized naming of Arvia in Barbados less than 2 weeks ago. The amazing event featured our fabulous godmother, Nicole Sherzinger, chart-topping U.K. singer, Olly Murs and the incomparable Prime Minister of Barbados, Mia Mottley. Arvia is taking the brand with new guest experiences like the industry's first 3D submarine escape room, and it's got over 30 dining and bar outlets. We have a measured 4.5% capacity growth compared to 2019 while still retaining the excitement from 14 newly delivered ships, representing nearly 25% of our capacity.\nAnd importantly, our growth is weighted towards three of our highest returning brands: Carnival Cruise Line, AIDA and P&O Cruises U.K. following our portfolio and fleet optimization. As mentioned on previous calls, to help support this growth and drive overall revenue generation over time, I've actively been working with each brand on their strategies and road maps to ensure they have clearly identified target markets, capacity that is appropriately sized to the market potential, demand generation capability to hone in on the target market at the lowest possible acquisition cost, and deliver an amazing guest experience on board to drive Net Promoter Scores and resulting advocacy higher.\nThese efforts are well underway. We have or are in the process of refreshing segmentation research across all major source markets to confirm and resize our target audiences by brand post [ pause ]. Our brands have identified clear differentiators, and we are leveraging these insights to fine-tune each brand's positioning and marketing efforts to attract new-to-cruise guests and increase loyalty. For example, we've developed new affinity partnerships like Porsche Club of America for Princess, which is an efficient way to drive new-to-cruise demand to a brand that will resonate with its target guests.\nWe have launched new marketing campaigns across multiple media channels, including new national and home port-driven regional television in most major markets to increase awareness. And we've leaned into digital media with emphasis on video for enhanced storytelling. In fact, AIDA's new wave campaign, Better Together, has had 86 million views on TikTok and counting. We are redesigning websites to increase online traffic, improve conversion and achieve higher pre-cruise onboard sales. We are refining our onboard apps to increase communication and engagement as well as capturing incremental onboard revenue. We are refining our digital performance marketing efforts, continuously fine-tuning search engine optimization and testing new lead generation approaches with impressive results.\nAs just 2 examples, Holland America was recently named to the top 100 fastest-growing digital brands and Costa has driven an over 40% increase in lead generation in just the last 6 months. Our web visits are up 35% over 2019, which is multiples of our measured capacity growth. And our guests that are new to brand already reached 90% of 2019 levels in the first quarter. These are testaments to the success of our investments in advertising and sales support. And in fact, we're bolstering our sales and service support to address the increased volume and reduce call times resulting from all of the above.\nWe are sharpening our revenue management tools to drive incremental revenues through increased bundled package offers and new upgrade programs. We're also opening deployments further in advance, and testing and learning pricing strategies to support earlier occupancy builds and to push the booking curve out further. We are actively reducing already low cancellation levels through changes to deposit policies and new fare structures. And we are using guest insights and sharing cross-brand learnings to aid in everything we do.\nWe all have a sense of urgency to further our brand's efforts to drive net yield improvement. And while it's working, we recognize these efforts build over time. To aid in these efforts, we also have an opportunity to further leverage and monetize our industry-leading land-based assets in the Caribbean and Alaska.\nIn the Caribbean, we are building on our strategic advantage with a meaningful expansion of Half Moon Cay, which is consistently voted best private island. And of course, we're also developing our largest Caribbean destination yet, our Grand Bahama port. It's being designed to deliver wow fact tailored to Carnival Cruise Line guests to drive higher revenue yields and margins. Importantly, this development is strategically located to deliver a wide array of lower fuel consumption itineraries, furthering our carbon reduction efforts.\nAnd in Alaska, we have an unmatched strategic footprint across hotels, rail and motor coaches to deliver unique land-sea packages of a lifetime as well as the most itineraries by far, featuring the iconic Leisure Bay.\nTurning to our capital structure. We've completed two more export credits this quarter, bringing the total remaining available to $3.2 billion. The export credits are not only an attractive way to fund new ships, but they also serve to effectively roll debt that's maturing at attractive rates. In fact, the majority of export credits coming due in the next few years will be replaced by new export credits available to be drawn. As a result, we expect export credits to remain a similar portion of our debt structure at preferential low to mid-single-digit interest rates.\nWe also proactively addressed the renewal of our revolving credit agreement. The creative forward start revolver allows us to retain the benefit of $2.9 billion of liquidity until August of 2024 and provides an 18-month window to build on the current commitment of $2.1 billion. Hats off to David and our treasury team.\nWe remain disciplined in making capital allocation decisions, including new builds. We have our lowest order book in decades, which is 4 ships on order through 2025, and there will be none in 2026, plus our second incredible luxury expedition ship for Seabourn to be delivered later this year. Following a strong and prolonged wave season, customer deposits are running up double digits, contributing to adjusted free cash flow turning positive this quarter and for the full year. We are set up for structurally higher growth in customer deposits going forward as we benefit from increasing demand and increases in our bundled package offerings and pre-cruise sales.\nWhile we'll always look at opportunistic refinancing opportunities with adjusted free cash for the year expected to be positive, our revolver renewal behind us, more committed export credit financings in hand, our reduced CapEx profile going forward and over $8 billion of liquidity, we believe we are well positioned to pay down near-term debt maturities from excess liquidity and have no intention to issue equity. And with our industry-leading cost structure, we are well positioned to bring incremental revenue to the bottom line. We are focused on durable revenue growth, margin improvement and driving EBITDA per available birthday hire to propel us on the path to delevering investment-grade credit ratings and increased ROIC. Over time, we expect the enterprise value for our company to shift from debt holders back toward equity holders.\nI can't end the call without once again praising our travel agent partners for their unwavering support and our team members, ship and shore, who work so hard every day to fulfill our mission of creating unforgettable happiness by providing extraordinary cruise vacations to our guests while honoring the integrity of every ocean we sail, place we visit and life we touch. Our company is powered by our best-in-class people, something for which I am incredibly thankful.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & Chief Accounting Officer\n\nThank you, Josh. Before I begin, please note all of my reference to ticket prices, net per diems and adjusted cruise costs without fuel will be in constant currency unless otherwise stated.\nI'll start today with a summary of our 2023 first quarter results. Then I'll provide a recap of our cumulative book position. Next, I will give some additional color on our 2023 full year March guidance and finish up describing our financial position.\nAs Josh indicated, in the first quarter, we outperformed our guidance on all measures. For the first quarter, our adjusted EBITDA was $382 million, which was $82 million, above the midpoint of our December guidance. The improvement was driven by two things: First, $82 million of favorability in both improved ticket prices as net per diems were up 7.5% and higher occupancy of over 91%; and second, $28 million of favorability in adjusted cruise costs without fuel due to the timing of expenses between quarters, both of which were partially offset by a $31 million unfavorable net impact from higher steel prices and currency.\nI have three additional comments before leaving the first quarter results. First, our onboard and other revenue for the first quarter continued at an elevated pace that is consistent with the back half of 2022, demonstrating continued strength in the consumer as well as the quality of our onboard offering. However, I want to remind you that during the December conference call, I indicated that for 2023, as we have done in the past, we changed the bundled package offering to capture incremental revenue streams, and we reevaluated the revenue accounting allocations. As a result, in 2023, more of the revenue will be less in ticket and less allocated to onboard, impacting the onboard and other revenue per diem comparisons to both 2022 and 2019. Just another reason to add to the list of reasons why the best way to judge our revenue performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics such as net per diems.\nSecond, occupancy for the first quarter was over 91% but still a gap to 2019. We expect to continue to close the gap as we progress through 2023, setting us up for improved year-over-year adjusted EBITDA starting in first quarter 2024, driven by higher revenue because of the occupancy improvement.\nAnd third, net per diems for the first quarter 2023 benefited from brand mix and cabin mix as compared to the remaining 3 quarters of 2023, which was particularly aided this quarter by the exotic voyages that held down our occupancies, which we discussed on our last conference call.\nTurning to our cumulative book position. For the remainder of 2023, our cumulative advanced book position is at higher ticket prices normalized for future cruise credits when compared to strong 2019 pricing with booked occupancy that is solidly in the higher end of the historical range. The strong cumulative book position along with bundled package offerings and strong pre-cruise sales has resulted in total customer deposits achieving a first quarter record of $5.7 billion, surpassing the previous first quarter record of $4.9 billion, a 16% increase.\nNext, I will give some additional color on our 2023 full year March guidance. We now expect capacity growth for the full year 2023 to be 4.5% when compared to 2019. With strengthening demand, Costa will be able to reenter its remaining idle capacity at a faster pace than originally thought, increasing our capacity growth from December guidance. Full year 2023 occupancy is expected to be 100% or higher as we close the gap each quarter on occupancy levels as compared to 2019.\nOn the pricing front, we expect net per diems to be up 3% to 4% for full year 2023 compared to a strong 2019 with net yields improving every quarter throughout 2023 as compared to 2019 and exceeding 2019 in the fourth quarter. As I previously mentioned, net per diems for first quarter 2023 benefited from brand mix and cabin mix as compared to the remaining 3 quarters of 2023. Our net per diems for the second quarter and implied guidance for the second half of 2023 reflect the changing brand mix and cabin mix throughout the year.\nDuring 2023, our European brands expect their onboard and other revenue per diems to be up significantly versus 2019 as they were in 2022 and has been the case with our North American brands. As I previously pointed out, the absolute onboard spending on our European brands is less than that on our North American brands. Our European brand guests tend to drink a little bit more but gamble a lot less.\nAs the European brands catch up on occupancy with our North American brands during the second and third quarters and filled their ships, driving adjusted EBITDA higher, they will make up a larger percentage of the total, changing the per passenger average. And with their historically lower onboard revenue per diems, we will no longer benefit from brand mix. In addition, as we continue to close the gap to 2019 occupancy, many of the remaining cabins left to be filled or inside cabins. As we fill our increasingly shrinking remaining inventory driving adjusted EBITDA higher, we will fill the last of our inside cabins, lowering our average net per diems.\nNow turning to costs. Off the base of our industry-leading cost structure, adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD for the full year 2023 versus 2019 are now expected to be up 8.5% to 9.5%. This is approximately 1 point higher than our December guidance, but for all the right reasons driving adjusted EBITDA higher.\nFirst, with record booking levels on both sides of the Atlantic during the first quarter, we increased the occupancy levels on which our December cost guidance was based, driving food costs and certain other operating expenses higher but also driving adjusted EBITDA higher.\nNext, we reevaluated and increased our customer service and support staffing levels and associated costs around the globe given higher booking levels are occurring sooner than we previously thought.\nThird, with strengthening demand, we made the strategic decision for Costa to reenter into service its remaining idle capacity, which means additional restart expenses in 2023, but again, this will drive adjusted EBITDA higher.\nFourth, the opportunistic sale and charter back of Seaborne Odyssey earlier this month will reduce depreciation expense, but the resulting charter hire expense drives adjusted cruise costs higher. We will record a U.S. GAAP gain on the sale, but the gain will be excluded from adjusted cruise costs.\nAnd finally, fifth, we see opportunities to set ourselves up for an even more successful 2024 and beyond by further tweaking up advertising expense later in 2023. Again, and I must sound like a broken record, this will drive adjusted cruise costs higher, but will also drive adjusted EBITDA higher.\nAs Josh said, we remain nimble and continue to aggressively seek opportunities to accelerate our path back to strong profitability. The details of depreciation and amortization, interest expense and fuel expense can be found in the business update press release we issued earlier this morning in the section titled Guidance. So I will not take the time to walk you through the numbers. However, I would like to thank our treasury team for the great job managing our debt portfolio with 75% of our debt having fixed interest rates, which is significantly higher than year-end 2021 when it was 58%, protecting us in what has been a rising rate environment.\nFurthermore, for those of you modeling our fuel expense, please note that we expect MGO to represent around 40% of our fuel consumption for 2023 with the percentage slightly higher during the first half of the year. Putting all these factors together, we expect $3.9 billion to $4.1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2023.\nAnd now I will finish up describing our financial position. I am smiling when I report that adjusted free cash flow turned positive in the first quarter of 2023 and we expect adjusted free cash flow to be positive for the full year 2023. I feel great as I report that we are beyond the peak of our total debt. Total debt peaked at over $35 billion in the first quarter of 2023 when we drew on the export credit for P&O Cruises Arvia at the time of delivery. We believe with over $8 billion of liquidity, we are well positioned to pay down near-term debt maturities of $1.8 billion for the remainder of 2023 from excess liquidity. And by year-end, we expect our total debt to be down to approximately $33.5 billion.\nIn addition, our debt maturity towers have been well managed through 2024, which has $2.5 billion of debt maturities next year. And looking forward, I expect substantial increases in adjusted free cash flow in 2024 and beyond through durable revenue growth and gross margin improvement to drive down our debt balances on our path back to investment grade. And as a result, we have no intention to issue equity.\nBefore I turn the call over to the operator, let me remind you to visit our website for our first quarter business update release and presentation.\nNow operator, let's open up the call for questions."

    "content": "Q4 2022 Carnival PLC & Carnival Corp Business Update Call\n\nQ4 2022 Carnival PLC & Carnival Corp Business Update Call\n\nCUKNYSEDEC 21, 10:00 AM\n\nJosh Weinstein\n\nPresident, CEO, Chief Climate Officer & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nGood morning. This is Josh Weinstein. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2022 business update conference call. I'm joined today by our Chair, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts.\nBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nOur business continues to accelerate on an upward trajectory as we rapidly close the gap to 2019. In fact, we are already exceeding 2019 revenue per diems, and we're gaining momentum on our return to strong profitability.\nTaking a step back, this year, we've completed a monumental 18-month journey and with our scale, what we believe to be the world's largest start-up, returning 90 ships to service, reboarding over 100,000 team members and restarting our unmatched portfolio of 8 private islands and port destinations plus our unrivaled land-based footprint in Alaska and the Yukon, all while welcoming back nearly 9 million guests. For that, I sincerely thank our global teams around the world for the ingenuity and sheer determination it took to see that through to completion.\nThroughout 2022, we have aggressively built occupancy from a 50-point gap in the first quarter to less than 20 points in the fourth quarter. We achieved this on growing capacity as we returned another 35% of our fleet to service in 2022, reaching 99% of our 2019 capacity levels during the fourth quarter. And on top of this, our constant dollar revenue per passenger cruise day was 2% higher than 2019's record levels for the full year and 4% higher in the fourth quarter, overcoming the dilutive effect of future cruise credits. Without this impact, each would have been 2 points higher. And in the process, we sustained record-breaking onboard revenue per diems significantly higher in 2019.\nWe're also not losing sight of our cost base as we've worked through our restart and continue to absorb and mitigate the impacts of the high inflationary environment we've all been living in. We reduced the increase in adjusted cruise costs excluding fuel per ALBD in constant currency from up 25% in Q1 to up 11% in Q4.\nWe've also significantly ramped up our advertising and sales support to drive future demand. Thanks to this and the hard work of our amazing trade partners, our percentage of first-time guests has continued to sequentially improve, closing the gap to 2019 levels. And we've been working smarter with our shoreside teams headcount already having been significantly reduced from 2019 levels for some time now.\nWe delivered stunning new flagships for 5 of our brands, including Carnival Celebration, AIDAcosma, Costa Toscana and Discovery Princess as well as our first luxury expedition ship, the finest in the world, Seabourn Venture. All of these ships were purpose-built to generate higher returns.\nWe broke ground on a new exclusive destination, Grand Bahama Port which will be a game changer for Carnival Cruise Line, while at the same time, benefiting more than ever from our existing private islands and unique port destinations, which captured 6 million visits from our guests and all while working to minimize our environmental impact with a 7% reduction in carbon intensity, a 30% reduction in food waste and 290 million less single-use items compared to our baseline. Most importantly, we are back to doing what we do best, delivering millions of unforgettable and much-needed vacation experiences to our guests.\nAnd we are truly a global company with 45% of those guests sourced outside of North America in 2019. In fact, we practically carried more people outside the U.S. than any of our peers carried in total. We believe that having the #1 or 2 brand in each of the largest cruise markets such as North America, the U.K., Germany, Australia, Italy, France and Spain, is the foundation of our portfolio strategy and allows us to tailor our experiences and offerings to those specific source markets, enabling us to generate stronger brand loyalty and gain greater penetration and profit.\nIn this current environment, though, there are 2 factors that have had an outsized impact on our results; an uneven reopening of cruise travel around the world in the aftermath of COVID and the more direct impact the war in the Ukraine has had on European countries. While all of our brands are on an upward trajectory, the pace of the recovery has trailed for those brands most heavily exposed to these factors.\nIn 2019, 1/3 of our non-North American guests, 2 million people came from Australia, Asia and The Baltics. The vast majority of these guests were sourced through Costa and Princess, representing 40% of Costa's guests and 25% of Princess' guests. At this point in time, Australia's reopening is where North America was a year ago, and Japan is closer to 2 years behind. The lagging reopening of these markets has triggered multiple changes in deployment and guest sourcing approaches as we anticipate the impact will continue to be felt particularly for the first half of 2023.\nOf course, China also has yet to reopen. Given Costa's significant presence in Asia with 5 ships planned to operate their year-round pre-pause, we've taken actions to rightsize the Costa brand with the removal of another 2 smaller, less efficient ships from the Costa fleet. This is in addition to the previously announced 3 ships transferring to our highly successful Carnival Cruise Line brand. This positions Costa well with a competitive fleet with closer to home deployments focused on its core markets in Continental Europe.\nWe have already been encouraged by the recent strength in booking volumes for the Costa brand. In fact, last month, Costa's booking volumes in these core markets were above 2019 levels for the fourth quarter of 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 as they navigate a closer in booking curve.\nThe war in the Ukraine remains concerning for us all and especially those in the affected regions. Given the closer proximity for both Costa and our German brand, AIDA, the war and associated impacts have weighed heavily on consumer confidence in those regions, resulting in greater uncertainty and closer in booking patterns.\nTo help manage, we've made strategic deployment decisions leaning into more itineraries that home port where the guests originate as well as shorter duration cruises, helping us to reduce the friction of air travel, lower the overall cost and facilitate a closer in booking environment. We believe this positions us well to attract more new-to-cruise guests and make us even more of a value proposition versus land-based alternatives by bringing our ships closer to where our guests live.\nWe have furthered our fleet optimization efforts again this quarter, bringing the cumulative number of ship dispositions since the pause to 26 when coupled with the delivery of larger, more efficient ships, including the successful introduction of Carnival Celebration last month and the addition of Arvia for P&O Cruises just last week. This will result in nearly 1/4 of our fleet consisting of new capacity.\nThis fleet transformation resulted in an 8-percentage-point increase in balcony cabins along with a tremendous increase in available real estate on board to deliver even more differentiated onboard experiences and generate associated revenues contributing to durable revenue growth going forward.\nWe will also benefit from lower ship level unit costs that help to mitigate inflation with 9 percentage points higher fuel efficiency and 6 percentage points greater efficiency in remaining operating costs. Our revenue generation will also benefit from the launch of Carnival Venezia's Fun Italian Style in New York. The program is off to a great start, having been met with strong demand and high prices building confidence and prospects for this creative initiative.\nOverall, in 2023, we'll have just 3% capacity growth compared to 2019 while still retaining the excitement and demand from 12 fantastic ships delivered in 2020. And thanks to portfolio optimization efforts, our capacity growth is weighted towards 3 of our highest returning brands, Carnival Cruise Line, AIDA and P&O Cruises U.K. There is no doubt 30-year assets will hold dividends along our path to strong profitability as we build demand and generate higher revenue yields over time.\nHaving said that, brand by brand, there is high capacity growth that we are managing in 2023. In this transition year, P&O Cruises is absorbing 40% more capacity than 2019, thanks to Iona and Arvia. AIDA has 20% more capacity at the start of the year. Costa will have significantly more capacity in its core markets versus 2019 as the full benefits of our fleet optimization program won't be completely felt until 2024, and Princess will source more heavily than ever before from North America, given its source market disruptions.\nAs I mentioned on the previous call, to help support this growth and to drive overall revenue generation, I've actively been working with each brand on their strategies and road maps. As a result, I've authorized our brands to take a significant step up in advertising activities, including a nearly 20% increase in our investment this past quarter over 2019 to elevate awareness and consideration and to drive demand for both the near and the longer term. This should be particularly impactful with those new to cruise, where we draw about 1/3 of our guests as we position to take share from land-based alternatives.\nWe are capitalizing on the 25% to 50% value gap to land-based alternatives that, frankly, should not exist, with new marketing campaigns to communicate our significant value advantage to land-based alternatives, including newly launched digital creatives from several brands. We plan to continue these increased investments in advertising as we head into next year to promote a strong wave season where we captured disproportionately higher bookings for the year, particularly our important summer season.\nHaving been in paused status for the better part of 2 years, we are also rebuilding top-of-funnel demand through the army of advocates coming off our ships every day, recommending our cruise vacations, a renewed focus on our trade relationships and a growing sales force.\nOn the revenue management side, we are ensuring that each brand is utilizing pricing philosophies to maximize revenue from launch to sailing and sharing best practices across brands. Our teams are focused on higher value-add from bundled packages supported by a market to sale approach and consistently capturing incremental revenue streams from many initiatives such as more robust cabin upgrade programs.\nWhile building back demand and enhancing our yield management tools and strategies, we are optimizing the combination of occupancy, ticket and onboard to deliver revenue to the bottom line, in the near term while maintaining price integrity for the long term.\nGiven the close-in nature of the booking curve from the disruption caused by the Omicron variant earlier this year, and the friction from protocols in effect to the bulk of the year, most brands have leaned heavily into opaque distribution channels like our friends and family rates, which allow us to achieve higher occupancy and result in onboard revenue while still preserving pricing power over time as they are rates that are not offered in the general marketplace. These channels are beneficial in reaching higher occupancy levels and higher onboard revenues, particularly for our North American brand.\nBooking volumes have already strengthened following the relaxation in protocols. Cancellation trends are improving globally and we have seen a measurable lengthening in the booking curve. This applies across the board. Since the start of the year, our EA brands have pushed the booking curve out and narrowed the gap by more than a month while our North American brands have pushed the curve out and narrowed that gap by 2 months, now nearing 2019 lead times.\nWe enjoyed a strong response to our recent Black Friday and Cyber Monday activity and the momentum has continued into December, building our base occupancy and marking an early start to a strong wave season ahead. It is important to recognize much of the first half of 2023 was booked prior to the relaxation in protocols. And in actuality, many of these first half cruises are still implementing certain more restricted protocols given the itinerary profiles consist of lengthier exotic deployment, including our long-awaited return-to-world cruises and long winter deployments for our European brands operating from colder climates. And much of this relies heavily on long-haul flights, which are not conducive to a closer in booking environment.\nNonetheless, we expect our first quarter occupancy gap to 2019 to be reduced even further and on higher net per diems on our way to historical occupancies in the summer. This bodes well for 2023 overall as we expect more markets to open for cruise travel, protocols to continue to relax, our closer-to-home itineraries play out, and our brands continue to hone all aspects of their revenue-generating activities. And as we continue to invest to build demand, we are positioned to pull back on promotions and opaque channels to drive meaningful ticket price improvement over time.\nOn a complementary basis, our industry-leading operating costs and fuel consumption per ALBD set us up to effectively deliver more of this revenue to the bottom line. Normalizing for 2019 fuel price and currency changes which provides a better sense of the strength of the underlying fundamentals of the business and our progress, we expect adjusted EBITDA per ALBD to reach 50% of 2019 levels in the first quarter of 2023, with sequential quarterly improvement as we progress through 2023 that should rival 2019 levels by the end of the year.\nTurning to capital expenditures, we actively managed down our spend by over $500 million during 2022, and we've taken a hard look at 2023 and beyond and reshaped investment spending by $300 million annually for a cumulative reduction of $1.7 billion. We have reprioritized project lists and hurdle rates to reflect the current environment, while absolutely maintaining our commitment to excellence in compliance, protecting the environment and the safety and well-being of our guests, team members and communities we serve.\nGoing forward, we are committed to using our expected cash flow strength to repair the balance sheet over time and will be disciplined and rigorous in making new build decisions accordingly. We have just 4 ships on order through 2025 plus our second incredible Seabourn luxury expedition ship to be delivered in 2023. This is our lowest order book in decades. We don't expect any new ships in 2026 and anticipate just one or 2 new builds each year for several years thereafter.\nTurning back to our operating performance. We are effectively addressing near-term challenges in the post-pause transition with higher first quarter net per diems expected and have been reshaping our portfolio to drive revenue growth as we return to historically high occupancy levels and delivering measurable pricing improvements over time.\nWe are fast tracking our momentum by investing in marketing and sales support to effectively communicate the amazing vacation experiences we deliver day in and day out, offering an unparalleled level of convenience and personalized service and at way too good of a relative value to land-based alternatives at every price point from mass temporary to ultra luxury.\nOverall, we remain focused on driving revenue growth that hits the bottom line and accelerating our return to strong profitability. And over time, this revenue generation, our industry-leading cost base and our more focused capital expenditure profile will support significant free cash flow and propel us on the path to deleveraging investment-grade credit ratings and higher ROIC.\nThis has been a truly remarkable year, and we have come a long way in an incredibly short amount of time. These efforts highlight what we've always known, our people are our greatest asset. And now they are armed with an even greater skill set built up over the last few years -- creativity, agility and perseverance that will help push us forward.\nWe're looking forward to 2023 and our positioning for our first strong wave season in 4 years, enabling us to deliver a strong summer period where we generate the bulk of our operating profit for the year.\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & CAO, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a recap of our cumulative book position and our financial position. Then I'll provide some color on 2023.\nTurning to our cumulative book position, marking an early start to wave season, we ended the year with multiple brands breaking records on very strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday booking volumes. Our full year 2023 cumulative advanced book position is at higher prices and constant currency normalized for FCCs when compared to strong 2019 pricing and is higher than the historical average book position.\nThe second, third and fourth quarters all have a book position that are above the historical average, while the first quarter 2023 book position was impacted by heightened protocols during its prime booking period, which have since been responsibly relaxed. As a result of the relaxation of the protocols, booking volumes for first quarter 2023, along with all future sailings have increased. Therefore, we expect to continue reducing our occupancy gap in first quarter 2023 to 2019 by nearly 5 percentage points from fourth quarter 2022.\nThe strong cumulative book position has resulted in total customer deposits hitting a fourth quarter record of $5.1 billion as of November 30, 2022, surpassing the previous record of $4.9 billion as of November 30, 2019.\nNext, let's talk about our financial position. During 2022, we continued to take refinancing risk off the table by addressing our 2023 debt maturities and getting ahead of our 2024 maturities. As a result of this, we ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $8.6 billion of liquidity.\nLooking forward, we expect to turn free cash flow positive in the back half of 2023 and continue to be free cash flow positive in 2024 and beyond. We anticipate utilizing this free cash flow to delever our balance sheet on our path back to an investment-grade credit rating.\nNow I'll finish up with some color on 2023. For first quarter 2023, we expect capacity growth to be 3.7% when compared to first quarter 2019 and 3.3% for the full year 2023 as compared to the full year 2019. During 2023, we expect to continue to close the gap on occupancy to 2019 levels. Occupancy for first quarter 2023 is expected to be 90% or slightly higher, just a 14 percentage point gap or better. As I said before, this would be nearly a 5-percentage-point improvement from the fourth quarter 2022 GAAP, but that is not enough. We are working hard and expect to close the gap to 2019 with occupancy returning to historical levels in the summer of 2023.\nOn the pricing front, first quarter 2023, we expect net per diems to be up 5.5% to 6.5% in constant currency and 3% to 4% in current dollars as compared to first quarter 2019. A great accomplishment as we start the new year. However, net per diems for first quarter 2023 are expected to benefit from brand mix when compared with first quarter 2019.\nDuring 2023, while our European brands expect onboard and other revenue per diems to be up significantly versus 2019 as they were in 2022 and as has been the case with our North American brands, absolute onboard spending on our European brands is less than that on our North American brands. Our European brand guests tend to drink a little more, but gamble a lot less. As the European brands catch up on occupancy with our North American brands during the second and third quarters and fill their ships, they will make up a larger percentage of the total changing the per-passenger average. And with their historically lower onboard revenue per diems, we will no longer benefit from the brand mix.\nAlso, for 2023, we do anticipate returning to non-GAAP financial measures to report revenue performance and use net per diems as opposed to revenue per passenger cruise day we used in 2022. For 2023, we once again expect to onboard another revenue per diems to be up significantly versus 2019, helping to drive the net per diems up. However, as I indicated in the past, as we change the bundled package offerings, we reevaluate the revenue accounting allocations.\nAs a result, in 2023, more of the revenue will be left in tickets and less allocated to onboard, impacting the onboard and other revenue per diem comparisons to both 2022 and 2019. Just another reason to add to the list of reasons why the best way to judge our revenue performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics such as net per diems.\nNow turning to costs. Off the base of our industry-leading cost structure, adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD for the full year 2023 versus 2019 are expected to be up 5% to 6% in current dollars and 7.5% to 8.5% in constant currency. For the first quarter 2023, the ranges are up 1 point less driven by lower dry dock cost per ALBD versus first quarter 2019 but first quarter 2023 does include an over 30% increase in advertising to further accelerate demand.\nThere are 3 main drivers of the cost increase. First, our forecast is for an average mid-teen level of inflation across all our cost categories globally. Second, our decision to further invest in advertising to drive demand and pricing in 2023 and beyond is expected to add 1 to 2 percentage points to cost per ALBD. And third, deployment optimization and other small investments are likely to add 1 percentage point.\nSignificantly mitigating these increases, our fleet optimization program that is expected to drive the 6-percentage-point improvement in ship operating cost per ALBD that is worth 4.5 points of adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD and the creativity, resourcefulness and hard work by our global teams producing sourcing and productivity savings of approximately 4 percentage points. A great accomplishment.\nI would like to say thank you to all the team members who contributed to this effort. The details of depreciation and amortization, interest expense and fuel expense can be found in the business update press release we issued earlier this morning in the section titled Selected Forecast Information. So I will now walk through all the numbers.\nHowever, for those of you modeling our fuel expense, please note that we expect MGO to represent about 40% of fuel consumption for 2023. However, that percentage may be slightly higher during the early part of the year.\nWhile we are on the subject of fuel consumption, I would like to recognize everyone on our global team who contributed to the expected 15% reduction in both fuel consumption per ALBD and carbon emissions per ALBD for the full year 2023, both as compared to 2019. We are working aggressively to drive down our carbon footprint, fuel consumption and costs through technology upgrades being rolled out like the Air Lubrication Systems mentioned in this morning's business update along with investing in port and destination projects and even more focused on itinerary optimization across our portfolio of brands, while realizing the benefits of our fleet optimization efforts so that everyone can fully understand the underlying strength of our business.\nI did want to point out that for 2023 versus 2019 at current fuel prices and FX rates, we did expect a negative impact from fuel price, fuel mix and currency of approximately $150 million for first quarter and an impact that is multiple times that for the full year including a full year currency impact of over $70 million.\nPutting all these factors together, we expect $250 million to $350 million of adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter 2023 and sequential improvement compared to 2019 in each quarter of 2023 as we continue to close the gap. However, given the significance of the wave season ahead of us, we will be in a much better position to provide full year guidance for net per diems, occupancy and EBITDA early next year. We plan on providing that guidance during our first quarter business update in March.\nAnd now operator, let's open up the call for questions. Thank you."

This is Josh Weinstein. Welcome to our third quarter 2022 business update conference call, my first as CEO. I'm joined today telephonically by our Chair, Micky Arison. And with me here in our Miami offices, our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and our Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Beth Roberts.\nBefore I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nOur business continues on a positive trajectory. We've been closing the gap to 2019 as we put a stake in the ground internally and shifted from return to service to a relentless focus on return to strong profitability. The occupancy gap to 2019 has reduced from over 50 points in Q1 to less than 30 points in Q3. At the same time, our capacity in service has gone from approximately 60% in Q1 to over 90% in Q3. In fact, in the month of August, we achieved almost 90% occupancy at higher constant dollar revenue per diems despite the impact of future cruise credits. And the differential in adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, has reduced from over $25 in Q1 down to $10 in Q3. As a result, we were able to generate over $300 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter, overcoming a near doubling in fuel prices.\nWe expect these favorable trends to continue as we finish up 2022 and head into 2023. And while we expect breakeven to slightly negative fourth quarter EBITDA given the seasonality of revenues and our increasing investment in advertising to drive revenue yield in 2023, we do expect second half EBITDA overall to be positive. We've also been making strategic changes to our fleet composition that will pay dividends over time. Our global fleet of 91 ships has never been better positioned, thanks to the exiting of 23 smaller, less efficient ships and taking delivery of 9 large and very efficient ships.\nWhile we'll all be 4 years older than we were in 2019, next year, the average age of our fleet will actually be a year younger than in 2019 at 12 years. It also means our average berth count per ship is increasing nearly 20%, the largest amongst our public peers. We expect benefits of this profile to include a fleet with 10% higher fuel efficiency, 6% more efficiency in remaining operating costs, a richer cabin mix and larger overall platforms to deliver onboard experiences and generate associated revenues.\nWe have also begun to address the brand portfolio to improve ROIC and drive durable top and bottom line growth. In light of the continued closure of cruise operations in China and our Costa brand's significant presence there pre-COVID, we are reducing Costa's capacity by 10% from 2019 levels, while bolstering our highly successful Carnival Cruise Line brand through the previously announced transfer of 3 ships, including 2 via our innovative Costa by Carnival initiative launching in 2023. All 3 ships will be placed on new itineraries, allowing Carnival to expand its drive-to cruise offering.\nWe will continue to evaluate opportunities to further optimize our brand portfolio over time. These fleet and portfolio decisions will provide strong tailwinds. And while during the pause in operations, being nearly twice the size of the next closest cruise company was a distinct disadvantage for our cash burn, we will once again benefit from our industry-leading scale. And there are even greater opportunities ahead to drive revenue as we return to full occupancy and march towards strong profitability.\nThroughout the pause, we have benefited from the dedicated support of our loyal guests. Now as we grow capacity in 2023 and beyond, we are redoubling efforts to attract new-to-cruise guests. About 1/3 of our guests have historically been new-to-cruise. And as you probably know, 2 of the most important drivers of new-to-cruise are word of mouth and advertising.\nWith respect to word of mouth, after the pause, we have been building back our army of advocates that leave the ships, spreading the word about the unparalleled vacation experiences we deliver day in and day out. In the third quarter alone, we carried twice the number of guests we carried in all of 2021, and over 50% more than in just the prior quarter.\nOn the advertising front, we've also been ramping up our efforts, having reached 2019 spend levels in just the last 2 quarters. In fact, until 6 months ago, we had spent less on advertising cumulatively over a 2-year period than in all of 2019, and most of this was directed at more efficient channels like past guests. This was a conscious decision to re-prioritize our resources to withstand the pause. As our brands have now been increasing their advertising investment, we will increase awareness and consideration and actively target those new-to-cruise.\nWhile we're still carrying a higher proportion of repeat guests, we have seen an improving trend in new-to-cruise and are already 2/3 of the way back to 2019 levels. And newcomers will be absolutely thrilled once we get them on board. We are delivering a great all-inclusive vacation experience, convenient, great dining and entertainment choices, fantastic itineraries, beautiful and innovative ships and the most amazing onboard teams providing a higher level of personalized service than you can find anywhere on land or sea.\nOur Net Promoter Scores are telling us, we are delivering a phenomenal product. The issue is we are way too much of a value. We should not be priced at a significant discount to land, which is exactly the case today, anywhere from 25% to 50% based on itineraries. Bottom line, when it comes to generating demand and increasing our revenue profile, we can, should and will do better.\nI have begun traveling to meet with each brand president and his or her commercial team to understand their strengths, capabilities and areas for improvement. We are working through their strategies and roadmaps to seize opportunities, all while taking advantage of tactics to quickly capture price and bookings in the interim.\nThis cuts across multiple areas of our commercial operations, driving further brand differentiation and clarity around each brand's optimal target segment; ensuring that creative marketing speaks to each brand's target audience; launching more effective digital performance marketing and lead generation approaches; a renewed focus on our trade relationships, another key driver of new-to-cruise demand; to reduce friction points and allow our travel agent partners to more efficiently secure bookings, while continuing to support internal sales as we need all sales channels to perform at a high level to be successful; improving revenue management execution as we continue to adapt to an evolving booking environment; and using data, guests and target audience insights and cross-brand learnings to aid in all of the above.\nThe engagement and transparency that characterize these brand sessions has been fantastic, and the sense of urgency these leaders have to drive their brands forward is real. And speaking of leaders, we actually have new leadership at the brands and throughout the organization. Since the pause began, 5 of our 9 brands have welcomed new energetic presidents, and these brand presidents have been actively bolstering the bench below them. Additionally, I have made a half dozen changes across corporate leadership in just the last few months. It's worth noting that with the changes I've made to date, 6 of my 12 direct reports are now women. We are actively focused on diversity and inclusion, and we'll continue to invest in talent and talent management.\nNow diversity fits alongside our overall sustainability agenda, and we've been making significant progress across the board. There have probably been no greater strides than reducing our carbon intensity. Despite being over 25% larger, our carbon footprint peaked more than a decade ago. And we've set 2030 targets for carbon intensity to be 20% lower than 2019 levels. We will achieve this through technology upgrades currently being rolled out, investing in port and destination projects, even more focus on itinerary optimization and realizing the benefit of our fleet optimization efforts.\nWhile there is no silver bullet to decarbonization for our industry yet, we are committed to working towards a solution. To this end, I'm excited about 3 successful pilots we recently completed using biofuels in existing engines without modification.\nTurning now to the current tone of business. Pricing for our 2023 book business is currently at considerably higher levels than 2019, adjusting for FCCs. And it is very encouraging that since announcing our relaxation in protocols in mid-August, we have already seen a very meaningful improvement in booking volumes. We are now running considerably higher than 2019 levels. At the same time, we have seen a notable improvement in cancellation trends. We expect these favorable trends to accelerate as the impact of our current and planned efforts will continue to materialize as we move toward our important summer season where we make the bulk of our operating profit.\nWhen it comes to our capital structure, maintaining a strong balance sheet has always been a priority for our company. Pre-pandemic, we have been able to achieve this while investing significantly in our newbuild program, thanks to the substantial cash flow our company generated. Going forward, we are committed to using our cash flow strength to repair the balance sheet over time, and we'll be disciplined and rigorous in making newbuild decisions accordingly.\nWe have 2 ships on order in 2024 and 1 in 2025. We do not anticipate significant deviation in annual levels for several years. This will significantly reduce our capital commitments and set us on the path to deleveraging. We have seized the opportunity to emerge as a company that is more efficient, more sustainable and more energized for the future. We have a transformed fleet, an unmatched portfolio of well-recognized brands and unparalleled scale in an under-penetrated industry. We are strategically managing our portfolio to optimize our near- and long-term performance.\nWe now have a tremendous opportunity to drive revenue growth by delivering measurable pricing improvements, while returning to historically high occupancy levels over time. That opportunity will drive significant free cash flow and accelerate our path to profitability, investment-grade credit ratings and higher ROIC. In the coming months, we'll talk specifically about long-term goals and targets so that we can track progress and maintain accountability along our path.\nOur travel agent partners, port and destination communities, suppliers, investors, lenders and, of course, our guests are also important to our business. I plan to speak with more of our stakeholders in the coming months to gather their perspectives as we strive for continuous improvement.\nI would like to end by personally thanking all of our talented and dedicated team members globally, ship and shore, for the heavy lifting it took to get us back to full operations. And now comes the exciting part. We get to take all of the creativity, agility and innovation that the team has built up in response to external factors throughout the pause and resumption of operations, and we now get to use that skill set to proactively drive our business forward and to fulfill our mission of creating happiness by delivering unforgettable and much-needed vacations to our guests.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & CAO, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, Josh. I'll start today with a review of guest cruise operations, and then provide booking trends and the current tone of business. Turning to guest cruise operations. Third quarter 2022 represents a significant milestone in the resumption of our guest cruise operations with adjusted EBITDA turning positive for the first time. We were pleased to see that third quarter 2022 revenue increased by nearly 80% compared to second quarter 2022, reflecting a continued sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement.\nFor the third quarter, occupancy was 84%, a 15 percentage point increase from the second quarter. We ended the quarter on a high note with 90% occupancy in the month of August. We were encouraged by the continued very close-in demand we experienced during the third quarter for the third quarter, a trend we had anticipated.\nRevenue per passenger day for the third quarter 2022 decreased from a strong 2019, mainly due to the impact of future cruise credits, or more commonly called FCCs, and currency given the stronger U.S. dollar, along with our large presence in Europe with 4 brands in the U.K. and Continental Europe. Once again, our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the third quarter 2022 versus third quarter 2019, driven by price increases, greater spending by our guests and the increased effect of the second wallet as more guests are participating in pre-cruise sales of onboard activities.\nIn fact, year-to-date, we have seen over 50% growth in pre-cruise sales of onboard activities on a per passenger cruise day, or PCD, basis as compared to 2019. Our teams have done an excellent job capitalizing on the opportunity in this area.\nAs I indicated in my comments during our last business update, we expanded our bundled package offerings given their popularity. The new bundled offerings required us to make changes to the accounting allocations. As a result, in the third quarter, more of the revenue was left in ticket and less allocated to onboard, impacting the onboard and other revenue per PCD comparison for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. Just another reason to add to the list of reasons why the best way to judge our revenue performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.\nOn the cost side, our adjusted cruise costs without fuel in constant currency per available lower berth day, or ALBD as it is more commonly called, the third quarter 2022 was up 14% versus third quarter 2019. We have seen a continuation of the sequential improvement quarter-over-quarter in costs throughout the year and expect to see a continuation of the improvement in the fourth quarter of 2022, with a low double-digit increase compared to 2019, driven in part by higher advertising expense to drive revenue for 2023. We ended the third quarter 2022 with $7.4 billion of liquidity, essentially the same liquidity level as last quarter.\nIn addition, I am pleased to report that total customer deposits, both current and long term, were $4.8 billion at third quarter 2022, approaching the record third quarter of $4.9 billion in 2019. New bookings for the third quarter of 2022 offset most of the historical seasonal decline in customer deposits, which was over $1 billion in 2019.\nFurthermore, to facilitate investor engagement, I wanted to mention a couple of balance sheet-related items. First, let me clarify our debt-to-capital covenant test. Our current debt-to-capital percentage is in the mid-50s using the calculation methodology in our debt agreements. This methodology allows for the add-back to equity of noncash write-offs and other adjustments, which eliminates the volatility from the pause in guest cruise operations, leaving us well within the debt-to-capital covenant limit set at 75% at the end of the third quarter 2022. Second, we will provide and will continue to do so quarterly a detailed debt schedule and a listing of ships in our fleet by brand on our website, carnivalcorp.com. To find these supplemental schedules, refer to the Financial Information tab within the Investor Relations section of the website.\nNext, let's look at booking trends and the current tone of business. Booking volumes for all future sailings during the third quarter 2022 saw a continuation of the accelerated booking volumes during the second quarter and closed the gap to strong 2019 levels. We did not see any seasonal slowing of booking activity in the third quarter 2022 versus the second quarter 2022 despite the third quarter normally being a slower booking period.\nIt is great to see booking volumes for all future sailings considerably higher than 2019 levels since the announcement of the relaxed protocols in mid-August, aligning us towards land-based vacation alternatives. However, we are still managing through the close-in nature of the booking curve caused by the Omicron variant disruption to our important wave season earlier this year and the more restrictive industry protocols in effect until very recently. This left us with more inventory to sell closer in. To optimize in this environment, we have been working to increase near-term occupancy in part by using limited promotions and opaque channels, available only to a select group of people to protect overall price integrity for 2023.\nTherefore, while this resulted in the cumulative advanced book position for the fourth quarter below the historical range, we believe we are well situated with our current fourth quarter 2022 book position given current booking volumes that are running significantly ahead of 2019 levels as we capitalize on closer-in booking patterns. Pricing, impacted in part by limited promotions in opaque channels, results in our cumulative book position for fourth quarter 2022 lower compared to 2019 sailings, but primarily due to FCCs.\nWith respect to occupancy, fourth quarter occupancy historically has been lower than third quarter given the seasonal dynamic of our business. It was a 9 percentage point drop in 2019. However, this year, that will not be the case. Our continuing build in cabin occupancy will more than offset the seasonal decline, which will result in slightly higher fourth quarter 2022 occupancy compared to the third quarter and represents another step forward in closing the gap to 2019.\nFor the full year 2023, our cumulative advanced book position is slightly above the historical average and at considerably higher prices compared to record 2019 levels normalized for FCCs. While I do expect an impact on 2023 yields from the FCCs, the impact is likely to be less than 1 percentage point for the full year 2023. Additionally, during 2023, we expect improvement in occupancy, with occupancy returning to historical levels in the summer of 2023.\nWhile our return to guest cruise operations is essentially complete, we are still evaluating a few remaining deployment options as referenced in our business update release. As a result, for 2023, we expect our capacity increase to be somewhere in the range of 3% to 5% compared to 2019. Of course, with nearly 25% of our capacity in 2023 from new ships, we also expect to benefit from the efficiency gains from our fleet optimization efforts that Josh mentioned earlier, helping to mitigate inflation.\nIn summary, looking forward to 2023, we have a strong book of business at considerably higher prices. Prices are higher in all 4 quarters of 2023. Onboard revenue per diems are up significantly in 2022, and this puts us on track for a record year in 2023 for onboard revenue. All of this clearly sets the stage positively for 2023, with Josh and I working together with all of the brand teams to drive revenue growth over time.\nAnd now operator, let's open up the call for questions."

Donald\n\nCEO, Chief Climate Officer, President & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our business update conference call. I am Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. I'm joined today telephonically by our Chairman, Micky Arison, who is in Europe. And here with me in Miami. David Bernstein, our Chief Financial Officer; Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; and as part of our previously announced transition, our Chief Operations Officer, Josh Weinstein. Thank you all for joining us this morning.\nNow before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release.\nThis is my final business update as CEO. While very disappointingly, our share price unfortunately reflects the current market conditions, I am nonetheless very proud of all that the team has accomplished over the last 9 years. I am especially proud of how well we have collectively overcome what seemed like insurmountable obstacles at times these last few years.\nAnd I remain very excited about our future. With cash from operations now turning positive, we have reached an inflection point and, in fact, turned the corner and are headed on a positive trajectory. I'm not only excited about, I am also very confident in the future of our company, and I'm looking forward to its continuous success. I strongly believe in this team and we are enjoying a smooth transition.\nAs Vice Chairman, far and away, my number one responsibility will be to support Josh and his management team as they work to build on the current momentum. Josh is a proven executive. He is well respected throughout the company. He served in key leadership roles. He's driven strong business results during his tenure. And he played an integral part in tuning the company through the global pandemic. Josh's thorough understanding of our industry, of our operations and our business strategy puts him in a strong position to lead the next phase of our company's journey. With his vision, intensity and core values truly aligned with those that characterize our company, I cannot think of anyone better suited for this role than Josh.\nNow turning to our business results. It is reinforcing to see the continued strength and demand for cruise. We are aggressively, yet thoughtfully, ramping up to full operations, with over 90% of the fleet now in service. And at the same time, we are driving occupancy higher on those ships that have been sailing and we are focused on improving pricing compared to pre-COVID levels.\nAs we had indicated, for the 20 ships that restarted over the last quarter, occupancy has been intentionally constrained. That said, occupancy increased from 54% last quarter to 69% this quarter, while we also increased available capacity by 25%. Now the combination drove an over 60% sequential improvement in passengers carried. In fact, we carried over 1.6 million guests this past quarter. And partly in the month of June, we are already approaching 80% occupancy and, again, on even higher capacity.\nNow what makes that even more impressive is we were able to achieve that in an environment of uncertainty, given frequently changing protocols, including those that were far more restrictive than those in broader society and that were far more restrictive than those found even in other portions of the travel and leisure sector.\nWhile thankfully, vaccination and test requirements are starting to relax given the improvement in the state of the virus, we continue, nonetheless, to face constraints in the pool of potential guests due to ongoing requirements in a number of places. Yet, we have been able to make very meaningful progress.\nAs you know, the CDC recently lifted the testing requirements for reentry into the U.S. for air travel which, going forward, clearly removes some of the friction from our North American brands deployment in both Europe and due to Canadian embarkation Alaska. Usually requiring a longer duration flight, these itineraries are typically associated with longer lead times. Consequently, we expect the real benefit to be realized in 2023 and beyond.\nImportantly, customer deposits increased by $1.4 billion in the second quarter, topping $5 billion. Now we have seen a continued increase in express demand, and we expect to see that demand continue to build as protocols are further relaxed and as society becomes increasingly comfortable managing the virus.\nConcerning the threat of global recession, while not recession-proof, our business has proven to be recession-resilient time and again. As we have seen in prior cycles, even in downturns, employed people take vacations. And that's even more true in today's environment where people prioritize spending on experiences over spending on things. Cruise remains an especially appealing vacation option during downturns because of its compelling value proposition relative to land-based alternatives. Also, there is pent-up demand for travel globally which is a powerful tailwind.\nCurrently, we are seeing success for close-to-home cruises, with many sailings achieving occupancy at or above 100%, where guests perceive far less friction than with international embarkations. In fact, our Carnival Cruise Line brand, sailing its entire fleet, is expected to reach nearly 110% occupancy during our third quarter.\nWe also saw an improvement in new-to-cruise guests in the second quarter, and we have begun to ramp up our advertising efforts selectively to help support attracting first-time cruisers.\nConcerning pricing. We remain focused on improving price through next year. We are focused on optimizing the occupancy while preserving long-term pricing. In this current environment of travel restrictions and health protocols where we have coast unavailability, we use [OPay] channels and limited promotions to capitalize on near-term demand.\nWe are building on our aggressive fleet optimization efforts. Given challenges in parts of Europe, we have reallocated capacity to capitalize on markets where there is stronger demand. In fact, we just announced an especially creative approach that we think holds great promise-, the launch of Costa by Carnival. With Costa by Carnival, we bring the ambience and beauty of Italy to Carnival Cruise Line guests. Costa Venezia, Costa Firenze, both newly introduced and both spectacular, will be managed by Carnival Cruise Line, catering to Carnival's guest base beginning in the spring of '23 and 2024, respectively.\nThis new concept will offer a unique experience for Carnival guests to choose fun, Italian style while capitalizing on Costa's beautiful Italian design elements. Deployment for Venezia will be announced shortly and will represent a new itinerary option for Carnival guests.\nSeparately, we also announced the transfer of Costa Luminosa to the Carnival brand beginning in November 2022 catering to Australian guests. Now with these changes, the Carnival brand will replenish capacity that have been removed from recent ship exits and contribute to manage growth for the brand. These new and differentiated product offerings enable us to capitalize on demand among Carnival Cruise Line guests and strengthen return on invested capital across our portfolio.\nIn addition, we continue to further optimize our fleet and have announced a removal of an additional smaller, less efficient ship, bringing the total to 23 ships to be removed from the fleet since 2019. The accelerated removal of these less efficient ships, coupled with the delivery of 9 larger, more efficient ships delivered since 2019 fosters higher revenues over time through a 7 percentage point increase in the mix of premium priced balcony cabins and an even better platform for onboard revenue opportunities as well as generating a 6% reduction in ship level unit costs, excluding fuel, moderating the effects of inflation and enabling us to deliver more revenue to the bottom line.\nUpon returning to full operations, nearly 1/4 of our capacity will consist of newly delivered ships, expediting our return to profitability and improving our return on invested capital.\nMoreover, next year, our capacity growth compared to 2019 is concentrated in brands with our highest returns.\nConcerning recent fuel prices, we continue to aggressively manage our fuel consumption. Upon reaching full fleet operations, we anticipate that we will achieve a further 10% reduction in unit fuel consumption and 9% reduction in carbon intensity as compared to 2019.\nWith our proactive efforts to reduce fuel consumption, we actually peaked our carbon footprint in 2011, and that's despite an over 30% increase in capacity expected through 2023. In fact, we have reaffirmed and strengthened our carbon intensity reduction goals for 2030 and are on an accelerated path to achieve them through our fleet optimization efforts, investing in projects that drive energy efficiency, designing energy-efficient itineraries and investing in port and destination projects.\nDuring the quarter, Carnival Cruise Line broke ground on an exciting new destination project, Carnival Grand Bahama Cruise port. This destination is expected to open in late 2024 and will offer guests a uniquely Bahamian experience with many exciting features and amenities. Now this private guest experience destination will join Princess Cay, Half Moon Cay, Grand Turk, Mahogany Bay, Amber Cove and Cozumel, securing our strong foothold in the Caribbean. In fact, we benefit from a total of 9 owned or operated private destinations and port facilities, including terminals in Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Barcelona.\nAgain, I believe we have operationally reached an inflection point and we are heading in the right direction with cash from operations turning positive this quarter. We have a strong liquidity position of $7.5 billion and have already managed our debt maturity towers down through 2024. We have 91% of the fleet now operating and at improving occupancy levels, which bodes well for future cash generation.\nAnd while to date, travelers perceive uncertainty and friction continues to be a headwind as protocols become less restrictive and society continues to become increasingly more comfortable managing the virus, we expect to see demand continue to build, as we have already seen with the strength for Carnival Cruise Lines closer-to-home cruises.\nThe attractive value proposition relative to land-based alternatives, which is even greater today, and the continued strength in onboard revenues should help foster a good environment for pricing and should help to accelerate our momentum going forward.\nOnce again, I don't have the words to adequately convey how personally rewarding and inspiring the commitment, the dedication, the creative ingenuity and the phenomenal execution of our Carnival team, shipboard and shoreside around the world has been. And that, of course, includes our Chairman, Micky Arison, and the rest of our Board of Directors.\nIn the face of constantly changing barriers and constraints, in an environment of continuous and extreme uncertainty, our global team of tens of thousands successfully tackled challenge after challenge after challenge, honoring our commitment to our highest priority of compliance, environmental protection and the health, safety and well-being of everyone while stewarding the shareholders' assets and positioning us for great success over time. I simply can't thank them enough and it's truly a privilege and an honor to work with them.\nThank you also to our valued guests. Their loyalty to our 9 world-leading brands and the countless letters and calls of support are so deeply appreciated. Thank you to our travel agent partners, who are more critical than ever and helping to deliver the great story of our cruise. Thank you to our home port and destination communities who have stood by us throughout these challenges, among other contributions providing vaccines and lobbying for workable protocols.\nThank you to our suppliers and other many stakeholders who stood by us and worked hard to meet our needs while facing challenges of their own. And of course, thank you to our shareholders, our bondholders, the banks, the export credit agencies for continued confidence in us and for ongoing support. We are indeed poised for a great future because of the efforts and contributions of so many.\nWith that, I would like to take the opportunity to introduce Josh and give him the chance to say a few words before turning the call back to David. Josh?\n\nJosh Weinstein\n\nChief Operations Officer, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, Arnold. And thanks again to Micky and the entire Board of Directors for this great opportunity. I strongly believe in our company and our ability to create happiness by delivering unforgettable and much-needed vacations for our guests. This need is even more important in the current environment given the stresses of the past 2 years and the value that we all place on shared experiences with friends and family.\nNow we are uniquely placed to deliver on this through our 9 leading cruise brands, each with a focus on meeting their specific guests' needs and wants. We plan on renewing our efforts to ensure each brand achieve clarity of positioning and effectively reaches their target audience. This, alongside providing cruise experiences that really resonate with their distinct guest base, will help each brand optimize its yield and growth aspirations to drive revenue.\nWe also expect to capitalize on our revitalized fleet, our continued portfolio optimization efforts and our unparalleled destination footprint, particularly in the Caribbean and Alaska. In addition, we have an exciting sustainability road map that underlies all of our efforts.\nWhat also gives me tremendous confidence is our determined and resilient team around the world. They've proven time and time again for the last 2.5 years that they can absolutely achieve anything and they do it while staying true to Carnival Corporation's collective values and positive culture. All of this will help us accelerate revenues and returns, drive durable earnings growth and improve the balance sheet.\nAs you said, Arnold, we are clearly at an inflection point and have a bright future ahead. I'm looking forward to putting the perspectives I've gained here in my 20 years in multiple roles to work for the benefit of our shareholders and our many other stakeholders.\n\nArnold W. Donald\n\nCEO, Chief Climate Officer, President & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThanks, Josh. We're looking forward to your leadership. David?\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & CAO, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, Arnold. I'll start today with a review of guest cruise operations, along with a summary of our second quarter cash flow. Next, I will touch on our 2024 mandatory auditor rotation. Then I'll provide an update on booking trends and finish up with adjusted EBITDA expectations and our current financial position.\nTurning to guest cruise operations. During the second quarter 2022, we restarted 20 additional ships, resulting in 74% of our total fleet capacity in guest cruise operations for the whole of the second quarter. This was a substantial increase from 60% during the first quarter 2022.\nAs of today, 91% of our fleet capacity is in guest cruise operations. We were pleased to see that the second quarter 2022 revenue increased by nearly 50% compared to first quarter 2022, reflecting continued sequential improvement.\nFor the second quarter, occupancy was 69% across the ships in service, a significant increase from the 54% in the first quarter. We were encouraged by the very close-in demand we experienced during the second quarter for the second quarter, resulting in nearly double the close-in occupancy gains in second quarter 2022 versus second quarter 2019, a trend we had anticipated.\nRevenue per passenger day for the second quarter 2022 decreased slightly from a strong 2019. As Arnold indicated, we are focused on optimizing occupancy while preserving long-term pricing. However, let's not forget the impact due to the future cruise credit, or FCC as they are more commonly called, which cost us a couple of percentage points in second quarter 2022 versus second quarter 2019. Excluding the impact of FCC's revenue per passenger cruise day, the second quarter would have been higher than a strong 2019.\nOnce again, our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the second quarter 2022 versus second quarter 2019, in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the past.\nWe have recently expanded our bundled package offering given their popularity. The new bundled offerings require us to make changes to the accounting allocation. As a result, in the third quarter, you will see more of the revenue left in ticket, unless allocated to onboard, impacting the onboard and other revenue per PCD comparisons for the third quarter as compared to the second quarter. Just another reason to add to the list of reasons why the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.\nOn the cost side, our adjusted cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD as it is more commonly called, for the second quarter 2022 was up 23% versus second quarter 2019. The increase in adjusted cruise cost without fuel per ALBD is driven by essentially 5 things: First, the cost of a portion of the fleet being in pause status. Second, restart-related expenses for 20 ships. Third, 24 ships being in dry dock during the quarter, which resulted in over double the number of dry-dock days during the second quarter versus the second quarter 2019. Fourth, the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols. And finally, inflation.\nRemember that because a portion of the fleet was in pause status during the second quarter and the higher number of dry-dock days, we spread costs over less ALBDs.\nThe first half of 2022 had an unusually large number of ships in dry dock as part of our resumption of cruising ramp-up, optimizing our dry-dock schedule while the ships are not in service and ensuring that the ships were great and work great when they welcome their first guess back on board. However, the second half 2022 dry-dock schedule looks more normal by historical standards. We anticipate that many of these costs and expenses driving adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD higher will end during 2022 and will not reoccur in 2023.\nAs a result of all of the above, we expect to see a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022, with a mid-teens increase expected for the full year 2022 compared to 2019.\nNext, I'll provide a summary of our second quarter cash flow. We ended the second quarter 2022 with $7.5 billion in liquidity versus $7.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. The change in liquidity during the quarter was driven essentially by 6 things: First, negative adjusted EBITDA of approximately $900 million due to our ongoing redemption of guest cruise operations, an improvement from the first quarter.\nSecond, our investment of $500 million in capital expenditures. Third, $200 million of debt principal payments. And fourth, $400 million of interest expense during the quarter. All of which was more than offset by a $1.4 billion increase in customer deposits during the quarter, along with the $1 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes we issued last month.\nNow I will touch on our 2024 mandatory auditor rotation. I wanted to take a moment to explain our situation as it is very different from most publicly listed companies outside the U.K. and the EU. Carnival plc, our U.K. publicly listed company, which is part of our dualistic company structure, is subject to U.K. law which requires mandatory auditor rotation. Therefore, PricewaterhouseCoopers, or PwC as they are more commonly called, must be changed as Carnival plc's auditor for the fiscal 2024 audit at the latest.\nTherefore, we conducted a competitive RFP process for the independent audit of Carnival plc as well as the consolidated entity, Carnival Corporation & plc. As a result of the recently completed RFP process, yesterday, our Board of Directors appointed Deloitte as the company's independent auditor for fiscal 2024. We completed the RFP process in the first half of 2022 to ensure an orderly transition of nonaudit services for the remainder of 2022 and to ensure independence by Deloitte in 2023, as required under U.K. law.\nBefore I continue, I would like to add that the Board of Directors and management of Carnival Corporation & plc would like to thank PricewaterhouseCoopers for its continued service as the company's independent auditor.\nNow let's look at booking trip. The higher March weekly booking volumes we talked about on our last business update continued throughout the quarter. This resulted in booking volumes for all future sailings during the second quarter 2022 being nearly double the booking volumes during the first quarter 2022. Second quarter 2022 booking volumes for all future sailings were the best quarterly booking volumes we have seen since the beginning of the pandemic, although they were still below the 2019 level.\nI am happy to report that booking volumes since the beginning of April for the second half of 2022 sailings have been higher than 2019 level. All of this reflects the previously expected extended wave season. And as I said before, we were very encouraged by the close-in demand we experienced during the second quarter for the second quarter, resulting in nearly double the closing occupancy gain in second quarter 2022 versus second quarter 2019, a trend we had anticipated.\nWhile the cumulative book position for the second half of 2022 is below the historical range, we believe we are well situated with our current second half 2022 book position given current booking volume, coupled with closer-in booking patterns. We continue to expect that occupancy will build throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023.\nPricing on our cumulative book position for the second half of 2022 was lower, with or without FCC, normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailing.\nFor the full year 2023, our cumulative advanced book position continues to be at the higher end of the historical range and at higher prices, with or without FCC, normalize for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings. This is a great achievement given pricing on bookings for 2019 sailings is a tough comparison as that was a high watermark for historical yield.\nDuring the second quarter 2022, we once again increased our advertising expense compared to the first quarter 2022 in anticipation of our full fleet being in guest cruise operations and our 8% capacity increase for 2023 versus 2019. Second quarter 2022 was the first time since the pandemic that advertising expense was above 2019 level.\nI will finish up with our adjusted EBITDA expectations and our current financial position. We all know that booking trends are a leading indicator of the health of our business. With improved recent booking trends leading the way, driving customer deposits higher, positive adjusted EBITDA is clearly within our sights. Adjusted EBITDA over the first half of 2022 was impacted by restart-related spending and dry-dock expenses as 34 ships, nearly 40% of our fleet, were in dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022.\nFor the third quarter, with over 90% of our capacity back in guest cruise operations and occupancy percentages building, we expect ship level cash contribution to grow. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be positive for the third quarter 2022 which, after everything we've been through, will be something worth celebrating.\nWith EBITDA turning positive, more liquidity than last quarter, debt maturity towers that have been well managed through 2024, we have already refinanced a portion of our 2023 maturities and we will do the rest over time.\nAnd now I will turn the call back over to Arnold.\n\nArnold W. Donald\n\nCEO, Chief Climate Officer, President & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, David. Operator, please open the call to questions."

Donald\n\nCEO, Chief Climate Officer, President & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nGood morning, and welcome to our business update conference call. I'm Arnold Donald, President and CEO of Carnival Corporation & plc. Today, I'm joined telephonically by our Chairman, Micky Arison; our Chief Financial Officer, David Bernstein; and Beth Roberts, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. We'd like to thank you all for joining us this morning.\nNow before I begin, please note that some of our remarks on this call will be forward-looking. Therefore, I must refer you to the cautionary statement in today's press release. Prior to getting into the details of the update, I just first want to say my heart goes out to all those affected by the invasion of Ukraine. I know thousands of members of our Carnival family are directly impacted and have love ones in the area. We, along with the rest of the world, are praying for a peaceful resolution.\nNow concerning our business. We're well on our way back to full cruise operations with 3/4 of our capacity having resumed guest operations and a plan to return the balance of the fleet for the summer season. And while the conversation around COVID-19 is greatly reduced, we still have to and are successfully actively managing.\nOur enhanced protocols have helped us become among the safest farms of socializing and travel with far lower incident rates than on land. In fact, we have carried more than 2 million since resuming gas operations. Our guests are enjoying great vacations, and we are enjoying historically high guest satisfaction scores.\nOf course, we have not lost sight of our highest responsibility and, therefore, our top priority, which is always compliance, environmental protection and the health, safety and well-being of everyone, our guests, the people and the communities we touch and serve, and of course, our Carnival family, our team members shipboard and shoreside.\nI'd like to start today by sincerely thanking our Carnival team members for their significant contributions which collectively have gotten us to where we are today despite a multitude of challenges. Through their collective efforts, so far, we successfully returned 64 ships to guest operations; enabled over 70,000 crew members to return to work, happy, healthy and vaccinated through our team's considerable efforts to secure and distribute vaccines; reopened our 8 owned and operated private destinations and port facilities, which about half of our guests have experienced since resuming operations, Princess Cay, Half Moon Cay, Grand Turk, Mahogany Bay, Amber Cove, Cozumel, Santa Cruz de Tenerife and Barcelona; and most importantly, delivered 2.2 million joyful vacations and counting.\nAt the same time, we also managed down operating costs, reducing our monthly adjusted EBITDA losses by 40% since mid-2020; completed a continuous stream of capital raising, exceeding $29 billion; refinanced more than $9 billion of debt, improving interest rates; amended over 100 different lender agreements; and successfully addressed our maturity tower out through 2024, all of which culminated in a consistent liquidity position exceeding $7 billion, an integral part of reinforcing stakeholder confidence. At our scale, the sheer volume of these accomplishments is no small feat. Yet these challenging operational deliverables were achieved while encountering strong headwinds like: Delta; Omicron; complex, constraining and constantly changing regulations and protocols; and more recently, the very troubling invasion of Ukraine, all of which undermine consumer confidence and generate greater friction on cross-border travel, labor, supply chain, itinerary planning and more.\nNow concerning the invasion of Ukraine. For the 4.6% of our capacity that was expected to call on Russian ports in the remainder of the year, we have decided to totally withdraw from Russia and have found attractive alternatives. That said, St. Petersburg was a marquee port for us. And while there have been times where we were unable to offer certain (inaudible) itineraries, in this instance, the close end nature of the deployment change does lead to some regional disruption in recent booking patterns. Now while the invasion has added some volatility to our business and does impact consumer confidence, with 50 years under our belt, we have successfully managed through a plethora of headwinds like: spikes in fuel prices, the Gulf War, Arab Spring, September 11, Ebola, Zika, SARS, MERS and more. And once again, the mobility of ships continues to be an asset. Time and time again, we have seen guests travel through challenges. In fact, Carnival Cruise Line turned 50 this month and recently enjoyed its 3 best weeks of bookings since resuming operations.\nAs we previously disclosed, we had experienced an impact on booking patterns more broadly at the start of our fiscal year due to the Omicron variant. Despite Omicron. guests carried grew by nearly 20% in the first quarter. Of course, albeit less than we would have otherwise achieved without the elevated cancellations which occurred in part due to a higher incidence of pretravel positive COVID test results as well as the difficulties that many prospective guests experienced obtaining timely tests. Moreover, there was just an overall impact Omicron had on our society over the course of our first quarter.\nHowever, we did maintain price as we said we would. We fully expect an extended wave season. In fact, we're already achieving occupancies in the month of March that are nearing 70% with more than 40 sailings exceeding 100% occupancy, a testament to the underlying demand for crews and closer in nature of booking patterns.\nConcerning recent fuel prices. It's certainly not the first time we've seen a dramatic spike in fuel prices. Helping to address that, we aggressively manage our consumption. And we are stepping up our efforts to further reduce consumption. Now historically, we have not used fuel derivatives. And while there is an optics benefit of smoothing earnings, over time, prices have gone up and they've also come down. But there is an economic cost to derivatives. Over the past few years, we're very glad not to have speculated with few derivatives because on a further drain on cash.\nWith our proactive efforts to reduce our footprint since 2007, we have reduced our unit fuel consumption nearly 30% and carbon intensity nearly 25% through 2019. And thanks to accelerated efforts across the board, upon reaching full fleet operations, we anticipate that we will achieve a further 10% reduction in unit fuel consumption and 9% reduction in carbon intensity as compared to 2019. In fact, we've been working hard to resume operations not only a strong operating company but a more sustainable, better all-around company.\nWe made further strides towards those efforts again this quarter. During the quarter, we enhanced our fleet optimization efforts, delivering 3 new ships: Costa Toscana, AIDAcosma and Discovery Princess, bringing the total to 9 larger, more efficient ships delivered since 2019.\nMoreover, we've announced the removal of an additional 3 smaller, less efficient ships, bringing the total to 22 ships to be removed from the fleet also since 2019. The accelerated removal of these less efficient ships has lowered capacity growth to 2.2% compound annually from the previous 4.5% through 2025, which should enable us to capitalize on pent-up demand on intentionally constrained capacity.\nThe fleet optimization effort will also foster higher revenues through a 7 percentage point increase in premium-priced balcony cabins and an even better platform for onboard revenue opportunities as well as generating a 5% reduction in ship level unit costs, excluding fuel, going forward, enabling us to deliver more revenue to the bottom line.\nUpon returning to full operations, nearly 1/4 of our capacity will consist of newly delivered ships, expediting our return to profitability and improving our return on invested capital. Again, we have long since recognize the importance of reducing our carbon footprint having peaked our absolute carbon emissions more than a decade ago. And we are continuing to innovate to effect change.\nAIDAprima will become our first ship to pilot battery power, enabling her to optimize the efficiency of the engines while at sea, reducing emissions. We also signed groundbreaking agreements through our subsidiary, Ecospray, to partner in the production of green bio-LNG generated from waste sources. In addition, we continue to invest to drive energy efficiency, rolling out our fourth in a series of 23 ships with innovative air lubrication system, which reduces drag on the haul and generates nearly 5% reduction in carbon emissions.\nWe've also taken strides to reduce our impact on climate change and mitigate climate risk in our business. We are working toward full adoption of the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, that's TCFD, and have begun by reinforcing our strong governance framework with my assuming the role of Chief Climate Officer, and with the formation of our Strategic Risk Evaluation Committee to further support climate-related strategic decision-making and risk management processes.\nHaving broadened our commitments to ESG with the introduction of our 2030 sustainability goals and our 2050 aspirations, we are tracking ahead on both our important food waste and single-use plastic reduction efforts. And we are nearing completion on the rollout of more than 600 food waste biodigesters across our fleet, the most advanced technology of its kind.\nWe believe we have clearly maximized our return to service, and we have positioned our company well to withstand volatility on our path to profitability. Throughout the pause, we have been proactively managing to resume operations as an even stronger and more efficient operating company to maximize cash generation and to deliver double-digit return on invested capital over time.\nAgain, our cash flow will be the primary driver to return to investment-grade credit over time, creating greater shareholder value. There have been multiple demonstrations of the resilience of the human spirit and the resilience of our business. It is heartening that our company can be a part of bringing our guests much needed social enjoyment with family and with friends, along with the excitement of experiencing new destinations and cultures, all dearly missed throughout the pandemic.\nI referenced Carnival Cruise Line celebrating 50 years. 50 years, frankly, seems such a short time ago that Tad Arison started Carnival Cruise Line, and along with Micky, built the modern day cruise industry, bringing joy from millions of on millions of guests and creating hundreds of thousands of jobs with all that means and creating better quality of life around the world.\nOf course, it cannot have been done without the overwhelming support from everyone. So once again, thank you to our valued guests. Thank you to our travel agent partners. Thank you to our home port and destination communities. Thank you to our suppliers and other many stakeholders. And of course, thank you to our shareholders, bondholders, banks and the export credit agencies for your continued confidence in us and for your ongoing support.\nAnd again, I would like to thank our team members for their dedication, their commitment and their outstanding execution. We are excited to welcome everyone back on board. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.\n\nDavid Bernstein\n\nCFO & CAO, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, Arnold. I'll start today with a review of guest cruise operations, along with a summary of our first quarter cash flows. Then I'll provide an update on booking trends and finish up with adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations.\nTurning to guest cruise operations. During the first quarter 2022, we restarted 10 additional ships, resulting in 60% of our fleet capacity in guest cruise operations for the whole of the first quarter. This was a substantial increase from 47% during the fourth quarter 2021.\nAs of today, 75% of our fleet capacity has resumed guest cruise operations. Agility to continuously adapt to the ever-changing landscape has been one of our greatest strengths during the pandemic. In the first quarter, we continued to demonstrate this scale as we adjusted restart dates to optimize our guest cruise operations. And we now expect each brand's full fleet to be back in guest cruise operations for its respective summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income.\nI am happy to report that just last week, we announced plans for our Australia restart, commencing at the end of May after the government advised that cruising would be permitted beginning in April. For the first quarter, occupancy was 54% across the ships in service. We never expected to achieve our historical 100-plus percent occupancies for the first quarter since many of these sailings were confirmed just a number of months before departure, which resulted in less than the normal booking lead time. However, we had anticipated first quarter occupancy would exceed the 58% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe started the quarter with over 55% cabin occupancy booked for the first quarter and expected to improve upon that during the quarter. However, during the first quarter 2022, as a result of the Omicron variant, we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, including higher cancellations resulting from an increase in pretravel positive test results, challenges in the availability of timely pretravel tests and disruption than Omicron caused on society during this time. All of this inhibited our ability to build on our cabin occupancy book position for the first quarter 2022 during the first quarter, resulting in occupancy for the first quarter 2022 at 54% being lower than the 58% occupancy we achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nDespite all that, during the first quarter, we carried over 1 million guests, which was nearly a 20% increase from the fourth quarter 2021. Once again, our brands executed extremely well with Net Promoter Scores continuing at elevated levels compared to pre-COVID scores. Revenue per passenger day for the first quarter 2022 increased approximately 7.5% compared to a strong 2019 despite our lucrative world cruises and exotic voyages being shelved this year. Our revenue management teams held on price when we experienced an impact on bookings for near-term sailings, optimizing our longer-term prospects for future revenue and pricing.\nOnce again, our onboard and other revenue per diems were up significantly in the first quarter 2022 versus the first quarter 2019, in part due to the bundled packages as well as onboard credits utilized by guests from cruises canceled during the pause. We had great growth in onboard and other per diems on both sides of the Atlantic. Increases in bar, casino, shops, spa and Internet led the way onboard. Over the past 2.5 years, we have offered and our guests have chosen more and more bundled package options. In the end, we will see the benefit of these bundled packages in onboard and other revenue. As a result of these bundled packages, the line between passenger ticket and onboard revenue is blurred. For accounting purposes, we allocate the total price paid by the guests between the 2 categories. Therefore, the best way to judge our performance is by reference to our total cruise revenue metrics.\nOn the cost side, our adjusted cruise cost without fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD as it is more commonly called, for the first quarter 2022 was up 25%. I did say adjusted cruise costs and not net cruise costs, a term we had previously used. The calculation of adjusted cruise costs and net cruise costs are the same. However, we felt the new name more appropriately lined up with our other non-GAAP measures of adjusted net income and adjusted EBITDA, which are also referenced in our business update press release issued earlier this morning.\nThe increase in adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD is driven essentially by 5 things: first, the cost of a portion of the fleet being in pause status; second, restart related expenses; third, 15 ships being in dry dock during the quarter, which resulted in nearly double the number of dry dock days during the first quarter versus the first quarter 2019; fourth, the cost of maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols; and finally, inflation. Remember, that because a portion of the fleet was in pause status during the first quarter and the higher number of dry dock days, we spread costs over less ALBDs.\nI did want to point out that in the second quarter of 2022, we expect a further 24 ships to enter dry dock as part of our resumption of cruising ramp-up, optimizing our dry dock schedule while the ships are not in service and ensuring that the ships look great when they welcome their first guests back onboard. This will again result in a doubling of the dry dock days during the quarter compared to 2019, which will impact adjusted cruise cost without fuel per ALBD during the second quarter. We anticipate that many of these costs and expenses driving adjusted cruise costs without fuel per ALBD higher will end during 2022 and will not reoccur in 2023. As a result of all of the above, we expect to see a significant improvement in adjusted cruise costs, excluding fuel per ALBD, from the first half of 2022 to the second half of 2022 with a low double-digit increase expected for the full year 2022 compared to 2019.\nNext, I'll provide a summary of our first quarter cash flows. We ended the first quarter 2022 with $7.2 billion in liquidity versus $9.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we believe we remain well positioned given our liquidity. The change in liquidity during the quarter was driven essentially by 4 things: first, an improved negative adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion due to our ongoing resumption of guest cruise operations despite the impact of the Omicron variant. We had thought adjusted EBITDA was going to improve more. But as I said before, the Omicron variant inhibited our ability to grow occupancy during the quarter, which limited the improvement in adjusted EBITDA. Second, our investment of $400 million in capital expenditures net of export credits. Third, $500 million of debt principal payments. And fourth, $400 million of interest expense during the quarter.\nNow let's look at booking trends. Since the middle of January, we have seen an improving trend in booking volumes for future sailings. Recent weekly booking volumes have been higher than at any point since the restart of guest cruise operations. During the first quarter, we increased our booked occupancy position for the second half of 2022, albeit not at the same pace as a typical wave season due to the Omicron variant. As a result, the cumulative advanced book position for the second half of 2022 is at the lower end of the historical range. However, we believe we are well situated with our current second half 2022 book position given the recent improvement in booking volumes, coupled with closer in booking patterns and our expectation for an extended wave season. We continue to expect that occupancy will build throughout 2022 and return to historical levels in 2023. And importantly, I am happy to report that prices on these bookings for the second half of 2022 continue to be higher with or without future cruise credits, or more commonly called FCCs, normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings.\nOur cumulative advanced book position for the first half of 2023 continues to be at the higher end of the historical range, also at higher prices with or without FCCs normalized for bundled packages as compared to 2019 sailings. This is a great achievement given pricing on bookings for 2019 sailings is a tough comparison as that was a high watermark for historical yields.\nI will finish up with our adjusted EBITDA and net income expectations. We all know that booking trends are a leading indicator of the health of our business. With improved recent booking trends leading the way, driving customer deposits higher, positive adjusted EBITDA is clearly within our sights. Over the next few months, we expect ship level cash contribution to grow as more ships return to service and as we build on our occupancy percentages.\nHowever, as I've already said, adjusted EBITDA over the first half of 2022 has been or will be impacted by the restart-related spending and dry dock expenses as 39 ships, over 40% of our fleet, will have been in dry dock during the first half of fiscal 2022. Given all these factors combined, we expect monthly adjusted EBITDA to continue to improve and turn consistently positive at the beginning of our summer season.\nWe continue to expect a net loss for the second quarter of 2022 on both a U.S. GAAP and adjusted basis. However, we expect the profit for the third quarter of 2022. For the full year, we do expect a net loss. Looking to brighter days ahead in 2023, with the full fleet back in service all year, 8% more capacity than 2019 and improved fleet profile with nearly 1/4 of our capacity consisting of newly delivered ships, continuing momentum on our outstanding Net Promoter Scores and occupancy returning to historical levels, we are looking forward to providing memorable vacation experiences to nearly 14 million guests and generating potentially greater adjusted EBITDA than 2019.\nAnd now I'll turn the call back over to Arnold.\n\nArnold W. Donald\n\nCEO, Chief Climate Officer, President & Director, Carnival Corporation & plc\n\nThank you, David. Operator, please open the call for questions."

This concludes today's\n\nOkay. Thank you. Have a good holiday.\n\nAs we develop and change those plans, real.\n\nknow , 3.5% , thing for give or take It's . That's it's a metric we look at . But it's not not the that ends the discussion about how much people should be spending on metric advertising , because as you can probably appreciate , there's a lot behind it .\n\ntrying to do what we We're just think is , is the right thing , is the right our brands and our about , business .\n\nAnd we're talking about how do we optimize . Once you get below that to make sure that we're being put the right way in front of the right potential guests guests or close the booking to to as far as as far as how we're seeing the advertising , you know , it's not it's not like it's spiking dramatically over as a , as a percentage of , of of revenue .\n\nI think I think it's fair to say , though , there will still be top of funnel things that always going we're to want to do to get into the consideration set .\n\nI think , over the and we just we need to make sure we're keeping next five years , pace . So that so we are reallocating dollars as we as we talk with our , our our operators about how they need to spend differently to , to to adjust to that .\n\nbe And we've we have to be nimble and we have to be really thoughtful about got to the fact that the world is going to change dramatically .\n\nSo, that's that is, I think that's just going to be a common theme as we move ahead over the next several years.\n\nAnd how are we marrying all of that up ? And so there are lots of things that are already in place because not surprisingly , there are third , third party companies that have tools already available that we're taking advantage of to make sure that we're keeping pace with the consumers are way that changing how they go about looking for not just the vacation , but frankly , anything nowadays .\n\nso Yeah . Well , I'll talk about the last part first . And you're 100% correct . is one of the fastest It changing areas of our business when it comes to technology use of AI tools , not only by us , but by the consumer .\n\n?\n\nI mean, how do you think about targeting as a consumer's way to get to shifting—maybe particularly in the digital landscape, then?\n\nthink that was called out as something you will increase 26 . Can you talk more in about where you ended with marketing as a percent of sales in how you 25 , think for 26 , and then I you know , there's a lot of talk about the way to get to consumers kind of changing with SEO and maybe things like that being less effective .\n\nThanks for keeping it in alphabetical order, with the 'Z' coming last. I wanted to ask about Mark.\n\nThank final question will\n\nYou. Operator, I think we've got time for one more.\n\nGood stuff . Thanks .\n\nSo, no specific formula to give. I think it's—yeah—but it's fair to say that that's the approach.\n\nIt's part of the arsenal to put out promotions to make people interested in what we have to offer and get our base of business, and hopefully generate as much revenue as we can on as many happy guests as we can.\n\nWe have been, like I said before, you know, we've been doing this over the years. Our yields in the last couple of quarters are up 17%.\n\nAnd because we have evolved over the last several years and will continue to with bundled pricing and packages , you know , it does it does change the dynamic about how we can , you position ourselves in the know , and do things and make folks think that , you know , and understand that it's a great value .\n\nAnd at the same time , you know , we get making sure folks on board that happy are and spending money not only in the ticket , but the onboard .\n\nI think in a , in a rational basis , in a way that we want to price integrity in the market for us .\n\nMany decades . goes and it gets And it absorbed . and it And we and we move comes along and , and I any don't feel different about the long term in light of what this particular instance is , because we do that well very with respect to , you know , the philosophy , you know , look , I think , I think it is fair to say that we are we are thinking and acting .\n\nYeah. And we have successfully absorbed elevated supply in the Caribbean before, and in Europe, and Alaska many times over the last—\n\nAnd Sure . I think that's a great intro . I mean , you know , first of all , let me just say real clearly the Caribbean is and it always will be a fantastic market for us .\n\nThanks .\n\n, I mean , I know you've talked about maximizing revenue , but if you could just talk like , holistically or , you know , how that's changed versus versus history , I think would be helpful just given I think that's a big , big deal here .\n\nSo can you just . I know a little bit you talked about this , Josh , but just on core pricing versus occupancy , like what biggest the change to me seems to be that Carnival is less willing to discount to So fill .\n\nI think one of I mean , not ago , I think we were too long talking about Alaska as having too much supply at one point , but it normalized pretty quickly .\n\nAnd then I know there's been a lot of talk about the Caribbean, but it's pretty normal in this industry to have big swings from time to time in supply.\n\nYou know , that should get us around a triple B rating . And we feel that that is strong at this point in time for for a company like ours okay .\n\nSo we are moving in the right direction and feel very good about that. I would say we had said sub-three, but overall we're probably targeting something in the range of 2.75.\n\nSure . So , you know , overall , if you calculate our using guidance , where we'll wind year , we will wind up less than three , we wind up up the at about 2.8 times .\n\nI think that you have naturally come and do this year in general. Thanks.\n\ntargeting . I said sub three . think you David , just why is that the right level ? And is there a desire to go above and beyond the 2.6 billion ?\n\nHi , everyone . Thank you . Just on the balance sheet , you've obviously done a tremendous amount of I think you're work .\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThank you. You too.\n\nThanks . Happy holidays .\n\nThey have been doing it, and I expect that will continue.\n\nAnd keep a little bit more price integrity overall . And generate more in the long run . So , and we we give our so brands rightly so the , the leeway to do that .\n\nAnd I think doing it the right way . And so , you know , there's always going to be opportunity to to figure out on the fringes whether it's worth , you know , getting the last few people on board or it's not .\n\nWe still end up with more revenue than what our forecast was, because we're managing, and our teams are managing, that balance.\n\nYou know , going three places over right at the end of the day , we want people to maximize revenue . And that's why , you know , we could we could miss an occupancy by a little bit .\n\nSure . And I think that's a fair call out . We are not mandating I am not mandating to my teams . You better sail full to the , you know , to the last decimal point .\n\nThanks .\n\nJust relative to the past , given that prices are at an all time high and maybe the experience improves with fewer people on the ship , so maybe how is that occupancy being optimized in the year ahead ?\n\nTailwind for what we have to offer because we are an amazing value. We give an amazing experience and can help you make your money go farther than what the land-based alternatives are.\n\nIt's been a pretty constant theme for a long time , and it certainly was in the fall , as you heard , not only us and people in the cruise space talk , but I think as you hear retailers talk and as we've been getting into the holiday seasons and people are looking to make sure that they they are getting the most they can get for the money that they spend .\n\nThey live in the same world as every other consumer does . And they see the headlines and , and they're looking I think in a lot of cases , to figure out how do they get more value for what they're spending .\n\nSo it's certainly in , in , in the middle class and up . Now , having said that , you know , our guests don't live in a vacuum .\n\nI would say . And asked before , when about our you think this has been US consumer across , you know , the big brands that we've got in the US , excluding seaborne , you know , the , the range of our , of our , of our household income is something in the 100 to $150,000 range .\n\nYeah , So , you know , when you look at the sure . segments , you got contemporary , luxury . You know , premium and we're not seeing any meaningful difference across the segments .\n\nIs there any way to parse that out to a better degree for us?\n\nCan you talk a little bit about the behavior of consumers income levels ? Because we've been hearing a lot between about this K-shaped demand patterns and how they've differentiated , you know , are we seeing things like seaborne consumers being more resilient than carnival consumers or vice versa ?\n\nHey . Good question morning . Nice guys . Can I ask a little bit quarter about consumer demand ? I think you guys did a nice job dissecting demand by geography , but maybe .\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jaime Katz with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThanks , David .\n\nMe too . Thanks .\n\nSo, we feel very good about the decision, and we finally got to it.\n\nAnd so we feel very good about the situation . And it also streamlines reporting and , and simplifies governance . And other things for us .\n\nneighborhood . You know , and so and the payback on this ? quick . It's Yeah , that less than just two years .\n\nthat's the\n\nHelps. Is that the neighborhood? David Every.\n\nYou know , upfront ongoing , you know , thinking , you know , a few million and dollars , you know , up front and maybe a few million as an ongoing little bit .\n\nAnd as my follow up , one more for you , David . Sorry , Josh , on the thank you . On the listing , you know , presume that there could be a couple of bucks of cost savings .\n\n.\n\nSo what we have to do, and what we focus on continually, is being most efficient with every single dollar we spend and finding ways to do more with less.\n\nWe're doing Shoreside as well that . . You know , shoreside , you find that obviously , you know , somebody could say your advertising expense is variable , but in the long run , it really isn't .\n\nHowever , that doesn't mean that you can't find better ways and optimize the business by doing things differently , which is whether it's using AI being or other things in order to improve your cost structure .\n\nSo once you that have basic premise in the business , you you're basically know what saying is a ship , ship size , most of your are costs fixed .\n\nSo , you know , that's a difficult question to answer because , you know , we do operate at full capacity and essentially sell every cabin .\n\nYou I know we're know , not going to be able to predict the future necessarily , but we'd love to get a sense for how we might find leverage in the model should it turn out to be a better year than anticipated .\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my question, David. Could you just help us a bit with fixed versus variable costs within where you're at today?\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Katz with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\n\nLizzie Thanks , .\n\nyou Thank .\n\nAnd we can't wait to show our guests them both for much of our capacity on the same itinerary. So we're looking forward to that.\n\nI would say we’re trying to make them very distinct and different experiences. And I think you are going to be delighted with that.\n\nWe'll continue to learn and adapt over time, as we should. And we'll certainly be factoring in, as you said, you know, what are some lessons learned that could be translatable to Half Moon or Relax Away.\n\nSure . You know , operations is is in line and the fuel consumption is too . So it's proceeding pretty much as we planned had .\n\nAnd it’ll give you the same answer, you know, we’re getting the ticket, which is the premium that we anticipated, the onboard output from the—\n\nFor asking again. So we celebrated just, I'd say, yesterday, one millionth guest coming to Celebration Key, which we were ecstatic to be able to celebrate.\n\nmore Well , thanks\n\nYou know, on the go forward, and as you kind of develop, relax away.\n\nYou said, 'go there.' We all make our own estimates of ticket yield contribution on board. Is there anything you can share—just participation rates, spend rate, what you are seeing on uplift, and what you're expecting?\n\nGreat . And then I know you get asked this every quarter , but I'll ask it again , especially in the in the context of to your net yield guidance .\n\nGreat . And then I know you get asked this every quarter , but I'll ask it again , especially in the in the context of to your net yield contribution This year , celebration Key has been open months a number of now , I think you've had a million guests .\n\nAnd so we're trying to appeal to as broad an audience as we can for the limited space that we have, which is good for being able to optimize our revenue recipe.\n\nWe've actually got maximum pretty capacity on our ships. So newcomers are welcome, as are our loyal guests who we love, as are folks who have cruised on others and want to try one of ours.\n\nWe're trying to always figure out how do we make the experience on meet and exceed expectations of our guests . And board as you've heard me say , we have a tremendously ridiculous price to gap between what ratio we experience our give to guests and what you can get in land based alternatives , and that value proposition , I think , is getting clearer and clearer when , when it comes to how we can market and talk about this now , because we don't have capacity growth in the next couple of years to speak of , of any of any of any real size , we don't have the situation where we're trying to figure get out more how do we people onto our ships .\n\nThat's when we know we're we're we're doing it right . And that's what we've been focused on . And of course , I always say , I talk about this the least , only because we're really so good at it .\n\nand the capabilities that we have . It's the performance marketing . It's the better and clearer brand messaging that's really speaking why to you shouldn't just want to take a vacation with us or a cruise with us , but you want to take a cruise with that brand .\n\nYeah. Hey, Lizzie. So, I think it is our brands getting better and better at their commercial execution up and down that silo. It's everything from how we do the revenue management and the way we use tools, right?\n\nHow much of that is maybe brand improvements in some of the brands that have been lagging, maybe more exposure to new-to-cruise, just anything you would be able to share that's helpful.\n\nYet you're seeing clearly . Congrats today . Great yield growth . Could you maybe talk more about what you think is driving same that , yield ship growth from here ?\n\nHi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go higher and just on a level strategy that you've taken. You have fewer ships launching than some of your peers.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Duff with Lizzie Goldman at Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHappy holidays. Thanks, James.\n\nGot it , got Thanks , it . Josh . And happy holidays .\n\nSo, we'll, we'll, we'll continue to, to stick to our strategy.\n\nAnd we also, frankly, see strength in our North American brands and European programs. So we're very happy with (a) where we're sourcing, and (b) where we're deploying.\n\nAnd then Costa we've got that's servicing , you know , the southern European countries , you know our , our European strategy . We think is , is very , very effective over the long term , as we've been saying for a long time .\n\nend of day , it . with our strategy and our approach , when you have the P&O You cruises , which is the , the biggest and best in the and Aida , which is the biggest and the best in UK , Germany .\n\nSo I'd Yeah . say , yeah , love know , keep clearing out of Europe . That'll be fine with You know , at the us .\n\n.\n\nRight . The issue is that a lot of that capacity is moving from from Europe into the Caribbean . I would think that given your relative exposure to some of your peers in in that Europe , maybe that's a net benefit to you guys , maybe speak to to that and dynamic whether or not you feel like you're sort of uniquely positioned Thanks there .\n\nGot it . And then I guess , you know , moving to the other side of the pond , obviously , as we think about global capacity growth for 2026 , very good it's in a spot .\n\nAnd, you know, we'll hopefully continue to, like I said, ride the momentum and keep improving the business.\n\nYou know , we overall , feel good about the business . You know , there are some specific drivers for Q1 that we we've talked about .\n\nWe had the impact of the volatility which is spring , having , in the you know , the outsized impact now , not not for the second half of 2026 .\n\nYeah , hey , James . So I think you've heard pieces of this throughout . So , you know , first of all , if you look at the first quarter versus the first half versus the second half , the comps are a lot different when it comes to the yields that we're lapping .\n\nYou know , that the Q4 yields , if anything , are probably going to be better than the full year . So just trying to understand the Caribbean context dynamic in the of all that , thanks .\n\nI think the Caribbean is a much larger chunk of Q4 as well, but it seems like, based on the answer to the previous question, that you feel pretty good.\n\nAnd then , you know , Steve's question , as we to think the about shape of the year , do you ultimately feel better as we move into the year about that Caribbean piece ?\n\nRight. So, 2.4% for Q1 relative to 3% for the year. Is that delta primarily just an outsized mix of the Caribbean in Q1?\n\nGood morning Hey . . So , circling back to the Caribbean conversation as we think about , you know , obviously there's some some one timers in the in the first quarter , you know , the Arabian Gulf deployment changes , but sort of your like for like numbers that you've given us .\n\n.\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Hardiman with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\n\nOkay . Thanks .\n\nYeah, this step function is over because we're at 100%.\n\nLike, are we clearly—is that step function over and now it just grows by, you know, guys do whatever you want to on a—\n\nTotally . No , I got you . I was just saying . Is there a smart way to think about the out years ?\n\nIt was 70% of the emissions allowances. So because of the step up, there was an increase. Plus, there was a slight increase in the cost of the EU allowances as projected as well.\n\nThe the increase was about $0.06 a share or about call it a roughly $80 million . Remember , in 26 we went from we to the went full 100% versus 25 where we were at .\n\nI could be thinking it's mistaken, but I have around $160 million for you in Q2 2026. Is there any way to...\n\nOkay . Got it . And then and then on the on the fuel side there was you know there's some rounding . So it's not like perfect math , but like there was it seems quite a step up in the emission allowance tax .\n\nAnd as we plan through 2027 , we'll get better visibility into that . But on the margin , it's kind of small . It's it's a handful of percent difference between the two pieces .\n\nEqual, this is what I was referring to. Now I'm just getting into a little bit more detail of the split between CapEx and OpEx, but we're talking about a really small movement.\n\nOne of the and it has swung both ways . I mean , one of the things that I used to that I've always said many times is the fact that not every dry is created dock day .\n\nSo, as a result of that, it is very difficult to project what will happen in 2027. You know, this has been going on for a long time.\n\nYeah , it's difficult really to to depict here because remember , we're talking about a very small movement on a large number , maybe 4 or 5% on over $1 billion .\n\nAssuming I understood you properly .\n\nDavid , I guess what's the To more typical your point , allocation as we think about the future as the 25 version or the 26 version , if that makes sense .\n\nThanks. Hey, for 26, on the cost side, it sounds like the two and a half normalized cost has six-tenths of a point for dry docks in it, with more opex versus capex.\n\nMizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThanks, Steve. Happy holidays.\n\nOkay. Gotcha. Thanks, guys. Have a good one.\n\nSo, relatively speaking, would I expect to see, on a year-over-year basis, higher yield increases in the back half of this year than in the first half?\n\nYou know , you saw the first quarter . I mean , the prior year , first half has much more difficult comparisons , higher increases yields than the back half .\n\nSo the seasonal between the quarters , as I've said before , is a it's a tough thing to forecast judges on full year the and not the quarters , but I it will be think probably less than the full year as far as the Revenue's concerned .\n\nHowever , keep in mind , you know , there's a lot of decisions left to be made on particular items and exact spending and advertising , repair and and other maintenance things .\n\nSo when you start thinking about the second, third full, and fourth quarter, I believe that they'll probably be all the full three quarters less than a year.\n\nYeah . So as far as cost is concerned , you know , the first quarter was saw , as you higher than the year .\n\nThanks .\n\nAnd I think we should think about the in terms of timing , you know , both of those metrics as we as we update our models .\n\nobviously we have Happens the first quarter guidance wondering , David , if you could help us think , you know , a little bit more about cadence over the last three quarters in terms of both yields and costs ?\n\nlook forward\n\nLet me put it this way then. Caribbean yields will be positive.\n\n. ask it\n\naccomplish . And , and how But we we've put it into the forecast . So I'm not sure if you want to try to take it from a different angle , but we about the way we've been tackling our business\n\nI will tell you that , you know , when the industry when you when you out is growing as much as back us it has , you know , it's , you know , that's just the feel good what about we've been backdrop .\n\nI'm not going to comment on our our competitors on any type of individual basis . I can you our profile is , you know , 4% growth over the last two years , between 25 and 2026 .\n\nYeah , I mean , I'm going to broker and record myself . Right ? I mean , you know , just I guess we're managing the business as we think is appropriate .\n\nMaybe a better way to to ask that is , you know , your ability to , to take pricing action right now in the Caribbean and then maybe how you're thinking about pure Caribbean yields in 26 relative to your your Thank 2.5% yield guidance Hey .\n\nAnd I know it's it's a probably haven't been asked about a lot recently . . You know . But but if we if we think about\n\nOf Steve Wadzinski, Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\n\nquestion you Our next comes\n\n.\n\nGreat . Best of luck\n\nYou know , sourcing , which leverage our scale , etc. . So we put in a substantial amount , which offset inflation .\n\nNow, as I—yeah. So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did put in about 1.1% of cost mitigation from efficiencies and other initiatives.\n\nIf anything ?\n\nWhat have you embedded on the cost the management side ? That could be potential offsets to the to the cost headwinds that are in your forecast .\n\nLast two quarters . You've you've shown really nice results on the cost side , I think you cited hundreds of items that you leverage scale as found to potential offsets to transitory cost headwinds .\n\ncolor . And Great then relative to your 3.25 net cruise cost outlook for the full David what have you embedded if anything , as it relates to cost , just management ?\n\nThat's great .\n\nBut this is our guess at this time. Best guess. Great.\n\nSo as always , we're going to try to , you know , we're going to try to exceed everything . That's always the goal .\n\nwe're fact that guiding to a normalized yield increase of of 3% , I think is very good . And I'd just remind you that if you remember what we've talked about with respect to the volatility last spring , it was really having an impact on the second half of 25 into the of first half 26 , which is which is what's been built in exactly to our to our forecast .\n\nThings happen differently in different geographies, and the diversity that we've got sets us up very well to be able to withstand the volatility.\n\nAnd so we just got to be prepared to deliver. In light of that, I just keep going back to the well. You know, the one thing I reiterate to everybody is the fact that things happen in cycles.\n\nalso know And that we're we didn't have the volatility of the spring on our radar screen this time last year . You know , things do happen all the all around the world .\n\nThe the that did play into it to an extent. I mean, we know we are going to lap some of the volatility in the spring.\n\nAnd it's based on some assumptions . So as far as stimulus specifically , we didn't we really didn't anything into that as far as , bake you know , macro impacts that we economic saw this year .\n\nManaging the curve and putting out putting out our , our product and our our guests who are experiences to looking for value . And that's what we do and that's what we've done over the last couple of years as our gone yields have up continue to do that with respect to all of the the ins and outs of 17% and we'll what's been baked in , you know , said like I before , you know , forecast to every some extent is a guess .\n\nYep . Hey the questions , Matt . Let me see if I can answer it , thanks for holistically . So as a starting point , you know , like I said in an earlier call , we are very happy with the momentum that's taken us through the end of the first quarter the last few weeks , and volume is up and into nicely , and we're doing that the way that always do we which that , is , you know .\n\nDid you bake in benefit for Celebration Key, Half Moon, anything in there for or against the tariff, lapping up volatility from a year ago that you saw in bookings, and did you put anything in at all for stimulus in terms of potential benefit?\n\nHave you seen anything irrational at all ? And does your for the 3% normalized yields for the year ? Does that require today's level of momentum to sustain ?\n\nMaybe the cadence of booking volumes that you've seen up through holiday prices in North America and Europe, which I think you cited at historical highs—and maybe even to say it a different way.\n\nGreat . Thanks . And congrats on another nice quarter . Thank you . So so , Josh , could you elaborate on on the momentum carrying into 26 that you cited specifically ?\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss, J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThank you .\n\nOkay. That's helpful. Thanks. Nice results.\n\nAnd we play in all of it.\n\nSo probably in a to answer roundabout way , your question , there is There is seven nighters shorts . and there's things that are even longer .\n\nAnd they'll continue to do that and do that thoughtfully . You know , we like the portfolio approach we're even into the taking Caribbean , because when you think about our our , our mix and you look at the first quarter , 20% of our Caribbean capacity is actually from European brands that have flight crew programs our into places like Barbados and Dominica and , and it works very well for us .\n\ngot you got there's all the seven nighters , you sorts shorts from got the from others , you know , comes when it to us , Carnival's know , been , you know , America's cruise line you operating in the Caribbean on shorts for , I don't know , five decades .\n\nActually, I don't have it offhand with respect to the first quarter, but clearly there is, you know, coming into the Caribbean, right?\n\n.\n\nhear A lot of it is in the close in market three . And four day itineraries . You know I don't know if you comment in terms of your want to exposure to that market specifically or if you could get in the kind of help us weeds and understand if you have , you know , a little bit of different mix versus what you guys see coming into that market for this first quarter , specifically\n\nOkay . That's great . Thanks for that , Josh . And then on the Caribbean commentary , you know , you know , we about that capacity lift .\n\nSo far, we feel good about the way our teams are going about managing the curve.\n\nTo port . And so the we have momentum has been good . We're doing things that we think are going to to help support the guidance and support the continue business , not only but 2027 and even that we're for 2026 , getting into 2028 .\n\nVoyage by voyage, we are doing the right brand-maximizing things to ultimately maximize the amount of revenue we have in the bank by the time the ship comes back.\n\nquestion . You know , your we're you know , as you said , we our revenue managers , brand the buy\n\nAnd\n\nWe had that heard been some some less robust demand . slight , slightly Still good , but it's not quite what some folks you what had seen last year .\n\nGreat, thanks. And congratulations on the dividend and the—\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brant Montour with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nThank\n\nThanks.\n\nOkay.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nquarter. Okay.\n\nSo, not much to say about the first.\n\nI mean, for our Q1 sailings, there's not that much left to go. And we are, at least at this point in time, a little bit better positioned—just a tiny bit—versus last year on the fringes.\n\nThanks. Yeah.\n\nIt's already has already happened.\n\nI know you mentioned kind of overall for the year and that you're overall for the highs. Would you say for Q1 that you're in line with those records, or are you further ahead than typical, or sort of in line with typical? Just when we think about how far past the point of digesting anything in the Caribbean?\n\nIn Caribbean capacity, and a lot of that really is focused on Q1. Typically, develops—at this point, you would be over 80% booked for Q1. If you could just kind of remind us where that is.\n\nOkay. Great. And\n\nAnd it's really something that takes off as we get into the latter part of November. But we're still right in the mix of it, as you know, and so we do need some more time to see how it all\n\nAnd as we always do around this time of year, you could say that Wave started early. It always starts early at this point, which I do believe.\n\nWe're always going to try to make sure that the close-in bookings are going to hopefully beat our expectations. But at this point in time, it's truly our best guess.\n\nSo I think the fairest thing to say is, hey, Robin, look, this is our guidance based on what we expect to happen. At this point in time, when we look into 2026, taking into account the business we've got on the books, the momentum we've got, and the fact that the world changes on a pretty daily basis—so we're always going to try to continue the momentum on the onboard side.\n\nThanks.\n\nIn other words, I'm just thinking about whether that acceleration and good close-in demand is in your guidance, or if that would really be upside to your guidance.\n\nFor next year, you mentioned that a lot of the acceleration in onboard spend and the year was due to better close-in demand. Would you say that, when you're thinking about your guidance for 2026, are you factoring in that those things will continue at that level, or are you assuming that those would be at the rate that you'd originally thought?\n\nAnd that was a lot of information that covered a lot of the initial questions. Maybe just one thing: when we think about your guidance, and it sounds like if we were just taking out the accounting accrual, it would be closer to sort of 2.8% yield growth.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nquestion.\n\nThank you. Our first question comes from the line of Robin Farley with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nFor participants using your handset, it may be necessary to pick up the speaker equipment before pressing the star keys. To allow for as many questions as possible, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and one follow-up.\n\nA confirmation tone will indicate you're lying in the question queue. You may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.\n\nWe will now be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad.\n\nNow, operator, let's open the call for questions. Thank you.\n\nNow\n\nWe intend to hold meetings of our shareholders in April to consider the recommendation. Subject to shareholders approving our recommendation, we intend to complete the unification in the second quarter of 2026.\n\nThis would create a single global share price, streamline governance and reporting, and reduce administrative costs. We favor stock trades and believe it will also increase liquidity. Major US stock indices would increase the weighting of the stock in indices.\n\nUnder our plan, Carnival plc shareholders would receive Carnival Corporation shares on a one-for-one basis, and Carnival plc shares would be delisted. Carnival plc ADSs would become a wholly owned UK subsidiary of Carnival Corporation.\n\nA substantial number of those have been unified in recent years for many of the same reasons we are recommending. We know of only three other major DLCs today. We are remaining.\n\nThis aligns with the marketplace. We are aware of 15 dualistic companies, or company or DLC DLCs, created over the last four decades, including our DLC in 2003.\n\nI'll finish up with some comments on the recommended structure. Simplification of our corporate structure, recommending to our shareholders that we unify the dualistic framework into a single company listed solely on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nThis results from the fact that all of the items that are expected to impact the full year will have a greater impact on the first quarter.\n\nCosts excluding fuel per Adjusted Cruise ALBD are expected to be up approximately 5.9% compared to the prior year, and higher than the full year.\n\nFirst quarter 2026 has a difficult prior year comparison, as 2025 was at a record level with a 7.3% increase compared to 2024. In addition, the quarter is being affected by the Caribbean double-digit industry-wide—the largest absolute growth—along with the first quarter having quarterly capacity in the Caribbean during the year, as well as the impact that volatility in the first half of last year had on our advanced booking curve.\n\nOur 2026 first—now, some key insights into the quarter. Yield improvement is approximately 1.6%, or 2.4% when normalizing for deployment and certain last-minute dry docks in the first quarter. Changes to our Arabian Gulf deployment also impacted the quarter.\n\nAs a reminder, while the program will be cash flow positive from day one, it does impact our yields in 2026. The impact is expected to be two-tenths of a point in 2026, half a point in 2027, two-tenths of a point in 2028, and turn positive thereafter.\n\nBefore I leave our 2026 guidance, I did want to update you on the impact of Carnival Cruise Line's new loyalty program, now starting in September, Carnival Rewards, which will impact 2026, impacting results for the fourth quarter.\n\nIn addition, this will result in $7.6 billion of $3.45 EBITDA, as we mentioned on the last earnings call. For the debt to EBITDA ratio under three times, while I'm happy to say, longer term, we're targeting a net report that even with four for 2026, we are projecting to get there by the end. Dividend payments are modeled into our guidance for the year.\n\nIn summary, putting all these factors together, our net income guidance for full year 2026 is over $1 billion, an improvement of more than 12% versus 2025, or 23 cents per share.\n\nThe net impact of fuel price and currency is expected to favorably impact 2026 by $0.20 per share, with fuel prices favorable by $0.17 and the change in currency exchange rates adding $0.03.\n\nBenefits from net interest expense, fuel consumption, and capacity will be partially offset by increased depreciation for a net favorable impact of six cents per share.\n\nAnd third, cost mitigation of approximately 1.1% from efficiency initiatives and further leveraging our industry-leading scale. Regulatory costs related to emission allowances and higher income taxes driven by Pillar Two will cost us $0.11 per share.\n\nWhile the total actual spending for our dry docks in 2026 is expected to be roughly in line with 2025, as a result of the nature of the 2026 work, more of the spending is expense and less is capital, classified as operating expenditures.\n\ndrivers of our normalized two and a half percent cost The three main increase are, first, 3% attributable to inflation and higher advertising expenses; second, about six tenths of a point from Dry Dock expense on our income statement; in 2026, after optimizing our Dry Dock schedule, we are expecting $604 Dry Dock days.\n\nSecond, the sliding of some costs from fourth quarter 2025 to 2026 will impact our overall year-over-year cost comparisons by about three-tenths of a point.\n\nThis is really a normalized rate of two and a half percent when factoring in two things. First, operating expenses for full-year operations of Celebration Key Grand Bahama, and the mid-year opening of our new pier at Relax Away, Half Moon Quay, will impact our overall year-over-year cost comparisons by half a point.\n\nTurning to costs, cruise costs without fuel per ALBD are expected to be up approximately three and a quarter percent, costing $27 cents per share for 2026 versus 2025.\n\nThe two and a half percent yield growth is worth over $0.35 per share when compared to 2025, which is a result of both an increase in ticket prices and higher onboard spending, which has continued to remain strong.\n\nNow I will provide some color on our 2026 full year December guidance. The 17% yield growth on top of over the last two years—we are expecting to deliver further yield improvement in 2026, with our guidance of two and a half percent, which is forecasting an increase of approximately, normalized for the Carnival Cruise Line, really 3% when loyalty program accounting and the last minute changes we made to our Arabian Gulf deployment and certain dry dock schedules are considered.\n\ngrade with Fitch and being one notch away with a positive outlook from S&P. All of this is expected to million improvement in net result in an over $700 interest expense in These efforts and our strong 2026 as compared to 2023, which is fully reflected in our guidance.\n\nIn total, we have reduced our debt by over $10 billion since the peak less than three years ago. Continued operating performance resulted in multiple credit rating upgrades throughout the year.\n\nWe successfully completed our $19 billion refinancing plan in less than a year. These efforts strengthened our balance sheet by simplifying our capital structure, reducing interest expense and debt, optimizing our future debt maturities, and enhancing our financial flexibility.\n\nNext, I will provide a recap of our 2025 deleveraging and refinancing efforts. We have reached a meaningful turning point, achieving an investment grade net debt to adjusted EBITDA-A ratio of 3.4 times as of the end of fiscal year 2025.\n\nThe balance of the favorability, four cents per share, was a combination of better fuel prices favorability and fuel consumption and fuel mix, slightly less depreciation than expected, favorable net interest expense, and a variety of other small factors.\n\nThis was 2.7 points better than September guidance and was worth $0.04 per share. The favorability was driven by both cost-saving initiatives, which we firmed up during the quarter, as well as the timing of certain expenses between the years.\n\nThe increase in yield was driven by improvements on both sides of the Atlantic. Second, cruise costs with our fuel per available lower berth day, or ALBD, were only up half a percent compared to the prior year.\n\nThis was 110 basis points better than September guidance, driven by continued strong close-in demand, which resulted in higher ticket prices and an acceleration of strong onboard spending.\n\nThe performance versus September guidance was driven mainly by two things: first, share, as yields came in up, favorability in revenue were three cents per 5.4% compared to the prior year, and that was on top of an increase of nearly last year's robust 7%.\n\nAnd then, as well as some key on the recommended simplification of our corporate structure. Turning to the summary of our fourth quarter results, net income to finish up with some comments was nearly two and a half times the prior year and exceeded September guidance by $154 million, or $0.11 per share, as we outperformed once again.\n\nI'll start today with a summary of our results. Next, I will provide a 2025 fourth quarter deleveraging and refinancing efforts. Then I'll give some recap of our 2025 color on our 2026 full-year December guidance, and insights into our 2026 first quarter.\n\nOver to David. Thank you for your results over the years, Josh.\n\nover to David. Thank\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over.\n\nThese accomplishments reflect the effort, support, and loyalty we've received from all of you. I continue to be very proud of what we've been able to accomplish together, while at the same time remaining incredibly excited about the continued improvement to our business and the runway ahead that leads to come.\n\nAnd that is something we do incredibly well. Thanks also goes out to our travel agent partners who have contributed immensely to this success. Likewise, a guest's, investors', destination—heartfelt thanks is owed to our loyal partners and other stakeholders.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is about delivering unforgettable happiness to over 13.5 million by providing them with extraordinary cruise vacations while honoring the people around the world, the integrity of every ocean we sail, every place we visit, and every life we touch.\n\nAgain, thank you so much to each of our team members at Shipping Sure who have delivered such phenomenal results in 2025 and set us up well for another step forward in 2026.\n\nAmid all of that background noise, we plan to deliver another double-digit earnings growth on top of the 60% increase we achieved in 2025, leaving us well-positioned as consumer discretionary and travel continue to outperform in the space yet again.\n\nAnd that's despite what will be an approximately 20% cumulative yield increase for us since 2023. So, while we are not immune to things like the lowest consumer sentiment in years, or capacity spikes in our most concentrated market, or geopolitical conflicts around the world, having two-thirds of the business on the books at higher prices underscores the resilience of our business model.\n\nAnd the good news is, the price-to-experience ratio compared to land-based alternatives is still at a ridiculous value and provides enormous headroom for many years to come.\n\nWe're also leaning into AI to further improve in areas such as marketing effectiveness and enhanced personalization, and to find further efficiency gains across the business.\n\nThey have been honing in on their target messages and markets, sharpening their marketing and reaching target consumers in an incredibly efficient manner. Moreover, we are continuously improving upon our yield management tools and techniques to generate the most revenue possible from our asset base.\n\nAnd we have positioned our company with the most diversified portfolio of world-class cruise lines in the industry, and in fact, we hold the number one or two brand in every major market. Our well-recognized cruise lines for cruising today.\n\nAnd our significant competitive Alaska advantage in the incredibly profitable Alaska trades will continue to serve us well for decades to come. On top of these important attributes, cruising has clearly become a mainstream vacation alternative.\n\nAnd as recently announced, we'll also be looking forward to a great guest experience in Ensenada, Mexico, showcasing what we're developing with our partners in the culture and natural beauty of Baja California, Mexico, that will greatly benefit our West Coast deployments.\n\nCelebration Key is a real differentiator for expansion at Relax Away Half Moon Quay later this year. This will soon be followed by Isla Tropical Roatan, and will be complemented as we lean into the rest of our Paradise Collection even harder.\n\nWe see much more pricing opportunity ahead as we transition our destination, which has historically been a utilitarian strategy, from what has been an asset base to a marketable growth driver for years to come.\n\nIn fact, we just kickstarted that a bit by calling the last of our convertible debt in the process, using some cash to take out 18 million shares.\n\nAlongside the dividend, we will We will also have ample opportunity to deliver even greater shareholder value over time, as we continue to reinvest in our future through our disciplined new bill program, return-generating vessel enhancement programs, like our successful Aida Evolution project, which will soon expand to several of our other brands, and our ongoing destination development efforts.\n\nReinstating the dividend reflects both our cash generation and the confidence in the durability of the structural improvements we've made to our balance sheet. We continue to delever to get below three times net debt to EBITDA, while still allowing for opportunistic share repurchases.\n\nReinstating the dividend reflects both our cash generation and the confidence in the durability of the structural improvements we've made to our balance sheet. We continue to delever to get below three times net debt to EBITDA, while still allowing for opportunistic share repurchases in the future.\n\nHaving reached a better-than-expected investment-grade leverage ratio of 3.4 times at year-end, I am pleased to say we are now formally resuming our dividends at an initial rate of $0.15 per quarter, which we expect to grow responsibly over time.\n\nWith this strong cash flow, no new ship deliveries this year, and the fantastic balance sheet improvements we've made over the last two years, we're about a year ahead of schedule and can now embark on a capital allocation strategy that will return even more value to shareholders.\n\nAll told, in 2026, we will bring over $350 million more to the bottom line year over year, and generate over $7.6 billion of EBITDA.\n\nDavid will provide more color around these two items—net cruise cost ex fuel per costs—but normalized just ALBD, are expected to be up about 2.5% for the full year.\n\nAgain, with no ship deliveries for 2026, we don't have the advantage of offsetting large cost increases with significant capacity. And, based on this, we've guided to unit cost growth of 3.25%, which includes a partial year of operating costs from our successful new destination developments, and the timing of expenses hitting in the first quarter of 2026 rather than Q4 2025.\n\nNow, even against that backdrop, we continue to drive the business forward, underscoring the advantage of our diversified global portfolio. We are also continuing to successfully mitigate inflation through effective cost management.\n\nAnd while I think it's obvious, to address the question we've been getting most often, our 2026 guidance fully incorporates the 14% increase in non-Carnival Corporation capacity growth in the Caribbean, taking that to a 27% increase in just two years, as well as our 4% growth over that time period.\n\nExpecting another year of the same—a fourth consecutive year of low or mid-single-digit per diem WEAR growth. Normalizing for the accounting changes from the implementation of Carnival Cruise Lines' beneficial new loyalty program, and late-stage deployment changes necessitated by geopolitical uncertainties in the Arabian Gulf, we are forecasting a 3% yield increase in 2026.\n\nThe disconnect between consumer sentiment and actual booking behavior continues to reinforce what we've said for a long time. Demand for our cruise lines is proving far more resilient than traditional macro indicators would suggest.\n\nIt is a true testament to the strength of the product offering across our portfolio of world-class cruise lines, and our guests prioritizing their spending with us.\n\nOur book position and recent performance are all despite Michigan's U.S. consumer sentiment readings dipping quite low for several months throughout 2025, and, in fact, last month dropping pretty close to its lowest level in recorded history.\n\nAnd over the last three months, we achieved booking volumes that were at record levels for both 2026 and 2027. At the same time, closing demand remained strong, as demonstrated by the outperformance in our fourth quarter, by our onboard revenue per diem significantly outperforming prior year levels, and our customer deposits up 7% year over year, hitting an all-time high for year-end.\n\nHaving said that, we are very well positioned to top 2025's fantastic results in 2026. We are already about two-thirds booked, in line with where we were a year ago—historical high prices for both at this time, and at North America and Europe.",

Please note today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Matthew Neisius, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Once again, I'm joined this morning by Sean Connolly, our CEO, and Dave Marberger, our CFO. We may be making some forward-looking statements and discussing non-GAAP financial measures during this session.\n\nPlease see our earnings release, prepared remarks, presentation materials, and filings with the SEC, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website for more information, including descriptions of our risk factors, GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, and information on our comparability items. I'll now ask the operator to introduce the first question. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, once again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star and one. Our first question today comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nGreat, thanks so much. Sean, Conagra Brands expects to return to positive organic sales growth in the fiscal second half, but also mentioned recent consumption trends in pointing to a low single-digit decline expected in the second quarter. What's driving the fiscal second half inflection, or is it really just easy year-ago comps? Do recent consumption trends that you mentioned sort of give you any pause, particularly in light of the planned tactical pricing actions that you're taking? To what do you attribute the recent consumption weakness?\n\nAll right, good morning, Andrew. Let me tackle that in reverse order. First, I wouldn't overly read into any recent consumption trend data. To the degree you saw any softening at the end of Q1, that was tied primarily to the two things I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is the shift of a major Angie's King Chicken Pop promotional event to Q2 and the initial planned elasticity effect of the inflation-justified pricing that we took on Duncan Hines due to cocoa costs. That's kind of the Q1 concept. This quarter in Q2, some of our major frozen events are planned about a month or so later than a year ago based on our supply ramp-up. That is pretty consistent with what we would expect in the full year, just a little bit of a shift in timing. Not much else to really discuss there.\n\nAs for the basis of our expectations for further sales progress in the second half, it will be a combination of volume momentum on frozen, where we wrapped last year's supply constraints, plus continued volume momentum on growing businesses like protein snacks. You have to also add what I'll call dollar momentum on inflationary businesses where we're taking price. That combination of factors reflects the horses for courses plan that we built. What I mean by that is we are investing to drive volume in frozen and snacks while maximizing cash via inflation-justified pricing and staples.\n\nGot it. Thank you for that. Fiscal first quarter came in ahead of expectations. Fiscal second quarter was moderated a bit in terms of your outlook. Net-net, do you see fiscal first half as potentially coming in a bit better than originally planned? Dave, how much was the benefit from trade expense timing to organic sales growth in the quarter? Thanks so much.\n\nYeah, Andrew. Taking the last part first, it was about 50 basis points of benefit in Q1, the trade timing, and then that will flip to Q2. 50 basis points in terms of sales. In terms of the first half, I would say given the flip in timing of that, given the fact that Q1 we had some benefit in inventory where we delayed some of the tariff costs, and now they're going to be coming in in Q2, I would say generally we're still on track with our original plan for the first half. There are different pieces we talked about in our guidance. We're a little favorable in interest expense, but our tax rate's a bit higher. There are obviously some puts and takes, but I think we're pretty much on our first half plan. Yeah.\n\nI would say, Andrew, that what I was looking for this quarter really were two things. Number one, can we get the service issues behind us and getting to 98%? Check. I'm feeling good about that. Second, once we did that and could start to resume our merchandising activities and rolling out our innovation, are we getting the consumer takeaway and are we seeing inflection on key businesses? Check, we saw that. The consumer is certainly not out of the woods yet. We're still seeing value-seeking behavior. We're still having to deal with inflation and tariffs. After a quarter, I think we're feeling good about the setup for the balance of the year.\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOur next question comes from Peter Galbo from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the questions. Sean and Dave, I just wanted to maybe touch on the updated core inflation outlook that you gave. I know you talked about some of the moving pieces within kind of the animal protein, but maybe you can just remind us, A, kind of how you're bought for the remainder of the year on some of those items. Are you kind of locked in now for the rest of the year? Just given that some of these cuts are very volatile and have moved, particularly chicken over the past month has maybe moved more favorably. I just want to understand the flex in that inflation guide as we get in the back half. Yeah. Peter, our original guidance, our overall inflation was approximately 7%. That's split 4% core inflation, and then 3% gross tariffs.\n\nThen we had mitigation, obviously, on tariffs of about 1 to 1.5% on that. We have our productivity, which helps us offset our core inflation. As we've gone through this quarter, we're seeing more pressure on the core inflation. There's been a little bit of movement on the tariffs, but generally, that's immaterial. The 3% gross tariffs we estimated at the beginning of the year are about the same. The increase in the overall inflation for the year is really coming from the core inflation, and that's really driven by the animal proteins. Particularly beef, pork, turkey, and then to some extent eggs relative to our original forecast. To your question about where we are from an overall coverage perspective, for Q2, we're about 85% covered. Certain commodities are fully covered, but then the animal proteins, which has been a pressure point, that's more spot market overall.\n\nWe do take positions and freeze them. We have capability to add coverage through freezing proteins, but generally that's more market and spot-based. About 85% covered Q2. For the full year, 60 to 65% coverage overall. Again, those proteins, we're exposed. If there's additional inflation or if the inflation moderates, we'll see a benefit from that. Great. Thanks for that, Dave. Very helpful. I wanted to pivot maybe to the balance sheet and the cash flow. Dave, I know you called out that there would be some debt pay down in that quarter. I've gotten a few questions this morning just on the cash flow generation in the quarter. It was a bit maybe lighter than expectations in some of the inventory builds.\n\nMaybe you can unpack both the debt pay down and how we should think about that in Q2 and the remainder of the year, and then just anything around kind of inventory build that happened in the quarter. Thanks very much. Sure. Let me start from the top. When we gave our guidance, we had forecasted that we would pay down $700 million in debt for fiscal 2026. That's from both the proceeds from the divestitures as well as $100 million from, you know, cash flow from operations to pay down debt. We're still on track with that. Actually, we included in our materials that we're going to have additional favorability from the tax legislation. We are estimating that at $75 million. We haven't built that into our specific pre-cash flow forecast yet, but that's clearly going to be a benefit.\n\nAs it relates to Q1, we have, and this is just solely timing. We built more inventory in the first quarter because remember, we were coming off supply disruptions, and we had to get back to service levels. That was a priority. We built our inventory, so our normal seasonal build affects Q1. We leaned in to make sure we had the right safety stocks on the areas where we had disruptions. You normally will see that in Q1. It's a little bit more. Our inventory on hand, we have more days on hand, but that's been planned. That's timing. We still feel comfortable about our full-year forecast as it relates to inventory. I would say we're on track. Q1's the normal build. In the first quarter, our net debt is down about a little over $400 million versus where we finished at the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nAs we said in the comments, on a rolling 12, we've reduced our net debt by $1.1 billion. We feel really good about cash flow generation, both where we are and how we're forecasting it for fiscal 2026. Just one other piece of perspective on that inventory build. Several of the peers in Center Store Grocery have really struggled in the last year to generate consumer pull against their brands, even when investing. We have not had that problem. You may recall we had six or seven quarters of straight line top line improvement as we invested after in the pursuit of volume last year, and we returned to growth in Q2. We have clear evidence that the brands and the innovation are working for consumers, but we ran into the supply interruption and we had to pull a lot of our merchandising.\n\nNow that we've got service levels back, armed with that confidence that we can generate consumer pull because of these products, we are absolutely convinced having inventory in place so we don't fall out of stock again and fail to keep up with consumer demand, particularly going into holiday season, is absolutely the right thing to do.\n\nAwesome. Thanks, guys.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Mr. Palmer, is it possible your phone is on mute? Just to confirm, the speaker room, are you able to hear me?\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWe can hear you. Okay.\n\nIt looks like we've got Palmer number two in the queue. Why don't we go there and we'll come back to Tom in a bit.\n\nAll right. Our next question comes from David Palmer from Evercore ISI. Sir, please go ahead with your question.\n\nOkay. Thank you. Good morning. Frozen entrees, obviously, it's been a great long-term category for Conagra Brands. Just looking at the recent data, and I know there's reasons for this, maybe some overhangs from some of the past supply chain stuff, but wondering, you know, what is your state of the union with that category? It looks like you guys are losing share and the category is declining. For years, you guys were driving the majority of growth in the category that was oftentimes growing at least a little bit. I wonder what your frozen outlook is, frozen entree in particular outlook is through the rest of the year, and I have a quick follow-up.\n\nSure. All right, David. Yeah, our outlook is positive. You know, the simple way to think about frozen meals is the category goes as Conagra Brands goes. That's been the rule for the last seven or so years. When we didn't innovate back in the day, the category didn't grow. When we committed to innovating frozen, the category grew steadily for a long, long time. Including, by the way, in our Q2 last year, I think our frozen business was up in the ballpark of 3%. We're coming off of a back half of last year where we had major service interruptions in that business. We walked away from major merchandising, and that hands our merchandising to competitors who then get in the plans, customer plans for a period of time while we're working to get service levels back.\n\nThat contributed, obviously, to us being a share donator, which is the first time that's happened in years and years and years. That's obviously a temporary phenomenon tied to our supply interruptions. What you're seeing now is our innovation is rolling into the marketplace. Our service levels are back to 98%. We're getting kind of back in the queue on these major events and feel extremely bullish about it. We've got some absolutely fantastic innovations that we rolled out last year that were interrupted. We're rolling out new ones this year, and they're already off to a particularly strong start. I will draw your attention to the new Dolly Parton frozen meals and frozen desserts that are new in the marketplace and performing extremely well. What's encouraging about that as well is they're not only performing well, that's a premium-priced product. That's a good mix for us too.\n\nI have tremendous confidence in our frozen business. To win in frozen, you've got to have scale and you've got to have an innovation machine. We've got the best in the business. We're looking forward to continued momentum on that business as we go through the year and wrap some of the weak spots in the last year or second half.\n\nThank you for that. Just a very general big-picture question. You're going to have those easier comparisons in the second half of the year, and you're going to be more on your front foot. I'm wondering, what are some, I don't know if there's exact metrics that you can share, but what are the things that you're going to be looking for in the second half that would really tell you that you get back to balanced sales and profit growth in fiscal 2027? If that is, the goal here is to get back to an on-algo in 2027, what would kind of let you know you're there? Clearly, growing against some of these comparisons may not be enough for that. Perhaps give us a sense of what you think would be \"good enough\" in the second half to show us you're really on track again.\n\nThanks. You know, Dave, you once said a good piece of wisdom for me. You said your hero business has got to be heroes, meaning frozen snacks need to grow. I think that is well said. I think, you know, for this company, frozen snacks are clear growth categories. It represents about 70% of our retail business. We've had tremendous momentum on both of those businesses leading up to the supply challenges we had last year. By the time we exit this year, I want to see real momentum and inflection on those businesses. We've already got it within the key strategic snacks businesses. For example, Slim Jim right now is tracking really well. SeaStore is coming back. That's very encouraging. Our new innovation on Slim Jim, which is our new Buffalo Wild Wings Buffalo Chicken Slim Jim, is performing really well out of the gate.\n\nThat's a very positive sign. On frozen, it's all about getting back in the queue on merchandising events with customers and then making sure that the innovation that we worked so hard to build performs. So far, it looks good. Those businesses with a positive trajectory as we move through the year, I think is a very, very positive sign for next year when we've got some of these margin clawback opportunities in front of us. That'll be a combination of a good-looking top line and an improving gross margin line as well. I'm looking forward to that.\n\nThank you very much. Our next question comes from Brian Adams from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Maybe just first a quick housekeeping one following up on David's question there. Q1 volume performance for refrigerated and frozen came in a lot better than I think maybe scattered trends would have suggested. I think in the prepared remarks, you said volumes for frozen itself were up like 3% or so. Was there any elevated shipments in the Q1 as you were finishing up restoring supply at shelf, or is this pretty consistent with other consumption trends that you were seeing?\n\nHey, Brian, the 3% number, that was the I was referring to Q2 last year when frozen was back growing strongly in Q2. Shipments were a little bit ahead in the quarter, which is pretty typical at a time when you've been out of stock and you're kind of replenishing. I wouldn't overthink this because if you look at our company on kind of a rolling four-quarter basis, shipments to consumption are almost always equal. For us, it doesn't really amount to much. I wouldn't overthink that piece. Anything you'd add? The only thing I would say is just if you're just purely looking at shipments to consumption within the quarter for R&F, that hit here, obviously, because the prior year, shipments were really strong. There's a little bit of benefit, shipments versus consumption related to hit here within Q1 for R&F.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Thanks. Yeah, not my best reading comprehension, I guess, there. On the margin clawback opportunities that you just actually spoke to, can you kind of just run through those high level for us as we think about '27? Some of the stuff, you know, like some of the costs you've had this year, like tariffs, that's not necessarily something you can assume goes away. I also know you have some work in process on the chicken, and then I'm not really sure the puts and takes on SG&A. Do you mind just running through those, Sean, as you see them today?\n\nSure. Absolutely. I'll tick off five things that I mentioned last quarter that remain intact. It starts with productivity. In fiscal 2026 this year, between core productivity and tariff mitigation, that number is just over 5%, which is very strong. By the way, Q1 came in right at that, above that level, which is a super strong quarter. That will continue. The supply chain team is doing a nice job. Second, at some point, we're going to get inflation relief. You said somebody mentioned proteins a little bit ago. Hopefully back closer to our typical 2%. If you look back 100 years as we have, anytime we've had these kind of runaway inflation cycles like this, there's always been relief on the other side of the hill. At some point, that'll happen. We obviously can't recall exactly when.\n\nThird, the advancement of our supply chain resiliency investments, including the chicken plants, will enable us to repatriate some of that outsourced production going forward at lower costs. Fourth, we are taking pricing in certain categories. After you get past the initial lag of inflation hits and you wait 90 days or so to get pricing in, you start to get the benefit of that. Fifth, I mentioned last quarter, we were kicking off an ambitious initiative to re-engineer our core work processes, leveraging technology, including AI. We have kicked that work off to accelerate growth and lower costs. We'll have more to report on that going forward. That's an exciting possibility. Between those actions and our ongoing efforts to reshape the portfolio for faster growth and better margins, we do expect a good margin expansion following fiscal 2026.\n\nOkay. Really helpful. Thanks, Sean. Thanks, Dave. I'll pass it on.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Robert Moskow from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi, thanks. I have a phasing question about Q2 volume, Dave and Sean. I'm just looking at comparisons versus a year ago on volume, and it would appear that, you know, the volume growth comp would get tougher in Q2 compared to Q1 because of the Hebrew comparison and also because you had a lot of frozen vegetable volume in Q2. Should I assume that volume growth is, or volume declines are similar in Q2 as in Q1 because of those comps, or is the merchandising activity enough to provide some sequential improvement in volume?\n\nYeah, Rob, this is Dave. We have obviously a ton of brands, and so there's a lot of moving pieces, a lot of dynamics on merchandising. Generally speaking, the volume that we had in Q1 should be similar in Q2. When you net it all together for total company.\n\nIn terms of growth, okay.\n\nYeah, in terms of volume and year-on-year growth.\n\nYeah, thanks a lot.\n\nYeah. Just for perspective, Rob, on the year-to-go basis, we had a strong investment profile in merchandising last year. We had to pull back on some of that in the second half. We have a very strong investment in merchandising behind this innovation for the year-to-go period as well. As I mentioned, some of those innovations which just are getting going now are already performing quite well. We are looking forward to that. You saw in the promotion chart I shared in the prepared remarks that while we've had some of the merchandising restored in Q1, there is room to go as we move through the back half of the full year.\n\nGot it. Thanks, Sean.\n\nOur next question comes from Megan Klapp from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHi. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to start with maybe a follow-up, Sean, to Andrew's second question at the beginning, just around how the quarter played out and how you're tracking so far. You made a comment last quarter that you viewed the fiscal 2026 guide as prudent given the operating environment. You've talked a lot about a lot of encouraging things that you saw in Q1. At the same time, consumer sentiment's weak. You've talked about value-seeking consumer behavior. Cost inflation's a bit higher. Just putting all those puts and takes together, I guess when you think about the fiscal 2026 guide today, you reiterated it. Would you still characterize it as prudent? Maybe where is the guide in your mind, you know, the most conservative? Thank you.\n\nI think it remains prudent. As I mentioned to somebody this morning, the two things I was really looking for in this quarter are we got to get service back, right? We had a lot of momentum. That momentum was very material. It was interrupted in the back half of last year because of service. We've got confidence that if we get service back, we will get the consumer takeaway. We got service back to 98%. That's good. The fact that the innovation is off to as strong a start this year, actually stronger than what we had last year. We had a very strong innovation performance last year in terms of not only customer acceptance, but the velocity of that innovation right up to the point where we pulled our merchandising, particularly in frozen.\n\nIt's good to see innovation out of the gates this year performing at an even higher level in terms of units per store per week velocities, things like that. That's a positive. Between that and the plans we've got calendared out for the balance of the year, I think the outlook is prudent. We're pretty optimistic about building that momentum that I talked about with Dave Marberger a few minutes ago as we move through the year. Specifically, this is a horses for courses annual operating plan that we built. There are some businesses where we've planned out the year to invest to drive volume growth, specifically frozen and snacks. We're seeing movement in the right direction there. I expect to see more of that as we get to the back half.\n\nThere are other businesses where we are facing more acute inflation because of things like in-place tariffs, where we're taking more inflation-justified pricing. There, it's about dollars. Between the volume plans that we've got and the dollar plans that we've got, I think it comes together and puts us in a prudent position.\n\nOkay, great. Thanks. That's a good segue to my follow-up, which is, as you think about implementing tariff-related pricing, which I think you said will come on late in the second quarter, have your views on elasticity and the expected elasticity changed at all, just given you're still seeing some value-seeking behavior with the consumer? If we just think bigger picture around the macro, the consumer is going to be seeing a lot of, it seems like, inflation-driven pricing start to roll in around the same time. Thank you.\n\nGood question. We track elasticities weekly, and we've kind of built in a historical elasticity expectation in categories as we built the plan. Specifically, what we've seen is within our categories, Conagra Brands' average elasticity is a bit better than our competitors' across channels. Further, at a company level, if you look at just total pricing versus total volume change, you'll also see that our elasticity has been a bit better than most peers over the past year. I don't feel like we are assuming anything heroic in terms of elasticities going forward, even in the face of the pricing actions that we've got.\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Max Gumpfort from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, thanks for the question. Sean, I'm curious for an update on the value-seeking behavior that you're still seeing. It's been a few years now. I'm just wondering how you see this cycle playing out and how you're positioning Conagra Brands to come out of this cycle in a better place. Thanks very much.\n\nYeah, I mean, I think you're probably hearing the same thing from just about everybody in consumer packaged goods on this. It is kind of this barbell economy where you've got higher-income consumers that are showing more resiliency and they're still spending. You've got lower-income consumers across different age groups that are being more discerning. They are absolutely doing what they've got to do to maximize their household balance sheet. We have to deal with that. Clearly, there is more value-seeking behavior that is evident in the lower-income group. Our job is to give those consumers the value they're seeking. With the portfolio scope that we have, there are a lot of great value choices. That's a big part of why sales are improving and so are shares. Going forward, we'll continue to put that value lens on our innovation and marketing effort because it matters.\n\nIf you weren't seeing this kind of behavior, I think if you look at our innovation slate over the last 10 years, you've probably seen it skew toward more premiumized products. When you have a large cohort of consumers that are value-oriented, you take a different lens around your innovation for both price-pack architecture and the kinds of innovation that you want to deliver. Why? Because the benefit of superior relative value is a benefit that's going to move the sales line. You should imagine that we not only have a good slate of great value offerings already out there, but it does inform our innovation pipeline going forward to make sure that we've got products that are very provocative, not because of maybe an ultra-premium benefit, but because of a value benefit.\n\nGreat. As a follow-up, it was nice to see service levels get back to 98%, enabling a recovery to some degree in quality merchandising and improved volume share performance as well. As we look to the remainder of the year, is there any color or guardrails you could provide on how you expect your promotional levels and your volume share performance to progress from here? Thanks very much.\n\nYeah, I'll point to some data that I shared last quarter, which is if you look across the group, and specifically the near-end kind of center store peers, what you've seen is that promotional levels in terms of % of total volume sold on promotion has kind of migrated back to just about pre-COVID levels. It's uncanny. It's almost pre-COVID levels company by company. We're a little lower than that because we're still recovering from supply interruption, but moving back toward that. I have not seen promotional levels go above that kind of pre-COVID norm. That's a positive sign, I think. The second metric we track is kind of depth of discount. You know, are we seeing this more broad-based desire to have a return to volume growth now leading to deeper discounts? The answer is no. We've not seen that. That's been that way for several quarters running.\n\nI think that's positive because I think what it shows is that it's a rational environment. You know, everybody is to some degree investing margin in the service of volume. I think that kind of keeps your feet on the ground here. It's been a rational environment, and I think there's room for us to do more in terms of merch. We've, you know, back in the right direction, but we're not back to where we were. Obviously do it in a very rational way. That's our intent.\n\nOur next question comes from Scott Marks from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nHey, good morning, Sean, Dave. Thanks so much for taking our questions. The first thing I wanted to ask about, coming back to some of the recovery of the supply chain disruption from earlier this year, you've spoken about obviously recovery in your own service levels, rebuilding of your own inventories as well. I'm wondering how you're seeing it from the retailer side in terms of their inventory levels relative to where they were prior to the disruption on frozen vegetables and some of the chicken products. Thanks.\n\nYeah, good question, Scott. It's probably not a lot of drama in the answer, though. We're not seeing anything particularly noteworthy. I would say pretty typical and nothing that I could report that would really be of any real news. Anything you'd add to that, Dave? Yeah, no. When we use the term service levels, they're very specific metrics in terms of where they are with their levels and inventory. Customers are kind of back where they need to be, generally speaking.\n\nGot it. Thanks for that. A follow-up question just on some of the chicken facility modernizations. I know you made the comment that you're still expecting the baked chicken facility to be completed in Q2. I think you're still working through a fried chicken modernization that's expected a little bit later. How should we be thinking about maybe cadence of recovery of the margin, let's say? I know you spoke about some benefits in H2, but just trying to gauge how we should be thinking about the restoration of margin from that perspective. Thanks.\n\nSure. The baked chicken project, that's the one we kind of started with. That's farther along. The fried chicken is kind of a newer development because the demand for fried chicken has just exploded in the last couple of years. We had tremendous success last year with our Banquet Mega Filet. That's an investment that will go on a little bit longer. In the meantime, it'll be an investment that moves some of that production out of house, which has kind of a double whammy in that we lose the absorption of not producing it ourselves, and we pay a tolling fee for that. That'll correct as we go forward as well. Baked comes on first in terms of the benefit, and fried will follow that. The good news here is we sell a lot of healthy meals and frozen.\n\nThese days, the ones that contain protein are the ones that, not surprisingly, people are really buying. Unfortunately, it's also been the inflationary part of the basket. We've got, you know, that's where we had a decision to make in terms of what are we after, short-term volume or margin. We fundamentally believe that the best thing for the future cash flows of our frozen business is to keep that consumer pull strong and keep our market share strong. That's why we're investing some margin in the short term to really get that volume cranking.\n\nGot it. We'll pass it on. Thanks very much.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question comes from Tom Palmer from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.\n\nThank you. Is round two here? You can hear me?\n\nWe got you, Tom.\n\nAll right. A third Palmer on the call. I wanted to just ask on the timing of inflation and kind of how it plays out over the course of the year. I think from the materials, it seems like to start off the year, maybe it was a little bit favorable to that kind of 7% plus. Is Q2, just given what we're seeing with protein, maybe heightened or just, I guess any help on kind of the cadence over the next three quarters as you see it today?\n\nYeah, Tom, it's Dave. The Q1, the real favorability there was for tariffs and timing on tariffs. The core inflation was kind of where we thought it would be, actually a little bit a tad bit higher. When you kind of look at Q2 through Q4 and you look at overall inflation, it's pretty consistent from a percentage perspective to the full-year guide of slightly above 7%. There's no material change in the year-on-year percentage of the inflation.\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you for that. Sean, I just wanted to kind of clarify, I guess, one item, and I know it's been asked about already a little bit, but it seems like you are seeing benefits from promotional activity. At the same time, as you have kind of taken some pricing initially, maybe you noted a little bit lower elasticity than you might see in the past. I mean, look, I get some of this is maybe we're talking about different products where these two are applied, but I guess in the current environment, are you guys kind of baking in that one of these two sides shifts a little bit to converge?\n\nI think what we're baking in, Tom, is that as we roll out our innovation and our marketing support, including our advertising and our major merchandising events, we're going to have the kind of consumer pull that we've seen in the past. That's on the more volume-oriented businesses. On the more dollar-oriented businesses, I think we've baked in a historically accurate elasticity level. Usually, that's around a minus one. We have not seen any elasticities to suggest that that is an overly optimistic point of view at all. I think in total, the outlook for both sides of the horses for courses concept is that it's prudent. I expect good consumer response in the areas where we're investing to drive volume on frozen and snacks as the year progresses. I expect there will be an elasticity effect on canned goods and some other things that we're taking price on.\n\nThey should be fairly predictable effects consistent with history.\n\nThank you for that.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, at this time, we'll conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Matthew Neisius for closing remarks.\n\nThank you, Jamie, and thank you all for joining us today. Please reach out to Investor Relations with any additional questions. Have a great day.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We do thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines."

Thanks, Melissa. And thank you all for joining our first quarter fiscal 25 earnings call.\n\nBefore we begin, I'd like to extend our sympathies to everyone affected by Hurricane Helene. We are supporting World Kitchen, American Red Cross and Feeding America, and we'll continue to monitor the situation to determine how we can further help those in need. Now let's get started on slide four. Q1 marked another quarter of progress in many areas. And I'm proud of the way our team executed within a dynamic environment. We took the actions we told you we would take And by and large, we got the results we expected to get. We told you last quarter that Q1 would have plenty of noise in it, and it did.\n\nBeyond the anomalies we planned for, we had one out-of-plan dynamic to contend with. Today, we will endeavor to unpack the quarter and provide a clear understanding of the underlying state of our business, which is encouraging. In fact, the most important thing for you to take away from our call today is that we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 25 goals. We had clear priorities for Q1 and delivered on all of them. We continue to drive meaningful volume improvement in our domestic retail business, including year over year growth in our strategic frozen and snack domain.\n\nOur share improvement stands out, not just in the absolute, but among peers, as we drove strong share performance across the majority of the portfolio. Continuing to drive our value over volume strategy in food service helped us sustain our margins at pre-COVID levels despite channel softening. We continue to advance our supply chain productivity initiatives, which remain on track to deliver one billion dollars of cost savings by the end of fiscal twenty five. And finally, we were excited to resume our portfolio reshaping initiatives with the acquisition of Fatty Smoked Meat Sticks, which expanded our leading position in the high growth, high margin meat sticks product category, as well as the divestiture of our Indian joint venture ATFL.\n\nOur team delivered on these priorities, despite an out-of-plan dynamic that pressured performance during the quarter, namely a manufacturing disruption that required us to pause production at our Hebrew National hot dog plant in the middle of grilling season. While we were able to fully resume plant operations, the temporary manufacturing pause resulted in lost sales. Revenue for the Hebrew National Brand was down 47 percent in Q1. We estimate that this equated to a 60 basis point reduction in total volume and a 90 basis point reduction in total organic net sales during the first quarter. The loss was particularly apparent within refrigerated and frozen, where we estimated that it accounted for 150 basis point reduction in volume and a 210 basis point reduction in organic net sales for the segment.\n\nWe estimate that the majority of the impact of this disruption will be isolated to the first quarter. Taking all of this into account, our results for the quarter were in line or above our internal plan for most metrics except organic net sales, which was impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption I just discussed. I'm pleased with our team's continued execution against our key priorities, which has strengthened the underlying momentum of our business. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 25 guidance. Let's take a closer look at each of our priorities, beginning with our volume progress on slide five.\n\nAs you can see, our proven playbook and strategic investments have generated continuous volume recovery in our domestic retail business over the past year. In fact, domestic retail volume performance in Q1 exceeded our expectations, and our volume recovery would have been higher, but for the temporary impact of Hebrew National. Importantly, as you can see on slide six, we delivered year-over-year volume growth across both of our strategic domains, frozen and SNAC. We focused our investments to maximize consumer engagement within these domains. And their return to growth demonstrates that our plan is working. Slide seven shows the volume trends in our staples domain.\n\nExcluding the temporary disruption in hot dogs, the rest of our staples domain also delivered sequential volume improvement during the quarter. And don't forget, Q1 staples volume was impacted by the elasticity effect of last year's price increase on our tomatoes platform. Since we wrapped those pricing actions as we exited Q1, this impact will wane going forward. And to give you a sense of the magnitude, staples consumption in Q1, ex-tomatoes and hot dogs would also have been positive. So overall, while we anticipate the consumer environment will remain a challenge in Fiscal 25, our proven ability to navigate through it gives us confidence that we will continue to drive volume across our business.\n\nEven more impressive than the strength of our volume improvement is our share performance seen here on slide eight. Achieving four consecutive quarters of share progress is a solid achievement in any period, but to do so amid today's challenging consumer environment underscores the strength of our strategy and the resiliency of our portfolio. In Q1, approximately 71% of our portfolio held or gained volume share, and the vast majority of that was share gain. And, as you can see on slide nine, our share performance is far ahead of our near-end peer set. Only one of our closest peers has more than half of their portfolio holding or gaining share, and we are outperforming them by a solid margin.\n\nIf you zoom in on our strategic frozen and snack domains shown here on slide 10, the share performance is even stronger. 93% of our frozen and snack brands held or gained volume share during the quarter. This slide demonstrates the continual improvement of our share performance over the past year, highlighting the effectiveness of our enhanced investments to drive consumer engagement. Importantly, we continue to deliver volume progress and strong share gains while achieving the expected ROI. Slide 11 demonstrates how the industry merchandising environment remains rational. There are two key metrics to consider when evaluating the state of merchandising, the share of volume sold on promotion and the average depth of promotion.\n\nIn both key metrics, Conagra and our near-end peer set are promoting slightly less today than we did in the most comparable pre-pandemic period. Said differently, the overall promotional environment is roughly consistent with historic norms. And when you double click on each of these metrics, you'll find that Conagra is actually less promotional than our closest peers. Both today and in the pre-pandemic period, Conagra sells a lower percentage of our volume on promotion. And when we do have targeted promotions, our average discount is also less. The takeaway is clear. We continue to operate in a rational merchandising environment.\n\nConagra remains less reliant on promotions to drive volume, and we continue to maintain a disciplined approach to prioritize the long term health of our brand. Now, let's dive into each of our domains. Starting with frozen on slide 12, our Q1 volume sales outpaced both edible and relevant frozen categories, led by our strong volume share performance in single serve meals and share increases in vegetables and multi-serve meals. Slide 13 takes a closer look at single serve meals, our largest frozen category. Conagra now represents a majority of all industry volume in this $6.5 billion category, a tremendous achievement in this dynamic and competitive environment.\n\nOur investments have enabled us to drive steady share improvement in this category throughout fiscal 24, and we built upon that success during the first quarter of fiscal 25. Frozen Vegetables is another category that contributed to our improved share performance during the quarter. Recall that Birdseye was the focus of our value over volume approach as we pulled back activity on the commodity veg space while building our business and innovation pipeline in the premium value added space. As you can see on slide 14, our efforts are paying off. Our Frozen Vegetables business remains stable and positive. Moving to snacks on slide 15.\n\nWe continue to considerably outpace the total snacking category, largely due to our Advantage portfolio. Our brands span on trend permissible snacking subspaces like meat snacks, popcorn, and seeds, as consumers opt for low-carb, protein, and fiber-rich snacks offered by Slim Jim, Dukes, David, Angie's Boom Chicka Pop, and more. Permissible snacking is growing much faster than the overall snacking category, and our portfolio of well-known brands is benefiting. During the first quarter, we took another step to build upon this strength by welcoming the fatty to the Conagra family. Slide 16 highlights some of the key points that make this acquisition so attractive.\n\nConagra is a leader in the meat snacks category with significant scale. But within meat snacks, Conagra is the leader in meat sticks, a high margin business that is growing faster than all other snacking categories, as demand for more convenient, healthy and affordable experiences continues to attract new buyers. Fatty Smoked Meat Sticks joins consumer favorites Slim Jim and Duke's to form a trifecta smokehouse, which will allow us to capitalize on high growth, protein focused snacking behavior. The addition of a premium brand like the Fatty furthers Conagra's position of strength as we focus on growing our snacking business across advantaged categories.\n\nTurning to our food service business on slide 17. It's no secret that COVID posed an unprecedented challenge for the entire food service industry. And our food service segment was no exception. Over the last five years, we've been laser focused on building a better business and returning margins to pre-COVID level. As a result of our efforts over the past few years, we grew organic net sales and adjusted operating profit. And this past year, we were able to restore food service margins to their fiscal 19 level. During Q1, we sustained that margin as we continue to execute our value over volume strategy.\n\nOur margin recovery has also been supported by our efficient and effective supply chain, highlighted here on slide 18. We expect to drive approximately $350 million in savings during fiscal 25 through multiple productivity initiatives. Further, Q1 service levels remained at the strong pre-COVID level of 97%. We also continued to deliver improvements in free cash flow, reducing our cash conversion cycle by seven days relative to the prior period. As a result of these efforts, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings by the end of Fiscal 25. Our productivity initiatives remain a key tool in our strategic playbook as the savings we realize help fuel our brand building investments and portfolio reshaping efforts.\n\nTurning to slide 19, we were excited to resume our historical practice of active portfolio reshaping with both inbound and outbound activities. consumer tastes and habits are constantly changing. And we continuously evaluate opportunities to reshape our portfolio to position the company for further growth and margin expansion, whether that be through investments in innovation, and brand modernization, M&A, or value accretive divestitures or spend. Portfolio reshaping is in our DNA, and Conagra has taken substantial actions over the past decade to transform our portfolio. However, in recent years, we've been more single-mindedly focused on debt pay down. Now, given the progress we've made on debt and cash flow, as well as other market dynamics, we are in a strong position to resume active portfolio reshaping, and importantly, still meet our long-term, three times net leverage target through a combination of bolt-on acquisitions and divestitures of low-growth businesses.\n\nIn Q1, we advanced these efforts through the acquisition of the fatty and the divestiture of our majority stake in Indian subsidiary Agrotech Foods Ltd. Looking ahead, we will continue to assess opportunities to reshape our portfolio for faster growth and stronger margins. As discussed at the top of the call, our execution across each of our priorities in Q1 has reinforced our confidence in the underlying strength of our brands, people, and strategy. With that, I'm pleased to reaffirm our Fiscal 25 guidance.\n\nI'll now pass the call over to Dave to discuss our financials in more detail. Thanks, Sean. And good morning, everyone. Slide 22 shows our financial results for key metrics in the quarter. Sean provided a good overview of how our business performed in Q1, highlighting our continued volume improvements in domestic retail, share gains, and strong productivity.\n\nTo most effectively unpack our Q1 results, I'll move to our segment performance on the next slide. Slide 23 shows the composition of organic net sales by segment, and also highlights the estimated impact of the Hebrew National manufacturing disruption on total company sales. Total organic net sales, excluding Hebrew, would have been down 2.6%, or 90 basis points better than the minus 3.5% we delivered. In Grocery and Snacks, we delivered organic net sales of approximately $1.2 billion, a decline of 1.9% versus last year's first quarter, primarily from lower volume. Price mix decreased slightly, a result of investments in selected brands partially offset by a price increase taken in the prior year on our tomato business.\n\nOur refrigerated and frozen segment delivered approximately $1.1 billion in net sales, a decline of 5.7% from prior year. volume and price mix were both impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption in Hebrew National. Excluding Hebrew, we estimate that refrigerated and frozen net sales in the quarter would have been down 3.6%. volume for the quarter would have increased 1.6% and price mix would have been down 5.2%. Refrigerated and frozen price mix was impacted by pass-through pricing reductions in certain brands that were experiencing deflation, primarily in our spreads business. and increased trade merchandising investments, particularly in our frozen business.\n\nWe also experienced a shift in the mix of products sold, which was a headwind to price mix in the quarter. Our international segment delivered an organic net sales increase of 3% over prior year, driven primarily by another strong double-digit quarter in our global exports business. Finally, our food service business performance continued to be impacted by the lower margin business we exited that was first called out in our Q3 fiscal 24 call, along with ongoing softness and restaurant traffic. As Sean discussed, our food service business is larger and more profitable than it was at the start of the pandemic and remains an important contributor to the Conagra business portfolio.\n\nSlide 24 shows our net sales bridge. I've already unpacked the quarter's volume and price mix dynamics for you. The remaining elements are foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net sales by 40 basis points, largely driven by the US dollar to Mexican peso exchange rates, and 10 basis points of favorable impact from the acquisition of fatty smoked meat sticks.\n\nThe components of our Q1 Adjusted Operating Margin Bridge are shown on slide 25. Adjusted Operating Margin declined 244 basis points over prior year to 14.2%. In addition to the price mix and trade merchandising investments I've already discussed, we also saw year-over-year cost of goods sold inflation of 3.3%, primarily from proteins, sweeteners, and warehousing costs. SG&A was higher due to wrapping lower incentive compensation a year ago and foreign exchange was a headwind. Productivity improvements, which approximated 3.6% of cost of goods sold, helped fund our trade investments in the quarter. This productivity was partially offset by the impact of the Hebrew national disruption.\n\nWe don't expect these unfavorable costs to continue going forward.\n\nSlide 26, details are adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin performance by segment for Q1. All segments reported a decline from prior year and adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin, and all segments were impacted by the same dynamics. Primarily, lower organic net sales, which included increased merchandising investment, higher cost of goods sold inflation, and unfavorable operating leverage, partially offset by favorable productivity. Additionally, refrigerated and frozen adjusted operating profit was impacted by approximately $10 million from the manufacturing disruptions in Hebrew National, and our international segment saw an outsized negative impact from unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe adjusted EPS bridge for Q1 fiscal 25 is shown on slide 27. Adjusted EPS was $0.53 in the current quarter compared to $0.66 a year ago due to a decline in adjusted operating profit, unfavorable FX rates, and lower equity earnings from Ardent Mills. Pension and adjusted taxes contributed one cent of EPS in the quarter. Our Ardent Mills joint venture continued to perform well in its core flower business, but delivered lower commodity revenue in Q1 compared to last year due to lower market volatility.\n\nKey balance sheet and cash flow metrics are shown on slide 28. Conagra generated $269 million in net cash flows from operating activities in Q1. The decline from prior year was driven primarily by lower operating profit and changes in seasonal working capital that we expect.\n\nCapital expenditures were $133 million, dividends paid were $167 million, and we resumed share repurchases of $64 million to offset dilution from our share-based equity incentive compensation plan. Our Q1 fiscal 25 ending net debt reduction from prior year reflects debt paydowns during fiscal 24 and includes funding the Q1 acquisitions of both the fatty smoked meat sticks business, as well as the manufacturing operations of an existing co-manufacturer of our cooking spray products. Net leverage at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times and was in line with our expectations as we remain on track to finish the fiscal year around 3.2 times.\n\nIn addition to the acquisitions in Q1, we also closed on the sale of our ATFL business in India. The net of those three transactions resulted in additional cash uses of approximately $154 million. We remain focused on reducing our net leverage and continuing to generate strong free cash flow.\n\nAs Sean said, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 25 guidance as shown on slide 29. I will provide some more color on the next slide. As we stated last quarter, when initially providing our full year fiscal 25 guidance, we expect sequential volume recovery each quarter, and we expect adjusted operating margin improvement to be greater in the second half. For Q2, we expect improvement in volume, top line and margin compared to Q1. We do expect our fiscal 25 merchandising investment to be at the highest level in Q2. Also, we are now forecasting full year fiscal 25 inflation of approximately 3.2% of total cost of goods sold.\n\nThat is up from approximately 3% originally projected for the year. We are seeing inflationary pressure primarily in the areas of proteins and sweeteners. While we are seeing deflation in select areas such as edible fats and oils, the net impact is a 20 basis point increase in the annual overall inflation estimate. We don't expect any material impact on fiscal 25 margin or adjusted EPS from our first quarter M&A transaction. But we expect a decrease in overall reported net sales of approximately $30 million for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our year-end net leverage target of approximately 3.2 times assumes expected favorability in free cash flow resulting from improved working capital, lower expected capital expenditures, and lower estimated cash taxes from a favorable tax settlement.\n\nAnd finally, we expect full-year adjusted gross margin to be relatively flat versus fiscal 24.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for your interest in Conagra Brands."

I'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bayle. Good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. Let's start with the Q2 headlines shown here on Slide 5.\nAt a macro level, the industry-wide shift in U.S. consumer behavior that we discussed on last quarter's call persisted into the second quarter. These behavior shifts continued to pressure volume and mix. However, while the consumer is still deploying some value-seeking tactics when they shop, we are seeing clear progress when it comes to volume recovery. In Q2, that progress was most notable in our refrigerated and frozen segment, in particular, our frozen business. This inflection was helped by investments on key brands as we were seeking to understand consumer readiness to revert back to more typical purchase behaviors. We saw outstanding responsiveness that will inform our back half actions. More on that in a moment.\nThe net result was a clear improvement in volume trends with domestic retail volume loss that was half of what we saw in Q1. We delivered solid margins and EPS as well as excellent free cash flow conversion. Our productivity initiatives remain on track, although we also saw a [ self ] absorption impact from our volume declines.\nAs we look ahead to the second half, we have a robust investment plan in place, reflecting our increased confidence and consumer responsiveness to brand-building levers. Our goal is to continue to build momentum with our consumers as we move through the back half of the fiscal year and then enter fiscal '25 in a position of strength. I will share more on our multifaceted action plan in a few minutes.\nFinally, we are updating our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting both the consumer environment and the additional brand investments in the second half of the year. After tremendous initial resilience in the face of a record inflation super cycle, U.S. consumer behavior shifts did emerge last spring in our industry as the cumulative effect of inflation caused consumers to begin to stretch their budgets. This resulted in a reprioritization of food choices as shoppers adjusted purchase behavior towards more stretchable meals. This slide reprises some of those shifts we discussed last quarter.\nAt that time, we told you that we expected these trends to be transitory. We still believe that to be the case. But the pace of the shift back to normal consumer behavior has been slower than we initially expected, and that pressured our volume, performance and mix in the second quarter. That said, the tide appears to be turning.\nWhen we discussed these behavior shifts last quarter, Frozen was one of our most impacted businesses, specifically our frozen single-serve meals. After 5 years of consistent strength, we saw some consumers looking to alternatives such as multi-serve meals and scratch cooking to stretch their budgets. We didn't expect that trend to be lasting as the unshakable consumer demand for convenience combined with Conagra-driven product innovation has generated strong frozen demand for a long time now.\nAs I noted in my opening remarks, we believe it's important to understand consumer readiness to resume more typical shopping behaviors before more fully ramping up investments to facilitate the process. We want to be confident that our investments will have the desired impact. With that in mind, during the second quarter, we did invest in certain key businesses to assess consumer response to increased brand building stimulus. Most noteworthy was our largest frozen business, single-serve meals where we deployed high-quality merchandising nationally. The results were very encouraging with lifts up 60%.\nThese lifts ultimately drove meaningful gains in our market share. As you can see on this slide, our Q2 share in this business approached 51%, eclipsing last year's gains and also setting a new record. The net of this is while the consumer is still stretched, they are responding to high-quality brand-building stimulus. And when you look at volume trends, while not yet positive, you can see that progress is clearly underway. Slide 9 shows volume results in our key U.S. retail segments both separately and combined.\nI'll draw your attention to the chart on the left, where you can really see the impact of our investment actions. As a result of these investments, Refrigerated & Frozen segment volume went from minus 10.5% in the first quarter to minus 3.3% in the second quarter coming in line with volumes in Grocery & Snacks. Overall, our targeted investments in Q2 helped cut the total domestic retail volume decline in half compared to the first quarter, not all the way back, but good progress.\nI'm also pleased to report that we continue to deliver momentum in our International and Foodservice businesses, which together account for approximately 18% of total Q2 revenue. International grew organic net sales by 5.6% in the quarter, while our two largest markets, Mexico and Canada delivered organic net sales growth above 9%. This was a result of our international team's outstanding execution including strong brand activation, improved point-of-sale performance, innovation that is resonating with our customers and expanded distribution in Mexico. Our Mexican business has now delivered four consecutive quarters of volume growth.\nIn Foodservice, we delivered organic net sales growth of 4.3% in the quarter, driven largely by favorable price mix as well as expanded distribution in our frozen portfolio, which accounted for roughly half of our total Foodservice business.\nSlide 11 details our second quarter results, including organic net sales of approximately $3 billion, which is down 3.4% compared to last year. Adjusted gross margin of 26.9% was down 129 basis points from last year, reflecting our targeted investments and the absorption impact associated with the volume decline. Adjusted operating margin of 15.9% was down 108 basis points compared to last year. And adjusted earnings per share of $0.71 was down approximately 12% versus last year.\nImportantly, we delivered strong free cash flow during the second quarter. Dave will cover this in more detail shortly. But as you can see on Slide 12, free cash flow in the first half of fiscal '24 was almost 6x what it was in the first half of fiscal '23. We used some of that free cash flow to pay down debt, bringing our net leverage ratio to 3.55x in the second quarter.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we have a robust and multifaceted investment plan in place for the second half of the year, reflecting our confidence in consumer responsiveness to our brand-building efforts. On Slide 13, you can see images from our new advertising investments focused on our biggest brands, including Birds Eye, Healthy Choice and Slim Jim. You may have already seen some of the terrific work we've done this year with Slim Jim and the WWE, building on the heritage and built-in awareness of our long-term partnership with Wrestling Legend Randy \"Macho Man\" Savage.\nFiscal '24 is one of our biggest innovation slates yet. We are backing those launches with meaningful increases in slotting, in-store and other sales support versus the prior year. Slide 14 highlights some of the exciting innovation we've recently launched. If we have any Chili lovers on the call, I highly recommend our Wendy's Chili. You can get the true restaurant taste of this beloved Chili at home.\nFinally, Slide 15 highlights the investments we're making in high-quality merchandising. Our efforts are focused on reengaging consumers with our existing products, to capture market share as well as introducing consumers to our new innovation. The targeted investments we made during the second quarter give us confidence that our multifaceted brand-building investments in the second half of the year will drive momentum going into 2025.\nWe're updating our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting both the consumer environment and the additional brand investments in the second half of the year. Our new guidance includes organic net sales decrease between 1% and 2% compared to fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.6% and adjusted EPS between $2.60 and $2.65.\nOverall, we remain confident in our brands, plans, people and agility as we continue to navigate this shifting consumer environment. With that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, our team executed well as we continue to navigate consumer behavior shifts that pressured our volume and mix.\nIn Q2, net sales were $3.2 billion. As Sean discussed earlier, this reflects a 3.4% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from lower year-over-year volumes. However, this is the third quarter in a row where the rate of volume change versus the prior year quarter improved. Amid these broader macroeconomic challenges and increased brand investments, we delivered solid margins and EPS along with strong free cash flow during the second quarter.\nAdjusted gross profit decreased by 7.6% in the quarter as the positive impact from productivity initiatives was offset by cost of goods sold inflation unfavorable operating leverage, lower organic net sales and increased trade investment. Adjusted operating profit decreased 9.3% and adjusted EBITDA decreased 7%, largely driven by the decrease in adjusted gross profit, partially offset by an increase in equity earnings driven by continued strong operating performance in our Ardent Mills joint venture. We delivered Q2 adjusted net income of $341 million or $0.71 per diluted share.\nSlide 19 provides a breakdown of our net sales for Q2. The 3.4% decrease in organic net sales was primarily driven by the consumer dynamics just discussed. Further contributing to the decline was a 0.5% decline in price mix which reflects an increase in strategic trade investments made during the period and an unfavorable mix impact from selling a higher percentage of lower sales dollar per unit items. This was partially offset by price increases taken on our tomato-based products given the continued high inflation. We also saw a small benefit from foreign exchange, which is reflected in our net sales decline of 3.2%.\nSlide 20 outlines the top line performance for each segment in Q2. While organic net sales were down in our domestic retail segments, we delivered sequential volume progress that benefited from the targeted strategic investment Sean discussed earlier. We also continued the strong momentum in our International and Foodservice segments, which delivered Q2 organic growth of 5.6% and 4.3%, respectively.\nSlide 21 shows our Q2 adjusted margin bridge. While our productivity initiatives remain on track, our margin was negatively affected by the continued impact of overhead absorption from our lower volumes. Cost of goods sold inflation was a headwind of 1.7% and price mix was a 0.6% headwind, which reflects the retailer investments made during the period. These factors combined drove the decline in adjusted gross margin for the quarter. Our adjusted operating margin benefited from small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A.\nSlide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q2. Adjusted operating margin in both our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments decreased due to the margin drivers I just discussed. Although inflation impacted the Grocery & Snacks segment at a higher rate than Refrigerated & Frozen. We were pleased that our Foodservice adjusted operating margin expanded 193 basis points and our International segment's adjusted operating margin expanded 30 basis points, both driven by higher organic net sales and productivity as both segments are showing consistent improvement. Foodservice also benefited from comparison to prior year Q2, which included supply chain disruptions.\nOur Q2 adjusted EPS performance of $0.71, was $0.10 below the prior year quarter, primarily from the decline in adjusted gross profit and pension income and higher interest expense. This was partially offset by slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A expense, along with increased equity method investment earnings driven by Ardent Mills. The A&P change was timing related, as we expect to increase A&P spending in the second half and the decline in SG&A was primarily the reduction in incentive compensation versus the prior year.\nSlide 24 displays the significant progress we made in the quarter and first half on free cash flow and our net leverage ratio. Over the first half of fiscal '24, we delivered a $532 million improvement in free cash flow with a conversion rate of approximately 97%, the highest first half conversion rate over the past five years. Our focus on managing inventory levels and improvement in accounts payable directly contributed to these strong results. In addition, we had strong cash distributions from Ardent Mills in the second quarter, reflecting the strong profit and cash flow performance of Ardent Mills the last few years.\nOur strong free cash flow has helped us deliver debt reduction during the period. At the end of Q2, our net leverage ratio was 3.55x, reflecting debt repayment of more than $500 million over the last 12 months.\nLooking ahead to the remainder of fiscal '24, we expect to continue our debt reduction efforts as we prioritize our long-term leverage target of 3x. We chose not to repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt this fiscal year. We will continue to evaluate the best use of capital to optimize shareholder value as we progress through the fiscal year.\nAs mentioned, we are updating our guidance for fiscal '24 to reflect our year-to-date results, expectations for the slower pace of volume recovery and the additional brand investments in the second half. Slide 25 outlines our expectations for our three key metrics, including organic net sales to decrease between 1% and 2% compared to fiscal '23 with volumes continuing to improve through the back half of the year. Adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.6% and adjusted EPS between $2.60 and $2.65.\nTurning to Slide 26, I'd like to take a minute to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We expect net inflation to moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 3% for fiscal '24.\nRegarding pricing, there are a few dynamics currently at play. With our estimated 3% inflation rate, we are seeing areas that are still highly inflationary such as tomatoes and starches, which are up above the average and areas that are deflationary such as edible oils and dairy, which are below the average. These dynamics have resulted in both inflation-justified pricing actions and select pass-through price reductions included in our outlook. We expect that these dynamics, combined with our increased second half investments will result in price mix being down versus prior year in the second half.\nWe now anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $450 million in fiscal '24 as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. As a result, we continue to expect to achieve gross productivity savings of approximately $300 million by the end of fiscal '24. We expect interest expense to approximate $440 million primarily due to a higher weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt. While we do not expect to receive any benefit from pension income, we expect Ardent Mills to contribute approximately $170 million to our bottom line due to its continued strong performance. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nAs I discussed, we are prioritizing our debt reduction efforts and expect to further reduce our outstanding net debt in the second half. Longer term, we remain on track to reach our 3x net leverage ratio target by the end of fiscal '26. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relation\n\nGood morning, and thanks joining us for the Conagra Brands First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, will first discuss our business performance, and then we'll open up the call for Q&A.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal '24 earnings call. Let's start with what we want you to take away from our presentation shown here on Slide 5. At an industry-wide level, macro dynamics have clearly impacted consumer behavior across the board. I will cover this in more detail shortly, but ultimately, this behavior shift has elongated the volume recovery period across the industry, which is reflected in our Q1 top line results.\nAs we've navigated these macro dynamics, I'm proud of the team for delivering another quarter of strong margin improvement and EPS growth. We also continued to strengthen our balance sheet improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders. Our team's execution supported a strong supply chain recovery during the quarter, hitting pre-pandemic service levels as we exited Q1.\nLooking towards the remainder of the year, we will work to drive volumes and top line growth through targeted and disciplined investments behind prudent merchandising and continued support for our strong innovation. Finally, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, reflecting confidence in our plans, people and agility as we navigate a shifting consumer environment.\nAs I mentioned a moment ago, the timetable for volume recovery has been elongated across the industry due to near-term consumer behavior changes. After 3 years of unprecedented inflation, along with other macro dynamics, consumers have felt increased financial pressure and used a variety of strategies to stretch their balance sheet. This resulted in a near-term reprioritization of their typical purchase behaviors in order to make their budgets work. We've seen shifts like this before and expect these near-term changes in behavior to also be temporary. In fact, recent trends suggest this is already underway.\nLet me provide a bit more color on the kinds of behavioral shifts we've observed. As you've seen for some time now, with the notable exception of summer travel, discretionary purchases have been down almost across the board. Consumers have also been actively reducing remnant household inventory from the pandemic.\nWithin food, convenience-oriented items, typically a top consumer priority have lagged as shoppers have turned to more hands-on food prep to get additional bang for their buck. And as they've done this, not surprisingly, they have shifted from meals for one to meals for many, even if not everyone at home at the same time to be together.\nAnd the last shift, I will mention is a reduction in wasted food and an increase in the use of leftovers. Collectively, these short-term behavior shifts act as a sort of cheat code to help these consumers spend within their means. Slide 8 demonstrates the elongated volume recovery across the industry. As you can see, through the 4-week period ending August 26, the entire peer group was showing volume performance within a very tight band with Conagra in the middle of the pack. As I mentioned a minute ago, more recent trends are showing the first signs of improved performance.\nWith that backdrop, let's dive into our results shown on Slide 9. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of approximately $2.9 billion, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the slower volume recovery we've discussed. Adjusted gross margin of 27.6% was up 272 basis points from last year. Adjusted operating margin of 16.7% was up 297 basis points compared to last year and adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 increased almost 16% versus last year.\nDiving further into our top line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 10, that sales in our Staples domain were flat compared to the prior year. As consumers shift toward more stretchable meals, our staples categories such as can Chile and can tomatoes are well positioned and have gained unit share compared to last year.\nDespite the macro headwinds, our snacks domain has continued to grow, as shown on Slide 11. We're building unit share as consumers continue to respond positively to our microwave popcorn and ready-to-eat pudding and gel brands.\nLooking at Slide 12, you can see that our frozen domain has been the most significantly impacted by recent shifts in consumer behavior particularly in areas like single-serve meals, given the headwinds we discussed a moment ago. As we look at the frozen domain, it's worth noting a few key points.\nFirst, despite the recent impact on volume, we continue to gain unit share in important frozen categories like single-serve meals. This dynamic demonstrates the relative strength and strong position of our brands.\nSecond, the year-over-year performance figures do not properly represent the broader trend within frozen food. In fact, if you look over a 4-year period, Conagra's frozen retail sales have increased 22%.\nFrozen meals has been one of the fastest-growing categories in consumption over the past 40 years. Its 4% CAGR is in the top tier of foods growing in at-home consumption. This expansion has been fueled by the long-term sustained consumer demand for convenience as well as the addition of innovation and quality ingredients. This 40-year trend demonstrates the critical role that frozen plays in providing convenient, high-quality foods for every occasion, which consumers have come to increasingly rely on. This is central to why we believe the current softness is temporary.\nTurning to Slide 14. I'm pleased to share that we continue to advance our supply chain initiatives during the quarter, allowing us to return our service performance back to pre-pandemic levels. Our productivity initiatives remain on track, and we plan to maintain and capitalize on this strong recovery during the rest of fiscal '24.\nThat's a key piece of our action plan for the remainder of the year, as outlined on Slide 15. In addition to our ongoing supply chain execution, we will continue to focus on executing our Conagra Way playbook as we make targeted and disciplined investments behind our brands. Help protect share and drive the top line, we're focused on investing behind quality, high ROI merchandising and A&P to support our brand. We'll also continue to prioritize reducing our debt and improving our net leverage ratio.\nWe are reaffirming our fiscal '24 guidance that we shared last quarter, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% compared to fiscal '23. We adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. Overall, we remain confident in our plans, people and agility as we continue to navigate this shifting consumer environment.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 18 highlights our results from the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our profit and cash flow delivery and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets.\nIn Q1, net sales were $2.9 billion, reflecting a 0.3% decrease in organic net sales, driven primarily from the elongated recovery of volumes due to the industry-wide slowdown in consumption that Sean discussed earlier.\nGross margin recovery was a key priority for us in fiscal '23, and we delivered another strong result in Q1. Adjusted gross profit increased by 10.9% in the quarter, primarily from the pricing implemented in the prior year and strong productivity, which more than offset the negative impacts of cost of goods sold inflation and unfavorable operating leverage. Adjusted gross margin increased 272 basis points, and adjusted EBITDA increased 12.1%, largely driven by the increase in adjusted gross profit.\nSlide 19 provides a breakdown of our net sales. The 0.3% decrease in organic net sales was driven by a 6.6% decrease in volume which was partially offset by a 6.3% improvement in price mix, a result of fiscal '23's inflation-driven pricing actions. A small benefit from the impact of foreign exchange contributed to reported net sales coming in flat for the quarter.\nSlide 20 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q1. Our Grocery & Snacks segment achieved net sales growth of 1.2% in the quarter. We gained dollar share in snacking categories, including seeds and microwave popcorn as well as in Staples categories, including Chili and [ Candy ]. As Sean discussed earlier, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was the most impacted by recent consumer behavior shifts, with net sales down 4.6% in the quarter.\nOur International and Foodservice segments combined are slightly below 20% of our net sales. Both are important to Conagra and contributed meaningfully to growth this quarter. Our International segment delivered year-over-year volume growth in addition to improved price mix, which helped support strong organic net sales growth of 8.2% during the quarter.\nOur two largest international regions, Mexico and Canada delivered double-digit organic net sales growth over prior year. We also saw low single-digit volume growth in Mexico, which contributed to the segment's overall positive volumes. For the remainder of the year, we expect volume growth to continue in international.\nOur Foodservice segment delivered 5.2% net sales growth in Q1 from strong price mix, and we expect to see positive net sales growth in Foodservice for the fiscal year. Foodservice also delivered a strong gross margin in Q1 versus a year ago due to the reduction of supply chain disruption costs incurred in the prior year. This benefit is not expected to extend beyond Q1. Our Foodservice segment supplies a diverse set of clients beyond restaurants, including health care, travel and leisure and educational institutions, and we are well positioned to compete in these markets.\nSlide 21 highlights our adjusted operating margin bridge. We are pleased to have delivered a fourth consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 272 basis points in Q1.\nWe drove a 4 percentage point improvement from price mix during the quarter. We also realized a 1.8 percentage point benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives along with the wrap of some supply chain disruptions in the prior year. These price and productivity benefits were slightly offset by cost of goods sold inflation, a margin headwind of [ 3.1% ]. Those factors, combined with small year-over-year favorability in A&P and SG&A, drove the 297 basis point improvement in operating margin for the quarter.\nSlide 22 details our margin performance by segment for Q1. Overall, continued progress on our productivity initiatives and positive price mix contributed to an increase in adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin across all four operating segments. It is worth noting that our Refrigerated & Frozen segment continued its very strong operating profit and margin recovery in the quarter with adjusted operating margin improving 294 basis points versus a year ago.\nOur Q1 adjusted EPS increased to $0.66, representing a 15.8% increase over the prior year. Higher adjusted gross profit and slightly lower A&P and adjusted SG&A were the positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. These positives were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement nonservice income, decreased equity method investment earnings and higher interest expense.\nSlide 24 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.55x down from the end of fiscal '23. We will continue to prioritize reducing our debt and lowering our net leverage ratio in fiscal '24.\nNet cash flow from operations increased $180 million in the quarter, primarily driven by reduced investment in inventory versus the prior year. While CapEx investment increased by approximately $20 million, Q1 free cash flow more than doubled from a year ago, coming in at $300 million. This strong free cash flow enabled us to pay down approximately $130 million of net short-term debt while also funding $157 million for the Q1 dividend, highlighting our focus on balanced capital allocation. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter as we continue to prioritize paying down debt.\nAs mentioned, we are reaffirming our guidance for fiscal '24, given the strong Q1 profit and margin performance and the confidence in our investment plans year-to-go as we continue to navigate a shifting consumer environment.\nSlide 25 outlines our current fiscal '24 expectations for our three key metrics, including: Organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23; adjusted operating margin between 16% to 16.5%; and adjusted EPS between $2.70 and $2.75. Let's take a closer look at how we expect to achieve that guidance during Q2 in the back half of fiscal '24 shown on Slide 26.\nDuring Q2, we expect to continue seeing low single-digit organic net sales decline, but volume decline should improve versus Q1 as we wrap inflation-driven pricing actions from fiscal '23. As Sean mentioned, we will redeploy some of our strong gross profit into strategic investments behind quality, high ROI merchandising and increased A&P to support our brands. We also expect operating margins to be down from Q1 with adjusted EPS approximately flat to Q1.\nIn the back half of the year, we expect volume trends to return to year-over-year growth, which will help drive low single-digit organic net sales growth. We expect our trade and A&P investments to be higher than the first half, with margins flat to Q2 and second half fiscal '24 adjusted EPS approximately flat to the same period in fiscal '23.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. I'll start with the business update on the quarter and fiscal year and then share how we're thinking about 2024 and beyond.\nSlide 6 outlines what we'd like you to take away from today's call. In Q4, we delivered solid profit and margin growth despite the disruption from one of our frozen logistics partners, Americold, which impacted both our sales and costs during the quarter. For the full fiscal year, I'm proud of the way our team navigated a dynamic operating environment to deliver strong results. These efforts to execute against our fiscal '23 strategic priorities, and the continued implementation of our playbook have our brands well positioned following the volatility of the past few years.\nAs you'll see, our outlook for fiscal year 2024 reflects a transition toward a more normalized operating environment as well as a continued commitment to our long-term financial algorithm.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results, starting on Slide 7. Organic net sales for the quarter grew over 2% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 and adjusted gross margin of 27% represents a 216 basis point increase over the fourth quarter last year. The full year results underscore the strength of our performance across all 4 metrics, including 6.6% organic net sales growth and 17.4% adjusted EPS growth compared to the prior year period, as well as robust gross and operating margin improvement.\nLooking back at our priorities going into fiscal '23, we're pleased to say that we delivered on each of them. We continued our disciplined pricing execution in the face of ongoing inflation, which helped to drive margin recovery a top priority coming into fiscal '23. Our supply chain continued to improve as we made meaningful progress on our cost savings initiatives, which in turn led to a vast improvement in service levels.\nWe remain committed to lowering our net leverage ratio, which was reduced from 4.0x to 3.6x by the end of the fiscal year. And we did all of this while investing to maintain the brand strength that we've built up for many years running.\nLet's take a closer look at these priorities, starting with the impact of our inflation-justified pricing actions on Slide 9. As you can see, pricing peaked in Q3 but remains almost 17% above the prior year due to our actions to offset ongoing COGS inflation. During the fourth quarter, elasticities did soften a bit, but remain fairly consistent well below historical norms and in line or better than competitors.\nOur strong execution was instrumental in driving margin recovery, which is detailed on Slide 10. As we've previously discussed, there is an inherent lag between the time when inflation hits and when we're able to recover that cost through inflation-justified pricing. This lag effect results in temporarily compressed margins as we saw, most notably throughout fiscal '22. We took great strides to recover our gross margin in fiscal '23, and Q4 was our third consecutive quarter of strong margin improvement up 216 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year.\nTurning to Slide 11. We continue to advance our supply chain initiatives, investing to rebuild our own inventory which helped us to deliver service levels of 95% as we exited the fiscal year. While we're making strong progress in supply chain, it's not yet back to normal as we experienced transitory disruptions in the quarter such as the cybersecurity event at Americold. That said, we're pleased with our progress so far and see more room for improvement in fiscal '24, including investing in technology and modernization as the operating environment continues to normalize.\nSlide 12 highlights one of the key ways in which we are investing to maintain brand strength, our persistent focus on modernizing brands through innovation. The innovations we've launched since fiscal 2018 generated nearly $1.8 billion in retail sales during the last fiscal year. And unlike many in our space, we continue to innovate during the pandemic with new product launches since fiscal '21, now representing more than half of that total. Importantly, our innovation has built some really strong and sustainable platforms, including Bowls, Slim Jim Savage and Duncan Hines Epic.\nOur strategic frozen and snacks domains have been the focus of our innovation engine. As Slide 13 highlights, their growing domains and we've helped architect that growth. Over the past 4 years, the frozen and snacks categories in which we compete have grown 9% and 8%, respectively, outpacing total food growth. Within our portfolio, frozen and snacks together now represent almost 70% of our domestic retail dollar sales, and we've consistently increased our share within these strong and growing domains.\nLooking more closely at frozen. Slide 14 shows the growth of this category over the past 9 years, which represents the time frame in which we reinvented our approach to frozen food. Since fiscal 2014, the frozen categories in which Conagra competes have grown from $29 billion to $54 billion, representing a 7% CAGR. And Conagra has increased our share by nearly 500 basis points to become the leader in frozen. This growth is a testament to our continual effort to modernize and support our strong brands as part of the Conagra Way playbook.\nOne example of that brand strength is how our unit sales stack up to our peers. As you can see on Slide 15, even during the year of significant pricing 7 of our top 10 frozen product segments held or grew unit share in fiscal '23. The same is true in our snacks portfolio. As you can see on Slide 16, our 2 largest snacking platforms meat snacks and microwave popcorn also gained unit share during fiscal '23.\nNow let's turn to the year ahead. As we continue to emerge from unprecedented operating conditions, including both COVID and the inflation super cycle, we anticipate fiscal '24 to be a transition toward a more normalized operating environment. That transition will include a few tailwinds and headwinds that are outlined on Slide 19.\nStarting with the tailwinds. In fiscal '24, we will be wrapping the various discrete supply chain disruptions that persisted throughout the year. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we will also benefit from the ongoing advancement of our productivity initiatives, and we expect our investments in innovation to continue to deliver strong results, building upon our track record of success.\nNow let's talk headwinds. First, shifting consumer behavior. As you can see in the weekly scanner data, food companies are starting to wrap pricing in the year ago period and dollar sales are coming down as expected, but the rate of improvement in volume recovery is lagging. That suggests new consumer behavior shifts beyond the initial elasticity effects that occurred when pricing actions were initially taken.\nWe've seen this dynamic since just after Easter, and it has been broad-based across many categories and competitors. And importantly, where we see it, it is usually not a trade down to lower-priced alternatives within the category. Rather, it's an overall category slowdown. The question is, why now, given the steadiness we've seen from the consumer for 2 years? There are several possibilities at the root of this. One behavior shift we've heard about from consumers is just buying fewer items overall, more of a hunkering down than a trading down.\nThere are several potential reasons as to why, including this summer being more travel intensive than last year. Overall, we view this dynamic as likely temporary behavior shift for consumers to stretch their budgets, but we have captured it as a near-term headwind in our outlook.\nMoving to the second headwind. While very limited, we have seen a few single ingredient brands become deflationary, and we will make appropriate price adjustments to reflect that. Finally, the reduction of pension income and decline in contribution from Ardent Mills compared to its strong fiscal '23 performance will impact our earnings performance compared to the prior year.\nTo maximize our competitiveness this year, we will continue to execute our playbook and invest in our business. And Slide 20 highlights one of our most important investments, our biggest innovation slate to date. Our fiscal '24 innovation lineup features a compelling mix of convenient, value-added meals, restaurant experiences and exciting licenses. We expect our most significant new innovation to be in distribution by the end of Q1 and build throughout the rest of the year. These innovations, coupled with our consumer and customer support will help us effectively navigate the dynamic marketplace conditions.\nSlide 21 outlines our financial guidance for fiscal '24. We expect organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin of 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75. As Dave will unpack further, our EPS guidance reflects our expectation for growth from the underlying business operations, which is being muted by the previously mentioned impacts from lower contribution from Ardent Mills and pension income.\nOverall, Conagra continues to benefit from strong brands, strong processes and strong people, which are all working together to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion. With that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. As Sean noted, we've made great progress from this time 1 year ago, as shown on this page. We navigated a challenging operating environment and successfully delivered on our priorities to implement inflation-justified pricing, drive gross margin recovery reduced net leverage and rebuild inventory levels, all while investing to maintain the strength of our brands. This enabled us to deliver strong full year results that exceeded our original fiscal '23 expectations on all metrics.\nSlide 24 highlights our results from the quarter and full fiscal year. During fiscal '23, we delivered strong top line growth with full year organic net sales up 6.6% compared to fiscal '22, driven by our inflation-justified pricing and modest elasticities. Margin recovery was a top priority for fiscal '23 and our business delivered, increasing adjusted gross margin by 226 basis points and adjusted operating margin by 125 basis points for the full year. This margin enhancement contributed to strong full year adjusted EPS growth of 17.4%.\nSlide 25 shows our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. The increases in fourth quarter and full year organic net sales were driven by improvements in price mix, primarily from inflation-justified pricing actions and were partially offset by a decrease in volumes. We estimate that our fourth quarter volume was impacted by the transitory supply chain disruptions from the cybersecurity incident at Americold, impacting revenue by approximately 50 basis points in the quarter.\nThis disruption negatively impacted sales in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment during the fourth quarter, an impact of approximately 110 basis points for the quarter. Despite this discrete situation in Refrigerated & Frozen, we were pleased to deliver solid sales growth in all other segments during the fourth quarter. And both our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments delivered 6.1% organic net sales growth for full year fiscal '23.\nWe detail our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 27. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to have delivered a third consecutive quarter of strong gross margin improvement, up 216 basis points in Q4. We drove a 7.1% margin gain from improved price mix during the quarter and realized a 40 basis point net benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with market inflation and market-based sourcing negatively impacting our margins by 2.1% and 3.3%, respectively.\nAdjusted operating margin was 14.6% for the fourth quarter which was a 39 basis point decline versus a year ago. The strong gross margin improvement was more than offset by increased A&P investment and an increase in SG&A from both higher incentive compensation expense and transitory asset write-offs in the quarter.\nOne additional call out on this slide. Our cost of goods sold inflation headwind of 5.4% as calculated by netting our Q4 market inflation and our market-based sourcing. Previously, market-based sourcing was captured in our net productivity column. We believe this format is more meaningful to investors, and this change will be applied in our materials going forward.\nSlide 28 details our margin performance by segment for Q4. Refrigerated & Frozen continued its strong operating profit and margin improvement in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin improving 286 basis points versus a year ago. Grocery & Snack operating margins were down 248 basis points due primarily to increased inventory reserves for excess seasonal inventory, along with unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption.\nThe International segment increased adjusted operating margin, 497 basis points in the quarter, driven primarily by pricing, while the Foodservice segment adjusted operating margins were down 75 basis points due to some transitory asset write-offs. Also, as highlighted in our earnings release, results from our annual goodwill intangible impairment testing also negatively impacted reported profits primarily in our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments. The primary driver of the impairment charges was the increase in our discount rate due to the current interest rate environment.\nSlide 29 shows adjusted EPS bridges for the fourth quarter and full year compared to fiscal '22. In the fourth quarter, adjusted EPS from operations was flat as the increase in adjusted gross profit was offset by the increases in A&P and SG&A mentioned previously. Total EPS for Q4 was down 4.6% as the flat operating profit and benefit from our equity method investment earnings was more than offset by lower pension and postretirement income, higher interest expense and higher adjusted taxes.\nOn the bottom half of the slide, you can see that our year-over-year EPS growth of 17.4% and was entirely attributed to the operating profit increase of $0.41, which underscores the strength of the underlying business. The benefit of $0.11 from our Ardent Mills joint venture was offset by increased pension and interest expense.\nSlide 30 includes our key balance sheet and cash flow metrics. At the end of fiscal '23, our net leverage ratio was 3.63x, down from 3.99x at the end of the prior year. Our net cash flow from operating activities reflects continued investments to rebuild our inventory levels. Going forward, we are well positioned to support sustained demand across categories.\nYear-to-date CapEx was $362 million at the end of fiscal '23, down from $464 million in the prior year due to the timing of projects. We continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $624 million in dividends in fiscal '23, up 7.2% versus fiscal '22, and we paid $150 million to repurchase shares in fiscal '23, up from $50 million a year ago.\nI'd like to spend a minute reviewing our guidance for fiscal '24. Slide 31 outlines our expectations for our 3 key metrics, including organic net sales growth of approximately 1% over fiscal '23, adjusted operating margin growth between 16% to 16.5% and adjusted EPS between $2.70 to $2.75.\nLet's take a closer look at the drivers of our adjusted EPS guidance on Slide 32. Compared to the prior year period, we anticipate continued improvement to our adjusted gross profit to be offset by the impact of elevated investments in A&P and SG&A to support our innovation and our people, higher interest expense from interest rate increases approximating $450 million and an adjusted tax rate of approximately 24%, net net to adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 4% in our underlying business operations or an adjusted EPS of $2.83 to $2.88.\nWe also expect the growth in our underlying business operations to be offset by lower income from our Ardent Mills joint venture as well as the reduction of pension income due to higher interest rates. As we previously discussed, Ardent Mills had a particularly strong fiscal '23 driven by favorable market conditions and the venture's effective management through recent volatility in the wheat markets. As we transition toward a more normalized operating environment, we expect lower Ardent Mills income of approximately $150 million in fiscal '24, which is still a very strong operating performance relative to historical results as Ardent continues to mature as a business.\nI will now unpack a few additional assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 33. Again, we expect to see easing inflationary pressures and improved supply chain operations in fiscal '24, which is reflected in our outlook. We anticipate net cost of goods sold inflation of approximately 3% in fiscal '24 as we continue to emerge from the inflation super cycle, with targeted inflation-justified pricing actions that will become effective in the early second quarter of fiscal '24 to help offset elevated costs.\nFrom a supply chain perspective, we expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million as we continue to make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. We also expect the investments we are making to drive gross productivity savings of approximately $300 million during fiscal '24. Finally, we expect to reach a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.4x and by year-end fiscal '24 and remain on track to reach our target net leverage ratio of approximately 3x by the end of fiscal '26.\nWe see fiscal '24 as a transition toward a more normal operating environment, and we are reiterating our commitment to the long-term financial algorithm we unveiled at our Investor Day in July 2022, as shown here on Slide 34. This morning, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a 6% increase in our annualized dividend from $1.32 a share to $1.40 per share. This increase reflects confidence in our outlook and is in line with the targeted payout ratio.\nTo sum things up, we made outstanding progress in fiscal '23 and as we continue to execute on our strategic priorities to drive value for shareholders. We believe Conagra is well positioned for long-term value creation. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call.\nThank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relation\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us for the Conagra Brands Third Quarter and First 9 Months of Fiscal 2023 earnings call. I'm here with Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, who will discuss our business performance. We'll take your questions when our prepared remarks conclude.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantees about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impacts the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nAnd I'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. Slide 5 outlines what we'd like you to take away from today's call. Our top priority coming into fiscal year 2023 was margin recovery following the unprecedented environment of the last 2 years with COVID and the inflation supercycle.\nTo facilitate that margin recovery, our executional focus has been on inflation-justified pricing, supply chain improvements and the pruning of low-margin volume, a strategy we have successfully deployed before and refer to as value over volume. And 3/4 of the way into the year, our plan is working.\nIn Q3, we delivered our second consecutive quarter of strong gross margin recovery, our pricing execution continued to be excellent while elasticities remain muted and consistent. Our volume performance again led our near-end peers versus our pre-pandemic baseline and our supply chain continued to improve with service levels exceeding 90%.\nThis improvement allowed us to rebuild inventories to appropriate levels and support most of the strong demand from our customers, but there were exceptions as we experienced temporary manufacturing disruptions in certain categories that prevented us from being in stock. Despite this, we had strong results in the quarter overall, and we are updating our guidance for the year, including increasing our expectations for adjusted EPS growth and tightening the ranges for net sales growth and operating margins.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results on Slide 6. We delivered organic net sales of approximately $3.1 billion representing a 6.1% increase over the prior year period. Our adjusted gross margin of 28.1% represents a 409 basis point increase over the third quarter of last year, and our adjusted operating margin of 16.9% represents a 321 basis point increase over that same period.\nAdjusted EPS rose 31% from last year to $0.76 per share. The year-to-date results underscore the strength of our performance with growth across all four metrics including 8.1% organic net sales growth compared to the prior year period and the robust margin improvements we set out to achieve at the beginning of the year.\nSlide 7 shows the sustained recovery of our gross profit margin for a second consecutive quarter. Again, this margin recovery was our top priority for the year. Why? Because our gross margins fund our innovation program, and that innovation has been the centerpiece of our playbook and our success in driving sustained category growth in our two strategic focus areas frozen and snacks. This recovery, therefore, means you should continue to expect a relentless stream of provocative innovation and brand-building support as we go forward.\nIn fact, looking at Slide 8, you can see that Conagra is one of the only companies in our peer set whose gross margins are essentially on par with pre-pandemic levels. Importantly, our brand strength and innovation pipeline position us well to maintain solid growth and healthy gross margin going forward. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, our sales growth was primarily driven by inflation justified price increases coupled with ongoing muted elasticities.\nSlide 9 shows the relationship between elasticities and price increases. As you can see, elasticities have remained remarkably consistent and benign over the last 8 quarters, even as we increased the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing COGS inflation.\nAnd Slide 10 shows our elasticities are among the best in the industry. The modest elasticities, which are well below historic norms and have remained consistent in the face of our inflation-justified price increases are a testament to the strength of our brands, the execution of our pricing strategy and the limited impact of private label competition.\nTurning to Slide 11. As you can see, at the total Conagra level, retail sales grew by 5.5% compared to the third quarter of last year and by 24.7% compared to 3 years ago. To put some context around the 5.5% number, three points: first, there was a fair amount of noise in the year-over-year comps for the peer set in Q3. Some companies had a very weak year ago period due to supply chain challenges while we had pockets of real strength in the year ago period due to Omicron and strong customer support for products that had recently come off allocation.\nSecond, we continue to prune low-margin volume, most notably resuming our opportunistic value over volume strategy on select brands. This included eliminating 10 for 10 promotions on both value tier vegetables and canned products such as Chef Boyardee and Hunt's Tomatoes.\nThird, we experienced manufacturing disruptions in certain categories that led to out-of-stocks in the quarter. Most notably impacted where our canned meals and sides businesses, specifically canned pasta, canned beans, canned chili and canned meat, all part of our grocery portfolio.\nIn Frozen, we had one noteworthy disruption as our fish business was on allocation, which led to out-of-stocks during the peak Lenten season. This was due to a fire on our fish frying line as reported in our second quarter 10-Q. While these discrete issues suppressed our volume in Q3, the root causes have been largely resolved, and we expect volumes to rebound sequentially from here.\nImportantly, when you take the noise out of the short-term view and compare our growth versus the stable baseline of 3 years ago, you see our performance has been strong on both the top and bottom lines. Dampening the results versus this time period normalizes for the volatility across demand, inflation and supply chain throughout the pandemic and demonstrates that Conagra is a top performer among our peer set.\nSlide 12 details our top line performance on a 3-year basis as measured over the prior 52 weeks and compared to our near-end peer group who are footnoted in alphabetical order at the bottom of the slide. Among this group, Conagra continued to rank second in dollar sales growth and first in unit sales performance just as we did in Q2.\nThis remains true when you look at the same chart isolating the third quarter. And post-Q3, the syndicated scanner data has shown our unit sales trends improving. In fact, in the 4-week period ending 3 25 are units ranked in the middle of our near-end peer group on a 2-year CAGR basis. Our continued top-tier pricing execution and volume performance is made possible by the strength of our brands and the superior relative value that our products provide to the consumer.\nLet's take a look at our top line performance during the third quarter by retail domain, starting with Frozen on Slide 14. We maintained our momentum, delivering strong retail sales growth on both a 1- and 3-year basis, improving 4% and 23%, respectively. This growth was driven by a number of our key categories, including breakfast sausages and single-serve meals. It's worth noting that this performance comes on top of very strong performance for our frozen domain in the year ago period when the Omicron outbreak influenced consumers' in-home eating behavior. For example, single-serve deals grew 12% last year, creating a 2-year stack of 18% in that category.\nTurning to Snacks on Slide 15. You can see a similar story. We drove a 7% increase in retail sales compared to the third quarter of fiscal '22 and a 39% increase over the third quarter of fiscal '20. The continued momentum in this domain is broad-based across a number of categories. Compared to last year, seeds was up over 22% and baking mixes and microwave popcorn both rose more than 10%. Meat snacks grew 6% year-over-year, building on top of the 22% growth in the year ago quarter, a period when meat snacks were coming off allocation and our customers were eager to fulfill demand for our leading products in this category.\nWe also continued to drive growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio despite the discrete supply chain challenges in some of our canned meals and sides businesses that I noted earlier. Our staples portfolio increased retail sales 7% compared to the third quarter of last year and 20% compared to the same period 3 years ago. This growth was led by WIP toppings, which grew more than 18% on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to Slide 17. While we experienced transitory supply chain friction, we also continued to make progress on our supply chain initiatives during the third quarter, which benefited from continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives, which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, and more moderate increases in COGS as anticipated.\nThese improvements to our supply chain led to improvements in the service we provide our customers. While we're making good progress in supply chain, it's not back to normal and industry-wide challenges persist. However, we're recovering as expected, and we see more room for improvement as we advance our productivity initiatives, and the macro environment continues to normalize.\nOverall, we're confident we will deliver on our top line and margin guidance for the year, and we're raising our bottom line estimates. With that in mind, we are updating our guidance to reflect that we now expect organic net sales growth of 7% to 7.5%. We expect adjusted operating margin of 15.5% to 15.6%, and we're increasing our expectations for adjusted EPS growth to range from $2.70 to $2.75.\nBefore I hand the call over to Dave, I want to reiterate our confidence in the path ahead. We have successfully executed pricing actions in response to inflation, that inflation is moderating, and elasticities remain remarkably consistent and benign. We're moving past discrete supply chain disruptions and continue to make progress on our margin expansion initiatives such as productivity and value over volume, all within an environment that is normalizing.\nAnd as we look at more recent scanner data, we are already seeing improvements in sales trends and we expect that momentum to accelerate through the end of the fiscal year. Overall, Conagra continues to benefit from strong brands, strong processes and strong people, which are all working together to drive sustainable growth and margin expansion.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials from the quarter in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights as shown on Slide 20. We delivered another quarter of strong results, reflecting the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook. In the quarter, organic net sales increased 6.1% due to inflation-justified pricing and continued muted elasticities, as Sean discussed.\nAdjusted gross margin increased 409 basis points to 28.1%, and adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 23.9% for Q3 and 17.8% year-to-date benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives, reflecting our focus on margin recovery. This increase in adjusted gross profit contributed to strong adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.1% in the quarter.\nLet me break down the drivers of our 6.1% organic net sales growth here on Slide 21. We delivered 15.1% improvement in price/mix from our inflation-justified pricing actions. This price improvement was partially offset by a 9% decrease in volume. If you simply apply Conagra's current and historically favorable 0.54 elasticity factor to the 15.1% price/mix, you will see that elasticity explains approximately 8 of the 9 percentage points of the volume decline. The remaining 1 percentage point volume decline is mostly from the supply chain disruptions we've discussed. And given our elasticities have been running at these favorable levels for some time now, this level of volume decline has been planned in our fiscal '23 sales and gross margin projections.\nSlide 22 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q3. We are pleased with the continued net sales growth across all four reporting segments. Our domestic retail portfolio continues to perform well. With net sales in our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments, up a combined 4.7%. Our International segment saw solid growth in the quarter with organic net sales up 9.5%. International reported net sales were up 7.7%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Finally, we continued to see strong recovery in our Foodservice segment, which grew 17.3% in the quarter.\nI'd now like to discuss our Q3 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 23. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to have delivered a second consecutive quarter of strong margin recovery. We drove a 10.9% margin benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter and realized a 1.8% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with 8% gross market inflation impacting our operating margins by 5.9% and a negative impact of 2.8% from market-based sourcing. Finally, higher investment in A&P and adjusted SG&A during the quarter reduced margins by 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively.\nSlide 24 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. While some supply chain challenges continued during the quarter, execution of pricing and improvements in our productivity and service levels allowed us to deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment.\nTotal adjusted operating profit increased 30.8% to $522 million during the quarter despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense primarily due to increased incentive compensation. It is worth noting that we delivered 321 basis points of adjusted operating margin improvement in Q3 versus a year ago, while incurring incremental transitory costs in our Grocery & Snacks segment due to the supply chain challenges we've discussed.\nTurning to Slide 25. Our Q3 adjusted EPS increased by 31% or $0.18 per share compared to a year ago primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit as well as from a small benefit in taxes. Our Ardent Mills joint venture performance continued to be strong and has wrapped strong results from a year ago. These positives were partially offset by higher adjusted A&P and SG&A as well as lower pension and postretirement income and higher interest expense versus a year ago.\nYou can see on Slide 26, how we are continuing to strengthen our balance sheet metrics. At the end of the third quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.65x, down from 4.2x at the prior year period. Our net cash flow from operating activities reflects investment to rebuild our inventory levels. Improvement in our inventories has enabled us to improve service levels above 90%, and we are well positioned going forward in most categories to support sustained demand.\nYear-to-date CapEx was $267 million at the end of the quarter, down from $364 million in the prior year period, while year-to-date free cash flow increased to $436 million. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by the year-to-date increase in our dividend payments and share repurchases.\nFor the balance of fiscal '23, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value. As Sean mentioned, in response to our continued business momentum and ongoing operating dynamics, we are raising our fiscal '23 EPS guidance and narrowing our ranges for organic net sales growth and adjusted operating margin with only one quarter remaining in fiscal '23.\nTurning to Slide 28. I'd like to briefly discuss the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We continue to expect total gross inflation of approximately 10% for fiscal '23 and expect gross inflation to continue for the full calendar year 2023. We will update you at our Q4 earnings call in July with our inflation expectations for full year fiscal '24.\nWe expect our net leverage ratio at year-end to remain approximately 3.65x and anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $370 million for fiscal '23. This number is below our original expectations due to the timing of certain projects. We remain committed to making capital investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation.\nLastly, we expect interest expense to be approximately $410 million and pension and postretirement income to be approximately $25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nTo sum things up, we are proud that we delivered another strong quarter in fiscal '23 especially considering a supply chain environment that continued to present some challenges. Our service levels have improved and our margins continue to recover to pre-COVID levels, and we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities to generate value for our shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items.\nThe GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. I hope you all are off to a happy and healthy start to the new year. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. I'd like to start by covering some key points for the quarter on Slide 5.\nDespite our most recent wave of inflation-justified pricing, consumer demand for our products in the second quarter was strong as elasticities remained muted and well below historical norms. The ongoing durability of demand is a testament to the strength of our portfolio and demonstrates how the Conagra Way playbook has positioned our brands to continue to resonate with consumers even in an inflationary environment.\nThe successful execution of our playbook is clear in our second quarter results. We drove a significant increase in our top line. We continue to have solid share performance across the portfolio, especially in our key frozen and snacks domains, and we made excellent progress recovering both gross and operating margin.\nOperationally, we made good headway on our supply chain and productivity initiatives. While we're pleased with what we've accomplished to date, our supply chain is not yet fully normalized. That will improve. And overall, we see a long runway of opportunity ahead. We also continue to prioritize strengthening our balance sheet while making strategic investments in our business and returning capital to shareholders. In short, Conagra had a strong quarter across the board.\nGiven our positive results during the first half of fiscal '23, we have increased our expectations for the year, raising our full year guidance across all metrics, including organic net sales growth, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted earnings per share.\nWith that overview, let's dive into the results on Slide 6. As you can see, we delivered organic net sales of more than $3.3 billion, representing an 8.6% increase over the prior year period. Our adjusted gross margin of 28.2% represents a 310 basis point increase over the second quarter of last year. And our adjusted operating margin of 17% represents a 237 basis point increase over that same period. Adjusted EPS rose 26.6% from last year to $0.81 per share.\nSlide 7 goes into more detail on our sales results on a 1- and 3-year basis. Given the timing when the pandemic and inflation began to impact our industry, we believe that the 3-year comparison provides important context to highlight the underlying strength of our performance. At the total Conagra level, we grew retail sales more than 10% on a 1-year basis, and more than 26% on a 3-year basis.\nWe're pleased with our solid share performance, including how our strong brands allowed us to largely maintain total company market share while taking several inflation-justified pricing actions, particularly during the past year. Notably, we've continued to drive robust share gains in key frozen and snacks strategic domains, on both a 1- and 3-year basis.\nI want to spend a minute putting our sales growth in context. Slide 8 shows our performance over the past 3 years compared to our near-end peer group, including Campbell's, General Mills, Kellogg's, Kraft Heinz, Smucker's. We have a great deal of respect for our peers, all of which have been navigating the same macro demand and inflation dynamics over the past 3 years. Among this group, Conagra ranked second in dollar sales growth and first in unit sales performance.\nIt's important to keep in mind that all of these peers have taken pricing actions to help offset inflation and Conagra is in the middle of the peer set in terms of the price per unit increases in this time period. It's clear that consumers continue to appreciate the quality, convenience and superior relative value that our strong brands have to offer, which has enabled Conagra to perform extremely well on both on absolute and relative basis.\nLet's take a closer look at our top line performance during the second quarter by retail domain, starting with Frozen on Slide 9. We maintained our momentum, delivering strong retail sales growth on both a 1- and 3-year basis, improving 9% and 26%, respectively. This growth was driven by a number of our key categories, including breakfast sausages and single-serve meals, which both experienced double-digit retail sales growth compared to last year.\nTurning to Snacks on Slide 10. You can see a similar story. We drove a 14% increase in retail sales compared to the second quarter of fiscal '22 and a 41% increase over the second quarter of fiscal '20. The continued momentum of our Snacks business is broad-based across a number of categories. Compared to last year, microwave popcorn was up 21%, seeds was up 18%, and meat snacks and hot cocoa both rose more than 14%.\nWe also accelerated growth in our highly relevant staples portfolio, increasing retail sales 10% this quarter compared to the second quarter of last year and 22% compared to the same period 3 years ago. This growth was led by pickles and whipped toppings which grew more than 11% and 10%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. As I've mentioned, our strong top line performance was primarily driven by inflation-justified price increases, coupled with ongoing muted elasticities.\nSlide 12 details the relationship between pricing and volume over time. As you would expect, increased pricing does have an impact on volume, both for Conagra and the total industry. However, you can see how elasticities have remained steady even as we have continued to increase the price per unit of our products to help offset ongoing COGS inflation. And as we detailed a few minutes ago, Conagra's 3-year CAGR on unit sales performance leads its near-end peer group. The relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brand.\nNow that we've unpacked the relationship between price and volume and the resulting net sales, I'd like to spend a few minutes on the relationship between net sales and COGS and the resulting impact on our margin performance on Slide 13. Generally speaking, when a business has strong brands, strong processes and strong people, as Conagra does, it is able to navigate inflationary cycles in discrete, predictable phases.\nAs we have detailed for some time, when unprecedented inflation increased our cost of goods, we took strategic pricing actions to help offset the rising costs. However, there was an inherent lag between when we implemented pricing actions and when we realize the benefits of those actions in our top line results, this pricing lag resulted in temporary margin compression. Furthermore, continued inflation extended this period of margin compression as new inflation-justified pricing actions led to additional lag effects.\nThat is the dynamic we have experienced over the last several quarters as we continue to play catch-up by increasing price incrementally to account for the extraordinary extended rise in inflation. At the end of the first quarter, we reached a significant inflection point in the relationship between net sales and COGS, marking the end of the temporary margin compression phase in the beginning of the margin recovery phase. As you can see in the chart, inflation has begun to moderate in certain areas, enabling our inflation-justified pricing actions to catch up to the rising costs.\nSlide 14 shows the impact this inflection has had on our gross margin results, as continuously rising inflation weighed on our COGS throughout fiscal '22 and into the first quarter of fiscal '23, our margins were compressed. Now predictably, as pricing has finally caught up to COGS inflation, you can see the recovery of our gross margin to be more in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nWhile our gross margin can vary quarter-to-quarter due to a range of internal and external factors, the strategic pricing actions we have successfully executed, combined with moderating inflation and our strong brands, position us well to recover and maintain a healthy gross margin going forward. Of course, inflation remains elevated in many areas, and we continue to closely monitor our costs, just as we have in the past. We will continue to take appropriate inflation-justified pricing actions as needed.\nAnother key driver of our margin recovery is our supply chain performance shown on Slide 15. This is due to a combination of macro factors as well as the strategic initiatives we are executing to improve our operations. We made good progress on our supply chain during the second quarter, which benefited from improvements in the service we provide to our customers, continued headway on our ongoing productivity initiatives, which remain on track to achieve the targets we outlined at our most recent Investor Day, more moderate increases in commodity prices and improved inventory levels due to an increase in the availability of materials.\nThe takeaway here is that we're pleased with the progress we're making, but industry-wide challenges do persist. There's more room for improvement as we advance our productivity initiatives and the macro environment continues to normalize. As a result of our strong performance this quarter and the first half of fiscal year 2023, we are raising our full year guidance for all metrics detailed here on Slide 16.\nWe now expect organic net sales to grow between 7% and 8% compared to fiscal '22; adjusted operating margin to be between 15.3% and 15.6%; and full year adjusted EPS growth of 10% to 14% or $2.60 to $2.70 per share. Dave will provide more detail on the underlying assumptions behind these expectations.\nBefore I turn the mic over, I want to summarize what I've covered today. Our strong performance during the first half of fiscal '23 was primarily driven by a combination of inflation-justified pricing actions and muted elasticity, reflecting the strength of our brands. Consumers continue to recognize the value our brands provide despite the higher prices, allowing us to gain share in key domains such as frozen and snacks.\nOur top line growth was coupled with encouraging progress in a number of different areas of our supply chain that enabled us to operate more efficiently. Together, these factors as well as improvement in the inflationary environment helped us recover our margins to near pre-pandemic levels. As a result of our strong performance, we're raising our full year fiscal '23 guidance for organic net sales, adjusted operating margin and adjusted EPS.\nFinally, we're looking forward to seeing everyone who can make it to CAGNY this year. We plan to host our annual kickoff dinner on February 20 and are scheduled to present the following morning. We will follow up with more details on the event as we get closer.\nWith that, I'll pass the call over to Dave to cover the financials from the quarter in more detail.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights from the quarter as shown on Slide 19. We are very pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect the ongoing strength of our business and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook. For the quarter, we delivered organic net sales growth of 8.6%, primarily driven by inflation-justified pricing and muted elasticities.\nAdjusted gross margin increased to 28.2% and adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 21.7%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and productivity initiatives. The increase in adjusted gross profit, combined with another strong performance from our Ardent Mills joint venture, contributed to adjusted EBITDA growth of 21.5%.\nSlide 20 provides a breakdown of our net sales. As you can see, the 8.6% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 17% improvement in price/mix, which was a result of inflation-justified pricing actions that were reflected in the marketplace throughout the quarter. This was partially offset by an 8.4% decrease in volume, primarily due to the elasticity impact from those pricing actions. However, the impact was favorable to both expectations and historical levels.\nSlide 21 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q2. We are pleased with the robust net sales growth across our entire portfolio. Net sales growth in our domestic retail portfolio remained strong, with our Grocery & Snacks segment and Refrigerated & Frozen segment achieving net sales growth of 6.8% and 10.5%, respectively. The difference between the organic and reported net sales performance in our International segment reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.\nI'll now discuss our Q2 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 22. We drove a 12.2% benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter, driven by the previously discussed inflation-justified pricing actions. We also realized a 1.3% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives. These pricing and productivity benefits were partially offset by continued inflationary pressure with 11% gross market inflation negatively impacting our operating margins by 7.5% and a negative margin impact of 2.9% from market-based sourcing.\nAs a reminder, as commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market. Even though we see commodity inflation moderating, we will not immediately realize a benefit to the P&L as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to the timing of our contracts and when they roll off.\nSlide 23 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. As Sean detailed, our decisive inflation-justified pricing actions, coupled with improved service levels and productivity, allowed us to successfully navigate ongoing inflationary pressures and industry-wide supply chain challenges and deliver adjusted operating margin expansion in each segment during the quarter. We were also pleased that higher sales and productivity, once again, offset headwinds from inflation and elevated supply chain operating costs across all four segments in Q2.\nAs a result of this continued strong performance, total adjusted operating profit increased 25.9% to $563 million during the quarter despite an increase in adjusted corporate expense during the period primarily due to increased incentive compensation.\nSlide 24 shows our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter. Q2 adjusted EPS increased $0.17 or 26.6% compared to the prior year. This significant increase was primarily driven by higher sales and gross profit as well as a small benefit from a continued strong performance from Ardent Mills.\nSlightly offsetting these positives were higher A&P and adjusted SG&A compared to the prior year period as well as lower pension and postretirement income, higher interest expense and the impact of adjusted taxes.\nSlide 25 reflects the continued progress we made on our commitment to strengthening our balance sheet. Our net leverage ratio remained at 3.9x at the end of Q2, down from 4.3x at the end of Q2 in the prior year period. As we have previously communicated, Q2 is historically a heavier use of cash quarter from a working capital perspective. So we expect progress on our net leverage reduction to be greater in the back half of the year. With that in mind, we continue to expect to end the fiscal year with a net leverage ratio of roughly 3.7x.\nYear-to-date CapEx of $188 million decreased by $69 million compared to the prior year period, while free cash flow increased by [$104] million year-over-year. We remain committed to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by our payment of $159 million in dividends in Q2 fiscal '23 and $309 million year-to-date. The first half dividend increase of $27 million compared to the first half of fiscal '22, reflects the quarterly dividend rate of $0.33 per share.\nWe also repurchased $100 million worth of shares in the second quarter and $150 million worth of shares year-to-date to offset most of the longer-term performance-based shares we estimate issuing. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to strengthen our balance sheet and optimize shareholder value.\nAs Sean mentioned, we are raising our fiscal '23 guidance for net sales growth, adjusted operating margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share given our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23 and expectations for a solid performance for the balance of the year.\nTurning to Slide 27. I'd like to take a minute to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We expect gross inflation to continue, but moderate through the remainder of the fiscal year, resulting in an inflation rate of approximately 10% for fiscal '23. Additional inflation-justified pricing actions that have previously been communicated and accepted, will go into market in Q3. However, the magnitude of these pricing actions will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.\nWe anticipate CapEx spend of approximately $425 million in fiscal '23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation. Approximately $200 million of the $425 million was spent in the first half of fiscal '23.\nLastly, we expect interest expense to approximate $405 million and pension and postretirement income to approximate $25 million for the year, driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate remains approximately 24%.\nTo sum things up, we are extremely pleased with our strong performance in the first half of fiscal '23, especially the recovery of Q2 adjusted gross margins to near pre-COVID levels. This, along with our expected continued positive business momentum led to raising our full fiscal year '23 guidance.\nOur strong performance amid such a dynamic environment would not be possible without the hard work of our entire team and reflects the ongoing strength of our brands and successful execution of the Conagra Way playbook.\nLooking forward, we remain committed to executing on our strategic business priorities and generating value for our shareholders.\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening.\nI'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier. Please go ahead.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSVP of Investor Relation, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for joining us for the Conagra Brands First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. I'm here with Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO, who will discuss our business performance. We'll take your questions when our prepared remarks conclude.\nOn today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making these statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our first quarter fiscal '23 earnings call. Let's jump right in with what we want you to take away from our presentation shown here on Slide 5.\nOverall, Conagra delivered strong first quarter results. We had robust net sales growth across our portfolio, mainly due to the impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions, coupled with ongoing limited elasticities.\nWe continued to gain market share at the total portfolio level, particularly within our strategic Frozen & Snacks domains, and drove solid profit improvement during the quarter. We also saw another strong performance from Ardent Mills as effective management enabled the joint venture to continue capitalizing on volatility in the wheat markets.\nOur supply chain productivity continued to improve. However, we experienced some internal and external operational challenges during the quarter like many of our peers. These challenges led to both increased costs and inefficiencies, which more than offset the benefits from improved productivity and impacted our business in the quarter. I'll unpack this later in the presentation.\nWe also continue to strengthen our balance sheet, improving our leverage ratio during the quarter while investing in our business and returning cash to shareholders.\nFinally, our solid start to the year reaffirms our confidence in the fiscal '23 guidance we announced last quarter.\nWith that backdrop, let's dive into the results shown on Slide 6. As you can see, in the quarter, we delivered organic net sales of just over $2.9 billion, representing a 9.7% increase over the year ago period. Adjusted operating margin of 13.7%, which is down slightly compared to last year as a result of the supply chain inefficiencies, I mentioned a moment ago, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.57, 14% higher than what we generated last year.\nSlide 7 breaks down our strong sales performance during the quarter. At the total Conagra level, retail sales grew by almost 9% compared to the first quarter of last year and just over 24% compared to 3 years ago. Our momentum continued as we gain share in the marketplace, demonstrating the valuable connection our brands have with consumers. These share gains are most pronounced in our Frozen & Snacks domains, which increased share 0.8 and 1.5 percentage points on a 1- and 3-year basis, respectively.\nDiving further into our top line performance by retail domain, you can see on Slide 8 that Frozen generated a significant acceleration of quarterly sales growth on a 1- and 3-year basis of 8% and 27%, respectively. Clearly, our focus on catering to consumer preferences for convenience, quality and great taste continued to resonate. Similar to prior quarters, this growth was led by key categories such as plant-based protein and single-serve meals, which, along with breakfast sausages, increased sales by double digits compared to the first quarter of fiscal '22 while gaining market share from our competitors.\nOur Snacks domain also continued to deliver strong sales growth on a 1- and 3-year basis shown here on Slide 9. Compared to the first quarter last year, Snacks retail sales increased 13%. And as you can see, we have delivered sustained growth versus the period 3 years ago, including 36% in the recent quarter. In particular, we saw significant growth in sales of microwave popcorn, which increased more than 20% compared to the prior year.\nOur highly relevant Staples domain also accelerated sales growth, increasing 8% compared to the prior year and 15% versus 3 years ago. This was driven by strong performance in single-serve dinners and entrees with toppings, pickles and canned tomatoes.\nSlide 11 highlights the relationship between price and volume over time. As I mentioned on last quarter's earnings call, we continue to take strategic pricing actions during the first quarter to help offset ongoing COGS inflation. As you would expect, pricing has driven some volume elasticities both for Conagra and the overall industry. This tends to be most acute in the immediate aftermath of new pricing and wanes over time as consumers adjust. As you can see at the bottom of this slide, our net elasticities have remained nearly flat over the past few quarters. These relatively modest elasticities, both compared to historic norms and our peers, are a testament to the strength of our brands.\nAs we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we also look at the relative impact between branded foods and private label. As you can see on Slide 12, private label has increased its dollar share of certain categories on average since 2019, including a jump in share gains at the beginning of this calendar year. However, it's worth noting that those share gains are much more modest in the categories in which we compete. We're confident that the continued investments in our brands as part of the Conagra Way will ensure they continue to resonate with consumers. These important efforts, combined with our limited exposure to private label, will help us retain the market share we've gained during the pandemic.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dave, I want to talk about Conagra's supply chain and both the improvements and inefficiencies I referenced earlier. As I said, our supply chain continues to make progress. Pricing actions we implemented in the quarter and over the last year were largely able to offset continued inflation, and our service metrics continued to improve in Q1. While we're pleased with what we've accomplished to date, our supply chain is not yet fully normalized. We've continued to see some discrete inefficiencies pop up that resulted in higher costs in Q1.\nI'll give you 2 examples to illustrate this. In our Foodservice business, we identified an off-spec finished good issue while producing product for a customer. We disposed of the product and lost manufacturing time during our diagnostic. This pulled sales and gross margin below where they should have been.\nMy second example is in our canned chili and beans businesses where late, in Q1, we found cans that were off-spec. No product was recalled. And while production is now back up and running properly, the lost inventory effect will linger into Q2, impacting volumes and margins. The point is, these types of challenges can result in downtime needed to determine and solve the root cause of the issue as well as proper testing to ramp production back up. That lost time can result in higher costs and less production.\nLooking ahead, we're not expecting these discrete supply chain interruptions to disappear overnight as the external environment remains dynamic. But despite these transitory disruptions, we are making good progress in the supply chain, with core productivity continuing to improve. Accordingly, we remain committed to our operating margin target for the year and to the productivity targets we announced at our Investor Day in July.\nIn summary, we're off to a strong start in fiscal '23 fueled by robust top line growth as a result of inflation-driven pricing increases and muted elasticities. Operationally, we continue to make progress in our specific areas of focus.\nFor the balance of the year, we're planning for the operating environment to remain dynamic. While we expect consumer response to our brands to stay strong, we are planning for this quarter's volumes to be impacted by the supply chain disruptions, I just outlined, and from our most recent wave of inflation-driven pricing introduced to the market in early Q2. However, as I covered earlier, we expect this elasticity to wane over time. And while inflation remains persistent, we are starting to see moderation in certain areas and anticipate relief for commodities as the year unfolds.\nOverall, we're off to a great start. But 1 quarter doesn't make a year, and we remain focused on delivering for our customers and consumers. We continue to see a clear path to achieving the guidance we issued for fiscal '23 behind the strength of our brands and ongoing productivity initiatives, leading us to reaffirm those targets.\nWith that, I'll pass it over to Dave.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by discussing a few highlights from the quarter, as shown on Slide 16.\nOverall, we are pleased with our start to fiscal '23 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year guidance targets. We delivered strong organic net sales growth of 9.7% in Q1, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. Adjusted gross margin came in at 24.9% in line with expectations. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth was up 7.1%, benefiting from higher organic net sales and continued progress on supply chain productivity initiatives, although supply chain operational challenges did impact our business, as Sean referenced.\nThe Ardent Mills joint venture continues to operate as an effective inflation hedge as favorable market conditions and effective management drove another strong quarterly performance reflected in the equity earnings line and contributing to adjusted EBITDA growth of 9.1%.\nTurning to Slide 17. The 9.7% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 14.3% improvement in price/mix, a result of continued inflation-driven pricing actions. This was partially offset by a 4.6% decrease in volume primarily due to the elasticity impact from those increases. The small headwind from the impact of foreign exchange was the final contributor to net sales during the quarter.\nSlide 18 shows the top line performance for each segment in Q1. As mentioned, we are pleased with the robust net sales growth and continued share gains across our entire portfolio, particularly within our domestic retail businesses. Our Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen segments achieved net sales growth of 10.5% and 9.6%, respectively. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was reflected in the net sales decrease for our International segment.\nI'd now like to spend some time discussing our Q1 adjusted margin bridge found on Slide 19. We drove a 10.5% benefit from improved price/mix during the quarter, reflecting previously communicated pricing actions. We also realized a 1.2% benefit from continued progress on our supply chain productivity initiatives, which is net of operational inefficiencies Sean discussed. These price and productivity benefits were muted by continued inflationary pressure, with 15% gross market inflation impacting our operating margins by nearly 11%.\nMarket-based sourcing had a negative margin impact of 1.6%. As commodity prices rose quickly last year, we benefited from locking in contracted costs that were lower than the market and have rolled off this quarter. As a reminder, even when commodity inflation eases, we will not immediately realize a benefit as our costs may remain higher than the spot market due to timing of contracts. This is transitory and a product of a dynamic operating environment.\nSlide 20 breaks down our adjusted operating profit and margin by segment. We were pleased that higher organic net sales and supply chain productivity drove increased adjusted operating profit growth across 3 of our 4 segments in Q1. The strength of our Grocery & Snacks segment stands out on this slide, with adjusted operating margin in the segment increasing by 90 basis points compared to a year ago. Although Refrigerated & Frozen operating margin was down 21 basis points in Q1, this segment's gross margins were better than Q4 gross margins, demonstrating gross margin inflection that we expect to continue year to go. Inflation, supply chain pressures and elevated operating cost headwinds offset higher sales and realized productivity in our Refrigerated & Frozen, Foodservice and International segments.\nBefore unpacking adjusted EPS on Slide 21, I'd like to provide some context on the goodwill and brand impairment charges that impacted our reported numbers. During the quarter, we made the decision to reorganize the reporting structure for certain brands in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment. In connection with these changes and in accordance with GAAP, we conducted an evaluation of goodwill for impairment. Given the increases in the current interest rate environment, which has further increased from the rates we recently used in our standard Q4 impairment testing, a higher discount rate primarily drove the noncash goodwill and brand impairment charges of $386 million for the quarter in reported SG&A expenses. The charges are not shown on the slide because they do not impact our adjusted numbers, but all reconciliations can be found in the tables at the back of this presentation.\nOur Q1 adjusted EPS increased $0.07 or 14%. Higher sales and gross profit, Ardent Mills' strong performance and a slight benefit from adjusted taxes were the primary positive contributors to our adjusted EPS performance in the quarter. These positives were offset by higher adjusted SG&A from the comparison to lower incentive compensation in the prior year's first quarter as well as lower pension and postretirement income and higher interest expense.\nYou can see how we are continuing to strengthen our balance sheet on Slide 22. At the end of the quarter, our net leverage ratio was 3.9x, down from 4x at the end of fiscal '22. We expect to end fiscal '23 with a net leverage ratio of roughly 3.7x. Keep in mind that historically, Q2 is a heavier use of cash quarter from a working capital perspective. So we expect progress on our net leverage reduction to be greater in the back half of the fiscal year.\nCapEx decreased by $30 million year-over-year to $125 million during the quarter, while free cash flow increased $138 million from negative $15 million in Q1 '22, partially due to the accelerated receipt of outstanding receivables as we capitalized on certain customer payment terms. We paid $150 million in dividends in Q1 fiscal '23, an increase of $18 million compared to Q1 a year ago, highlighting our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. And we repurchased $50 million worth of shares in the first quarter in line with our stated objective of offsetting dilution from our share-based incentive compensation plans. We will continue to evaluate the highest and best use of capital to optimize shareholder value as we progress through the fiscal year.\nOnce again, we are reaffirming our fiscal '23 guidance across all metrics given our strong quarter and expectations for solid performance for the balance of the year.\nBefore opening up the call for questions, I want to walk through the considerations and assumptions behind our guidance. We continue to expect the inflationary environment to persist, but moderate through calendar year '23, which will result in a low teens inflation rate for our fiscal year '23 weighted toward the first half of the fiscal year. We also expect previously communicated pricing actions in light of these costs to become effective early in the second quarter, likely causing volume to decline. We recently communicated some additional pricing that will be effective in Q3. However, the magnitude will be smaller and more targeted than previous pricing actions. As always, we will continue to monitor inflation levels and price as needed to manage future volatility.\nWe expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million in fiscal '23 as we make investments to support our growth and productivity priorities with a focus on capacity expansion and automation.\nFinally, we anticipate interest expense to be roughly $410 million, and pension and postretirement income to be approximately $25 million for the year driven by the higher interest rate environment. Our full year tax rate estimate is approximately 24%.\nTo reiterate, we are pleased with our strong start to the year and remain confident in our outlook for fiscal '23. Our ability to deliver solid results amidst such a dynamic environment is a testament to the hard work and skills of our team, the strength of our brands and our execution of the Conagra Way playbook.\nThank you for listening. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. I'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Melissa Napier, Head of Investor Relations for Conagra Brands. Please go ahead.\n\nMelissa Napier\n\nSVP of Investor Relation, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nGood morning. This is Melissa Napier, Head of Investor Relations for Conagra Brands. I'm here with Sean Connolly, our CEO; and Dave Marberger, our CFO. Today, Sean and Dave will discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2022 results and provide some perspectives on fiscal 2023.\nWe'll take your questions when our prepared remarks conclude. On today's call, we will be making some forward-looking statements. And while we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nWe will also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP and adjusted numbers refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items.\nThe GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release and the slides that we'll be reviewing on today's call, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nI'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Melissa. It's great to be working with you again. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our fourth quarter fiscal '22 earnings call. I'll start with what we would like you to take away from the call this morning.\nThroughout fiscal '22, our team took decisive actions to offset inflation and invest in our business. We faced heightened costs throughout the year, but inflationary pressures were especially high in the fourth quarter. As a result, we implemented additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset the impact.\nWe continued to make deliberate strategic investments in our business to better serve our customers and meet the strong consumer demand for our products as physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty. I'm pleased that our brands continue to resonate with consumers demonstrated by broad-based share gains within the portfolio, particularly within our most strategic domains of frozen and snacks.\nWe are continuing to drive growth, gain share in attractive categories, and we remain disciplined in executing the Conagra Way to create lasting connections with consumers.\nAs we've communicated throughout the year, the external factors I touched on a moment ago, as well as investments we made to maximize service and product availability in the face of supply constraints, all contributed to increased margin pressure.\nWe continue to pull levers to manage these factors and we were pleased to see margin improvement materialize in the fourth quarter in Grocery & Snacks as well as Foodservice. This represents an important inflection point that we expect will extend to our Refrigerated & Frozen and our International businesses within fiscal '23.\nI also want to highlight the strong fourth quarter performance of our joint venture, Ardent Mills, which effectively managed through recent volatility in the wheat markets and continued to prove an effective hedge against inflation.\nLooking ahead to fiscal '23, we expect to see continued strength in our sales driven by strong innovation, the impact of pricing actions and progress in the supply chain to help offset continued inflation and elasticities. While we expect elasticities to increase incrementally from fiscal '22 levels as more inflation-justified pricing comes to market, we believe they will remain below historical levels. These expectations are reflected in the fiscal '23 guidance we're providing today. With this expected macroeconomic backdrop, we are lowering our long-term leverage target which Dave will discuss later. As you know, maintaining a strong and flexible balance sheet and keeping our investment-grade credit rating remain important to us.\nWith that overview, let's take a look at the results. While we had planned for high inflation, it was higher than we anticipated. Slide 7 shows our cost of goods increased 16% in fiscal '22, far higher than the 9% we anticipated at the time of our fiscal '21 fourth quarter call a year ago.\nInflation was particularly acute during the fiscal '22 fourth quarter when our cost of goods sold were 17% higher than a year ago period and 24% higher on a 2-year basis. The elevated levels of inflation we experienced in fiscal '22, particularly in the fourth quarter, required decisive actions in response. A critical part of that response included the inflation-justified pricing we implemented throughout fiscal '22.\nOn Slide 8, you can see the change in on-shelf pricing by quarter. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all 3 domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago and also increased in Q4 as we experienced additional inflationary pressures. We closely monitor the impact of these pricing actions on volumes. We've been pleased that price elasticity has remained below historical levels.\nSlide 9 demonstrates that unit sales have stayed largely consistent on a 3-year basis even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. Even in Q4, as more significant inflation-justified pricing took effect, the increase in elasticity was relatively modest and below historical norms.\nAs we monitor the impact of our pricing actions on volume, we look at the relative impact between branded foods and private label. While private label is gaining some share more broadly in food, we have not seen notable migration toward private label in the heavily branded categories in which we compete.\nThe superior relative value of our products continues to resonate with our customers and our consumers and the resiliency of our portfolio means we are well positioned to take additional action in fiscal '23 if we continue to experience incremental inflation.\nAs a result of our decisive actions, we're beginning to see the expected recovery in our margin performance. As I mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter represented an important inflection point as we saw margin improvements materialize in Grocery & Snacks and Foodservice, which helped drive fourth quarter operating margin improvement for the total company.\nAs I already noted, we expect our Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments to deliver operating margin improvement as fiscal '23 progresses.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, our team delivered solid Q4 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment.\nCompared to the fourth quarter of '21, Organic net sales for the fourth quarter increased at just under 7%, with growth in all 4 segments. And importantly, adjusted operating margin increased approximately 100 basis points and adjusted EPS was up over 20%.\nI'd like to briefly detail our performance across our 3 retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 12. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers modern attributes, convenience and quality to make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q4, we continue to deliver strong growth on both a 1-year and 3-year basis. And within this consumer domain, we've seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than double-digit year-over-year growth in both plant-based protein and single-serve meals.\nNow let's talk about snacks. As shown on Slide 13, we've seen a meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth in our snacks business over the last 3 years. In the fourth quarter, our snacks business grew 11% year-over-year. That equates to 34% growth over the same period in 2019. In this domain, we've driven growth in key categories, including meat snacks, hot cocoa, microwave popcorn and salty snacks.\nOur retail sales of ingredients and enhancers and shelf-stable meals and [sides] have also been growing meaningfully over a 3-year period, and that trend continued in the fourth quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, this business grew 5% year-over-year and 10% on a 3-year basis. In particular, we saw a large increase in the retail sales for syrup, which was up nearly 20% in Q4 on a 2-year basis.\nAs we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation has remained a key to our success across the portfolio, slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the fourth quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including whipped toppings, single-serve meals and plant-based protein.\nLooking at Slide 16, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a 1- and 3-year basis. Total Conagra retail sales were up 15.8% on a 3-year basis for the year. We also continue to gain share in the important frozen and snacks categories with our category weighted share growth up both on a 1-year and 3-year basis.\nWith that context, for fiscal '22, let's turn to our outlook for fiscal '23. We expect our strong brands, on-trend innovation, effective pricing, and strengthen supply chain to drive top line growth and margin improvement.\nContinued inflationary pressure in fiscal '23 is expected to result in incremental increases in elasticity, which, overall, we anticipate will continue to remain below historical levels.\nOur outlook also reflects our expectation that we will have higher CapEx and interest expense in fiscal '23, lower pension income and that the elevated performance from Ardent Mills in fiscal '22 will moderate.\nWe look forward to sharing more details about our expectations for the year at our upcoming Investor Day.\nIn 2023, we expect organic net sales growth of 4% to 5%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, adjusted EPS growth of 1% to 5%.\nBefore I turn the call over to Dave, I'll remind you that my team and I are looking forward to hosting an Investor Day on July 27 to discuss our plans for the future. In response to feedback, we've decided to hold our event in a virtual-only format to best accommodate our investors and analysts. Registration, dial-in and Q&A details for the virtual event are available on our website.\nDave, over to you.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with some highlights from the quarter and full year, which are shown on Slide 22. Overall, we feel very good about how we are exiting fiscal '22, and the way we navigated the dynamic operating environment that impacted our entire industry throughout the year.\nDuring fiscal '22, we delivered strong top line growth with full year organic net sales up 3.8% compared to fiscal '21, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. While higher-than-expected cost of goods sold inflation weighed on our adjusted operating margins throughout the year, we were encouraged to see Q4 operating margins improve versus year ago.\nOverall, our full fiscal year '22 adjusted operating margins decreased by 312 basis points versus last year to 14.4%, which was in line with the revised expectations we provided during our third quarter call. Fiscal '22 adjusted EPS of $2.36 was also in line with our revised expectations.\nTurning to Slide 23, you can see our net sales bridge for the quarter and full year. During the fourth quarter, the 6.8% increase in organic net sales was driven by a 13.2% improvement in price mix as a result of continued inflation-justified pricing actions as well as favorable brand mix. This was partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in volume. The headwinds from the divestiture of our Egg Beaters business and the impact of foreign exchange were the final contributors towards the 6.2% increase in total Conagra Brands net sales during the fourth quarter.\nThe bottom half of the slide highlights the drivers of our net sales growth for full year fiscal '22 versus the prior year. The highlight here is the 3.8% organic net sales growth that I just mentioned, which showcases the underlying health of the business and our ability to execute inflation-justified pricing actions.\nThis point is reinforced on Slide 24, which shows the top line performance of each of our segments. As Sean mentioned, we are pleased that net sales continue to grow across the portfolio for both the quarter and full year when compared to the respective year-ago periods. We also continued to see market share gains, reflecting the strength of our brands.\nThe sales momentum of the business is strong as we exit fiscal '22. We detail our adjusted operating margin bridge on Slide 25. In aggregate, our adjusted operating margin was 15% for the fourth quarter approximately 100 basis points above the year ago period. As you can see, we realized a 9% benefit from favorable price mix and a 1.8% benefit from net productivity in our supply chain.\nAlthough our productivity in the quarter was below historic levels, given continued supply chain challenges, the rate was up compared to Q3 and we are seeing steady improvement in our supply chain operations as we exit fiscal year '22. The price and productivity benefits were more than offset by gross market inflation of 17.3%, which impacted our operating margins by more than 12%.\nI will unpack the inflation impacts in more detail shortly. Together, these factors contributed to the 147 basis point decrease in our adjusted gross margin for the quarter compared to the year ago period. Advertising and promotion costs for the quarter decreased 38.7% driven primarily by lacking -- lapping the significant increases in A&P during Q4 last year.\nThis decrease contributed 1.1% to overall adjusted operating margin. Adjusted SG&A costs also declined during the quarter driven by decreased incentives and deferred compensation, contributing an additional 1.3% benefit.\nSlide 26 breaks down our adjusted operating margins by segment. We were encouraged to see both our adjusted gross margins and adjusted operating margins in our Grocery & Snacks, and Foodservice segments hit inflection points during the fourth quarter and begin to improve compared to last year. The recovery in these segments drove the 13.5% year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating profit during the fourth quarter.\nOur Refrigerated & Frozen segment was most impacted by higher-than-anticipated input cost inflation in Q4, particularly in proteins and edible oils. The above forecast inflation in Refrigerated & Frozen has pushed forward the lag until additional inflation-justified pricing is reflected in market. As we have mentioned previously, we believe our Refrigerated & Frozen segment and our frozen portfolio, in particular, is well positioned for further success.\nOur International segment was also impacted by higher-than-anticipated inflation and some FX headwinds versus prior year. Pricing actions were implemented as planned but were not enough to fully offset the cost headwinds incurred. As Sean mentioned earlier, we expect to see operating margins expand in both our Refrigerated & Frozen and International segments in fiscal '23, as pricing actions catch up to the recent inflation.\nI would like to take a deeper dive into the gross market inflation we experienced during the quarter, shown here on Slide 27. Inflation continued to rise to over 17% above the high end of the range that we were anticipating at the time of our third quarter call. It rose most acutely for commodities that are particularly difficult to hedge including chicken and pork. Even though we forecasted a significant acceleration of our chicken and pork costs in Q4, as depicted in the charts on the right, actual inflation came in even higher especially in chicken, which hit record levels compared to our expectations as of the Q3 call.\nWe continue to pull on a number of levers to offset the elevated costs including an additional round of inflation-justified pricing actions implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal '22 that will be effective in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and new pricing that will take effect in the second quarter of fiscal '23. Another strong performance by Ardent Mills also proved to be an effective inflation hedge in our Q4 results.\nSlide 28 details our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter compared to last year. The sales increase and recovery of overall operating margins was the primary driver of the increase in our adjusted EPS during the fourth quarter contributing $0.09. We also saw a $0.02 benefit from our equity method investment earnings, which increased 42.1% during the quarter to $48 million due to solid results from Ardent Mills as effective management at the joint venture allowed it to capitalize on volatile market conditions. A benefit from pension and postretirement nonservice income and higher adjusted taxes were the additional drivers of our EPS change.\nThe $0.65 in adjusted diluted EPS that we generated for the quarter brought our full year adjusted EPS to $2.36 down 10.6% from fiscal '21. On a 2-year compounded annualized basis, full year fiscal '22 adjusted EPS increased 1.7%.\nTurning to Slide 29, you can see our balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the quarter and full year. We feel good about ending the year with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4x, which was generally in line with the target we outlined during our third quarter call. We aim to continue decreasing this ratio moving forward as we prepare for more market volatility, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.\nCapital expenditures decreased by $42 million year-over-year to $464 million, or 4% of net sales. Lastly, we continue to prioritize returning capital to shareholders as we paid $582 million in dividends in fiscal '22.\nI'd now like to spend a minute talking about our guidance for fiscal '23. Slide 30 outlines our expectations for our 3 key metrics, including organic net sales growth of plus 4% to plus 5%, and adjusted operating margin of approximately 15%, and adjusted EPS growth between plus 1% and plus 5%.\nIn addition, we aim to continue reducing our long-term net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 3x, as I alluded to earlier. The macro environment remains volatile, and this target reflects our strategy to maintain an even stronger balance sheet as we navigate continued headwinds moving forward. And we continue to remain committed to a solid investment-grade credit rating.\nBefore we open the lineup for questions, I want to unpack the assumptions behind our guidance shown here on Slide 31. We expect the high inflationary environment we experienced in fiscal '22 to continue into fiscal '23, with levels in the low teens off of the fiscal '22 gross market inflation of 16%.\nAs I noted, we have communicated additional inflation-justified pricing actions to help offset these elevated costs, which we anticipate being realized during the first and second quarters of fiscal '23. And we are keeping a close eye on how these actions impact elasticities.\nWe forecast the environment to remain dynamic through fiscal '23 with elasticities, increasing from fiscal '22 levels but remaining below pre COVID but historical levels. From an investment perspective, we expect CapEx spend of approximately $500 million as we prioritize reinvesting in the business as a lever to combat inflation with a focus on capacity expansion and productivity enablers.\nWe also plan to increase our SG&A investment to support talent, infrastructure and continued automation. Interest expense is anticipated to be roughly $410 million for the year, pension and postretirement income, approximately $25 million, and our tax rate estimate is approximately 24%.\nThese 3 items combined represent an approximate $0.13 headwind to fiscal '22 adjusted EPS and are incorporated into our fiscal '23 EPS guidance of plus 1% to plus 5%. The higher interest rate environment is the main driver of the expected interest expense increase and pension income decline. We anticipate Ardent Mills having another strong year, but expect fiscal '23 results to moderate versus fiscal '22, particularly versus the elevated performance in the second half of fiscal '22.\nTo reiterate, we are confident about how Conagra ended the year and are optimistic about our future opportunities. We are looking forward to walking through these opportunities and our strategies to unlock them in more detail at our Investor Day later this month. That concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for listening.\nI'll now pass it back to the operator to open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Bayle Ellis. Please go ahead.\n\nBayle Ellis\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements today. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nAlso, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in either the earnings press release or the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bayle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will detail our results for the quarter and our updated outlook for the remainder of the year. We'll then open the line to your questions.\nI'd like to start with the key messages we want to share with you this morning. As we navigate a dynamic external environment, our team delivered a solid Q3 that was largely in line with our expectations on the top line and adjusted EPS. We remain laser-focused on successfully executing the Conagra Way playbook by creating superior products and ensuring physical and mental availability to create lasting connections between consumers and our brands. This enabled us to deliver a robust plus 6% organic net sales growth for the third quarter, in line with what we expected.\nThe strength of our top line can be measured both in the absolute and relative to peers as we gained share in key categories on a 1- and 2-year basis. And it's important to note that in response to inflation-driven pricing that has been executed in the market to date, elasticities have been favorable to historical patterns, even more so than what we expected. Unit demand remains strong as consumers continue to recognize the superior relative value that our portfolio provides.\nAs worldwide events contributed to an already challenging environment, our teams remain agile and nimble to respond effectively and continue to serve our customers. Our third quarter results reflect strong contributions from our latest innovations, and we have another exciting innovations slate planned for fiscal 2023.\nBut we also experienced higher-than-anticipated inflation as the third quarter unfolded. In the face of these heightened costs, we again made the deliberate decision to continue to invest to service orders and meet the strong consumer demand for our products, ensuring physical availability is an important part of maintaining and building trust and loyalty with consumers. While these strategic investments contributed to margin compression in Q3, we believe making them was the right decision as we position Conagra for the long term. Ultimately, we landed Q3 EPS a bit differently than we previously anticipated, but we did get there. Our adjusted Q3 EPS actualized in line with our expectations, above forecasted performance, and our Ardent Mills joint venture offset incremental Q3 inflation headwinds.\nAs we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, the environment isn't getting much easier in the near term. We now expect an additional $100 million of market inflation in Q4. The updated Q4 inflation forecast equates to a 26% increase versus 2 years ago. As we'll detail further today, this higher-than-expected inflation is disproportionately impacting some of our strongest businesses, including meat snacks and frozen. Keep in mind that these businesses rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and that frozen requires more specialized temperature control transportation.\nBut as we started to see this latest wave of inflation coming, we took action on pricing just as we have throughout the year. These new pricing moves go into effect in Q1 of fiscal '23 and are highly targeted toward frozen and protein snacks. These businesses have been distinguished by innovation-driven sales growth, favorable elasticities, continued share gains and limited private label competition. So although we are experiencing pressure on our total company margins near term, we will see the benefits of the new pricing actions we've taken to offset this latest wave of inflation beginning in Q1 of fiscal '23.\nWith this context, we're updating our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2022. Our updated outlook reflects expectations for continued strong consumer demand for our product and lower-than-historical elasticities as well as the further increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Specifically, we now expect organic net sales for the year to be plus 4%, and we project adjusted diluted EPS to land at about $2.35, which translates to approximately $2.65 of earnings power when taking into account the impact of the lag between inflation and our end market pricing this fiscal year.\nAnd with that overview, let's dig into the quarter. As you can see on Slide 6, our team delivered solid Q3 results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. On a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the third quarter increased at just under 8%, and adjusted EPS grew by over 11%.\nLooking at Slide 7, you can see that we continue to grow sales on both a 1- and 2-year basis. Total Conagra domestic retail sales were up 18.5% on a 2-year basis in the quarter. We also continued to gain share in the quarter with our category weighted share growth up on both a 1- and 2-year basis. And on a relative basis, our share performance continued to compare favorably to the industry overall and to our largest peers.\nSlide 8 demonstrates that we gained category share at levels that outpaced our top 15 peers during the quarter. And if you take a look at the chart on the right, the share gains in our frozen and snacks domains were particularly notable.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, our performance in frozen and snacks has driven our total Conagra share gains fiscal year-to-date and during the third quarter. Importantly, our categories are healthy, attractive and growing. As you can see from the chart on the left, our frozen and snacks domains have grown nearly 8% and 9% during the fiscal year-to-date and third quarter, respectively. So we're not just gaining share, we're gaining share in some of the most attractive parts of the store. These results are holding notwithstanding our need to put significant inflation-driven pricing into the market.\nOn Slide 10, you can see the extent of our recent actions which increased in Q3 and have accelerated over the last 5 weeks. On-shelf prices for our brands rose across all 3 domestic retail domains compared to the same period a year ago, with inflation-driven price increases most concentrated in frozen and protein snacks. We implement these pricing actions. We're watching the impact on volumes closely, and we are pleased that the price elasticity has remained below historical levels.\nSlide 11 demonstrates that unit sales have remained consistently positive on a 2-year basis even as the on-shelf prices for our brands have increased. This dynamic is a testament to the fact that despite the broad-based inflationary environment we're operating in, the targeted nature of our inflation-driven pricing actions and the superior relative value of our products continue to resonate with our customers and consumers.\nA great example of this is our Banquet brand in our frozen business. As we've discussed before, the Banquet brand is a mainstay in American households and has undergone considerable modernization to ensure that the brand delivers on its promise of relevant flavors, hearty portions and a great value. Consumers see the relative quality and availability of our Banquet products and continue to choose Banquet despite inflation-driven price increases. Banquet's volume has remained consistent as prices went up and start contrast to a key competitor.\nWe see a similar story in our snacks domain with Slim Jim, another brand that has made lasting connections with its consumers through perpetual modernization, relevancy and availability. Despite the increased cost of protein and associated pricing actions, Slim Jim volumes have increased considerably, far outpacing a key competitor.\nIn addition to strong relative performance compared with other branded products, we also continue to maintain share relative to private label products. Slide 14 shows private label dollar share across the edible industry at large, across the categories in which Conagra competes and across Conagra's frozen and snacking categories specifically.\nTwo things stand out about this chart. First, we compete in parts of the store with less private label penetration than the edible space at large. And second, the share of private label sales has remained stable amid the highly inflationary environment over the past several years. We believe the data shows that consumers are finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio.\nAnd we have not backed off from our modernization focus in the current environment. Innovation has remained a key to our success. Slide 15 shows the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new products and a modernized portfolio. During the third quarter, our innovation outperformed with the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. And once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including with toppings, frozen vegetables and frozen plant-based meat alternatives.\nAnd we have another exciting lineup of new innovations set to hit the shelves during fiscal 2023. The new products you see on Slide 16 are already being accepted by customers who have come to respect the innovation and marketing engine at Conagra and our ability to drive demand in key categories.\nOur ongoing investments in e-commerce also continued to yield strong results in the third quarter. We delivered compelling quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business as we outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth in Q3, building on our momentum from fiscal 2021.\nLooking at the chart on the right, you can see that our e-commerce business has continued to grow as a percentage of our total retail sales as we continue to invest behind supporting our brands. I'd like to briefly detail our performance across our 3 retail domains, starting with our frozen business on Slide 18. Frozen continues to be one of the strongest businesses in our portfolio and offers convenience and quality that make it the perfect fit for today's consumer. In Q3, we continued to deliver strong growth on both a 1- and 2-year basis. And within this domain meat substitutes, single-serve meals, desserts and multi-serve meals were the main drivers of our results. Driven by the appeal of our products to the consumer and the investments we've made in brand building and innovation, our leading frozen portfolio again grew share in Q3, both in the domain overall and within key categories.\nNow let's talk about snacks. Slide 20 highlights the meaningful acceleration in retail sales growth that we've experienced in our snacks business. In the third quarter, our snacks business grew 11% year-over-year that equates to more than 30% growth over the same period in 2020. Within Snacks, we have seen growth across key categories, highlighted by more than 20% year-over-year growth in meat snacks. Similar to our frozen business, our snacks portfolio is gaining share in this large and growing domain. We delivered share gains in multiple snack categories, including several popcorn categories, meat snacks and hot cocoa.\nOur staples retail sales have also been growing over a 2-year period, and that trend continued in Q3. Specifically, we saw very large increases in retail sales for refrigerated whip toppings and cooking spray, both of which were up over 25% in Q3 on a 2-year basis.\nSince the onset of COVID-19, many consumers have rediscovered their kitchens reinvigorating the relevance of our staples portfolio. As demonstrated on Slide 23, our staples portfolio has increased its share during this critical time frame with 2-year share gains across many key categories including Asian sauces, refrigerated with toppings, syrup, Sloppy Joe and canned meat. When you take a step back and look across our portfolio and the retail domains in which we operate, you see broad-based strength in healthy categories. We are driving growth, gaining share in attractive categories and remain disciplined in executing the Conagra Way to create lasting connections with consumers.\nThe health of our business is what will enable us to deliver profitable growth for the long term. In the immediate, however, we face a volatile cost environment that continues to be very challenging. As the third quarter unfolded, our expectations for full year fiscal 2022 gross inflation increased from approximately 14% to approximately 16%. The biggest driver of this change is the market inflation that we now expect for Q4. At the time of our Q2 call, we expected Q4 gross inflation of about 11%. Today, we expect Q4 gross inflation of approximately 16%. On a 2-year basis, Q4 gross inflation is expected to be an unprecedented 26%. And as I noted earlier, these incremental costs are disproportionately impacting our strong frozen and snacks businesses. Both rely on inputs like protein and dairy, which are harder to offset in the short term and in the case of frozen require specialized temperature-controlled transportation.\nAs noted on Slide 25, we're updating our guidance for the full year to reflect the trends I just covered. We now expect organic net sales growth of approximately 4%, adjusted operating margin to be approximately 14.5%, adjusted EPS to be approximately $2.35, and as I just mentioned, we're updating our gross inflation guidance to approximately 16%.\nWe're also providing guidance for the fourth quarter to reflect the higher estimated inflation and the lag in the offsetting pricing actions. In Q4, we expect organic net sales growth of approximately 7%, adjusted operating margin of approximately 15.5% adjusted EPS of approximately $0.64 and gross inflation of approximately 16%. While the environment remains challenging, our team continues to stay focused on executing our Conagra Way playbook and positioning our business for long-term growth and value creation.\nWe delivered strong sales growth and continued to gain share, particularly in our healthy and growing frozen and snacks categories, both of which continue to resonate with consumers despite necessary price adjustments to help offset the impact of inflation. While accelerated inflation has put pressure on our near-term earnings, we're confident in our ability to offset the impact with additional inflation-driven pricing actions. And overall, due to the strength of our brands and consistent approach to creating lasting connections with consumers, we are confident in the underlying health of the business and the many value creation opportunities ahead.\nWe hope to see you at our upcoming Investor Day on July 28 at the New York Stock Exchange, where the team and I will be sharing more on our plans for the future. We look forward to seeing many of you there in person.\nNow that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter. I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financials.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing our quarterly results at a summary level, as shown here on Slide 28.\nAs Sean discussed, we delivered strong organic net sales of plus 6% in Q3, reflecting the continued relevancy of our portfolio to consumers. We experienced better-than-anticipated elasticities on volume in the face of our inflation-driven price increases. Inflation pressures accelerated as Q3 unfolded as reflected in our Q3 operating margins. At the same time, our Ardent Mills joint venture, reflected in the equity earnings line, had a strong quarter driven by favorable market conditions.\nQ3 adjusted EPS of $0.58 was largely in line with our expectations, down 1.7% versus prior year and up 11.1% on a 2-year compounded growth basis. Overall, a very solid Q3 financial performance given the volatile operating environment.\nWe show a breakdown of our Q3 net sales bridge on Slide 29. Our 6% organic net sales growth was driven by a strong price mix increase of 8.6%, reflecting the inflation-driven pricing actions we have taken in every segment of our business over the last year. Volume declined 2.6%, primarily due to the elasticity impacts of the price increases, along with supply constraints on certain refrigerated and frozen products.\nLooking at reported net sales drivers, the divestitures of our peanut butter and Egg Beaters businesses drove an 80 basis point decline, and foreign exchange was an additional 10 basis point headwind. Together, these factors contributed to 5.1% growth in total Conagra net sales for the quarter versus a year ago.\nSlide 30 shows our Q3 net sales summary by reporting segment on a 1- and 2-year basis. We delivered organic net sales growth across each of our segments this quarter due to inflation-driven pricing and continued strong consumer demand. Growth was particularly strong within our Foodservice segment where volume continued to rebound as restaurant traffic recovers from the impact of COVID-19. Foodservice third quarter organic net sales were in line with pre-COVID sales levels.\nWithin our 2 domestic retail businesses, both Grocery & Snacks and Refrigerated & Frozen delivered strong price mix results for the quarter. Volumes were down a bit more in refrigerated and frozen than in Grocery & Snacks as we had some higher-than-expected supply disruptions in Refrigerated & Frozen in the quarter associated with labor and materials challenges, but we expect this dynamic to improve as we progress through Q4. For total Conagra, organic net sales grew at a 2-year compounded growth rate of 7.8% in the third quarter.\nWe show the operating profit and margin summary of each of our reporting segments on Slide 31. Adjusted operating profit was down 9.9% in Q3 and was essentially flat on a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see from our results, inflation and cost pressures were most concentrated in our Refrigerated & Frozen segment this quarter.\nI have a slide later in my remarks with specifics, but at a summary level, as Q3 unfolded, we began to experience higher-than-anticipated inflation on protein and higher costs in the temperature-controlled transportation network, both of which are harder to offset in the short term. But as you heard from Sean, our frozen businesses continue to win with consumers. While we look forward to getting back to a more normalized cost environment, we believe that our frozen portfolio is well positioned to support the additional price increases that the current inflationary environment require. We've recently announced new pricing actions for our frozen businesses as well as for our protein snacking businesses, which are also experiencing elevated levels of inflation. We will see the benefits of these new pricing actions in Q1 of fiscal year '23.\nPage 32 summarizes total Conagra operating margin, excluding Ardent Mills for the third quarter. This page really highlights the significant impact that inflation had on the business in the third quarter. Q3 total market inflation was 15.4% and negatively impacted operating margin by 10.6 percentage points in the quarter. This inflation level was higher than what we estimated when we discussed our outlook with you following Q2, and it's driven the additional pricing actions I just mentioned. The good news is that our 8.6% increase in price mix and sales translated to 5.7 percentage points of operating margin improvement in the quarter.\nWe also delivered 1.5 percentage points of productivity improvement, net of operational offset in the quarter. Our teams were able to deliver this level of net productivity even in the face of meaningful labor disruption. The level of base productivity we achieved in our plants and our production output were both challenged in Q3 due to Omicron-related labor disruptions. But with the labor situation now starting to stabilize, we expect these headwinds to abate as we progress through Q4. We also saw marginal benefits from A&P and adjusted SG&A savings in Q3. These factors combined to deliver adjusted operating margin of 13.7% for the third quarter.\nTurning to Slide 33. You can see our adjusted EPS bridge for the quarter. The operating profit drivers I just discussed resulted in a $0.06 decrease in adjusted EPS versus Q3 of last year. The primary operating profit headwind was the 15.4% inflation rate. The other major headwind in Q3 was the unfavorable operating efficiencies related to labor disruptions in our operations that I just mentioned. The tailwinds for the quarter were the significant price mix benefits and realized productivity that we delivered. We also had lower SG&A and A&P costs in the quarter.\nQ3 EPS was also favorably impacted by a lower weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt and by a very strong quarter from Ardent Mills. Given the nature of Ardent's business, it can benefit from volatile market conditions. Although Ardent income is recorded below operating margin in our financial statements, it is a cash-generating business that has performed well in this highly inflationary environment.\nAs you've seen in our materials this morning, the highly inflationary environment has caused us to reduce our adjusted EPS guidance for the year. However, we believe it's important to provide some additional details on how we view the underlying earnings power of our portfolio, which we believe is strong.\nOn a pro forma basis, we estimate that fiscal '22 adjusted EPS approximates $2.65 versus the updated guidance of $2.35 we're sharing today. So what does the $2.65 represent? First, as you can see on the chart, it incorporates the impact of the updated market inflation estimate we're now expecting in Q4 and driving a reduction in our previous EPS estimate of about $0.18. The $2.65 also reflects estimated favorability of approximately $0.03 versus the previous full year EPS estimate for Ardent Mills. Beyond those items, the $2.65 reflects our estimate of all the pricing lags we faced this fiscal year.\nAs you've heard us discuss in recent quarters, the reality of a CPG food business is that inflation hits the P&L before a corresponding pricing response can be executed with customers. Generally, that lag is about 90 days. We've estimated the impact of our pricing lags, netted elasticities for fiscal year '22. We believe that the full year EPS impact of these lags is approximately $0.30. This estimated impact excludes our Foodservice and International segments as we only quantified it for the domestic retail businesses. Of course, it's important to understand what this estimate represents. It is not our fiscal year '23 EPS guidance. We will provide more insight on our expectations for fiscal '23 after fiscal year '22 ends. But it is our estimate of what adjusted EPS might have been in fiscal '22, if price increases were effective at the same time that inflation actually hit our P&L., better demonstrating the underlying earnings power of the business.\nSlide 35 breaks down our revised inflation expectations a bit further. As you can see, the expected inflation rate for Q4 has the biggest delta compared to our previous expectations. If you look at the chart on the right, Q4 inflation is expected to be approximately 26% versus 2 years ago. clearly, an unprecedented level of market inflation that we are managing through. Slide 36 goes into more detail on where we saw this inflation impact on our supply chain most severely in the third quarter, and where the bulk of the incremental $100 million of new inflation is coming from. As Sean and I have both mentioned, transportation and proteins were particularly challenging in Q3 and remain so as we started Q4. Dairy has also been a headwind versus our prior expectations.\nLet's talk a bit more about each of these. Beginning with transportation, Q3 costs were heavily impacted by driver and truck availability, which resulted in more inflationary pressures from spot market usage and rates. Additionally, as you are all aware, fuel prices were driven up significantly during the quarter due to unforeseen worldwide events. With respect to proteins and dairy, we also saw Q3 inflation at rates higher than previously forecasted. Meat-based proteins are difficult to hedge and current industry freezer inventory positions are at multiyear lows. This supply dynamic limits our ability to build our freezer stock inventory, which is our typical coverage strategy.\nFor a bit more perspective on cost, our total meat-based protein spend in fiscal '21 approximated $675 million. For fiscal '22, we now estimate total meat-based protein market inflation of approximately 50%, which is approximately $340 million of additional market cost in this one commodity area, driving nearly 40% of our total gross materials inflation in fiscal '22. In summary, these 3 categories alone are estimated to drive $0.16 of the incremental gross cost inflation we're now expecting for Q4.\nTurning to the balance sheet and cash flows, we stayed the course on our balanced capital allocation approach this quarter. As outlined on Slide 37, we reduced net debt by approximately $240 million in Q3 and getting our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to 4.2x. As more of our pricing actions flow through our balance sheet in the fourth quarter, we expect this leverage ratio to drop to approximately 3.9x. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating and to our long-term net leverage target of roughly 3.5x.\nI'll wrap up with a repeat of the updated guidance that Sean walked you through. our new fiscal '22 and Q4 guidance are shown on Slide 38. As you've heard from us this morning, we expect our strong top line momentum to continue with benefits from our pricing actions and favorable elasticities driving organic net sales growth of approximately 7% in Q4 and approximately 4% for the full year, up from approximately 3% in our previous guidance and up from approximately flat in our original fiscal '22 guidance. Because of the incremental inflation we have discussed today and the additional lag in the pricing actions, we are estimating Q4 EPS to approximate $0.64, a strong increase of 18.5% versus the prior year. This results in EPS for fiscal year '22 of approximately $2.35, down from approximately $2.50. We also now expect market inflation for the year to approximate 16%, up from approximately 14%, and we expect adjusted operating margin to be approximately 15.5% in Q4 and approximately 14.5% for the full year.\nWe remain confident in the brand strength and underlying earnings power of our business. Following the Conagra Way playbook, we continue to invest in our brands to create innovative products that resonate with consumers, and we believe these investments have positioned our portfolio well to manage through this challenging environment.\nWe look forward to diving deeper into the progress we have made and the future opportunities we see at our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for July 28 in New York City. You will also hear from our new supply chain leader, LA Eby, who will review the strategic actions we are planning to drive further efficiencies in our supply chain. We will also communicate our algorithm for longer-term financial performance. We look forward to seeing many of you then.\nThank you for listening, everyone. That concludes my prepared remarks today. I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions."

(Operator Instructions)\nPlease note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Brian Kearney from Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nBrian Kearney\n\nHead of IR, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. I'll remind you that we will be making some forward-looking statements today. While we are making those statements in good faith, we do not have any guarantee about the results we will achieve. Descriptions of the risk factors are included in the documents we filed with the SEC.\nAlso, we will be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. References to adjusted items, including organic net sales, refer to measures that exclude items management believes impact the comparability for the period referenced. Please see the earnings release for additional information on our comparability items. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations can be found in either the earnings press release or the earnings slides, both of which can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, conagrabrands.com.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Sean.\n\nSean M. Connolly\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2022 earnings call. Today, Dave and I will discuss our results for the quarter, our updated outlook for the remainder of the year and why we believe that Conagra continues to be well positioned for the future.\nI'd like to start by giving you some context for the quarter.\nFirst, as you all know, the external environment has continued to be highly dynamic. But our team remained extremely agile in the quarter and executed the Conagra Way playbook. We navigated the ongoing complexity and delivered strong net sales growth anchored in elevated consumer demand that continued to exceed our ability to supply, inflation-driven pricing actions and lower-than-expected elasticities.\nWhile our net sales exceeded our expectations, margin pressure in the second quarter was also higher than expected driven by 3 key factors. First, while we anticipated elevated inflation during the second quarter, it was higher than our forecast. Second, we experienced some additional transitory supply chain costs related to the current environment. And third, in the face of elevated consumer demand that continue to outpace our ability to supply, we elected to make investments to service orders and maximize product availability for our consumers.\nWe expect margins to improve in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of the levers we pulled and continue to pull to manage the impact of inflation. We'll always look to our cost savings programs to offset input cost inflation. However, given the magnitude of the cost increases, our actions also include additional inflation-driven pricing. We communicated pricing to customers again in December.\nFor the year, we're once again reaffirming our adjusted EPS outlook, but our path to achieve that guidance has evolved. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance based on stronger-than-expected consumer demand and lower-than-anticipated elasticities. We're also updating our margin guidance given the increase in our gross inflation expectations for the year and the timing of the related pricing actions. Taken together, we continue to believe that elevated consumer demand, coupled with additional pricing and cost savings actions, will enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of about $2.50.\nSo with that as the backdrop, let's jump into the agenda for today's call. We'll start with an overview of the quarter before going into more detail on our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year. I'll also share some of our thoughts on the structural changes we're seeing in consumer behavior, particularly with younger consumers. We believe these changes are further evidenced in the long-term potential of Conagra Brands.\nLet's dig into the quarter. As you can see on Slide 7, our team delivered solid Q2 results. On a 2-year CAGR basis, organic net sales for the second quarter increased by more than 5% and adjusted EPS grew by nearly 1%.\nAs I noted earlier, we delivered these results in the face of a highly dynamic and challenging operating environment. Input cost inflation came in higher than expected in the quarter. In addition, we made some strategic decisions to service the heightened consumer demand we continue to experience.\nAs the entire industry incurred transitory costs associated with labor shortages, supply issues on material and transportation costs and congestion challenges during our Q2, we chose to invest in our supply chain and service orders. This deliberate decision ensured we could deliver food to our customers and consumers especially during the holiday season.\nMaintaining physical availability is an important part of building trust with customers and maintaining consumer loyalty. The bottom line is that amid the supply disruption seen across the industry, we remain focused on building for the long term. While the net result of these factors was a negative impact on our margins during the quarter, we're confident that our purposeful approach better positions our portfolio for the future.\nI want to take this opportunity to thank our tremendous supply chain team. They've been resilient in navigating this environment, allowing us to remain agile and deliver for our customers and consumers. I continue to be impressed by our team's commitment, and I'm grateful for their ongoing dedication.\nLooking at Slide 10. You can see that our strong performance in the second quarter was broad based. Total Conagra retail sales were up 14.8% on a 2-year basis in the quarter, with double-digit growth in each of our domestic retail domains: frozen, snacks and staples.\nHousehold penetration was also up this quarter, building upon the significant number of new consumers we've acquired over the past 2 years. Total Conagra household penetration was up 59 basis points on a 2-year basis, and our category share increased 41 basis points.\nIn addition to increasing household penetration and acquiring new consumers, we are retaining our existing consumers, as demonstrated by our repeat rates. Shoppers continue to discover our incredible products and their tremendous value proposition. As the chart on the right of Slide 11 shows, our consumers keep coming back for more.\nAs we execute our Conagra Way playbook, innovation remained a key to our success across the portfolio in Q2. Slide 12 highlights the impact of our disciplined approach to delivering new product and modernizing our portfolio. During the second quarter, our innovation outperformed the strong results we delivered in the year ago period. We continue to invest in new product quality, and it's supporting our innovation launches with deeper, more meaningful consumer connections. Once again, our innovation rose to the top of the pack in several key categories, including snacks, sweet treats, sauces and marinades and frozen vegetables.\nSlide 13 demonstrates how our ongoing investments in e-commerce continued to yield strong results. We again delivered strong quarterly growth in our $1 billion e-commerce business, and e-commerce accounted for a larger percentage of our overall retail sales than our peers. We outpaced the entire total edible category in terms of e-commerce retail sales growth during the second quarter, just as we did in the first quarter of 2022 and throughout fiscal 2021. As we mentioned earlier, our strong net sales growth was driven by elevated consumer demand, favorable elasticities and inflation-driven pricing actions.\nOn Slide 14, you can see the extent of our pricing actions in the first half of the fiscal year. During this period, our on-shelf prices rose across all 3 domestic retail domains. And, as Dave will discuss shortly, the pricing flowed through the P&L.\nAs you can see on Slide 15, price elasticity has been fairly low. It's been favorable to our expectations. Consumers continued to see the tremendous value of our products relative to other food options, a concept I will elaborate on in a few minutes.\nNow let's turn to the path ahead. You can see on Slide 17 we currently expect gross inflation to be approximately 14% for fiscal 2022 compared to the approximately 11% we anticipated at the time of our first quarter call. This is a large increase, and we're taking actions to offset the increase while still investing in the long-term health of our business.\nTo help manage our increasing inflation, we're taking incremental pricing actions, including list price increases and modified merchandising plans. Many of these actions have already been announced to our customers. As a reminder, there is a lag in timing between the impact of inflation and our ability to execute pricing adjustments based on that inflation. As a result, the incremental price increases will go into effect in the second half of the year with the most significant impact during the fourth quarter.\nWhile it's easy to get caught up in the quarter-to-quarter impact of inflation and pricing, it's important to keep focused on the big picture. The long-term success of our business is driven by how consumers, particularly younger consumers, respond to our products. And when you take a step back to evaluate the broader environment and how our portfolio delivers against the needs of the modern consumer, we believe that Conagra is uniquely positioned for the future.\nAs we've detailed many times before, Conagra's on-trend portfolio filled with modern food attributes is winning with younger consumers. And our confidence is underpinned by the many changes we're seeing in consumer behavior that are proving to be structural, especially given that these changes are driven by younger consumers that represent the most significant opportunity for long-term value creation.\nYounger consumers represent a large and growing part of the U.S. population, and they want to optimize the value that they get for the money they spend on food. A large part of optimizing their food spending includes shifting more dollars from eating away from home to eating at home. As they make that trade, they're choosing national brands. And we believe Conagra is ideally positioned to experience an outsized benefit from these behaviors given the relationship our brands are forming with younger consumers. Overall, Conagra is delivering superior relative value to consumers compared to both away-from-home options and store brands.\nLet's take a closer look at these trends, starting with the population changes.\nSlide 20 highlights the demographic shift underway in the U.S. Millennial and Gen Z consumers are a large and growing cohort. These consumers are starting to settle down, buy homes and start families. As we presented in the past, when people enter the family formation phase, they increase the amount of food they eat at home with an outsized increase in the consumption of frozen foods. And what we find particularly important about reaching Millennial and Gen Z consumers is that we believe they will remain more value focused than their predecessors.\nFirst, let's talk about the near term. As you can see in the chart on the left, Millennial and Gen Z consumers are earlier in their careers and earning less than the older generations of working-age people. This is natural, but it bodes well for food-at-home trends in the shorter term. We believe that even as foodservice bounces back, younger consumers will be value conscious in their food choices.\nFewer younger consumers are expected to achieve the financial success of the generations before them. The data on the right suggests that Millennials are more likely to earn less than their parents. We believe this means that these savvy consumers will look to stretch their food dollars further even as they age.\nThe data also shows that younger consumers are already eating more at home. Compared to the population as a whole, Gen Z and Millennials have decreased restaurant visits more and sourced a larger percentage of their meals at home.\nAs these younger consumers have made the shift to at-home eating, the data shows that they're finding comfort in the quality, reliability and familiarity that national brands provide. We believe this makes a lot of sense. National brands provide value while replicating many of the on-trend flavors and modern food attributes that consumers are used to experiencing in away-from-home dining. When consumers make trades like away-from-home to in-home eating, trust is paramount. In short, national brands, particularly modernized brands like those in our portfolio, deliver on this trust imperative, and that's because they offer superior relative value versus other food options.\nAs consumers seek to stretch their household balance sheets in the face of broad-based inflation, one of the single largest levers available to them is the reduction in spending on food away from home as food-away-from-home prices are typically over 3.5x more expensive than food-at-home prices. This trade will likely become even more important for consumers as food-away-from-home prices have already increased faster than at-home prices in calendar 2021, and they are expected to increase at nearly twice the rate as at-home prices in calendar year 2022.\nOur aggressive modernization of the Conagra portfolio over the past several years has put us in a strong position to capitalize on these structural shifts. Our portfolio has shown its competitive advantage with excellent trial, depth of repeat and share gain performance. Overall, we believe Conagra is well positioned to leverage these shifts to create meaningful value for shareholders.\nAnd Slide 25 shows you the data to support our claim. Conagra is attracting more younger consumers than our peers and getting them to repeat at more attractive rates. By appealing to younger consumers now, we're building superior consumer lifetime value.\nImportantly, the data shows that these new, younger buyers are stickier across our portfolio. We believe this comes back to the investments we've made and continue to make in our products and our brands. The Conagra Way has positioned us to win.\nAs I discussed earlier, we're reaffirming our adjusted EPS guidance of approximately $2.50 for the full year with a few updates on how we expect to get there. We're increasing our organic net sales guidance to be approximately plus 3%, up from approximately 1%. We're slightly adjusting our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15.5%, down from approximately 16%. And we're updating our gross inflation guidance to about 14%, up from approximately 11%.\nNow that I've highlighted our performance for the quarter and strong positioning for the future, I'll turn it over to Dave to provide more detail on our financial performance.\n\nDavid S. Marberger\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Conagra Brands, Inc.\n\nThank you, Sean, and good morning, everybody. I'll start by going over some highlights from the quarter shown on Slide 28.\nAs Sean mentioned earlier, there were a number of factors that influenced our results this quarter. First, we were encouraged to see that consumer demand for our products remain strong. And second, elasticities were better than anticipated.\nHowever, we also continued to see inflation rise across a number of key inputs, and the dynamic macro environment created challenging conditions for the supply chain. The team remained agile in response to these dynamics, including the decision to make additional investments during the quarter to meet the elevated demand and maximize the food supply to our consumers. Overall, our actions favorably impacted our top line during the quarter with organic net sales up 2.6% compared to the year ago period.\nAn important part of the top line success we've realized throughout the pandemic is our ongoing commitment to the Conagra Way. We've remained focused on building and maintaining strong brands across the portfolio. We continued these efforts in the second quarter with continued product innovation and by further increasing our spending on advertising and promotion, primarily focusing on e-commerce investments.\nWe show a breakdown of our net sales on Slide 29. The 4.2% decline in volume was primarily due to the lapping of the prior year surge in demand during an earlier stage in the COVID-19 pandemic as volume increased approximately 1% on a 2-year CAGR. The second quarter volume decline was more than offset by the very favorable impact of brand mix and inflation-driven pricing actions we realized this quarter, driving an overall organic net sales growth of 2.6%.\nOn last quarter's call, we noted that the domestic retail pricing actions were just starting to be reflected on shelves at the end of the first quarter. Those increases were reflected in our P&L this quarter, driving the 6.8% increase in price/mix. The divestitures of our H.K. Anderson business, the Peter Pan peanut butter business and the Egg Beaters business resulted in a 70 basis point decline, and foreign exchange drove a 20 basis point benefit. Together, all these factors contributed to a 2.1% increase in total Conagra net sales for the quarter compared to a year ago.\nSlide 30 shows our net sales summary by segment both on a year-over-year and on a 2-year compounded basis. As you can see, we continue to deliver strong 2-year compounded net sales growth in each of our 3 retail segments, which resulted in a 2-year compounded organic net sales growth of 5.3% for the total company.\nYou can see the puts and takes of our operating margin on Slide 31. We drove a 6.2 percentage point benefit from improved price/mix, supply chain-realized productivity, cost synergies associated with the Pinnacle Foods acquisition and lower pandemic-related expenses.\nNetted within the 6.2% are the additional investments we made to service orders and maximize product availability. These investments reflect the dynamic environment and actions we've taken to respond to it. This includes decisions to utilize more third-party transportation and warehousing vendors for some of our frozen products, incurring incremental cost to move product around our distribution network to better align with customer order patterns and delaying a plant consolidation productivity program to maximize current production. The 6.2% also includes transitory supply chain costs such as higher inventory write-offs and increased overtime to support operations.\nThe 6.2 percentage point benefit was more than offset by an inflation headwind of 11 percentage points. The second quarter gross inflation rate of 16.4% of cost of goods sold was approximately 100 basis points or $20 million higher than expected, driven by higher-than-anticipated increases in proteins and transportation, which are both difficult to hedge.\nThe combination of the favorable margin levers, our choiceful supply chain investments and inflation headwinds resulted in adjusted gross margin declining by 483 basis points. Our operating margin was further impacted by 20 basis points due to our increased A&P investment during the quarter, as I mentioned earlier.\nYou can see how these elevated costs impacted each of our reporting segments on Slide 32. While each segment was impacted, our Refrigerated & Frozen segment was impacted the most with adjusted operating margin down 707 basis points primarily due to outsized materials inflation and the additional investment incurred to service orders and get food delivered to consumers. We are confident that we will improve overall operating margins in the second half as we execute our additional pricing actions to offset the higher inflation rates.\nAs you can see on Slide 33, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.64 was heavily impacted by the input cost inflation across our portfolio. Even though the benefits of our first quarter pricing flowed through the P&L this quarter, the incremental inflation we incurred in the second quarter created an additional headwind. In response, we announced additional pricing to customers in early Q3 during December. Although we have yet another lag before this pricing benefits the P&L, we expect to realize benefits from these pricing actions in late Q3 with most of the impact in Q4.\nAlso, our Ardent Mills joint venture had another good quarter and delivered EPS benefit versus the prior year. We realized lower net interest expense and a slightly lower average diluted share count due to our share repurchases in prior quarters.\nTurning to Slide 34. I want to unpack how Q2 adjusted EPS landed versus our expectations.\nOur second quarter adjusted EPS came in lower than we originally had anticipated due to 2 main factors. First, as previously mentioned, inflation came in higher by approximately 100 basis points of cost of goods sold or approximately $0.02 to $0.03 of EPS. While we have announced additional pricing actions for the second half to offset the incremental inflation, the timing of these benefits is naturally lagging behind the higher inflation. Second, the cost we elected to incur to service orders, coupled with the additional transitory supply chain costs I described earlier, led to another $0.02 to $0.03 impact on our adjusted EPS. We are forecasting these service and transitory cost dynamics to improve as the second half progresses.\nLooking at Slide 35, we ended the quarter with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.3x, which is in line with the seasonal increase in leverage expected for the second quarter. We expect to generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the fiscal year and expect to end the year with a net leverage ratio of approximately 3.7 to 3.8x. We remain committed to a longer-term net leverage target of approximately 3.5x and to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.\nI want to close today by reviewing the factors driving the updated guidance we issued this morning, which is shown here on Slide 36.\nI'll start by saying that we remain confident in our ability to achieve approximately $2.50 in adjusted EPS for the full fiscal year. As the macro environment continues to be very dynamic, our expectations for the path to achieve that target have shifted. We are increasing our organic net sales growth guidance to approximately 3% to reflect our stronger-than-expected performance year-to-date as well as our incremental pricing actions in the second half.\nWe are lowering our adjusted operating margin guidance to approximately 15.5%. We expect the incremental sales and pricing actions in the second half to offset the dollar impact of the incremental net inflation and other supply chain costs.\nWe have increased our gross inflation expectations to approximately 14%, largely driven by higher estimated costs versus the previous estimate for proteins, transportation, dairy and resin. We will continue to monitor these input costs closely and will be quick to respond using all available margin levers. As Sean detailed, price elasticity has been favorable to our expectations so far.\nAs we have explained previously, there is a lag in timing between when we experience inflation, take actions, including pricing, to offset the dollar impact of the inflation and when we see those actions flow through our financial results. With respect to the additional pricing actions we have announced for the second half of fiscal '22, we expect to realize a small amount late in the third quarter and the full benefits from these price increases in the fourth quarter.\nWe, therefore, expect our third quarter margins to be roughly in line with second quarter margins with an increase in operating margins in Q4 as the pricing catches up with inflation and the impact of the lag is reduced. Our guidance also assumes that the end-to-end supply chain will continue to operate effectively as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve.\nBefore turning it over to the operator for Q&A, I would like to reiterate that confidence in our ability to reach our earnings goal is based on the strength of our business at its core to manufacture and deliver foods that people enjoy.\nThat concludes my prepared remarks today. Thank you for listening. I'll now hand it back to the operator for questions."

Our press release, presentation materials, and a transcript of these prepared remarks are also available there. In our presentation this morning, Sean Connolly, our CEO, and Dave Marburger, our CFO, will be making some forward-looking statements.\n\nWhile we're making those statements in good faith based on current information, we don't have any guarantee about the results we'll achieve. Descriptions of our risk factors are included in our filings with the SEC. We'll also be discussing some non-GAAP financial measures. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations and information on our comparability items are in our earnings release and presentation materials in the Investor Relations section of our website. I'll now turn the call over to Sean.\n\nThanks, Matthew, and happy holidays, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. Let's begin with the headlines for the quarter on slide four. As expected, the macro environment remained challenged, with a few new twists emerging this past quarter. In this dynamic environment, we're executing a tailored portfolio segmentation strategy to drive volume growth in frozen, and snacks while maximizing cash in staples.\n\nAnd though there was quite a bit of noise in Q2, both in the scanner data and our P&L, the underlying story is clear: our in-market execution is working, and momentum is building. We're seeing continued upward inflection in our growth businesses of frozen, and snacks, where we're strategically investing margin to drive volume performance. In addition, we're on track in our cash businesses, largely in our staples portfolio, where we've taken inflation-justified pricing to protect margins.\n\nOur supply chain delivered another quarter of impressive performance, with record service levels and strong productivity. We also launched Project Catalyst, a major initiative leveraging AI, data, and other new technologies to unlock significant value across our operations. You're going to hear much more from us on this in calendar 2026, so stay tuned.\n\nBased on our first-half performance and everything we're seeing in the marketplace, including underlying consumption trends, inventory dynamics, and our robust investment slate, we have high confidence in our plans to deliver a return to organic net sales growth in the second half and are reaffirming our full-year guidance. Before I get into the business performance, let me provide some context on the macro environment on slide five. As I mentioned earlier, consumer sentiment remained fairly weak in Q2.\n\nHousehold budgets continued to be strained, and value-seeking behavior persisted, with these pressures weighing most heavily on low and middle-income consumers. We also saw some unanticipated dynamics this quarter, many of which we expect will be timing-related. The government shutdown spanned about half the quarter, along with the related pause in SNAP payments. There were also two noteworthy dynamics related to weather.\n\nFirst, we had our first October in 10 years without a hurricane hitting the continental US. We had planned for a normal hurricane season. We also saw a slow start to winter. Finally, during our Q2, we often see retailers begin to build inventories ahead of the holiday season. However, this year, we shipped behind consumption, which we believe is due to two discrete timing factors. First, the government shutdown and pause in SNAP payments led some retailers to slow down ordering near the end of the quarter.\n\nSecond, several of our large customers made timing shifts on their promotional calendars, particularly impacting our frozen business, which moved their inventory build into our Q3. Given those dynamics, there was an unusual amount of noise in our top line, both in the scanner data and the P&L. In the P&L, undershipping consumption shaved about a point off of our Q2 net sales.\n\nWe have since seen these shipments start to materialize in December. As for the scanner data, this chart illustrates the unusual volatility in the quarter, mostly tied to the aforementioned weather dynamics and the pause in SNAP payments. So, to parse out the noise and provide a clearer view of the underlying state of the portfolio, let's look at our business at a category level. Starting with frozen on slide seven.\n\nAs you can see on this chart, in Q2, we were wrapping an exceptional quarter a year ago, where volumes were up 3%. You can also see the ensuing drop-off tied to last year's temporary frozen supply constraints we've discussed previously. This year, our focus has been on restoring our frozen momentum, and it's working. In Q2, while year-over-year growth softened due to lapping the very strong year-ago period I just mentioned, we drove strong growth on a two-year basis, sustaining the positive inflection we saw in Q1.\n\nAnd importantly, 90% of our frozen portfolio held or gained volume share over the same period. This tells you that our strategic investments are working and we're winning with consumers. As for performance versus the record year-ago period, we're pleased with where we are, particularly given the timing shifts of some major frozen promotions to Q3.\n\nSpeaking of promotions, slide eight shows our frozen promotion recovery also continues to inflect in the right direction. We're pleased with this trend and look forward to further progress in the second half of the year. Now, let's take a look at our largest frozen business, single-serve meals, on slide nine. On the left, you can see the continued upward inflection of our volumes across the last year, quarter, and most recent five-week time period.\n\nYou also see that trend versus two years ago. Why show the two-year look? Again, it's because in Q2 a year ago, we delivered extremely strong performance that we did not expect to exceed this year, having recently emerged from our supply impacts. The timing shifts of some of our major frozen promotions into Q3 further support this point.\n\nEven with the promotion shifts, when you look at the trend versus two years ago, you can see we've returned to solid growth at 1% in the latest period. What's particularly encouraging, and you can see this on the right side of the chart, is that our 52.9% market share remains far and away the market leader and very close to last year's outstanding level.\n\nWe're seeing a similar story in frozen vegetables on slide 10. Bird's Eye continues to perform very well. On the left, you can see strong momentum building across all time periods, with the most recent data showing more than 3% volume growth versus a year ago and more than 9% versus two years ago. On the right, you can see we've recovered the share we lost in the wake of our supply challenges.\n\nIn fact, we're now above 19% share and up 130 basis points versus two years ago. Our strategic execution is working. We've invested behind the brand, restored our supply, and are winning with consumers. Moving to snacks on slide 11. Once again, our snacks business delivered strong performance in Q2, significantly outperforming the snacking categories in which we compete in both volume and dollars.\n\nIn fact, this represented the fourth consecutive quarter of dollar sales growth in our snacking categories. We have exactly the right snacks business for today's consumers. Our portfolio of protein-centric high-fiber foods is in demand and on trend. In an environment where some of our competitors are struggling with snack portfolios weighted towards salty and sugary carb-heavy products, our snacks are resonating strongly with consumers. This is a strategic advantage that positions us well for sustained growth.\n\nThis is highlighted by our protein-centric snacks on slide 12. Our meat snacks business, including Slim Jims, Duke's, and FATTY, posted 5% volume growth and 4% dollar growth in the quarter. In fact, FATTY, our most recent acquisition, is on track to double in size in fiscal 2026. Our seeds business, including David and BIGS, posted 4% volume growth and 4% dollar growth. Protein is exactly what consumers are seeking, and we're delivering.\n\nOn slide 13, I want to highlight an important dynamic that's benefiting our Slim Jim brand. Compared to our broader portfolio, Slim Jim is disproportionately represented through the convenience channel, which includes the C-stores attached to gas stations. Accordingly, consumer traffic for this channel is correlated to gas prices. When gas prices are high, people filling their tanks tend to save money by reducing the number of trips inside the convenience store.\n\nThis weakness in C-store traffic impacted Slim Jim performance in recent years. With gas prices having moderated, the trend has reversed exactly as we expected. C-store traffic has improved, and so has Slim Jim's performance in this channel. Importantly, as you can see on this chart, Slim Jim's volume performance in broader multi-outlet channels has remained positive throughout. Now, let me talk about the sweet treat side of our snacks portfolio on slide 14.\n\nTwo of our sweet treat businesses, Swiss Miss and Snack Pack, experienced unusually high costs due to cocoa inflation. We raised prices to offset that inflation, and because of the strength of these brands, the impact has been very encouraging. We're seeing the desired effect on dollars: Swiss Miss up 14% and Snack Pack up 8%. We're also seeing volumes hold up despite the incremental pricing, with Swiss Miss up 5% and Snack Pack up 1%.\n\nTurning to slide 15 and our canned products. As I mentioned earlier, we planned for typical hurricane activity during the quarter only to experience the first fall in 10 years without a hurricane reaching landfall in the US. This combined with the later start to winter impacted consumption. In addition, we've taken inflation-justified pricing on these businesses due to rising steel costs. The early elasticities are on track with our expectations.\n\nWhat's most encouraging is what you see on the right. We exited Q2 with positive trends in several categories. Canned tomatoes improved from -3% to +3.5% dollar growth, and chili improved from 3.6% to 12.3% dollar growth as we effectively managed these businesses for cash. Our supply chain is also performing strongly.\n\nAs outlined on slide 16, we delivered exceptional service levels of approximately 99% in Q2, the highest sustained levels of service we've achieved as a company. Our first-half productivity came in at approximately 5%, which is very robust and keeps us on track to reach our full-year target. We also completed our baked chicken modernization project during the quarter, which will enable us to insource previously outsourced production at lower costs going forward.\n\nNow, let me introduce a new initiative, Project Catalyst, a multi-year comprehensive effort to leverage AI, data, and other new technologies to unlock significant value across our organization. We're reimagining ways of working, transforming end-to-end processes, and connecting our people with cutting-edge technology in ways that will drive efficiency and effectiveness. We have senior leaders mobilized across the organization, are seeing real opportunities emerge, and are getting increasingly excited about its potential.\n\nYou'll hear more from us about this initiative in calendar 2026, including specific targets for the value we expect Project Catalyst to unlock. So let me bring this all together on slide 18. Based on everything we're seeing, the underlying consumption trends, the inventory dynamics that we expect to normalize, and the robust investment slate we have in place, we are highly confident in our plans to deliver a return to organic net sales growth in the second half.\n\nWe've recently debuted on-trend, in-demand innovation and have more coming to market. You can see some examples on this slide. Our new Banquet mega breakfast bowls marks this brand's entry into the highly attractive breakfast category. Slim Jim is expanding into chicken with its Buffalo Wild Wings chicken sticks.\n\nDolly Parton is extending into single-serve frozen meals with delicious varieties like this beef pot roast, and Vlasic is building on the success of its pickleball platform with the introduction of new spicy Vlasic pickleballs. We have more merchandising planned for the back half compared to the first half, particularly in frozen, as we expect promotional levels to continue to improve.\n\nWe intend to increase advertising and promotional spending in the back half relative to H1 to support our growth businesses. As a result, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 guidance today, as you can see on slide 19. Our team is executing well and creating positive underlying momentum. We're seeing continued upward inflection in our growth businesses, and we're on track in our cash businesses. Supply chain service levels and productivity are strong, and we have confidence in our ability to deliver in the back half.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Dave to walk you through the financials in more detail. Dave?\n\nThanks, Sean, and good morning, everyone. Slide 21 shows our financial results for key metrics in the quarter and the first half. As a reminder, we entered the year with plans to invest margin to drive volume. As we mark the halfway point in the year, we've made solid progress against our objectives, and our first half results were largely on track to our expectations.\n\nFor Q2 specifically, Conagra's organic net sales were approximately $3 billion, a 3% decline versus the prior year. Adjusted gross margin of 23.4% and adjusted operating margin of 11.3% were both down versus the prior year, but slightly better than our expectations, which I'll provide color on shortly. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.45, down $0.25 versus a year ago.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the page, you'll see our first half results, including organic net sales of $5.6 billion, a 1.9% decline versus the prior year. Slide 22 shows our second quarter net sales bridge. Total Conagra organic net sales declined 3% over the previous year, with volumes down 3%, and flat price mix.\n\nForeign exchange was a 10 basis points tailwind, and the divestitures of Chef Boyardee, and our frozen seafood businesses together had a 390 basis points impact. Sean discussed earlier the noise impacting the top line during the quarter. The largest driver impacting organic net sales was a reduction in retailer inventories related to the timing of our merchandising activities. We estimate this was a 100 basis points headwind to the quarter, resulting in a gap between our shipments versus consumption.\n\nWe expect these shipments to occur in Q3 ahead of the planned merchandising events, and we are already seeing that play out in recent weeks. In addition, we saw a 60 basis points headwind due to lapping favorable trade timing in the year-ago quarter, in line with our expectations. As Sean discussed, unseasonal weather had a modest impact on results.\n\nWhile our shipments and consumption can be impacted by these timing items, we remain confident in the underlying momentum in the business. Slide 23 shows the composition of net sales by segment. In grocery and snacks, we delivered net sales of $1.2 billion, representing a 1.5% decline in organic net sales versus the prior year, as lower volumes and unfavorable mix were partially offset by inflation-justified pricing actions. Our refrigerated and frozen segment delivered $1.3 billion in sales, with organic net sales down 5.1% versus the prior year.\n\nThis was driven primarily by lower volumes, inclusive of the impact from the retailer inventory dynamics I just discussed, which slightly over-indexed to this segment, as well as approximately 140 basis points of unfavorable mix due to lapping certain promotional events in the year-ago period. In our international segment, organic net sales declined 2.9% versus prior year, an improvement versus Q1. We saw organic growth in our Mexico region, while Canada and global markets experienced volume softness in response to inflation-justified price increases.\n\nOrganic net sales in our food service segment posted a second consecutive quarter of growth, with organic net sales growing 0.2% over the prior year. Volume declines were generally in line with Q1 results and were more than offset by favorable pricing. Slide 24 shows that adjusted operating margin declined 406 basis points over the previous year to 11.3%.\n\nPrice mix was a 10 basis points tailwind, as our targeted price increases more than offset the recently discussed trade timing headwind and unfavorable mix. Total inflation remained elevated in Q2 but came in slightly favorable to our expectations. We saw some favorability related to moderating chicken prices, though proteins, including beef, pork, and eggs, continue to be key areas of cost pressure. Gross tariff inflation for Q2 was in line with expectations.\n\nAs Sean highlighted earlier, our productivity efforts remained strong in Q2, with core productivity, including tariff mitigation, at approximately 4.5% of cost of goods sold. Partially offsetting this was unfavorable operating leverage from lower internal production volumes, as we focus on optimizing working capital. We also completed our baked chicken facility project in Q2, an important milestone in modernizing our supply chain.\n\nAdjusted SG&A, which includes advertising and promotion expense, was 70 basis points unfavorable to year-ago, including higher incentive compensation expense as we expected. On a standalone basis, A&P was also slightly higher than year-ago from increased investment, but favorable to our expectations. Our segment-adjusted operating profit and margin results are summarized on slide 25. Overall, the drivers of the segment results are generally in line with the total company drivers just discussed.\n\nThe adjusted EPS bridge for the second quarter is shown on slide 26. Adjusted EPS was $0.45 in the quarter compared to $0.70 a year ago, driven by lower adjusted operating profit, lower adjusted equity earnings, a higher adjusted tax rate, and reduced profit from divested businesses, which more than offset favorable pension income and lower interest expense. Key balance sheet and cash flow metrics for the first half are shown on slide 27.\n\nCompared to the year-ago period, we've made solid progress repaying our debt, with net debt lower by nearly $850 million. We ended the quarter with net leverage at 3.83 times, which was favorable to our expectation. We remained committed to a balanced capital allocation approach as we continue to target long-term leverage of three times. Capital expenditures totaled $219 million, and dividends paid were $335 million for the first half, both largely in line with the prior year.\n\nAs expected, free cash flow in the first half was impacted by our seasonal working capital build, including building inventories ahead of planned merchandising events and lower operating profit. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter, nor did we have any additional M&A activity in the quarter. Shifting gears, I want to provide a quick update on our joint venture, Ardent Mills.\n\nArdent has performed extremely well over the years, and they play an important role for us through their contributions to our earnings and to our cash flow. The core flour milling business for Ardent has continued to deliver solid results. However, lower prices and lower volatility in wheat markets have negatively impacted Ardent's commodity trading revenue this quarter.\n\nIncorporating our updated projections, we now expect adjusted equity earnings to be approximately $170 million versus our prior expectation of $200 million. As Sean mentioned, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 guidance for key metrics shown here on slide 29. We continue to expect organic net sales change of -1% to +1% versus fiscal 2025, adjusted operating margin of approximately 11% to 11.5%, and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.70 to $1.85 per share.\n\nSlide 30 provides a bit more color on our expectations for the remainder of the year. For the second half, we expect to return to overall organic net sales growth driven by the wrap of our frozen supply constraints, our recent inflation-justified pricing actions, and the robust investment slate we have planned. Next, cash flow remains a top priority, including reducing our inventory to optimal levels.\n\nThis opportunity is made possible in part by the supply chain investments we've made and the strong service levels we've achieved this year. We expect to make meaningful progress reducing inventory in the second half, though these actions come with short-term absorption headwinds, which will impact year-ago margins. In addition, we expect A&P to increase in the second half relative to the first half, peaking at over 3% in Q3.\n\nThese activations, alongside the innovation and merchandising plan, further our priority of investing to drive volume in frozen and snacks. Taken together, these actions are expected to result in Q3 adjusted operating margin below our Q2 result. For the full year, our estimates for total inflation, including tariffs and total productivity, are largely unchanged at approximately 7% and 5% of cost of goods sold, respectively. While more recent changes to tariff policies are generally favorable, the impact to Conagra is limited, given our primary exposure to tin plate steel.\n\nOn an absolute basis, we continue to expect tariff expense net of mitigation to increase sequentially as we progress through the remainder of the year. We also continue to expect full-year A&P at approximately 2.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A, excluding A&P, at approximately 10% of sales, both unchanged versus our prior expectations.\n\nLast, as I mentioned, we expect adjusted equity earnings to contribute approximately $170 million. Finally, slide 31 outlines our additional fiscal 2026 guidance metrics. Aside from the change to adjusted equity earnings, our expectations for each of the other line items shown remain unchanged versus Q1.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks for today's call. Thank you for your interest in Conagra Brands."

I would now like to turn the conference over to FedEx Vice President of Investor Relations, Jenny Hollander.\n\nJeni Hollander\n\nVP of Investor Relations, FedEx\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Q1 Earnings conference call. The Q1 earnings release, Form 10-Q, and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to one question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.

Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Jenny. We delivered a solid quarter in line with the Q1 outlook we shared in June, despite significant volatility and uncertainty around the global trade environment. Our results demonstrate the resilience we have built into our network. They also reflect the dedication of our world-class team, who have adapted quickly to serve customers with excellence through an evolving demand environment. I'm very appreciative of Team FedEx. We continue to reduce structural costs while deploying Tricolor, advancing Network 2.0, and improving our European operations. These strategies are enabling us to flex the network faster than ever before and lowering our cost to serve, all while providing our customers with high-quality service.\nImportantly, we are continuing to win new business in high-value verticals, driven in part by our differentiated digital tools that are enhancing the FedEx value proposition and customer experience. We also continue to make meaningful progress, preparing for the spinoff of FedEx Freight, which remains on track. Following the spinoff, Freight will be a separate public company with the best customer value proposition in the LTL market and a proven track record of strong operational execution. Turning to our consolidated Q1 results, revenue is up 3% year-over-year, driven by strength across our US domestic package services.\nWe achieved our targeted $200 million in transformation-related savings and grew adjusted operating income by 7%. Similar to last quarter, the results at Federal Express Corporation, or FEC, demonstrate the operating leverage that we built into our business. On a 4% year-over-year increase in FEC revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 17% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 70 basis points. Notably, we achieved this result despite continued headwinds from the trade environment and the US Postal Service contract expiration.\nConsistent with the industry trends that we have seen in recent quarters, revenue at Freight remained pressured. That said, despite the prolonged weakness in the industrial economy, the LTL market remains rational, and we are well-positioned with our disciplined approach to strategic growth. I'm proud of the results our team is delivering across the enterprise, despite industrial economic weakness. While an industrial recovery is not required for long-term value creation at FedEx, I'm confident that we'll unlock significant upside across the enterprise when the demand environment improves. Last quarter, I spoke about the degree to which we flexed our networks to better match the demand environment amid global trade shifts. As policies and demand evolved throughout the Q1, we further adjusted capacity thanks to our Tricolor strategy.\nFor example, we reduced our Purple Tail trans-Pacific Asia outbound capacity by 25% year-over-year and nearly 10% versus the prior quarter. We also decreased our third-party, or White Tail, capacity by similar percentages. At the same time, we shifted capacity to capture profitable revenue on the Asia to Europe lane. With the full removal of the de minimis exemption in the United States late last month, we have been working closely with our customers, helping them maintain effective and efficient access to the vital US market. Given a significant portion of our de minimis volume exposure previously came from China, we were able to use learnings from our experiences in May to help shippers elsewhere navigate the more recent exemption elimination.\nThis level of connectivity extends to how we're advancing the elements of our transformation that are unique to FedEx. The Network 2.0 rollout is progressing well, and customer feedback, especially when it comes to the consolidated pickup experience, remains very positive. In the Q1, as planned, we optimized approximately 70 additional US stations. Our total optimized station count across the US and Canada is now approximately 360, enabling us to exit September with nearly 3 million in average daily volume flowing through Network 2.0 optimized operations.\nLooking beyond Network 2.0, improving profitability in Europe remains a top priority, and I am especially pleased with the team's year-over-year improvements in labor and on-road productivity metrics. Q1 also marked our best new business quarter in Europe in the last two years, driven by express parcel growth on both the intra-European and transatlantic lanes. Importantly, this business was well-balanced between B2B and B2C customers, demonstrating our focus on growing in premium B2B and longer-haul export B2C segments.\nThis commercial strategy, combined with our rigorous focus on cost management, led to a meaningful contribution to our year-over-year FEC profit improvement. I talked earlier about how our Tricolor strategy enabled us to flex the network to adapt to changing demand patterns. Tricolor is also driving greater densification and reduced unit costs across our purple, orange, and white networks. The strategy is simultaneously focused on enhancing service quality and mitigating congestion at major sort locations. Our execution on this important initiative is bolstering end-to-end solutions for global customers as we grow profitably in the global air freight market. This strategy supported an impressive 14% year-over-year Q1 revenue growth in International Priority and Economy Freight with high flow-through. Data and technology remain foundational to our business, but we are entering a new chapter in how we leverage them.\nOur founders' vision, more than 45 years ago, that information about the package is as important as the package itself, has proven prescient. Today, FedEx operates an advanced Digital Twin that goes beyond tracking. It is becoming an intelligent system that anticipates disruptions, provides optimized route information in real time, and creates predictive customer experiences. We move 17 million packages through our network daily, generating 2 petabytes of data and 100 billion transactions across software applications. The real value isn't in the volume. It is in the unique nature of this data. Our position at the intersection of global commerce gives us an unmatched view of physical supply chain patterns, seasonal demand shifts, and emerging trade corridors. This real-world operational data platform cannot be replicated by any competitor or a tech solution.\nSimply put, FedEx owns one of the richest logistics intelligence assets in the world. I'm excited to welcome Vishal Talwar, our new Chief Digital and Information Officer and President of FedEx DataWorks, who joined us last month. As the former Chief Growth Officer at Accenture Technology, Vishal brings deep expertise in enterprise AI and understands how to leverage our unique physical digital assets into next-generation AI-led capabilities.\nUnder Vishal's leadership, we will continue accelerating two key priorities: scaling AI across the enterprise, from enterprise function to how we operate and serve our customers, and exploring new revenue models that leverage our unique assets. We're also strengthening our cybersecurity posture to protect our strategic advantages. Before I turn the call over to Brie, I'd like to update you on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current assumptions, we expect full-year adjusted earnings to be $17.20 to 19 per diluted share.\nThis reflects a range of scenarios in what remains a dynamic global operating environment. As it continues to evolve, we will remain focused on executing on our commercial priorities, dynamically matching capacity with demand, and delivering on the $1 billion in transformation-related savings we shared previously. Brie and John will provide more details on the key variables and underlying assumptions for this outlook shortly. We have made tremendous progress on our transformation, and there is much more to come. To that end, we are excited to announce that our next FedEx Corp Investor Day will be held in Memphis on 11 February and 12 February 2026. I look forward to seeing many of you there, where we will provide more detailed updates on our strategic initiatives and our longer-term financial targets. Now, over to you, Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. I'm very proud of our entire global team for how they are supporting our customers in the current trade environment. Our strong value proposition, including superior weekend coverage, supported 3% year-over-year revenue growth across the enterprise. This is the highest quarterly rate we have seen since the pandemic. At FEC, revenue was up 4%, driven by US domestic package revenue strength. This was a direct result of profitable share growth in the US domestic market. This strength was partially offset by continued weakness at FedEx Freight due to the continued pressure from the industrial economy. Our value proposition is helping us deepen our customer relationships and win business. For example, in Q1, Best Buy named FedEx as their primary national parcel carrier.\nLeveraging our advanced visibility tools, Best Buy will provide real-time tracking data and customer order communication, improving their customers' experiences. By providing customers with more timely and accurate updates, the company also expects to reduce support calls, cancellations, and reship costs. We are excited to partner with Best Buy to create a smarter, more reliable supply chain that further strengthens their customer trust. We were pleased to deliver a 5% increase in US domestic ADV year-over-year, with growth across the majority of our services. In line with our expectations and consistent with the trends we saw in May, international export volumes declined, particularly on the China to US lane. Knowing our strongest international lane would be under pressure, we pivoted the commercial team, and they have done a tremendous job capturing demand out of Southeast Asia and Europe.\nThis provided a partial offset against the headwinds to demand on the China to US export lane. The team has also done a great job maximizing US outbound capacity. We are seeing improving trends in both outbound weight and volume, supported by strong growth in our healthcare vertical. At FedEx Freight, along with broader industry trends, average daily shipments declined. Weakness in the industrial economy and excess capacity in the truckload market continue to pressure our results. That said, Freight made excellent progress in the quarter, continuing to stand up its dedicated sales team.\nThis team is focused on improving the customer experience and maintaining strong yields. As the industrial economy improves, Freight is poised for growth and margin expansion. The parcel pricing environment continues to improve. We have achieved strong capture from our pricing changes in the quarter, which included an increase in our fuel surcharge index. At FEC, US domestic package yield was up 3%, driven by strength across all services. International export package yield grew 4%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, favorable exchange rate impacts, and the reduction in lightweight e-commerce volume due to the change in the de minimis exemption.\nOur Tricolor strategy continued to drive growth in international priority and economy freight, where we delivered a 9% increase in revenue per pound. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment declined 1%, driven by lower revenue per hundredweight and lower fuel surcharges. While weight per shipment was flat year-over-year, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in weight per shipment over the past few quarters, and FedEx Freight revenue per hundredweight remains among the highest in the industry. We announced our demand surcharges in July, which are needed to offset the incremental cost at peak to deliver outstanding service while protecting profitability. Earlier this month, we announced a 5.9% general rate increase effective in January.\nWe expect strong capture from both. In Q1, we prepared for the ramping of our new Amazon business, which was minimal in Q1, as we expected. We believe the onboarding will be complete by Q3, which will support continued US domestic revenue growth in the quarters ahead. This profitable business will skew towards larger, heavier weight packages. We are cautiously optimistic about peak season growth, based on what we are hearing from our customers currently. As a reminder, this year's peak season will last one day longer than last year's. With that in mind, we are expecting a modest increase in peak ADV versus fiscal year 2025 and a mid- to high-single-digit increase in year-over-year total peak volume, with growth driven by our larger B2C customers.\nRegarding the full-year outlook, we are currently planning for revenue growth of 4% to 6%. The top of this range assumes that current favorable trends in the US domestic segment continue, and the lower end assumes incremental pressure on US demand, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. On the international side, the top of the revenue range assumes the current level of international export revenue pressures continue through the rest of the fiscal year, while the lower end assumes an acceleration in these pressures. At FedEx Freight, we expect revenue to be flat to up modestly year-over-year, depending largely on the market conditions in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to advance our commercial priorities, sharply focused on B2B, small and medium-sized businesses, Europe, and of course, global air freight. Within B2B, we continue to onboard new healthcare business in Q1, building on our momentum from prior quarters. This includes strong healthcare-related growth within our global air freight business. Later this month, we are launching a new flight linking Dublin and Indianapolis. This new flight will move goods one day faster, supporting healthcare and other high-value verticals with shipments between Ireland and the US. We grew our US domestic small business revenue by more than 10% year-over-year in the Q1.\nThis was fueled by focused and targeted sales execution and a close alignment between our sales and our operations teams. This collaboration is accelerating onboarding, shortening deal cycles, and driving meaningful new acquisitions. We are also scaling high-impact support to deliver exceptional customer experiences during this complex environment. FedEx Rewards, our loyalty program, which is unique in the industry, continues to see significant growth while deepening our S&B customer relationships. In closing, I'm very proud of our team's strong execution in this dynamic environment. We are helping our customers manage through evolving policies and changing demand patterns.We remain disciplined in our approach to revenue quality. We are ready to continue providing outstanding service to our customers before, during, and after peak. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Brie. Our Q1 results reflect the tenacity and agility of the FedEx team in providing outstanding service while delivering on our strategic initiatives and increasing stockholder returns. We executed very well in Q1, with results above the midpoint of our adjusted EPS outlook range. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital expenditure, continued to repurchase stock, and grew our quarterly dividend. Turning to our financial results, on a consolidated basis, in the Q1, we delivered $3.83 in adjusted earnings per share, up 6% year-over-year. We delivered these positive results despite significant headwinds from reduced international export demand and the expiration of the US Postal Service contract. Overall, we delivered revenue growth of 3%, which supported 20 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7% adjusted operating income growth.\nAs Brie mentioned, our yield management and strong commercial execution resulted in higher revenue growth from US domestic package services, which contributed to our year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement. We grew adjusted operating income by approximately $90 million despite the $150 million headwinds from the global trade environment, $130 million of headwind from the US Postal Service contract expiration, and continued softness at FedEx Freight. As a reminder, we'll lap the expiration of the Postal Service contract at the end of this month. Additionally, our Q1 results reflect a higher-than-expected Q1 GAAP tax rate of 27.3%, which was unfavorably impacted by a non-recurring income tax expense related to the examination of prior year tax return filings.\nTurning to performance by segment, at FEC, adjusted operating income increased by $168 million, up 17%, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted margin expansion for FEC. This was driven by higher yields, continued cost reduction efforts, and increased US domestic package volume. These drivers were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, and the headwinds I mentioned earlier. As expected, due to the evolving trade environment in the quarter, we experienced a material headwind on our Asia to US lane, largely from China outbound, driving most of the $150 million international export headwind to adjusted operating income.\nAt FedEx Freight, adjusted operating income declined by just over $70 million, and adjusted operating margin contracted 250 basis points. Though the current operating environment is challenging for the entire LTL sector, FedEx Freight is uniquely positioned to see strong incremental margins in the eventual market upswing.Moving on to capital allocation, during the quarter, we opportunistically purchased $500 million worth of stock, which, alongside our increased dividend payout, demonstrates our unwavering commitment to increasing stockholder value. We have $1.6 billion remaining under our 2024 stock repurchase authorization, and subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue repurchasing shares during the remainder of FY26.\nFedEx maintains a healthy balance sheet with $6.2 billion of cash on hand exiting Q1 and with investment-grade credit ratings from the major agencies. I'm also very pleased that our recent euro-denominated bond offering was significantly oversubscribed, a testament to the strength of our business, balance sheet, and capital allocation strategy. Q1 CapEx was $623 million, driven by Network 2.0-related facility enhancements, hub modernization, and continued investments to maintain our fleet of aircraft and vehicles. We continue to target $4.5 billion in annual CapEx for FedEx Corp in FY26.\nWith regard to pension contributions, given the well-funded status of our pension plan, we are reducing our expected pension cash contribution. We now anticipate making up to $400 million in voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans in fiscal 2026, compared to our prior forecast of up to $600 million. Moving to our FY26 adjusted EPS outlook, which is based on the information that is known to us today. Though the global operating environment remains fluid, with dynamic economic conditions across geographies, our value proposition remains strong, and we continue to execute effectively. As a result, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $17.20 to 19, which reflects a range of potential scenarios for the year.\nFactors that will determine where we ultimately fall in the outlook range include the evolution of global trade, the health of the industrial economy, the US domestic demand environment, traction in our higher-margin B2B verticals, and inflation. Adjusted EPS of $18.10, which is the midpoint of our range, assumes consolidated revenue growth of 5% and $1 billion in transformation-related savings from our structural cost reductions, Network 2.0, and associated One FedEx savings in FY26. We expect Adjusted Operating Income offsets to include a $1 billion headwind due to the global trade environment, recognizing this number could flex in either direction as the environment evolves, and a $160 million headwind to Adjusted Operating Income from the expiration of the Postal Contract.\nWe expect our FY26 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and EPS to be supported by our share repurchase program, as I mentioned earlier. At the midpoint of our range, we anticipate a 6% increase in Federal Express revenue, with adjusted operating margin down slightly. Also, at the midpoint, we expect low single-digit improvement in FedEx Freight revenue, with margin down year-over-year. Now turning to our FY26 adjusted operating income bridge, we're introducing a new view of this bridge to provide deeper insights into the expected drivers of profitability this year.\nThe bridge shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our outlook in one of the scenarios at the midpoint, resulting in adjusted operating income of $6 billion. Of course, the assumptions behind the variables at the midpoint may flex as the environment changes. In this scenario, for FEC volume-related revenue net of variable costs associated with this volume, we expect a $400 million tailwind driven largely by US domestic package services, offset by a material headwind from reduced international export demand. With respect to FEC yield, we expect a $2.3 billion tailwind, demonstrating our commitment to revenue quality and continued pricing discipline.\nOffsets to these tailwinds include a $2.1 billion base expense increase across the business, excluding FedEx Freight, a $300 million headwind from direct trade-related expenses, including higher customs clearance costs, a $160 million US Postal Service contract expiration headwind I mentioned earlier, a $100 million decline in adjusted operating profit at Freight, and a $100 million headwind from the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Embedded in our assumptions are the previously mentioned $1 billion in headwind to adjusted operating profit from the global trade environment, and $1 billion in transformation-related savings from Drive and Network 2.0. And while Drive began as a cost reduction program, it is now fundamental to how we run our business. With regard to Q2, we anticipate a sequential improvement in adjusted EPS.\nAt FEC, we expect to maintain or improve operating margin sequentially, and at FedEx Freight, we expect the year-over-year decline in adjusted operating margin to begin moderating sequentially in Q2. Before turning to Q&A, I want to provide an update on our spinoff of FedEx Freight, which is progressing well and on track for the June 2026 separation. In August, we submitted our confidential Form 10 to the SEC, and in September, we submitted a request for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the transaction to the IRS. These are important milestones as we move toward the tax-efficient spinoff. Freight now has about 200 frontline LTL sales and sales support personnel on board and is well on its way toward our goal of 400 sales specialists prior to the spinoff.\nI'm confident that both the expanded dedicated sales force and our ramping technology investments will continue to improve the customer experience. Once separated, FedEx Freight will be a separately traded public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FDXF, and we plan to host our FedEx Freight Investor Day in New York City in spring of 2026 prior to the separation. Overall, I remain confident that the FedEx Freight separation and the continued execution of our strategic priorities will unlock significant stockholder value in the years ahead. And with that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star, then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star, then 2. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, afternoon. Thanks for the color on the midpoint. I'm curious on the low and the high end of your EPS range. Is it simply a function of where it comes out in that revenue range, or is there other things that could help impact where it winds up sitting? Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Jordan. It's John. I'll start by saying it's really important to note that we're basing this outlook on the information available today. We did center on the midpoint of our range, and I think it's fair to say that where we ultimately land will be determined by a variety of variables. I touched on them in some of my prepared remarks, including the evolution of global trade and its impact on demand, the health of the industrial economy, US domestic demand, and so forth. So it's not any one factor.\nIt's a variety of factors, and we're going to be monitoring those closely. It's going to be a very dynamic environment that we intend to capitalize on.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for the details on the cost there. I just want to dig into that a little bit to understand, because if I look at the incremental margin growth of 4% to 6%, yet the incremental operating gains are not keeping pace. So is that because of the headwinds that you ran through? Maybe, John, maybe you can refine that a little bit on the billion-dollar cost, the $300 million headwind on the trade expenses. I just want to maybe parse that out a little bit further.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Yeah, there will be pressure. I mean, what we're talking about here is a billion dollars of headwind as a result of some of the environmental impacts. So our full-year assumption does include the removal of the de minimis exemption for the rest of the world that went into effect in the end of August. But I think it's fair to say that that billion dollars will be something that we'll be focused on, but something that will be a challenge for us as we go forward.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nIf I can add to that, Ken, I think that is a big headwind for fiscal year 2026. We're doing everything in our power to make sure that we can improve our customer experience and mitigate the costs as we move forward. The underlying business is very strong as we move into 2027 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nYeah, thanks for taking our questions here. Raj, you leaned a little further into the data side of the business post the hire, Michelle. I know we just started a month ago. I don't know if he's on the call or could talk a little bit high level about strategy, particularly where you're talking about finding new revenue models to monetize that part of the FedEx story. Or if not him, just a little more thought on where you're heading in that and how big a business that might be for FedEx going forward. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Bascom, for raising that question. One of the things that we are clear about is the value of the data that we have. We move 17 million packages a day, two petabytes of data. As I said earlier, it's not just the volume of the data, it's the value of the data, especially in the dynamic world that we live today. The important thing is that we started this work back in 2020, and we started organizing and engineering this data on a platform basis for some time now. That's what gives us the edge, especially as AI has now evolved and is moving quickly. The fuel for AI is data, and to have engineered data and the high-value data of what we have is now super critical as we move forward. It's already bearing fruit.\nIt's bearing fruit in our operations as deep learning models are enhancing our predictability. We couldn't have done Network 2.0 without the data platform that we have and the technology we have. It's already bearing fruit from a differentiation perspective. We have premium monitoring and intervention tools for our customers, and the healthcare business that Brie's team is winning; 40% of them are on the Surround platform, which is essentially based on the data platform and AI tools that we have. We also launched the commerce platform FDX, and that essentially is now becoming a workflow tool for our customers for orchestrating their supply chains.\nEspecially in this complex trade environment, those kind of is the added value as we improve our value proposition for moving things across borders and being predictive using GenAI to create value from HS classifications and so on. That area is quite nascent, and we have a long road as well as a runway ahead of us. Our mission and vision has evolved to make supply chains smarter for everyone. It begins with our data platform and the insights that we have on supply chain and the role of AI and the tools that we have.\nSo I think as we look ahead, we'll talk more about this in February as it becomes an enabler for our operations, a differentiator from our customer's point of view, and new revenue models that we can create based on this. So thank you again for that question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So any color on the magnitude of sequential earnings growth that you'd expect? And then just that was for Q2. Then just bigger picture, if I think about the last couple of years, we've heard we're reducing costs and growing earnings despite lower revenue. Whenever we get the revenue growth, the operating leverage is going to be really strong. Now we've got 5% revenue growth and $1 billion of cost reduction and buyback, but earnings are flat. I guess why aren't we seeing the better operating leverage? I get the global headwind, but you're growing revenue 5% even with that $1 billion-dollar global headwind.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSo, Scott, thanks for that. Let me start with the Q2. We have focused our commentary on the full-year guidance and are not giving Q2 guidance. But that said, as Brie mentioned, we're cautiously optimistic about peak season demand. We do expect, consistent with last year, sequential earnings improvement in Q2 versus Q1 383, but we're not guiding to Q2 being up or down on a year-over-year basis. We expect continued benefits from our transformation-related savings and large trade-related OI headwind than in Q1 of the $150 million. But just pivoting to your second question on kind of the flow-through, I'll repeat what I said before. We're facing a $1 billion headwind due to the trade environment.\nIn Q1, we experienced $150 million of that to adjusted op income, primarily driven by reduced demand out of China on the US lane. And so for the full year, and just to give a little bit more detail, we're assuming a material revenue headwind from the global trade environment. Operating income at the midpoint of the range will require us to execute, but there's going to be pressure. So the flow-through is not as great given some of the pressures. The $1 billion is embedded in lost opportunity in our FEC volume net of cost line, the direct trade-related expenses for things like customers' clearance and staffing, and base expense increases. So there's a fair amount of pressure there from which we intend to deliver on and will be focused on staying in the range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. John, I guess it's maybe a little more on that same topic that I think Scott was just asking about. The global trade headwind, I still feel like I don't really understand what it is. If I look at your international export revenue, I think was up a little bit in Q1. I think on one of your slides, you were pointing to some nice reduction in flight hours on Asia-US in both Purple Tail and White Tail. So I guess it's not clear to me what that $150 million in Q1 is. It doesn't seem to be revenue. It doesn't seem to be clear where the cost impact is.\nSo I really just wanted to see if you could just help us understand that a little bit better, and also why that gets meaningfully worse on a full-year basis to like $1 billion instead of versus the $150 million in Q1. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey, Tom, it's Brie. I'll take the top line question and then certainly let John kind of add in the color on the expense increase. So what we saw in the Q1 is the vast majority of that $150 million was impact from reduction in top-line revenue. Specifically, the majority of that is de minimis impacted and coming out of the China lane. We anticipate that that will continue to flow through the year. In addition to the $150 million per quarter, as we are planning for incremental pressure because of the global de minimis change that took place at the end of August, we've got $100 million of bottom-line pressure throughout the year, and then we have $300 million of incremental expense.\nSo to be really clear, that $1 billion of headwind is predominantly an impact of top-line revenue reduction because China to the US is a very profitable lane for us. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, no, Brie, just to add what I mentioned before. I mean, you touched on it.The direct trade-related expenses are $300 million for additional customs clearance and related capabilities, and also running through the base expense increases that, coupled with the top line that you mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I think we're all trying to get to the same place here, so I'll just layer on top of Tom and Scott. If this is all a top-line impact from the global trade, $150 million in the Q1, $850 million, yeah, $850 million for the rest of the year, which is close to $300 million. So it's almost doubling the impact in fiscal Q2, Q3, Q4. You have to get to the midpoint or even the low end of the full-year revenue guide. The rate of change will have to accelerate from the 3% in the Q1, and your year-over-year comps and even two-year stack comps are more difficult. So can you just help us bridge where the revenue acceleration comes from if this anomalous headwind is intensifying, potentially doubling?\nIs it all from price and yield? Are you expecting some significant volume pickup at some point absent the global tariff headwinds and de minimis?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey, Jonathan, it's Brie. So great question. So yes, we were very pleased with the 3% revenue growth in the Q1. To get to the midpoint of 5%, first of all, we do expect the majority of trends will continue. So right now, what we're seeing in September looks a lot like August. So it's a continuation of trend with a couple of really important notes. Number one, in the Q1, we had a $280 million top-line headwind because of USPS. That goes away in Q2 and beyond. Two, we are still onboarding some of the wins from Q4 of last year and early Q1. As I mentioned, as an example, Amazon is still onboarding, and it had very little impact in Q1.\nThere are several other examples of onboarding. And then in the back half of the year, we do expect FedEx Freight to have modest yield improvement and better than the Q1 or the Q1 and the Q2 from an expectation perspective. So we do think the midpoint is very realistic, and we're clear-eyed about how to get from Q1 to the rest of the year's range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening, and thanks for taking my question.Brie, I appreciate all those details. I was wondering if maybe you could walk through the outlook for domestic volumes on the package side again. And it's no secret that your largest competitor is shrinking here. So can you talk about maybe the competitive landscape, what's presenting for market share opportunities, and pricing? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYep, great question. So from a domestic perspective, we're not, and I'm speaking specifically to parcel, we're not expecting a massive trend change. We are expecting, as I mentioned, the onboarding. I think you'll see the mix look very similar from a different package profile. A couple of things. The team has done a really good job from an execution perspective. We've had the best momentum in S&B in the last quarter that I've seen for a while, so that's helping our yield growth.\nThe other thing to note is, of course, fuel was very helpful in the Q1, and that will continue through the year. In addition to that, we executed some price changes that came in in the middle of the quarter, and those will be helpful Q2 and beyond. So net takeaway, I don't see a massive trend change. This is self-help, if you will. This is market share, strategic, profitable market share acquisition, and we expect it to continue. To your point on price, we're really focused on winning with value proposition. We're winning in healthcare. We're winning in small business. We're winning because of our seven-day. I think you all heard the Best Buy example. Pricing is improving in the market, and we think very rational. Competitive, but rational.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Weatherby with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Weatherby\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, thanks. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess maybe just wanted to ask about the range. So 4% to 6% on the top line and $17.20 to 19 on the bottom line. Midpoint is 5% of revenue for the midpoint of the EPS. Should we assume that 4% revenue growth lines up with $17.20 and 6%? Is that the $19 side? And then maybe just a quick clarification point. What exactly is the $300 million of direct-related expenses on the trade side? Just want to get a sense of what that is.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. Hey, Chris, it's John. I would not make that direct connection between the factor you described on the 4% leading to on the low end. As I said before, this is a dynamic environment. There's going to be a lot of puts and takes as we go forward here, and we're going to be aggressively monitoring and managing it. That was just. We just gave one scenario, as we mentioned when we talked about how we get to the midpoint. There could be a number of others as well. With regard to your second question, I'm just trying to recall if you could.\n$300 million. Yeah, I'm sorry. That was customs clearance and related staffing, and related administrative expenses as a result of adapting to the current trade environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nDirector of Lead Surface Transportation and Airfreight Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. So regarding the top end of your guidance, you said it's predicated on the continuation of strength in domestic. I guess this question is for Brie. You saw some of the best conditions, you said, since COVID period. Your pricing was certainly the best, we believe, since 2022. Volume growth, third consecutive quarter of mid-single digit plus growth in domestic volumes. Brie, you said SMB, best momentum you've seen in a while. So maybe you can help us understand what's really driving the share gain. What do we need to see to make it sustainable? And then regarding the onboarded, the business you're onboarding, what does it look like? What's the profitability profile, etc.? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question, Richa. Honestly, from an execution perspective, we're really focused on strategic segments. SMB, we are selling direct. Our primary competitor sells through more platforms and third parties, and we've really seen some just outstanding execution momentum. We have a loyalty program that is highly effective, and we've been very focused on making sure customers are aware and engaged in the loyalty program, and that is working. From a healthcare, that's why you're seeing the premium volume momentum that we have seen over the last two quarters, essentially.\nSo we're pleased with that. Healthcare is very sticky revenue. It is high service expectations, very, very custom SOP, and so it is profitable, but it's also very sticky. And then, of course, from an e-commerce perspective, you have seen that FedEx Ground Economy bundle working. We are growing there. We are faster than our primary competitor. We have rural coverage that they don't have. And of course, we now cover about 65% of GDP on Sunday. So really pleased with the team's focus, equally pleased with their revenue quality. We've been pulling pricing levers as appropriate, and that definitely benefited us in the Q1, and we anticipate that we'll get a high capture throughout the year. Of course, we're also planning very rigorously for peak.\nPeak surcharges are in place. They are working. The team's got a very, very focused plan for peak that I'm excited about.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nFreight Transportation and Airlines Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Two questions, if I may. On the De Minimis, kind of what has been the customer reaction to the expiration of the rule, and do you think that is a new normal going forward? And also, does it feel like there's been much pull forward in international volumes that may have benefited you in fiscal Q1? And kind of what does that kind of normal run rate look like for the next kind of several quarters as well?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question. I'm certainly not going to speculate on the future trade environment, but I will tell you, obviously, from a customer perspective, it has been a very stressful period. I'm really proud of our clearance operations team and our commercial team because they are lockstep with customers. It has been particularly challenging for small exporters because they do not have the expertise and the staffing, and that's where our teams have come in and really partnered with them to help, as Raj talked about, automate some of their clearance inputs from a digital perspective. So we're very, very focused from a partnership perspective, but it has been really tough on small customers and exporters.\nAs far as the pull forward, I will remain optimistic. The American consumer from our numbers has been resilient. We do not see any indication in either air freight or domestic parcel business that this is pull forward. I will absolutely acknowledge July was quite strong for us, especially the prime week. We saw a lot of US retailers put sales in market, and they were affected. We saw strong volumes in July, but I don't necessarily see that as a pull forward. And like I said, right now, from our forecasting for both peak and the back half, we're confident in the range we put out from a top-line perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brian Osenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. So maybe, Brie, just to start off by elaborating a bit more on the peak. It sounds like some of it's visibility to maybe some of these new contracts that are onboarding. Some of it's more of a macro. So maybe you can separate just how much of the peak strength is FedEx-related versus what you see in the underlying market. I think that'd be helpful. And also maybe a little bit of context on freight. We didn't get too much color on that, but certainly a tough market and tough quarter, but it sounds like you expect things to stabilize and improve pretty significantly from here. So wanted to get some additional thoughts on what's embedded in that outlook. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay. I think I got it all, Brian, but stop me if I don't hit all of it. From a peak perspective, yes, when we look at kind of the number of operating days in the season of peak, we are expecting kind of from an ADV perspective, sort of a low to moderate growth from an ADV, but total volume will be up because we have that extra day. I do think a relatively significant portion of this volume growth is our acquisition that we took in the back half of last year. You're going to have that lasting benefit for us from a peak perspective. I anticipate that our numbers will be slightly elevated versus market. I also, from a performance perspective, we do see this driven by large B2C retailers and brands.\nThat's definitely heavy from a peak perspective. Rest assured, we have the revenue quality strategy and the peak surcharges in place. The team has done a really good job. We're lock-step with Scott Ray and the surface team to manage capacity and service. So we feel very good from a peak perspective. But to your point, I don't necessarily think that it's an indicator of overall market performance. From a FedEx Freight perspective, you've all tracked the pressures on the industrial economy. We are the FedEx; well, FedEx is the market share leader in the LTL industry. And so, of course, we are feeling that pressure.\nThe team's number one priority at FedEx Freight, and we take this responsibility very seriously, is revenue quality. We will have the benefit of the lifting in the back half. So we do anticipate that yields will increase in the back half, but we remain very disciplined and very focused.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector of Transportation Miami, Stifel\n\nYeah. Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. Maybe just one on the broader air freight market. We've been hearing about some potential supply constraints as the global freight fleet sort of ages here. I guess first, are you seeing signs of that? And then if so, how do you think about the flow-through with Tricolor? I imagine you've got some good flexibility to shift volumes sort of between the purple tails and third-party capacity.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah.From an air freight perspective, again, we're a relatively small market share participant from a global air freight perspective. We are being selective and really focused on premium freight. I am particularly proud of the airline team this quarter. They shifted capacity, and I'm equally proud of the commercial team. We knew because of the trade environment that our China to US lane, and we are the market share leader there, would be pressured. So we pivoted. We are growing between Asia and Europe, which is a large lane. We're being selective there. And then, equally important, on the Purple Tail that we balance capacity, and the team did a really good job from a US perspective. I'll give the healthcare team a shout-out.\nAlmost 50% of the weight growth from a US export perspective came from healthcare air freight, so our healthcare strategy is working there too.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Bruce, if I can jump in on the Tricolor, or if you remember the conversations that we have had before, the idea was to decongest the hubs and to have a fly truck network so that it links all our networks together optimally and densification of our network. All those are being tracked at KPI level very carefully, and I'm happy to report that the team has done a tremendous job, and it's working. That's what enables us to provide the value proposition to our customers to strategically and profitably grow in these segments. So again, we are in early innings on Tricolor, but the implementation has been stellar.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Seidel with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nElliot Alper\n\nVP and Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. This is Elliot Alper for Jason Seidel. So in terms of Network 2.0 and heading into peak season, are you planning for any changes in the process, like putting some stations on hold in busier markets as you work through peak? Could that affect any timing in terms of the cadence of the one billion in cost savings or anything to think about there?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question. We are very encouraged by the progress on Network 2.0. The Canada transition is complete, and the service levels there are very strong. We are obviously moving forward in the US market, underway as we planned. There is no change to the plans that we have set in place. We are exiting Q1 with 18% of our US ADV running through the Network 2.0 model. We have close to about 140 facilities and integrated 360 stations in the process.\nAt the end of the day, that's pretty much as planned, and that's what we will continue to execute going forward. You had a rumor that Network 2.0 is an efficiency story, but also a growth story as we improve our customer value and customer experience, that this becomes both an efficiency part of the equation and also an ability for us to grow in the segment. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nI think it's important to note we never plan for a new optimization in the middle of peak. Our rollout schedule, it's a given that that just doesn't happen in peak because services are top priority for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. So John, I wanted to kind of come back to this question on operating leverage and try to help better understand the bridge that you laid out here. When we think about Q1, is there anything in the comp on a year-over-year basis that may be added to the leverage, whether it's incentives or anything like that? And then as we think about the remainder of the year, right, obviously there's a lot of things happening on trade and things happening top line, bottom line. Is the answer here of why we're not getting more leverage just that the mix is shifting to less profitable traffic? I'm just trying to kind of really understand this thing at a high level.\nIf we've got $1 billion worth of cost taking out that would offset the headwind, and then we got 5% of revenue growth, why isn't there more falling to the bottom line?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. As I mentioned before, there's a variety of factors in play here, including kind of the opportunity cost of the hit to revenue as a result of the change in the trade environment. Mix shift is a factor to lower yielding mix, but I should say it's profitable. It's profitable mix. I want to be clear on that. But that is certainly a consideration. But there's a whole dynamic environment of factors that are putting pressure on us that run the range that are factored into that $1 billion.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ari Rosa with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst and Equity Research, Citi\n\nSo just on the revenue growth target, maybe you could help us understand how much of that is coming from new business wins because I don't think that's been totally clear. So is there a way to segment how much of the 4% to 6% is organic versus kind of new business wins? Anything you can give us on kind of the margin contribution of that. And then if I can squeeze one other one in, the $600 million of Freight spin costs, maybe you could just give a little bit of color on what that is. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nWell, I'll start with the Freight spin costs and then turn it over to that. Like with any large transaction, there's a significant amount of cost that's incurred. It's largely driven by the IT, the systems, and enhancing the systems at Freight to improve the customer experience. There are some staffing costs, but I would say those are small in the scheme of things. We talked about the salesforce and so forth, but largely IT-related and systems-related.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah. As far as the revenue range, it's a combination of factors, as I talked about. We've got execution from a share gain perspective. We've got execution on getting the right business in and then yield. The one thing that I can emphasize, that as we look at the difference between the Q1 and Q2 through Q4, the domestic momentum, one of the larger factors there will be continued onboarding, but we'll also be pushing on yield.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Operator. In closing, our Q1 results demonstrate our ability to support customers through this dynamic environment. I'm incredibly proud of the FedEx team for their outstanding commitment to our customers and for driving such strong performance in this quarter. I'm confident that the momentum we have established positions us well for the peak season ahead. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

I would now like to turn the conference over to FedEx President and CEO, Raj Subramaniam. Please go ahead.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, operator. Before we begin, I want to take a few minutes to honor someone who meant a great deal to this company, the business community, his beloved family and to me personally. It feels strange to be here with you also soon after his sudden passing. And it is difficult to put into words the tremendous loss felt by all who knew Fredrick W. Smith. But Fred was a man grounded by a mission, and he would tell us to say, \"focus on the business and keep marching forward.\" And so we will do just that. But first, I wanted to share a few thoughts.\nFred was more than a business leader, he was a visionary who revolutionized the delivery industry. He was a man who led with integrity and inspired others. His belief in people, his relentless pursuit of excellence and his commitment to connect people and possibilities, built one of the world's most successful companies over the last 5 decades and his legacy will be felt for decades to come. On a personal note, I will miss his strategic counsel, impeccable character and sharp [indiscernible]. He taught me that leadership is about service and not titles. He challenged me to think bigger, act bolder and always, always put our people and our customers at the center of everything we do.\nI feel tremendously fortunate to have spent 34 years learning from 1 of the most brilliant mines in our country's history. Please join me in extending heartfelt condolences to the entire Smith family during this difficult time. As we move forward, we will honor his legacy by continuing to build the company he loves with the same passion and purpose inspired in us all.\nNow consistent with our succession plan. Yesterday, the Board elected Brad Martin as the Chairman of the Board of FedEx Corp. Brad is a highly regarded business leader and strategic thinker, who is intimately familiar with the business, having previously served as our Vice Chairman. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeni.\n\nJenifer Hollander\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Raj. Good afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The fourth quarter earnings release and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to 1 question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nCertain statements in this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nFor additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC. Today's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. And now I will turn the call back over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jeni. I want to start by commending our team for their strong efforts and execution. We delivered a solid finish to FY '25 with another quarter of adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating margin expansion despite a challenging demand environment. This performance reflects the progress we have made on our strategic transformation, which continues to position FedEx for long-term value creation. In FY '25, we delivered on our $2.2 billion drive structural cost reduction commitment. This enabled us to achieve our 2-year $4 billion drive target compared to the FY '23 baseline. We advanced Network 2.0 in FY '25 as we began optimizing larger, more densely populated markets.\nWe continued to lower our capital intensive, and we returned $4.3 billion in cash to stockholders. We achieved all of this in the face of major headwinds, including the expiration of our U.S. postal service contract, 2 fewer operating days and volatility and uncertainty related to global trade policy. Against this dynamic backdrop, I'm very proud of our ability to deliver on our targets, adapt our network to changing trade flows and provide excellent service for our customers.\nNow turning to our consolidated Q4 results. Revenue was up 1% year-over-year. We grew our drive savings sequentially, achieved our drive cost reduction target in this quarter. This enabled us to grow adjusted operating income by 8% and expand adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points. At Federal Express Corporation, our results demonstrate the operational leverage that we have built into our business through DRIVE. On a 1% increase in revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 9%. We achieved this result in a weak demand environment with growth largely drawn by our deferred services. Our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network, and I'm confident in the operating results we can deliver when the industrial economy recovers.\nConsistent with the trends over the last several quarters, our higher-margin B2B volumes remain pressured, which affected both FAC and freight results. That said, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement of FedEx Freight and our ability to protect profitability with an operating margin of 20.8% in Q4. The trade-related events of the fourth quarter showcased our ability to leverage both the scale and the flexibility of our unrivaled global network supported by insights from the vast amount of data we collect.\nWe are at the center of a global trade ecosystem. We connect 99% of the world's commerce. We moved $2 trillion worth of goods every year. We connect 3 million shippers to more than 225 million consumers. And as the world changes and supply chains evolve, we benefit from our presence in over 220 countries and territories. This uniquely positions us to be a valuable partner to our customers as they navigate shifting demand trends evaluate the impact of tariffs on their businesses and adjust their supply chains accordingly.\nAnd importantly, our Tricolor strategy enables us to adapt our own network faster than ever before as circumstances and the needs of our customers change, driving greater efficiency and a better customer experience. For example, in the fourth quarter, we flexed our network to match the demand environment as trade flows shifted. We reduced capacity on our Asia to Americas lane by more than 35% in the first week of May compared to April. This included reducing our third-party or white tail capacity by 50%. We then continue to adjust the capacity as needed as demand trends evolve throughout the month.\nWe exceeded May with a net capacity reduction of about 20% versus April. We have been introducing other network changes in Asia, allowing us to consolidate from multiple points into a centralized gateway. We recently added a direct flight from Singapore to the U.S., enabling us to be more efficiently capture increased demand out of Southeast Asia. We continue to evaluate trade patterns and are prepared to alter our roots and capacity commitments should demand shift with a focus on Asia to Europe and Asia to Latin America.\nIn addition to rapidly adjusting our physical network, our team has done a remarkable job working closely with our customers and helping them navigate increasing operational complexities. We continue to apply our digital platform-based solutions to effectively address key pain points amid changing global trade policies. These solutions support a wide range of stakeholders, importers, exporters, brokers and regulators, and they are tightly integrated with our customers' existing workflows ensuring that critical trade and tariff-related work can occur seamlessly and efficiently.\nAs you are all aware, there's a lot happening outside of FedEx. Trade policies are evolving and trade patterns are changing. What's truly remarkable is a significant way we have leveraged our technological capabilities and processes to navigate these complexities and operate more efficiently for our customers.\nNetwork 2.0 is the next leg of our structural transformation, and it is well underway. In April, we completed the full optimization of Canada, our largest market yet. As planned, we optimized 45 U.S. stations in Q4, and we are now picking up the base. On June 1, we implemented Network 2.0 on nearly 30 stations across 11 markets, and we will optimize another 33 stations across 9 markets by the end of this month. That means we exit June with roughly 2.5 million average daily volume flowing through Network 2.0 optimized stations.\nLooking beyond North America, we have made progress in Europe, including our DRIVE target. That said, Europe remains a significant opportunity for long-term financial improvement. We have been implementing the workforce reduction plan we announced in June of 2024. This was a very difficult, but necessary decision for us, leading to about $150 million of savings on an annualized basis in FY '27. We have achieved better on-road productivity with sustained improvement in net service levels. We have now seen 2 consecutive years of cost per package reduction in our European business.\nIn FY '26, we'll focus on further improving on-road and in-station productivity, bringing new digital experience to our customers and growing market share profitably in the region. A quick update on the freight spinoff. Last month, we named Brad Martin as Chairman of the Board of FedEx Freight. We also named John Smith as President and CEO of the stand-alone company. As many of you know, John has deep freight expertise and a strong track record of improving margins and profitability at both FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. We are moving quickly to announce the rest of our Freight leadership team.\nWe recently hired Michael Rogers as Chief Technology Officer for FedEx Freight. Mike brings vast external technology experience, having most recently spent time in the fuel supply and the retail sectors. Additionally, Eddie Klang will serve as the FedEx Freight's Chief Human Resources and Legal Officer. Eddie brings deep expertise from his nearly 30-year career at FedEx, most recently as Corporate Vice President for Corporate Governance securities and tax law.\nMike Lyons has worked at FedEx Freight since 2007, will serve us sa Chief specialized services and Commercial Officer; and Clint McCoy who has worked at FedEx freight for nearly 30 years will be the Chief Operating Officer. I'm confident that this mix of strong external FedEx Corporation and fixed freight talent will set up FedEx Freight for success.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to provide early perspective on how we are thinking about the current quarter and the year ahead. The global demand environment remains volatile. We're staying close to our customers to help them plan and adapt as they navigate trade policy changes, and we are actively matching our capacity with demand as the environment evolves. John will walk through our expectations for the first quarter of this fiscal year. We remain focused on what we can control. For FY '26, we expect to achieve $1 billion of transformation-related savings which includes DRIVE and Network 2.0. I again want to thank the team for the innovative and mission-critical work they're doing to make supply chains smarter for everyone. This work has resulted in a solid finish to the fiscal year. And importantly, it's translating to better outcomes for our customers in a very complex operating environment.\nNow let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer\n\nThank you, Raj. I am proud of how we are helping our customers navigate this challenging period, and I think it's fitting to share that so too is our founder. Just this past Friday, Fred told me how fun it was to watch the team work. And then he saw and felt the momentum building in the business. He was excited about our e-commerce value proposition, the power of our clearance capabilities and of course, the growth in global air freight and health care. I want to commend the entire organization for our focus on creating vast differentiation and showing up for our customers.\nDelivering the Purple Promise has served us well for the last 50 years, the last quarter and undoubtedly, it will serve us well in fiscal year '26. Taking a closer look at our Q4 revenue performance. Consolidated revenue was up 1% with a 1% increase at Federal Express and a continued weakness as expected at FedEx Freight. For both segments, a better-than-expected may more than offset a softer than expected April. Looking at our volume trends by service. U.S. domestic volumes held up well throughout the quarter, with growth accelerating in late April and May. Our nationwide coverage and our speed advantage are helping us win new profitable business. We saw 6% volume growth across our U.S. domestic peripheral services. From an international perspective, our volume trends closely tracked global trade headlines. March performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Following the April 2 tariff announcement, customer concerns increased and as a result, volumes softened. In early May, upon tariff implementation, China to U.S. volumes deteriorated sharply and remained weak throughout the rest of the quarter.\nOur international export revenue was flat, reflecting the tariff-related impact on our Trans-Pacific trade lane. I do want to take a moment to commend our clearance team at the Memphis hub for their success in navigating this environment and maintaining excellent service. This was an impressive feat given customs entries in May were double the January to April average. Within our Freight segment, shipments remained pressured, but the year-over-year declines moderated sequentially, with average daily shipments down 1% year-over-year in Q4 compared to down 5% in Q3 and down 8% in Q2.\nIn fact, average daily shipments up 8.3% sequentially was our greatest Q4 over Q3 increase since fiscal year '21. As we prepare for the freight spin-off, we are continuing to execute on our commercial strategy with an emphasis on improved service and pricing discipline, and we continue to build out our dedicated sales force. The pricing environment continues to improve. At Federal Express, total U.S. domestic package yield was up slightly with strength in our priority services offset by mix shift in softer yields in deferred and ground economy. Maintaining pricing discipline remains a top priority. International export package yield declined 1%, driven by lower international economy yields, partially offset by an 11% yield increase for international priority. Within global air freight, we are pleased to see higher revenue per pound. This is a direct result of our Tricolor strategy, which is designed to increase network flexibility, reduce costs, and importantly, support profitable growth in the international export freight market.\nThanks to Tricolor, we delivered 5% growth in international air freight revenue in Q4 with a high profit flow-through. At FedEx Freight, I remain encouraged by the continued increase in revenue per hundredweight, up 1%, signaling a continued commitment to revenue quality. Total revenue per shipment declined 1% due to lower fuel surcharge and lower weight per shipment. Looking ahead, as global trade policies continue to evolve and companies adjust their shipping patterns, we are well positioned to support our customers and adapt as needed. Our current expectation is for flat to 2% revenue growth in the first quarter. This range includes approximately $570 million of idiosyntratics revenue headwinds from the expiration of the U.S. postal service contract and recent trade disruption.\nWhere we land in the range largely depends on how the U.S. domestic revenue at FECs evolves. The top end of the range assumes current favorable U.S. domestic trends at FEC continue through Q1. The lower end of our range assumes incremental pressure to U.S. domestic demand. Internationally, we expect revenue from the China to U.S. lane to remain pressured, consistent with what we saw exiting Q4. At Freight, we forecast revenue to decline slightly year-over-year in the first quarter.\nNow a quick update on our commercial strategy. Our focus is paying off, translating to better customer experiences and financial outcomes. Our emphasis on B2B, small and medium-sized businesses, Europe and airfreight is a deliberate approach to capitalize on high-margin market opportunities while diversifying our revenue streams globally. Within B2B, health care and automotive remain important verticals for us. We exited FY '25 with $9 billion in health care-related revenue, which drove growth in our U.S. priority volumes. In Q4, we became the first global integrator to achieve an important pharma-related certification, known as [indiscernible]. This is for ground handling across our express hubs and ramps. This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to quality, compliance and leadership in pharmaceutical logistics. It validates the strength of FedEx's quality management system and our ability to deliver end-to-end logistics services in compliance with an increasingly complex and highly regulated pharmaceutical industry.\nAs we look to further penetrate the high-margin health care segment, I am confident this achievement will unlock even more opportunity for us. Within automotive, we recently created a distinct vertical with its own dedicated leadership team, and we are off to a strong start. We were recently awarded GM Supplier of the Year Award for the 21st year in a row. Our focus for fiscal year '26 will be growing within the $18 billion high-margin segment of the North American automotive market, a subsector focused on premium services that supports automotive supply chain.\nAdditionally, small and medium customers remain central to our commercial strategy. FedEx Rewards, our loyalty program is unique in the industry and has become an important gateway for small and medium-sized businesses. I am especially pleased with our revenue growth in the U.S. as the rewards program enrollment increased 8% year-over-year. The rewards program creates a more seamless, personalized customer experience that drives customer loyalty.\nI want to again thank our team for continuing to execute on our commercial strategies. Their efforts are improving the customer experience, helping our customers navigate this period of volatility and and positioning us well for sustainable growth that flows through to the bottom line.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn W. Dietrich\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brie, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to share that the culture and extraordinary business that Fred Smith created unconditionally drew me to FedEx. I always greatly respected Fred from my earliest encounters with him in the industry. and I'm grateful and beyond privileged to have worked directly with him these past 2 years.\nNow turning to the quarter. I'm very pleased with what we achieved in Q4. This includes the actions we've taken to increase stockholder value, our discipline on CapEx and the transformation we advanced all while navigating a very complex environment. Our Q4 results reflect our ability to flex our network, onboard new revenue and manage costs. On a consolidated basis, we delivered $18.19 in adjusted earnings per share for FY '25, achieving 2 consecutive years of earnings growth despite the prolonged freight industry softness, 2 fewer operating days, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract and extraordinary weather events.\nFederal Express also posted higher FY '25 results year-over-year despite significant headwinds with adjusted operating income of $151 million on $641 million in revenue growth. This strong flow-through to the bottom line demonstrates the powerful leverage inherent in our business, a reality that will become even more apparent when we see a recovery in the industrial economy. While consolidated adjusted operating income declined to $121 million, this was due to FedEx Freight results, which continue to be challenged due to the prolonged weakness in the industrial economy. Taking a closer look at consolidated Q4 performance on a year-over-year basis, we delivered an 8% increase in adjusted operating income on a 1% increase in revenue.\nThese results reflect our ability to grow revenue profitably as well as our ongoing commitment to managing our cost structure. Our revenue performance includes recent health care wins, which are part of our strategy to profitably grow in B2B.\nAdjusted operating income increased by $147 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points. We achieved this result despite a $165 million headwind and from 1 fewer operating day, a $120 million headwind from the U.S. Postal Service contract expiration and pressures from the global trade policy changes. At FEC, adjusted operating income increased by $136 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points. This was driven by continued drive savings, increased U.S. and international export volume and base yield growth. These drivers were partially offset by operating expense inflation and the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Regarding our Asia international export exposure, the bilateral China to U.S. lane represents around 2.5% of consolidated revenue and is our most profitable intercontinental lane. Due to escalating trade barriers in the quarter, we experienced a material headwind on our Asia to U.S. lane, largely driven by China.\nNotably, this was not fully factored into our prior March outlook as certain tariffs were not yet announced and implemented until after our last earnings release. at freight operating income fell by $30 million and operating margin declined 40 basis points. Freight's operating income also reflects a $33 million gain on sale of a legacy facility. As anticipated, our freight performance improved sequentially, and our team maintained pricing discipline as base yields continue to be a tailwind to the quarter and the fiscal year.\nIn addition to our segment results, our fourth quarter results include a noncash impairment charge of $21 million related to our decision to permanently retire an additional 12 aircraft including 7 A300s, 3 MD-11s and 2 757s as well as 8 related engines. Over the last 3 years, we've removed a net 31 jet aircraft from our fleet which is a 7% reduction versus FY '22. These actions are aligned with the company's fleet reduction and modernization strategy as we continue to improve global network efficiency and better align air network capacity with anticipated demand.\nNow moving on to capital allocation. I'm extremely pleased that we both significantly reduced our capital intensity and returned $4.3 billion to stockholders in FY '25. This was well above our previous $3.8 billion commitment. During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically purchased an additional $500 million in shares, bringing our total to $3 billion in share repurchases for the year, and we remain committed to returning capital to stockholders. We increased our dividend by 5% in FY '26, making this the fifth consecutive year with a dividend increase. We will also continue to repurchase shares and expect the combination of our fiscal 2026 share repurchases and dividend payments to approximate adjusted free cash flow. We also significantly reduced our CapEx spending in FY '25 by approximately $1.1 billion for a total of $4.1 billion compared to $5.2 billion in FY '24. This marks our lowest capital spending in over 10 years.\nAdditionally, our CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 4.6%, the lowest level since FedEx Corp was established in fiscal year '98. We're currently planning for FY '26 CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $700 million relates to Network 2.0 investment. And we plan to further reduce aircraft CapEx to approximately $1 billion this fiscal year, a level we plan to maintain for the next several years. I'm also very proud that our adjusted free cash flow conversion from net income was extremely strong at nearly 90%, representing a step change versus prior years, driven by our lower capital intensity.\nOn this point, approximately 85% of our FY '25 CapEx was related to modernization of our aircraft and vehicle fleets as well as optimization and automation of our network. We continue to prioritize investments that support increasing efficiency and reducing our cost to serve as opposed to capacity expansion. This capital spending approach signals an inflection in the life of our business as we can now further reap the benefits of our global network and seek to increase stockholder returns and improve ROIC in the years ahead. And we're translating our adjusted free cash flow at parity into stockholder returns.\nWith respect to pension contributions, in FY '26, we're planning for up to $600 million of voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. qualified plans, which are 103% funded as of the end of FY '25. And finally, we have $1.3 billion of debt maturing in FY '26, which we expect to pay off or refinance.\nNow I'd like to walk you through our expectations for Q1. As we've talked about, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. Our outlook is, therefore, based on current tariff rates, recent trends we're seeing as well as that which we're hearing from our customers. As Brie shared, we're currently planning for consolidated Q1 revenue to be in the range of flat to up 2% including $170 million adjusted operating income headwind from international export due to global trade policy impacts.\nThis translates to a Q1 adjusted EPS range of $3.40 to $4 which includes approximately $200 million in transformation benefits. We also anticipate our quarterly effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. At $3.70 of adjusted EPS, the midpoint of our range, we anticipate a 1% increase in Federal Express revenue with adjusted operating margin up modestly. Also at the midpoint, we anticipate FedEx Freight revenue to be down slightly with a modest decline in operating margin.\nNow turning to our FY '26 Q1 operating income bridge, which shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our outlook. This bridge reflects adjusted operating income of $1.25 billion, which is equivalent to $3.70 of adjusted EPS. For revenue, net of costs, we expect $130 million tailwind, reflecting our assumptions of operating expense inflation and revenue growth mostly U.S. domestic.\nWe're forecasting $170 million in headwinds from international export, as I mentioned, driven by the global trade policy impacts primarily on our transpacific lane, Lastly, we anticipate $120 million in headwinds from the expiration of the U.S. post-service contract. Partially offsetting these headwinds is $200 million of benefit from our transformation initiatives.\nNow turning to some important considerations for FY '26. We expect around $1 billion in incremental year-over-year benefit from our transformation-related efforts, which includes structural cost reduction benefits from DRIVE and Network 2.0, we anticipate a moderate ramp of these savings throughout the fiscal year. In addition, U.S. Postal Service contract expiration will be a near-term headwind. For modeling purposes, I want to note that the significant revenue and operating income headwind is limited to the first 4 months of FY '26 and likely to skew typical seasonality. As a reminder, small upticks in B2B revenues can result in significant incremental flow-through. So if we see a recovery in the industrial economy, we're well positioned to see strong leverage to operating income.\nIn addition to our Q1 outlook, we remain committed to being transparent and resuming our full year outlook for adjusted EPS, effective tax rate and capital returns as visibility improves. Now that we're into a new fiscal year, we're very excited about the significant value creation opportunities ahead for both FedEx Corporation and the future stand-alone FedEx Freight company. In that regard, we plan to host a FedEx Corporation Investor Day in Memphis in early calendar 2026, where we'll share more details on our long-term strategy.\nThis will include a detailed update on our strategic initiatives, such as Network 2.0, which represents a $2 billion savings opportunity from our physical network integration and associated One FedEx savings by the end of fiscal 2017. Additionally, we'll continue to progress our freight separation plans and expect to spin off freight in June of 2026. We also look forward to hosting a FedEx Freight Investor Day next spring prior to the spin-off.\nIn closing, while FY '26 presents unique challenges and uncertainties, what remains unchanged is our commitment to driving stockholder returns and building a more profitable FedEx. Our transformation initiatives, capacity reductions and successful commercial strategies are helping us navigate the current environment and position us extremely well for when demand recovers. I'm confident in the value creation opportunity that remains in front of us. And with that, operator, let's please open it up for questions.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeni Hollander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJeni Hollander\n\nVP of Investor Relations, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon and welcome to FedEx Corporation's third-quarter earnings conference call.

Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeni, and welcome to your first earnings call at FedEx. We are happy to have you on board leading the investor relations team. Before we discuss the quarter, I would like to congratulate Rob Carter on his upcoming retirement, which we announced last week. He has served as CIO for the last 24 years, leading FedEx in modernizing our IT infrastructure. I'm immensely grateful to Rob for his numerous contributions in establishing FedEx as an innovative, data-driven, and a people-focused company. We thank him for his dedication and service to FedEx over the years and wish him well in his upcoming retirement. Thank you also to the FedEx team for their exceptional work in Q3 by providing superior service for customers and delivering strong results, all while advancing our transformation initiatives.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion in a declining revenue environment. This is a very positive dynamic and a unique one in our industry. It demonstrates clear progress on our transformation and ability to manage what's within our control through Drive. We're strengthening our value proposition, improving the customer experience, and increasing profitability. This progress supports our long-term goals for sustainable margin expansion, improvements in ROIC, and value creation for our stockholders. Now turning to the details. Our transformation is driving continued improvements in adjusted operating income, margins, and earnings per share. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 16% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin expansion of 90 basis points compared to the prior year, even as revenue declined 2%. Adjusted operating income growth was driven by continued strength at Ground and improvement at Express.\nAt the segment level, I'm particularly pleased with the results at Ground, where adjusted operating income increased 14% on 1% revenue growth, and adjusted operating margin improved to over 11% in the quarter. This reflects continued progress, controlling expenses, and effective yield management, including the ramping benefits from Drive. At Freight, the team's continued focus on profitable growth and cost management delivered strong margins and mitigated year-over-year volume challenges. Service levels remain exceptionally high, demonstrating our differentiated execution capabilities. We're also making progress at Express, where adjusted operating income increased, enabled by our ability to remove structural costs. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS range while narrowing the range to $17.25 to $18.25.\nIn fact, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings above the midpoint of the range we shared last June, despite full-year revenue expectations that have deteriorated significantly over the past nine months. This is clear evidence of our ability to execute. Turning to the express business, it is my top priority to continue to make the changes necessary to align our air network with an evolving demand environment and unlock the full profit opportunity. While we have made progress at express this quarter, there are several areas we're aggressively working to address in order to accelerate profit improvement: service mix, network utilization, continued inflation, and other cost headwinds. First, with respect to service mix, we're seeing a clear international market shift towards deferred services.\nThis is tied in part to the rapid growth of many of our e-commerce customers, where we are a critical enabler of global trade, offering unique solutions for our customers. More on how we're addressing this mix shift shortly. Second, weakness in global trade continues to constrain demand in our international business, which has remained challenged for longer than expected. As such, we're continuing to proactively realign our air network to match capacity to demand. And third, this quarter, Express experienced over $200 million of inflationary pressure on a year-over-year basis. We offset this with benefits from Drive as well as responsible headcount management. The dynamics I just outlined create significant opportunities for us to improve our network utilization. Last quarter, we introduced our Tricolor strategy.\nUltimately, this network design will enable us to improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system, put the right product in the right network, taking advantage of our continental surface networks in Europe and our market-leading FedEx Freight LTL network in the United States, and profitably penetrate new market segments at the right cost structure, including the premium air freight market. As we move forward, we are managing the execution of Tricolor with the rigor and discipline of Drive, and this will be a key element to our success. Moving to another area of opportunity. In Europe, we continue to improve our service levels and focus on commercial execution. However, the B2B environment remains challenged. In this context, we are making progress on Drive, on track to generate $600 million of savings in fiscal year 2025 and seeking further profit optimization opportunities.\nAs we have mentioned in previous calls, we are also experiencing a continued headwind for the United States Postal Service, which has reduced volume. Despite this volume and revenue drawdown, our service obligations to the USPS remain fixed. At Express and across the business, Drive remains a key enabler of improved profitability both in the near and the long term as we change the way we work and identify areas for structural cost reduction. In Q3, we delivered $550 million of benefits from Drive, offsetting the impact of revenue declines and cost pressures. I'm encouraged by the progress across all three categories. This includes $290 million in our surface network, $110 million of savings in air network, and international operations, and $150 million of G&A.\nGiven the progress we have made year to date, we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in permanent cost reduction benefits from Drive this fiscal year and are highly confident in the additional $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2025. The work we are doing with Drive is also helping advance planning for Network 2.0. This quarter, we rolled out our new surface operations leadership structure. Under this new structure, leaders and their teams will be responsible for all express and ground package operations and facilities in their respective divisions, regions, and districts. This will enhance operational execution and offer greater insights into the package business overall with accountability at all levels. More broadly, we have now implemented Network 2.0 in over 50 locations, with dozens more to follow in calendar 2024, all while maintaining outstanding service.\nAs a reminder, we will begin the rollout of Canada in April and expect to complete this transition by October of 2024. As part of our transformation, we are on track to complete the consolidation of FedEx operating companies into one streamlined and simplified organization, creating efficiencies as we build a stronger, more profitable enterprise. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services will consolidate into Federal Express Corporation. The work we're doing to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network is translating into direct improvements in our customer offering and profitability. When severe weather hits, it can cause a domino effect of delays and reduce service levels across our network.\nWhile we have always used data analytics to assess the effect of weather events, our new weather contingency playbook developed by our planning, engineering, and Dataworks teams enhances the process by leveraging predictive capabilities to proactively divert storm-bound volumes across our networks. By combining the power of digital insights and predictive analytics with our physical network, we effectively mitigated the impact of the January winter storms that hit our Express hub in Memphis by shifting Memphis-bound Express volume to Ground, our Freight, at the origin location. Despite this year's event having a longer impact on Memphis operations when compared to the weather event in February 2023, our network recovery was twice as fast. This quarter, we also announced a significant initiative, FDX, the fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey from demand to returns.\nIt'll provide real-time visibility to help our customers optimize and grow their business, leveraging our analytical capabilities and data from the 15 million packages we deliver every day. I'm excited to have Sriram Krishnaswamy serving as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective 1 July 2024. His proven track record of driving optimization and innovation for our business through data and insights, combined with his deep knowledge of the network, will be critical to moving FedEx forward as we become a data-driven digital-first company. As I look across the business and these financial results, there are clear signs of progress on our transformation. Our strategy is generating results, and we are well placed to maintain our leadership position while delivering improving financial outcomes. Together, we remain focused and committed to our long-term goals, supporting the creation of significant long-term value for our stockholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank our FedEx team for strong performance during the peak season. As a result of their hard work and commitment, we once again delivered the best service offering in the industry. We continued to execute on our commercial priorities with a focus on revenue quality while maintaining our industry-leading service. As a result, we took profitable share in the quarter at market rates, and we continued to retain the vast majority of the volume we gained from UPS in the second half of 2023. Our unmatched value proposition has enabled recent high-value wins in the semiconductor, healthcare, and aerospace industries. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to compete and grow further in the high-margin areas of the market.\nLooking now by geography, in the United States, conditions have been weaker than we anticipated, and internationally, we continue to see softness. We, however, remain very focused on strong commercial execution. Taking a look at Q3 revenue performance by segment, at FedEx Ground, revenue was up about 1% year over year on a modest yield improvement and flat volumes. Our team remains disciplined on growing with the right customers and mix while offering the best value proposition in the industry. At FedEx Freight, revenue declined 3%. While volume decreased compared to last year, the year-over-year decline moderated on a sequential basis. Revenue was also negatively affected by lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in weight per shipment, although the decline was partially offset by higher base yields.\nAnd at FedEx Express, revenue was down 2% year over year, driven by continued volume softness, lower fuel and demand surcharges, and a mixed shift towards deferred and e-commerce products. The actions Raj outlined will allow us to profitably grow this business while continuing to deliver excellent service for our customers. Turning to our monthly volume trends during the quarter, broadly speaking, volumes are stabilizing as we lap weaker demand from a year ago. International export increased 4% in the quarter, driven by a 29% growth in international economy, which, of course, is a market reset we expected. Freight shipments declined, but they continued to moderate sequentially. As Raj mentioned, postal volumes were a headwind in the quarter. Our current contract with the United States Postal Service expires on 29 September 2024.\nWe have made significant progress in negotiations for a new contract that aligns with our ongoing network transformation plan while providing the USPS with the operational reliability and outstanding service we have delivered for them for more than two decades. A new multi-year agreement would provide a more efficient network with service to fewer markets. It would allow us to better adjust our overall network to demand. We, of course, will let you know when we have an update. We continue to operate in a competitive but rational market environment. During the quarter, yield trends were similar to what we saw last quarter, with dynamics remaining mixed across the segments. At FedEx Express, yields remained pressured due to a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of lower-yielding e-commerce and deferred products. Yield was also pressured by increased capacity in the market.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery, partially offset by ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 1%, driven by lower fuel surcharges and lower weights. In January, we rolled out a 5.9% GRI, and importantly, we've been able to capture a high percentage of that rate increase. During peak, our holiday peak residential surcharges enabled us to effectively offset higher costs, delivering $120 million in profit. We are very confident we have the right strategy in place, balancing both volume and yield growth. We are building our network of the future with digital and data-driven solutions that simplify the customer experience and further strengthen our best-in-class customer offerings.\nFor example, earlier this month, we enhanced our healthcare offering with more powerful capabilities to prioritize critical life-saving healthcare shipments above other volume within the network. Healthcare customers now have the ability to select monitoring and intervention service options. They cover categories such as temperature requirements and vaccines, and they do this at the package level. Each express shipment now includes specific healthcare identifiers so that if we need to intervene, we are able to do it with more speed and more precision. And of course, in January, we announced the FDX Commerce platform. FDX connects the entire customer journey by offering end-to-end e-commerce solutions, making it easier for companies to grow demand, increase conversion, optimize fulfillment, and streamline their returns. The FDX platform will enable us to enhance our long-standing relationships with merchants of all sizes to help them optimize and grow their business.\nWe have opened a private preview for select brands and retailers, and based on their feedback, I am incredibly excited about the official launch later this year. In closing, I'm very proud of our entire global team and how they continue to deliver outstanding service as we navigate a very dynamic market. With that, I'll turn it over to John to cover our financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. Our third-quarter results reflect ongoing progress on our Drive initiatives, as well as our continued focus on service and revenue quality. As a result of these efforts, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion for the third quarter in a row, despite declining revenue in a challenging market environment.\nTaking a closer look at our performance in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income increased by $192 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points. At Express, adjusted operating income increased by $134 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. The benefits of Drive initiatives and an additional operating date more than offset lower revenue. At Ground, the team delivered another quarter of strong results. Adjusted operating income increased by $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points due to cost reductions and yield improvement. Despite slightly lower volumes and in an inflationary environment, ground cost per package was flat year over year, with lower linehaul expenses and improved dock productivity offsetting higher first and last-mile costs.\nAt Freight, while operating margin remained strong, operating income declined by $46 million and operating margin declined by 170 basis points, driven by lower fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment, and lower shipments. These results also reflect the lapping of a $30 million facility gain last year, partially offset by the benefit of an additional operating day during the quarter. Looking at the quarter overall, weather had an immaterial year-over-year effect on profitability. Before turning to the outlook, I'd like to spend a few moments updating you on our cost reduction initiatives, including Drive and more specifically G&A. As an initial matter and as part of responsible headcount management, we have reduced our workforce by nearly 22,000 over the last year and expect additional opportunities in the future as we move forward with our transformation.\nWithin G&A, we continue to make significant changes to how we approach areas like procurement and technology so that we are a more efficient digitally-led organization. In addition, global functional alignment provides savings opportunities. I'm pleased that we have achieved $350 million of G&A savings year-to-date, including $150 million in the third quarter. Taking a closer look at sourcing and procurement, we've continued to evolve the sourcing and procurement function from a segregated and regional structure to a centralized global organization that will manage most third-party spend across the entire enterprise. With new leaders in place, we're developing new category strategies and have already identified about 20 discrete categories that will manage centrally in cooperation with functional leaders. By implementing these new strategies at the enterprise level, we'll have tighter spend oversight, we'll better leverage our scale and buying power, and generate significant cost savings.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our enterprise-wide Drive progress this quarter, and we will deliver $1.8 billion in savings for the full fiscal year. Now, turning to our fiscal year outlook, and as Raj shared earlier, based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range while narrowing our outlook from the prior range of $17.50 to $18.50 to $17.25 to $18.25. At the midpoint of the narrowed range, we continue to assume a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue for the full year. As always, we'll closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory restocking, global trade, inflation, and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected revenue.\nWith regard to our fourth-quarter expectations, as implied by our outlook range, we expect year-over-year profit improvement despite lapping the onset of certain structural benefits executed in last year's fourth quarter at Express and Ground. Looking on a sequential basis, the leap day in the third quarter affects our typical seasonality. At the segment level, we're maintaining our full-year expectations for a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express, adjusted margin improvement at Ground, and strong but lower year-over-year margin at Freight. At Express, we're looking at every aspect of the business, including taking a fresh look at additional opportunities to improve our European business, and we're confident in our ability to unlock more value at Express and across all our businesses as we continue to seek optimization opportunities. Our bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full-year outlook.\nFor illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, the equivalent to $17.75 of adjusted EPS, as the midpoint of our narrowed outlook range. To walk the bridge to $6.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming that revenue net of cost increases is up $200 million, that we experience $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges diminish and product mix continues shifting toward deferred, variable compensation increases by $300 million, and that these pressures are more than offset by $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from Drive. At the midpoint, we would expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to increase approximately 17% despite revenue declining by a low single-digit percentage.\nAs I've discussed on prior calls, we remain focused on reducing our capital intensity and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns, as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation, and improving return on invested capital. Our capital investment priorities will be on improving efficiency, modernizing facilities, and optimizing our network. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.4 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $4 billion, and we now anticipate capital spend of $5.4 billion for the full year, which is down over $700 million from last year and down $300 million from our prior forecast of $5.7 billion.\nWe also continue to expect aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2026, and we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue will keep declining in the future as we reduce our facilities footprint through Network 2.0 and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx beyond fiscal year 2026. We currently have 37 jet aircraft parked, which is up from 20 last quarter, and as previously communicated, we will retire nine more MD-11s in Q4. Consistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction in the third quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for the first nine months of the fiscal year to $2 billion.\nWe expect to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock in the fourth quarter, bringing total fiscal year 2024 repurchases to $2.5 billion, while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan. I'm also pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which augments the $600 million that remains available for repurchase under the $5 billion 2021 authorization. This reinforces our commitment to support long-term stockholder returns. Overall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in continuing to improve profitability in a challenging revenue environment. We have more work to do, but I'm encouraged by the commitment and focus I've seen from our teams to advance our transformation and provide our customers and stockholders with even greater value. With that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to just one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Today's first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnlayst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for the update on Drive. If I did the math right, I think there's about $385 million or so left for the final quarter of this fiscal year. Maybe talk to where you think this money or the savings, which buckets are going to go to: surface, air, and G&A.\nI'm also just sort of curious on the surface side, how much of that is actually tied to Express surface stuff? Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo thank you, Jordan, for the question. It's John. I'm not going to speak specifically to the number you raised with regard to the remainder of the year on Drive, except to say that we are committed to the $1.8 billion for the fiscal year. I think it's safe to assume that's spread across all of our operating companies. With regard to your question on surface, it's predominantly ground. But as we continue to migrate towards Network 2.0 and through our Drive initiatives, there's a lot of complementary work that's being done together by the teams. So those savings are being realized both at Express and ground.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a bit about the trajectory of the margin on Express. Excuse me, the February quarter was quite a bit better than expected. I'm just wondering, how do we think about that as you go into fiscal 2025? I think two specific items you did mention. One, the $600 million improvement in Europe that I think would go to Express and just kind of visibility on that. Also how we should think about postal, where you had some comments, and I think that's been characterized as a $400 million headwind. Is it reasonable to say that that's $400 million you kind of add back to the number? Anyway, just some broader comments on Express and some of the bigger items. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tom. It's John again. Yeah, we're quite pleased with the progress we've made at Express and the margin expansion. As Raj mentioned, this is all of our primary focus to continue that expansion, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in drive. With regard to Europe, that will be a key focus area of ours, and we are committed to the $600 million that you mentioned. The postal service, certainly, as we're negotiating towards a deal, if that deal were to materialize, you would expect that it's mutually beneficial for both sides. We're looking forward to bringing that to closure as soon as possible. All of that will contribute to our ability to continue to expand our margins at our largest sector at Express.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie had mentioned a competitive but rational market environment as it relates to pricing and yield. We are several quarters into the demand downturn here, and of course, there's been some competitive issues directly in your business. As we look forward, if we continue to kind of bounce along this bottom on demand internationally, but I think more specifically to the United States, does the pricing environment start to waver at all a bit? Do we really need a macro tailwind before we can see maybe a stabilization or re-acceleration of yield?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nHi, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I think from a competitive environment perspective, yes, it is competitive, but I don't think that's particularly different in our industry. We're very used to a competitive environment, and the market does feel quite rational to me.\nWhen we look at the yield focus for the team, I'm actually pleased with the discipline of both the sales and the pricing organization. If you remove the fuel headwind across each one of our segments, Express, Ground, and FedEx Freight, we have kind of low single-digit yield improvement at the base. So I think the team is continuing to execute on our revenue quality strategy. And from a momentum perspective, we do have some headwinds this year that will diminish next year, especially in the international market. If you think about calendar year 2023, from an air freight perspective, the overall air freight market yields decreased between 30% and 40%. That is not going to repeat next year. And then, of course, from an international demand surcharge, it will continue to be a headwind in FY 2025, but less of a headwind than this fiscal year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my question. So in June, you'll complete the legal consolidation of Express, ground, and services as part of the One FedEx effort. Can you give us a look at how that will change, how you manage the business starting in July, how it will change, how you report your financials and operating stats? And can you give us some assurance that we'll get a deep history of comparable financial and operating data to help track your progress as you get further into the operational side of the integration in 2025, 2026, and 2027? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Bascome. And let me start, and then John can add on to this. First of all, we are well on track to complete our consolidation of FedEx operating companies.\nThis has been a lot of great work that's already been done and into one streamlined and simplified organization. I think two words kind of describe this move. One is efficiency, and the other one is effectiveness. I think we are looking forward to the structure that actually moves us forward on both fronts. And I think at the end of the day, these transformation efforts will set us up to drive improved performance and profitability over the long term. I'll give it to John to talk about the rest of it.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. And from a reporting standpoint, we'll be providing more details regarding the new reporting structure as we go forward. But I think it's fair to say that we'll continue to break out both ground and Express yield and volume by service as we currently do, and frankly, continue to provide sufficient data for you all to monitor the performance in those business segments.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. So Raj, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the Tricolor strategy and going after the premium air freight market. Could you talk a little bit more about what that is? I guess I'd always been under the assumption that you guys were the premium part of the air freight market. And how does this realignment actually open up some revenue that maybe you don't have access to today? Thank you, David.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I think I'm going to take a minute here to talk about Tricolor because I think it's a good opportunity. So bear with me for the time I'm going to take here. Firstly, Tricolor is a fundamental redesign of our network to improve the utilization of assets, our ROIC, profitability, and our operating margin. First and foremost, our overall capacity will be determined by the demand environment, and Tricolor will allow us to better flex our capacity to match demand. Now, within that capacity is when we'll break it into three networks: Purple, Orange, and White, we call it, and that cater to the different cohorts of traffic. The idea is to move the right product in the right network while reducing the cost to serve.\nThe Purple network will be a highly optimized and a leaner network designed to move international priority parcel volume that protects our value proposition in different geographies. Now, this network now becomes much more parcel-centric, will have significantly better service, but also density. That density will improve the revenue per position and revenue per flight. Now, turning to the Orange network, that will cater to the premium freight traffic. These are FedEx planes that will operate off-cycle from the Purple system, which allows a few things. Firstly, it allows us the ability, once again, to maximize density and asset utilization. It also decongests hubs and improves service. But most importantly, it allows a truck-fly truck model that reduces the cost to serve. In this context, it should be noted that we are fully leveraging the existing capacity in our trucking networks in the US and Europe.\nPrior to fiscal 2024, we haven't really moved any international freight shipments in our market-leading LTL network with FXF. Now it's already beginning to change, but in Tricolor, it'll take full hold here. So by doing so, we reduce the cost to serve, and we're able to target more of the premium air freight segment. Now, I'm going to coin a new term. Think of it as the \"global LTL segment.\" That's what this is about. Now, as you rightly asked, are we adding capacity to go up and lower yield in traffic? The answer is no. We are going to gate the overall capacity by the premium demand. It should also be noted that 20% of the global air freight shipments approximately drive about 80% of the weight, which is a primary target for freight forwarders.\nWe're going to focus on the other 80% that will readily work with the model I described. So the White network then is primarily used for passenger belly capacity to move lower yielding e-commerce and deferred traffic. So these three networks working in concert with high technological orchestration is what we call Tricolor. Let me just reinforce again that it helps the baseline productivity. It improves our existing asset utilization and makes the entire system more efficient. And we're going to manage the execution of Tricolor with the rigor of Drive to ensure success. So again, thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to come back and maybe better understand the moving pieces for Express during the quarter.\nObviously, quite a strong result, but there's oftentimes some impact from fuel incentive compensation, I think, was a bit of a tailwind here as that changed a little bit as well. So maybe, and then weather, that was a pretty significant surprise considering it was as difficult as you mentioned, Raj, but it seems like it really didn't affect the network. So maybe, John, if you can unpack some of the moving pieces, and then Raj, if you can comment on the durability of the network, if weather just isn't going to be as big of an impact going forward. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. I'll start with that last point because I think it's worth repeating on the weather piece, which ties into some of our digital strategies and our ability to adapt, to allow for what was substantially poor weather here in Memphis to be rerouted in a manner that had an immaterial impact on us. So as you'd expect, there was a lot of moving parts at Express, both positive and negative. And the levers of Drive, the focus on flight reductions, for example, we had 5% fewer flight hours in the quarter. And there are some additional benefits that flow from that on your cost side because when you're not flying airplanes, you're able to avoid certain maintenance costs.\nThe Air Ops team is doing an exceptional job of managing its cost for aircraft that are grounded, whether you're using what's called green time on engines that are available, limiting your inventory purchases, and so forth. So it's really across the gamut where we're seeing improvement there, all in the midst of some revenue headwinds that Raj and Brie talked about. So we're going to continue to keep our head down and focused on our costs. One of the things I like to say, this is a journey, not a destination, and we still have a long way to go at Express, and it is our primary focus, and look forward to keeping you posted on further improvements.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd Brian, I don't think I have much to add to what John has talked about. I think the idea that we use our latest and greatest in digital tools and the notion that we are now able to look at FedEx as an overarching network and able to move things helps us. Of course, we got to see as the weather patterns; those are very impossible to predict, but I'm just pleased with the work that we did this time around, and we'll continue to get better in this regard.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much, and thank you for the detail on Drive. Jeni, welcome. Look forward to working with you. Real quick, the puck doesn't stay in one place. It's always moving around, and I think you're alluding to this with what you're doing with Drive and Tricolor, but I'm just kind of curious from your perspective.\nWe announced this plan about, what, a year and a half ago back at the analyst meeting almost two years ago. How has the network design and some of the Drive goals when you're completed with this changed since you began this process?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I think we introduced Tricolor in the last conference call, and I think this design is just being put in place as we are speaking here. And so in terms of the Drive commitments, we had originally talked about $4 billion by FY 2025 and less than 50% in FY 2024. We will hit those numbers, right, for FY 2024 and on track for FY 2025. And again, the other part of it, of course, is Network 2.0, which we said $2 billion by FY 2027, and that's underway.\nSo with the focus on making sure that we have structural cost reductions, we have network redesigns with the whole FedEx portfolio in play, and the idea that we are moving forward on our digital tools, all three are working. And I think we got work to do, but we made some good progress. John's going to add more to what I just said. Yeah. I think what I would add to that as well is to your comment about a kind of changing environment. The teams meet weekly on this, and there are some programs that are delivering more than we expected, and there are some programs that are delivering less than we expected. But we're always looking to fill the pipeline as well on additional opportunities. And that's an ongoing project, and that speaks to Drive being part of our culture going forward.\nThat's not going to stop, and we're going to adapt to a changing environment, and I think that will help us as we move forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Good evening. So Raj and team, I guess I love the results in terms of the speed here at Express, but I'm confused a bit by the messaging. Last quarter, you talked about seasonal declines at Express and what occurred from Express going down to what should be maybe near breakeven given the seasonal moves, yet it was up so significantly, 130 basis points year over year. Was there a massive shift in the Drive or other programs or your speed of execution?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBecause it sounds like from what you're saying on the targets, nothing's really changed, but I'm just wondering what shifted intra-quarter so much that we're now seeing this quick of an improvement. And then just, I'm sorry, just a side clarification. Did you say Canada was about to be rolled out? Because I thought you had already said that with Hawaii and Alaska, Canada was done. So I just maybe I want to clarify that. Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo hey, Ken, it's John. I'll start with the last one. It's about to be rolled out. It has not been completed, and Brie can talk more about that in a minute. But Q3, as I mentioned earlier, was a combination of things. We saw, while the revenue was soft, we were focused on quality revenue. The cost controls were solid and strong. And there were some other levers that were alluded to earlier. As you can see, volume comp, for example, was down. So that was a contributor. But all these things taken together resulted in us and our focus on improving our results for Q3.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYep. And Ken, I'm just happy to clarify from a Network 2.0 perspective, the Canada plan has not changed. Alaska and Hawaii are done, and we are beginning the rollout of the integration in Canada that will begin this April, and we will be done before peak. And it's on track.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe if we can follow up there on Network 2.0. Raj, I think you mentioned you'd made some management changes on both ground and express service operations in the US. Can you talk maybe a little bit more about that and how that plays into long-term integration?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Brandon. I think first of all, Network 2.0 is on track. Let me just take a step back here. You'll recall that we said we plan to deliver $2 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2027, and we are taking that measured and deliberate approach. We just rolled out our new leadership structure in the United States, and it's obviously a much more streamlined structure and a much more effective structure, and essentially with the goal of putting one truck and one neighborhood design into action. We are encouraged by the early results we're seeing in the initial rollout as well. So far, Network 2.0 model on the whole achieved approximately 10% reduction in P&D costs and maintained very strong service levels. As we become more tech-enabled in this regard, we'll deliver even greater improvements.\nAs we have already talked about, we are focused on implementation of Canada before peak. I'm also happy to say that I'm very excited about Network 2.0 from a service perspective because it'll drive a better customer pickup experience. So we are on our way, on track, and again, some ways to go.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So John, this year is the billionth year of Drive savings, and you've talked about 900 million of offsets, so about 900 million of actual profit. As we think about fiscal 2025, do you think the actual profit improvement should be closer to the 2.2 billion of Drive savings, or do you think there's another year of material offsets to that Drive in fiscal 2025? And then just separately, just no one's asked about Ground yet, and it's by far the biggest part of the business. So if I can just ask one, the margin's 12% this year. Do you think there's further margin improvement to go with Ground? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. And let me start by saying on that 2.2, that's certainly our goal to have that all flow through, but we have to be realistic and understand that a lot of the pressures that we're seeing today are expected to continue for a while. And while we're going to continue to focus on those things within our control, there are certain things outside of our control. And so our goal is to have as much pass-through to the bottom line as possible, and we look forward to keeping you up to speed on that, including when we next talk in June.\nWith regard to ground, exceptional story, exceptional performance from the team. I believe those margins are sustainable, and there's still a number of projects in the pipeline that allow us to continue to grow and expand that business and those margins. So again, that's going to be our focus as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thanks very much, operator. And hi, team. I have, I guess, two questions. One is, as part of the whole redesign of the network and the business and collapsing everything into one, have you thought about shifting to a calendar year rather than staying on a May fiscal year? And my second question is maybe for Raj. A lot of investors push back to me about the business, the way you're structuring the business, and I noticed the stock aftermarket was up quite a lot after the earnings release. Why do you think investors are so skeptical of your business plan and aren't willing to give you the credit that maybe you deserve for the changes you've made as speedily as you've made them?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Helane. I'll start on the first part on the calendar year. As you'd expect, with everything going on, there's legal and accounting exercises that need to take place to get us through this next period, including 1 June 2024 date of one FedEx. But I can share it's certainly on my radar to migrate towards that, and we'll keep you posted on developments towards that.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nHelane, as far as your second question, all I can say is that we, as a team, are very much convinced that we have a unique story at FedEx here. The opportunities that we have, one in the industry is one thing, but within the industry, we have a unique opportunity because of the strategies that we have deployed. We started moving early than anybody else. We are performing better than our competition, both on the top and the bottom line. We have a longer runway because of the opportunities we have identified. So we will try to educate as many people as we possibly can on our strategy and where we are, but we are just seeing the early stages of what's possible at FedEx. Any one particular corner sometimes kind of throws you off, but the long-term strategy is sound, and we all believe in it, and it's going to be a good run in the next three, four years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for coming, everyone. Apologies if I missed this, but regarding the USPS contract, kind of when do you expect that to reach provision? Is that something that happens in FY 2024 or 2025? And also can you share how much of the volume has come off already and kind of how much would you dimension kind of that net with the new contract ends up being? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nHi, Ravi. Thanks for the question. It's Brie from a USPS contract. I really can't say more than I already said earlier. In short, we are feeling very positive about the negotiations.\nBoth parties are working eagerly. We're at the table. I think we are days or weeks away from knowing if we will have a contract, not months. And as we have shared previously, their current contract ends on 29 September. So we will know very, very soon, and I'm certainly not at liberty to talk about the details of a future contract.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for the question. I appreciate the incremental color on Network 2.0, and I was hoping you could maybe provide a little bit of color in terms of some of the investments that have to be made in order to execute on the integration, particularly as you enter or you begin the execution in a much larger market like Canada. Any color in terms of maybe lessons learned from your Alaska and Hawaii integration, and then what investments we should expect to see as you implement it in Canada? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Stephanie. It's John. Yeah, certainly there's going to be some investment required when you're consolidating facilities, particularly sort facilities. But there's also upside in that you're able to reduce your facility's footprint along the way. So that will involve certainly some planning and processes, analysis, and all that. But we're excited actually about the end game here, and that is our overall footprint will benefit. The benefits of that will far exceed the investment and contribute to a really efficient network.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd honestly, from lessons learned, I think the team feels really good about their execution to date. To Raj's point, we have seen kind of the P&D benefits that we anticipated, as well as we've seen the team be able to execute from a service perspective. I will say we are being very disciplined. We're being very methodical, and we are giving customers the advance notice as we go into market. That was one piece of feedback for customers. Even though we anticipate being able to deliver the same level of service with the combined organization as we are as the individual, they do want that notification. And so we, of course, are giving customers that advance notification. And to Raj's point on the positive, I cannot underemphasize how important that single pickup is to our small customer segment. This has been the only feature gap we had to UPS in that segment, and we are about to close it. So I'm pretty excited about that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nHey, Raj. Brie, John, and Jeni, welcome to the mix here. I don't know if you've really talked about it, but we've been hearing that you've had some pretty material service improvements, especially at Ground over the last, call it, year or so, and that's despite the cost-savings push. Can you maybe just talk about that a little bit? Where are the service levels today? What are the levers that you're pulling? And then what kind of opportunity do you have to drive corporate growth as a result of that?Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nI love this question. John Smith and Scott Ray are crushing it. When we went back and looked at our Q4, the toughest quarter to deliver, I should say Q4 calendar year, the toughest quarter to deliver awesome service, not only are we faster, I am quite confident we, on those higher standards from a delivery service perspective, we also had better reliability. How are they doing this? It's discipline. It's day in and day out execution. We look at our service metrics every single morning. We talk about net promoter score every week at our revenue management committee. And to Raj's coverage on the integrated leadership team, now the service organization, we absolutely expect to extend that across the entire network, and I just could not be more appreciative of our operators and how well they're doing.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I wanted Brie to answer that question because she holds their feet to the fire every single day. So I'm glad that you heard that answer directly from Brie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for getting me in. I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity you see just with the e-commerce return business. You've obviously been a big player there, but there's been a lot of changes to the network. Is that now a larger focus? The reason why I asked, obviously, there's been a press report about you re-engaging with Amazon. So just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. Happy to. I think we've got the best returns portfolio in the market. When you look at our retail coverage as well as our transportation solution, it is best in class. And when we looked at our January numbers, the FedEx Ground returns portfolio did see some healthy growth.\nYou layer that on with the new announcement of our FDX platform. We are going to be the only provider that has not only the physical capabilities but a very comprehensive digital capability. And what do I mean by that? We are going to be able to help all retailers, brands, and merchants process their returns on their websites, manage their exchanges, manage the inventory, integrate their branded tracking and communications to customers. It's a really powerful offering. As I mentioned earlier, we've started to preview this with some customers. We've got some pretty big names and what we're calling our private preview, and I look forward to sharing more results once we do the full launch later in the fall. I think I'll stop there. I'm enthusiastic about this.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nNo, I'll just say this much. When you integrate with those customers, even I can program, and it's a no-code environment. I can set up the returns policy. So if I can do that, anyone can do it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\n\nScott Schneeberger\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much, everyone. It's basically two questions. One's a follow-up to Bruce's. Brie, I was hoping if you could kind of give an overview of peak season, kind of takeaways, learnings, and then I think we have five less calendar days for the 2024 calendar peak. So just things that you're going to learn and manage ahead of time as it's a much more condensed season. And then the second question for any of you, but just in ground cost per package, it was down 2% in the fiscal second quarter, and you cited improved first and last-mile productivity. Flat here in this quarter, and offset was higher first- and last-mile cost. Just curious if there's anything we should read into there. Thanks for taking them both.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I think from a peak perspective, we're really pleased with how we're managing peak from a service, from a customer, and from a profitability perspective. First and foremost, the team starts literally now for this coming peak. And what do I mean by that? We are already talking to customers about what their peak requirements are for next year, and so that John and Scott have advanced planning. And then, of course, as we get closer to peak, we take the top 100 customers, and we are managing forecasts on a weekly basis. I think some of the integrated planning that we are doing with Dataworks is also incredibly helpful so that we have real-time information.\nWe're not waiting for spreadsheets to be passed over, but we've actually got real-time visibility into some of our largest customers, which has been incredibly helpful. So I don't anticipate us doing much different this year, but more of the same. Again, I also was really pleased with the peak surcharge capture. We are ensuring that the customers that really drive the investment we need in December, we're getting recouped for that cost. So we feel good.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll speak to the Ground piece. I think one of the drivers of the margin expansion and cost control at Ground was lower linehaul expense that I alluded to. We moved a lot of high-cost and ad hoc external linehaul spend into our scheduled network, and as a result, achieved lower rates on the planned linehaul purchase transportation.\nThis is all part of a broader optimization and ongoing optimization that's taking place in the network through Drive and through Network 2.0. So every aspect, and even those on first and last mile, will be part of that. We're also leveraging the capacity that we have. We do have some additional capacity in the ground network that can absorb additional volumes at no incremental cost. So that should help improve margins as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. In closing, we saw continued operating income growth, margin expansion, despite lower revenue for the third consecutive quarter. This is clear evidence that Drive is working.\nWhile these results are encouraging, it is our top priority to maintain momentum and continue to transform our network and the way we work. Once again, let me thank our FedEx team members for their hard work and dedication to delivering outstanding customer service. I'm really proud of the work that we have accomplished as we continue to build the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Thank you for your time and attention today.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Jeni. We are on the home stretch of Peak, and I want to begin by thanking our team members for their hard work and dedication as we deliver an outstanding holiday season for our customers.\nToday marks an important step in our transformation. Following our assessment of FedEx Freight, which we announced and commenced back in June, we have decided to pursue a full separation of this business, which will result in two industry-leading public companies. Through the separation, we believe we will unlock significant value for stockholders while allowing for continued commercial, operational, and technological cooperation between both businesses.\nThe separation will also enable both companies to benefit from enhanced focus and competitiveness for FedEx. This will ensure strong execution of our near- and longer-term strategic priorities while preserving the benefits Freight and FedEx enjoy from their long-standing connectivity.\nEach independent company will be well capitalized with flexibility to invest in profitable growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders.\nI would like to provide a brief overview on the compelling value proposition of both businesses, starting with FedEx Freight. We're excited to create a leading LTL pure-play, the largest carrier by revenue with the broadest network and the fastest transit times. FedEx Freight has deep relationships with customers who turn to us for our reliability, simplicity, and choice of services. Freight has maintained its leading market share position for a long time and increased operating profit with nearly 25% on average per year over the last five years, expanding operating margin by approximately 1,100 basis points.\nThe team's focus on safety, facility utilization, revenue quality, and operational efficiency has driven this performance and these factors will continue to guide Freight's go forward strategy supported by a strong balance sheet.\nAs a separate company, Freight will be better positioned to unlock its full value potential. Areas where we see the greatest opportunity include first, an expanded dedicated LTL sales force led by Tom Conley, our new VP of LTL Sales. With nearly 30 years of experience, we've already begun to build out this team and we expect to add more than 300 LTL specialists by the time of separation.\nSecond, an enhanced LTL-specific pricing and invoicing system that drives faster speed to market, more intuitive contracts, and is more tailored to this particular market, third, improved freight and FedEx network efficiencies focused on accelerating speed, improving coverage, optimizing touches, and lowering our cost to serve, and four, an LTL-focused automation which will drive efficiency and reduce outside vendor spend. FedEx Freight's portfolio of solutions, which includes both priority and economy services, is also well positioned to benefit from the long-term market dynamics shaping the LTL industry.\nAs we pursue this separation, we will remain focused on customer experience by sustaining or improving service to our customers to ensure the focus and seamless transition. Lance Moll will continue to serve as President of FedEx Freight as we execute on our separation.\nThe long-standing cooperation between FedEx and FedEx Freight will continue through commercial, operational, and data and technology agreements to enable seamless continuity of service and capture existing benefits from the relationship. We have an unmatched customer value proposition with two separate companies. We will ensure commercial collaboration that creates a seamless transition for our customers, especially those that turn to FedEx for all three services.\nFrom an operational perspective, in addition to the network efficiencies I mentioned earlier, Freight will continue to provide line haul for FedEx strategically, including Tricolor, Peak season, and Drayage Support. This requires minimal change as Freight already receives a direct financial benefit from supporting Federal Express via intercompany agreements.\nAdditionally, we will implement shared technology and service agreements to facilitate the transition and beyond. Through these agreements, FedEx will provide Freight with tech platforms that effectively connect the two businesses as needed and ensure business continuity. Given the strong reputation and familiarity of our brand, we plan for the new company to continue to operate under the FedEx Freight name.\nPutting all of this together, customers will continue to enjoy the superior service, speed, and coverage they have come to expect from FedEx Freight while also maintaining access to the unparalleled global ecosystem of FedEx services.\nNow turning to FedEx, we pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago and remain the industry leader today. Customers choose us for our advantaged value proposition enabled by our service, speed, and breadth of coverage. We deliver nearly 17 million packages each business day to over 220 countries and territories. We link more than 99% of the world's GDP. We transport approximately $2 trillion worth of goods every year by connecting three million shippers to 225 million consumers in the US. Our weekend and rural coverage also serve as competitive advantages.\nWe generate over one petabyte of data every single day, which provides insights that drive how we run our company more efficiently, how we serve our customers, and how our customers manage their own supply chains. The ongoing progress at FedEx gives me confidence that this standalone business will continue to thrive into the future.\nDuring and post separation, we will continue to focus on delivering significant value to stockholders through our strategic initiatives, which are cementing our leadership position as the world's best transportation and supply chain technology company. This includes DRIVE, which continues to change the way we work.\nWe are on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of FY 2025 versus the FY 2023 baseline. Network 2.0, which will deliver on the promise of a more efficient network including one truck, one neighborhood, along with consolidated facilities, where we are targeting $2 billion in savings by the end of FY 2027. Tricolor, the redesign of our global air network, which positions us for strategic growth while improving the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system.\nAs a separate company, FedEx will strengthen its leading value proposition with an emphasis on delivering outstanding service, continuing to provide a differentiated offering in premium segments, and remaining focused on higher yielding service, and building on our technology ecosystem to create smarter supply chains for all.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade profile. We will continue to make high return investments in the business while reducing capital intensity and increasing stockholder returns through buybacks and dividends.\nLooking ahead, we expect to execute the separation within approximately 18 months. Claude Russ will lead our Separation Management Office, bringing the DRIVE rigor and accountability that we use to run our operations. Claude has spent nearly 25 years at FedEx as the former CFO of FedEx Freight, is well versed in our freight business and the LTL market dynamics. Claude is currently Enterprise VP of Finance and has been a critical enabler of our DRIVE execution.\nToday we have shared the outcome of the assessment and our initial plans. As we have new details and separation milestones to share, we will keep you updated upon completion. This full separation will result in two strong, well-capitalized industry leaders, FedEx Freight, which will benefit from continued strategic and operational competitiveness and more flexible capital allocation.\nFedEx well positioned to continue executing on our strategic initiatives in pursuit of sustainable profitable growth. We're confident the separation is the right strategic decision for FedEx and FedEx Freight at this point in our evolution with a clear path ahead to create significant long-term stockholder value. Importantly, for our employees and our customers, it's business as usual as we look forward to a seamless transition. We are used to navigating change, and we will do it while continuing to deliver on the Purple Promise every single day.\nNow, turning to our Q2 results.\nLooking across the enterprise, we delivered sequential improvement both in DRIVE savings and adjusted operating profit. At Federal Express Corporation, we achieved strong results on a year-over-year basis and greater flow-through to the bottom line, with adjusted operating profit up 13% on essentially flat revenue. We did this despite the challenging demand environment, as well as headwinds we have previously identified, including the US Postal Service contract expiration and the timing shift of Cyber Week.\nThis is evidence that our transformation is clearly working. Similar to last quarter, we experienced weakness in the industrial economy, which negatively affected our B2B volumes, particularly in the US domestic package and the LTL markets. Continued market pressure, coupled with difficult year-over-year comparisons, weighed on our freight segment in the Q2.\nWith B2B revenues comprising nearly 60% of our package business, and 90% of our LTL business, we are well positioned for profitable growth when the industrial economy recovers.\nAgainst this backdrop, in support of evolving market dynamics, we continue to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent FedEx. As we deliver for our customers, we achieved DRIVE savings of $540 million in Q2. We remain confident that we will deliver our targeted $2.2 billion in incremental savings in FY2025. Our Network 2.0 rollout continued, and the Canadian market integration will be largely complete in early calendar year 2025.\nWith the expiration of the US Postal Service contract, we are strategically matching capacity with demand and flexing the network as needed to transport packages more efficiently. At the end of September, we reduced our US domestic daytime flight hours by nearly 60% and swiftly began to reduce other associated costs, and we delivered solid service for our customers. This is always our priority, and especially important during peak.\nI'm very pleased with how our teams are navigating a condensed period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. During peak, they're delivering more packages per day on average while maintaining the high-quality shipping experience that our customers expect, with the ground average time in transit at two days in the US this Peak.\nAs we look to the second half of the fiscal year, we remain focused on what is within our control, executing against our transformation initiatives to reduce our cost to serve, and drive improved performance. However, amid continued uncertainty around the demand environment, we are updating our expectations for FY2025. We now expect an adjusted EPS outlook range of $19 to 20. John will provide more color on the underlying assumptions shortly.\nTurning to DRIVE, on past earnings calls, I've talked about DRIVE as our structural cost optimization program. The reality is that within FedEx, DRIVE has evolved to be so much more. It's a new data and technology-driven business architecture that has changed how we work across our entire enterprise, introducing more rigor and accountability to every decision we make, leading to a continuous cycle of efficiency and optimization.\nTake Europe where we expect to achieve $600 million in total DRIVE savings by the end of the fiscal year. Our European business is predominantly a ground-based business. We introduced new European leadership over the summer, including a senior operator from our US Surface team. In the spirit of one FedEx, we are bringing hub and sort best practices from the US to Europe, and we have achieved many recent wins. Our progress includes revenue growth, which, combined with the DRIVE benefits, leads to improved performance this quarter.\nThis gives us confidence in Europe's near and longer-term trajectory. Our ability to enhance the financial performance of our European business starts with technology. Having implemented a common data platform, we now have a better view of our European network assets and cost to serve, using these insights to increase efficiency in the region.\nFor example, with our improved routing in Europe via the enhanced data flow, we reduced the number of touches on intra-European packages. This is not only improving productivity, but also expediting clearance, leading to better service. We also introduced dimensional pricing at our Charles de Gaulle hub in Paris. This enhancement, enabled by new and updated technology, seamlessly captures package dimensions and weight, and then integrates applicable surcharges via standardized processes.\nAs a result, we are now better and more accurately compensated for the goods we transport, especially for the higher margin packages with unique dimensions. We'll continue to roll out this capability to other European facilities over the next year. Together with non-stackable shipment surcharges, we expect this initiative to deliver an operating income benefit of over $50 million in FY2025.\nThis is a prime example of our new business architecture translating into improved financial and operational outcomes. Looking ahead across Europe, the team remains focused on deploying the right value proposition and network design, the digital tools that enhance the customer experience, and the right processes to deliver this experience efficiently and effectively. Improving our financial performance in Europe is a top priority for our entire leadership team. I'm very encouraged by our recent progress and confident in the opportunity ahead.\nIn October, just in time for Peak, we celebrated the grand opening of a new state-of-the-art sorting facility at our Memphis World Hub. This new sorting facility marks an important milestone in our modernization efforts, improving the work experience for our employees, and service for our customers, while increasing the efficiency of our hub. We also continue to roll out Network 2.0 in select markets in the first half of Q2, and we have now optimized 200 stations to date.\nWe are continuing to execute on Tricolor, our international air network design strategy, which is improving density and asset utilization across the enterprise, while targeting profitable growth. Before I close, I want to thank the FedEx team once again as we approach the end of our peak season. They make every FedEx experience outstanding, positioning us well through peak and beyond.\nNow let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. Market conditions remain soft, but our solid service levels, unique value proposition, and innovative offerings supported our Q2 performance and have positioned us well for a successful peak season. Consolidated revenue declined 1% in the quarter, driven by the weak industrial economy. US manufacturing PMI has indicated a contraction for 24 out of the past 25 months, representing the second longest downturn in US history.\nReviewing each segment on a year-over-year basis. Now at Federal Express, revenue was essentially flat. Higher yields across our services were partially offset by volumes, which declined year over year. We again saw increased demand for our lower-yielding services. Some of this demand increase was driven by a shift in customer preferences, particularly with the shift from Home Delivery to Ground Economy, but the majority was due to organic demand and not related to trade down between services.\nAt FedEx Freight, lower volumes, fuel surcharges, and weight per shipment drove the top-line decline year-over-year. Comparisons were challenging as some customers won last year from the Yellow bankruptcy have since left in search of lower prices. That being said, we are ready to capture additional profitable volume when the market returns.\nTurning now to volume trends by service during the quarter, volumes were pressured led by weakness in the US domestic market, partially offset by strong international growth. Across US domestic express services, volumes declined 1%, primarily due to weakness in the industrial economy. Ground volumes were down 1% as well, with the soft B2B environment weighing on ground commercial growth.\nWhile we recognize that e-commerce will continue to outpace B2B growth in the years ahead, we know that the priority customer base is stable, with low rates of churn, and the current priority volume weakness reflects the state of the broader global macroeconomic environment.\nBrown residential volumes were adversely affected by a difficult comparison due to Cyber Week, which occurred in Q2 last year and is in Q3 this year. International export package volumes increased 9% in the quarter, driven by international economy, which is largely consistent with recent quarterly trends. Within FEC, average daily pounds were up 10% for international priority freight and 5% for international economy freight. This signals early progress from our Tricolor strategy to drive profitable growth in the global air freight market.\nAt FedEx Freight, the soft industrial economy led to weakness in both weight per shipment, down 3%, and average daily shipments, down 8%.\nThe pricing environment is competitive, but I am encouraged that revenue quality actions are gaining traction. Revenue quality remains our highest priority as we ensure that revenue growth is benefiting the bottom line. At Federal Express, composite package yield increased 1%, driven by International Priority, US Priority, Home Delivery, and Ground Commercial. Overall yield for Ground services was flat, with yield growth at Home Delivery and Ground Commercial offset by Ground Economy.\nAs expected, International Economy parcel yield declined due to mix and lower weight per shipment. Moving to FedEx Freight, composite freight yield was up 4% driven by lower postal service volumes tied to the contract expiration, and also successful commercial execution in the international export freight market. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 4% driven by decreased fuel surcharge revenue due to lower fuel prices and lower weight per shipment.\nWe are through a significant part of Peak and project the demand surcharge revenue over this season will be up year-over-year. I am confident that this pricing strategy is supporting the revenue and profit expectations for the Q3. Looking at the second half of fiscal year 2025, we anticipate consolidated revenue to be up slightly on a year-over-year basis in both Q3 and Q4. While we still have five days to go.\nI'm very pleased with December volumes, which are ahead of our forecast. We expect our general rate increase of 5.9%, which goes live in January, to have a very strong capture.\nFederal Express revenue growth in the back half will be supported by Ground residential and International Economy volume growth driven in Asia, and also through European market share acquisition. We continue to see strong commercial traction, particularly in Europe. At FedEx Freight, we anticipate revenue to decline slightly in the second half due to continued softness in average daily shipments and modest yield improvement. As Raj mentioned, in January we begin hiring 300 incremental LTL specialists. We believe this increased focus will provide better support for our customers, and enable us to accelerate profitable growth.\nAs we wrap up the calendar year, it's a great time to remind you of our commercial strategy. I am proud to lead the best team in the industry, and I am confident that the commercial strategy we have in place will drive significant value in the years ahead. Our strategy is in service of our vision to make supply chain smarter for everyone. For our customers, our mission is to be their unrivaled partner in moving their business forward. To deliver on this mission, we will provide a superior digital portfolio and customer experience.\nIt's essentially the Purple Promise 2.0, powered by the FDX platform. In fiscal year 2026, we will begin the transition of our fedex.com customer base to the FDX platform. This will improve our speed to market and allow us to expose new capabilities, like advanced visibility for the millions of FedEx small and medium customers.\nWe are designing new experiences for high-value segments and planning for above-market growth where we already have a differentiated portfolio. Our target segments are B2B for both healthcare and automotive, domestic e-commerce, global air freight, and of course Europe first. B2B, we have experienced tremendous success in healthcare, which has been our priority. B2B vertical Federal Express already has a double-digit percentage of our revenue in the fast-growing $70 billion healthcare segment, and this segment is an important contributor to FedEx profit today.\nThis fiscal year, we expect to gain market share in the US by leveraging our unique portfolio, including cold chain support, our new quality management program, and FedEx Surround monitoring and intervention. While most of our healthcare revenue is US-based, the international healthcare market represents significant opportunity.\nWe will globalize our portfolio and accelerate revenue growth outside of the United States.\nAutomotive is also a massive market, and we are focused on what we estimate to be a $10 billion market within this industry that requires premium services critical to automotive supply chains. We have created an automotive vertical and expect to provide new benefit in early fiscal year 2026.\nOur second priority is the US domestic e-commerce market. E-commerce will continue to drive 90% of the market's incremental parcel growth in the years ahead within our US Ground services. Our superior speed and coverage give FedEx a competitive advantage, not to mention Picture Proof of Delivery, which continues to help us close new business.\nAs we execute on Network 2.0, we will continue to lower our cost to serve, which will lead to improved incremental flow-through from these volumes.\nOur third target segment is the global air freight market. This is a market with significant potential. We currently have a low single-digit market share in the $80 billion air freight market. International Priority Freight already serves as a profit driver for us. Our Tricolor strategy is a necessary condition to competing and winning in this market commercially. We've also made numerous changes to improve our performance. We have created a dedicated sales organization, a new customer service model, and are investing in the digital experience.\nThe air freight market is fragmented, and the shipping processes are antiquated. It's a market ripe for disruption. Fourth is Europe. The European parcel market is roughly $130 billion and will continue to grow in the years ahead. Our mix of revenue in Europe is already favorable, with the majority coming from B2B.\nAs Raj mentioned, Q2 revenue in Europe grew nicely, with strong execution. DRIVE continues to transform our cost to serve and improve service on the continent, while enabling us to lean into the most attractive parts of the market.\nRegardless of the target segment, revenue quality and capacity management are critical to growing profitably. We have made tremendous progress in yield capture in the last several years. A great example: total non-standard surcharges are generating a significant year-over-year benefit of over $180 million annualized. This is the result of a new AI image capture process.\nIn calendar year 2025, we will accelerate our work on an end-to-end capacity management system. Within SDX, there is a digital twin of the network. We now have real-time view of the network capacity globally. We will use AI in our Digital Quote platform to profitably fill voids at a scale and pace that was previously not feasible. I am very confident about the future as we lean into these commercial priorities. I am proud to be part of the best team in the industry, and extend my sincere thank you to the team members as they deliver for our customers this peak season. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. Despite soft market conditions, our Q2 performance demonstrates the team's strong commercial execution and actions to lower our cost to serve. We sequentially grew adjusted operating profit by approximately $170 million and increased our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year, with the growth driven primarily by our Federal Express segment, and we achieved these results despite revenue declining 1%.\nWalking through the dynamics of the quarter, the soft global industrial economy, coupled with the competitive pricing environment, constrained our results.\nThe Postal Service contract expiration negatively affected two months of the quarter, resulting in additional operating profit headwind. However, our plans to remove costs associated with this contract expiration are on track. DRIVE benefits of $540 million offset these headwinds, and supported our consolidated year-over-year adjusted earnings growth.\nProviding more detail by segment. At Federal Express, we grew adjusted operating income by $146 million year-over-year as a result of DRIVE savings, base yield improvement, and increased international export demand. We achieved this result despite inflationary pressures and several significant headwinds, including the Postal Service contract expiration, a $90 million headwind from the Cyber Week timing shift, and a $20 million headwind from the hurricanes in the Southeast US.\nAs Raj and Brie mentioned, we're pleased that in Europe, our continued network optimization initiatives and strong execution contributed to the profit improvement at Federal Express, and the ramping of our Tricolor strategy drove higher average daily pounds and yields year-over-year for Federal Express International Freight.\nIn Q2 we decreased total US domestic flight hours 24%, largely due to the 60% reduction in daytime flight hours that Raj mentioned due to the expiration of the Postal Service contract at FedEx Express, while operating profit was down $179 million. Approximately $30 million of this decline was due to our lapping the gain on sales of multiple facilities in Q2 of FY2024.\nConsistent with the broader LTL market, lower average daily shipments, fuel surcharges, and weight per shipment continued to be a headwind largely due to the soft industrial backdrop. These pressures were partially offset by cost management and continued base yield growth.\nMoving to DRIVE, as planned, we delivered a sequential improvement in savings in Q2 versus Q1, and savings of $210 million in Q2 were a significant lever in the quarter as we continue to optimize our IT and back office functions and reduce outside vendor spend. Surface savings of $150 million benefited the quarter as we continued to maximize third party rail usage, which lowers our cost to serve on our deferred service offerings, and adding the $180 million from Air Network and International, we achieved $540 million total savings in the quarter.\nAs we look to the back half of fiscal 2025, we continue to expect a sequential build in DRIVE savings, and we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing in base yields. However, the global industrial economy continues to constrain demand on our most profitable priority and commercial services. As a result, we are revising our FY2025 adjusted diluted EPS outlook to $19 to 20 compared to the prior range of $20 to 21.\nAt the top end of our range, we assume revenue is up a low single digit percentage, driven by a modest improvement in industrial production, leading to higher flow-through from B2B demand. At the low end of the range, we're assuming a low single digit decline in revenue due to incremental softness in the industrial economy and the pricing environment.\nRegarding our expected earnings cadence for the second half of the fiscal year at Federal Express, we anticipate Q3 will benefit from ramping DRIVE savings, improved top line flow-through due to the timing of Cyber Week, continued revenue quality actions, and the encouraging peak demand that Brie talked about.\nHowever, as a reminder, the Postal Service headwind is expected to increase in Q3 and will lessen in Q4 as we exit the fiscal year, and the Q3 Postal Service headwind will more than offset the benefit of the Cyber Week timing shift. We continue to anticipate DRIVE savings to build incrementally in Q3 and Q4, with a full year total of $2.2 billion. At FedEx Freight, we expect a continued softness in the US industrial economy and lower fuel prices to pressure operating profit for the remainder of FY2025.\nFinally, our Q4 is typically our strongest earnings quarter of the year. We expect this dynamic to continue despite having one fewer operating day in Q4.\nI'd now like to turn to our latest full year adjusted operating income bridge, which shows the year-over-year operating profit elements embedded in our revised outlook. This bridge now reflects adjusted operating profit of $6.6 billion, equivalent to $19.5 of adjusted EPS.\nFor revenue net of cost, we now expect a $700 million headwind compared to the $100 million FY2025 headwind assumption we shared last quarter. This reflects both our lower revenue assumptions and continued inflation.\nAt the same time, we now forecast a $300 million headwind from international export yield pressure, which is an improvement compared to the prior $500 million estimate. This is a result of execution on our revenue quality initiatives internationally.\nWe still expect about a $300 million headwind from two fewer operating days, one that was in Q1 and one that will be in Q4. Lastly, we anticipate a $500 million headwind from the US Postal Service contract expiration. We remain confident in our ability to offset these headwinds with the $2.2 billion from incremental DRIVE savings. Further supporting this revised outlook is our continued commitment to revenue quality, as evidenced by our calendar year 2025 general rate increase, Peak surcharges, and fuel table price changes announced in recent months.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion at Federal Express and operating margin contraction at FedEx Freight, given the challenging industrial production environment.\nAt the midpoint of our revised FY2025 outlook, we're assuming 9.6% adjusted EPS growth on approximately flat revenue. This expectation further highlights how DRIVE is fundamentally changing the way we do business. We're improving our cost structure to enable us to profitably grow with e-commerce, and are well positioned to see significant incremental margins on our priority services once global industrial production improves. It remains my highest priority to ensure that we continue to unlock the value that I know exists in our business.\nMoving to capital allocation, we remain committed to reducing our capital intensity while increasing our capital returns. In Q2, capital expenditures were approximately $820 million. Our planned FY2025 CapEx remains $5.2 billion, which is flat on a year-over-year basis, and this will translate into continued strong levels of adjusted free cash flow. We completed an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in Q2, bringing the year-to-date total to $2 billion, with an additional $500 million of repurchases planned for the fiscal second half.\nI remain confident in our near and long term ability to grow earnings while continuing to deliver strong levels of adjusted free cash flow, which will support increased shareholder returns in the years ahead. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question, and at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nThe first question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thanks.\nGood afternoon. Maybe I could just hit on the guidance for a moment. I think the Q2 results were generally in line with at least what you guys talked about on the last call. As we think about the dollar cut coming from the back half of the year, I know John, you talked about sort of the industrial production outlook and maybe how that's a bit more tempered. I guess I also wanted to kind of think about LTL or the freight business within that context. It was obviously under some pressure here.\nI guess maybe if you could help break down the moving pieces of the dollar in a little bit more detail, then also talk about the cadence of how that plays out. Is it a little bit more Q3 weighted or is it a little bit more Q4 weighted?\nDo you think things get better by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year? Just kind of curious how to think about.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Chris.\nI appreciate the question. As you know, our prior guidance factored in DRIVE savings as well as the pricing actions that we implemented. However, you know, the expected volumes and related revenue just did not materialize. Our updated adjusted EPS range, which is in the $19 to 20, reflects our revised revenue expectations. From a timing standpoint, while we are not giving quarterly guidance, I can tell you that Q3 will benefit from ramping DRIVE savings, improved top line flow-through due to the timing of Cyber Week that we talked about, and continued revenue quality actions.\nAs Brie talked about, you know, we are seeing encouraging signs from our peak demand. It is important to remember for Q3, though, that the USPS headwind is expected to increase in Q3 and then somewhat less than in Q4.\nThat headwind will more than offset the benefit of the Cyber Week I just mentioned. We continue to anticipate DRIVE savings to build incrementally in Q3 and Q4. From a Q4 standpoint, that is traditionally our strongest earnings quarter of the year, and we expect this dynamic to hold. That's true despite even having one fewer operating day. Hopefully, that gives you some more perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Congrats on the freight spin. Obviously long anticipated and a great move to see in value creation. My question is, Brie, you talked a little bit about peak season here and how it's shifting into Q3. Maybe can you give a little bit more color on kind of, you know, you mentioned peak was strong. Is there anything we can read into that in terms of volumes, ability to get price to flow through? I guess I'm more focused on the volumes both at ground and express. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey Ken, great question. From a December perspective, we are pleased. I will say it picked up right after Cyber Monday. It was a very strong week, and we are, from a December perspective, pleased volumes are running ahead of forecast. As I mentioned, our peak surcharge capture from an absolute dollar amount will be up year over year. We do think that December is going to be a very strong month.\nThat being said, I do want to talk about our top line outlook for the back half of the year because we do not necessarily believe that the December performance is going to carry through in the back half. As we're thinking about the back half top line outlook, we're looking at, you know, some improvement.\nI think you're going to see that improvement come in the form of domestic volumes, in particular at Ground. We think that will improve in the. We do anticipate that Q2 was the trough for FedEx Freight from a revenue perspective and that from an international. Actually, what we think we'll see in the back half is that total volume will look a lot like the first half, with actually some slight softening in Asia. We're very pleased with December. The execution is going to be great, the capture is going to be great, but we're not yet thinking that this is a signal of more to come in the back half.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ari Rosa with Citigroup.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good afternoon, and congratulations on the strategic move here. Raj, I'm just curious to hear you.\nTalk a little bit about kind of how you see the separation playing out.\nJust if you could talk about what are the things that kind of need to be done to ensure a smooth transition. Also, what are your thoughts on kind of the risk of customer attrition as you separate out the two businesses and just kind of ensuring that customers aren't confused by the separation or maybe see it as a risk to their operations. You guys separating out the two businesses. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Ari. I think, you know, we are, you know, we decided to separate because of the potential to increase shareholder value for both FedEx and FedEx Freight. As far as we have put in place the Separation Management Office with Claude Russ as the head to make sure that we get from here to day one to the points that you made. As Brie talked about, we have appointed a VP of LTL Sales, and we are going to add 300 sales folks in the next year to make sure that we pay more directly.\nDeal with the issue that you talked about. We're also going to continue to improve our customer experience. It's very important for you to note also that the FedEx Freight company benefits a lot from the association with FedEx.\nThat association, whether it's commercial, operational, or technological, we'll have those arrangements in place as we proceed through the separation.\nSo, I think we'll be able to handle this transition quite well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research Analyst in Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Just curious, if you give a little more color around the Network 2.0 rollout, the progression that's planned from here, and given the experience with Canada or any other areas, what do you think has gone particularly well and what has been the more challenging aspect of it all? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you very much, Jordan. I think, yeah. We may continue to make significant progress on Network 2.0. We've taken a deliberate approach to rollout and prioritizing service quality. We have optimized 200 stations so far, including 130 in Canada. We will complete the rest of the Canada integration early in 2025, with the last major market being Montreal as a feature of how we roll this out.\nEvery time we roll out something, we take lessons learned and we keep applying into the next one. That's working quite well. We are continuing to see 10% P&D cost reduction where we have fully rolled out 2.0. At the end of FY2025, we expect to have approximately 250 stations integrated. Hopefully that answers your question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stephens Inc\n\nHey, good evening, everybody.\nThanks for taking the questions. John, maybe one on capital allocation and the balance sheet. First, I guess how do you envision maybe debt being divvied up or how should we think about target leverage for each business?\nJohn, you've worked hard to reduce the capital intensity of both businesses. How do you envision capital allocation changing at all? Will this spin enable certain investments you previously weren't making, or how did that change?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, no, we're not anticipating any changes in capital allocation. You know, we're continuing to be focused on optimizing our existing business, ensuring, you know, the significant adjusted free cash flow is returned to stockholders. That's going to be true both before and after the separation.\nYou know, we continue to have the programs in place. We're going to. We've already accomplished $1 billion of share repurchases in Q2 for a total of $2 billion for the full year, with a remaining $500 million for the remainder of the year. That's all going to remain in place now in terms of, you know, capital allocation in kind of the post separation environment. That's all going to be something we're going to be reviewing over the coming months, and look forward to keeping you updated on the progress of that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, operator. Everyone, evening, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the spin. It's always nice to see some value creation out there.\nWanted to focus a little bit on. the commercial agreements you spoke about, you mentioned the ones that were, you know, with peak help and drayage. How long are these agreements for? Also, what about anything on the bundle side between the two companies? You know, I'm assuming existing contracts that are offered will be honored, and how should we look at the bundle going forward?\nI'm assuming they'll just go away.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThat's a great question. I think we just need to take a step back and just clarify, you know, what the customer base at FedEx Freight looks like today. First and foremost, obviously FedEx Freight would not be the powerhouse that it is today without the incredible strategy to take these three networks together, put them together, put the FedEx brand on them, and then to build off just the incredible relationships that FedEx has with customers.\nThat is one of our commercial strengths, deep solutioning and partnerships with our customer, and that has really created a lot of momentum. That being said, if you look at the majority of the FedEx Freight revenue base today, while the majority of small customers are bundled, the majority of the actual volume at FedEx Freight is negotiated on an independent contract.\nToday we really made a pivot, I guess about four or five years ago. Recognizing that when we were competing in a fragmented market, we had to negotiate the freight business separately. Those contracts will be honored. As you know, the vast, vast majority of FedEx Freight contracts are renegotiated every year. They will be honored as we go through this process. That is why we are very confident in the incremental focus from a dedicated sales team.\nIt's important to note we have about 75 sales reps today that are dedicated to large accounts at Freight. This will be additive to them. As we go through the process, we will look at the small customer strategy and I anticipate that will be slightly nuanced because that is where we really have leveraged the benefit of the earned discount program at FedEx.\nThere is a common myth that FedEx Freight revenue is diluted because of that bundle, and that is not true.\nActually, the way the earned discount program work is that as they ship more FedEx Freight or more LTL, you actually get incremental benefit on your parcel side. There is some potential benefit from small customer improvement too. We're very comfortable in our commercial strategy, and we can execute it.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nI think what I would add to that, from a kind of intra company standpoint, it's important to recognize that through the separate operating companies previously, and as Raj mentioned in his comments, freight has benefited from providing services to Federal Express. A lot of agreements already exist that will just be enhanced as we go forward with the separation. We're not going to have to reinvent the wheel on this.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nTravel and Transports Analyst, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone. Thank you. Maybe going back to the first question just on EPS, the change in the guidance. Freight was clearly pressured in the quarter is the entirety of the change in the guidance associated with the freight business. It just seems like the underlying core trends in Express are actually improving. I don't know. If you could just talk a little about the dynamic between the two businesses. The changes overall. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Thank you, Connor. Look, there's a number of considerations. The pricing actions that we've implemented are supporting our FY2025 earnings growth assumptions for sure. However, revenue expectations remain constrained due to the demand environment, largely resulting from the continued weakness in the US industrial economy that Raj talked about. US Premium services, even though there's some, you know, we talked a little bit about peak, but US Premium services are expected to remain muted for a while, thereby putting pressure on income and margin.\nWe do expect continued growth from our deferred services, which are contributing, but with lower margin and lower flow-through to the bottom line. Really, you know, the top end of our range assumes a modest improvement in global industrial production and slight growth in revenue.\nThe low end of the range assumes revenues declined slightly year over year, driven incrementally by incrementally softer industrial production and pricing. The midpoint just assumes flattish revenue year-over-year. You know, we're going to be focused on controlling those things we can, we remain confident in DRIVE, and those savings will continue to ramp incrementally during the second half. Those are some of the considerations that are going into our outlook.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, let me just add one other thing, Conor. I think at an overarching level, I mean, it's been really surprising to me to see the last 25 months that we are declining ISM for 24. It's, you know, very difficult to say when that will turn around. The fact that we have produced such, you know, the results and especially in FEC in this environment, I think it says a lot about what we can do and also shows what can happen when that market turns. We are assuming that the industrial production and the manufacturing continues to be similar to what we saw in the first half or the second half, as was stated earlier.\n60% of the revenue for the FECs comes from B2B, while 90% comes from LTL. Hopefully, that will help you with the calculations.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Transportation, JPMorgan\n\nHey, evening.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Thanks for taking the question. Bri, just wanted to come back to you on the general trends for price and competition you mentioned. It's still pretty competitive out there. You don't see a trade down necessarily, but it does sound like the deferred side of the business is growing faster. Just want to see if you can offer a little bit more comment. Sounds like the demand surcharge is sticking, but what about the other ones that you've put into place to help optimize the network and sort of get that revenue management moving in the direction that you would want? How are those sticking and how would that progress into the back half of the year? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi Brian. Great question. The market certainly is competitive. I do feel that it's rational from a pricing strategy. As we think about the yields in the back half, they are going to remain pressured. That is a function of two things: one, the economy, and two, to your point, there is a mix change. I do want to emphasize that we do have some customers trading down.\nWe're also, as we go to acquire new volume and customers, because all of our customers are simply trading less. You know, in a downturn, you need new customers to be able to add to the portfolio. There is growth in new customers in the deferred portfolio. From a pricing strategy perspective, I think the team, despite the economy, is executing really well. The pressure that we're seeing is on the base rate, and then weight.\nWe know every time we're in a downturn, weights are pressured really across all the portfolio, especially in the freight portfolio. There's not a lot that the team can do from a weight perspective. What they can do is be really disciplined in getting the surcharges, especially those surcharges that drive a disproportionate amount of cost. Peak is a great example. They're executing on Peak. From a large package perspective, nobody moves large packages better than we do.\nActually, we're seeing that. Part of what we're seeing in December is a lot of flow through from a fourth perspective. As you heard, not only are we being disciplined from a large package capture on surcharge, but the dimensional capabilities that we're putting in to get capture is increasing it.\nFrom a rural perspective, we have the best value proposition here in the United States into the rural markets. That matters for a lot of our customers. You know, the last 3 or 4% of their volume, they don't want to have to use a different provider. We're really being disciplined on getting those surcharges. They are contributing, but the base rate is really pressured because of the economy. I hope that helps.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good evening and congratulations on the spend. I know a lot of your shareholders will definitely be happy here too. I guess, Raj, can you expand on what you are doing differently under DRIVE? You spoke about how it is driving the way you do business today versus what you did yesterday, especially in the context of revenue quality, which I think Brie has mentioned many times and maybe even reflecting on losing your largest customer. It looks like your margins have actually come up. What else in the portfolio potentially can you change looking forward?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nOkay, I'm trying to digest that question, Brandon, but let me just start with DRIVE. Firstly, I think, you know, DRIVE has clearly evolved to be how we work in this company. We have established an overarching, market-leading approach to overall governance that leads to disciplined execution. You know, we are, it's a data-driven approach and very rigorous and very timely decision making, and ultimately leads to much, much better execution. This is going to stand us in good stead as a foundation for FedEx to execute as we go forward.\nThe second thing is we also adopted a data-first, digital mindset in solving problems while creating differentiation in our service offerings. The underlying technological innovation and transformation that we have created is quite profound. Those are the two things powering our execution.\nThat's also why as we have changed our vision to making supply chains smarter for everyone, it starts by making our own supply chain smarter. Of the $4 billion of DRIVE savings, I think roughly $1.8 billion would be a direct result of the new technologies that we put in place. That's what DRIVE is all about. As we look at what comes next, whether as we implement Network 2.0, or whether we improve and expand on Tricolor, or expand our operations and expand our performance in Europe, all those are going to be guided through DRIVE. That's what gives us the confidence of execution. I hope that answers the question that you asked.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone, and echo the sentiments on the spin. Great to see. Maybe somewhat of an oblique follow-up here to Brian's question. Just, you know, there's been some suggestion of a USPS privatization. You know, maybe we could get your thoughts on what that would mean for the competitive environment. Is that, you know, a new bona fide competitor, or is that maybe introducing a more material profit mandate and thus, you know, making the Postal Service more rational? You know, any thoughts and color there would be great.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, it is very early for us to comment on something like that. We will keep that. We monitor the developments there very closely, obviously. One of the principles that I think is important to state here is that for our industry, it's important that the package delivery business is not subsidized by the US taxpayer. I think that's a very important consideration set, and hopefully that'll be what will get adopted here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, Brie. I was hoping to ask about tariffs. It's a narrative that seems to be dominating some of the sentiment around the group right now. You're a much different cost structure than you were in the first Trump administration. Just as it relates to tariffs, have you heard from your customers about any pull forward? I guess secondly, how would you manage your network if there were to be a surge in demand that may be more of like a short term as opposed to a long term secular shift?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, it's a great question. From a December perspective, you know, there might be a little bit of a pull forward. As we talked about, we are seeing some, you know, some movement both in the freight network and in the parcel network from the ports. There might be a little bit. It's hard to tell right now because we're in the middle of peak, you know, how much of that is inventory as well as how much is just consumer demand. Obviously, it will be much clearer in January from a reaction perspective.\nI am really pleased with how quickly the airline team is able to respond right now. You know, to Raj's point, we are doing things differently with DRIVE. As far as being able to adapt, I'm very confident. You know, as Raj has shared many times, we're everywhere.\nWe have customer relationships everywhere. As customers prepare to pivot, we're there to pivot with them. You know, it's very hard at this point to predict what might happen under a future administration. We're not going to try to, but we are ready to respond with agility.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nJon, let me just say that as you can imagine, we are a referendum on global supply chains every single day, especially of the high value economy. We see this information from the bottom up, and the fact that we have a scaled network already in place that connects 99% of global GDP is a significant advantage because we can move our capacity much, much quicker than manufacturing can move. We are very agile, much different than what's been the case before.\nOne other thing I would say is that you can imagine that as part of our value proposition is an end-to-end delivery international that includes customs clearance. We have the data, the expertise, and the insights about what it takes to move a package from one country to any other country and all the commodities therein.\nThis becomes a competitive differentiation advantage for us as we make our customer supply chain smarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon, John, you said a couple times that the post office headwind is bigger than the cyber week tailwind. There's a lot more moving parts, so maybe can you just clarify. What you're trying to sort of communicate around Q3 expectations, and then on the LTL spin, I just want to understand a couple things.\nWhy is it 18 months seems a little long, and then as we do our math, is there any way to just think about if there's much, if any, of the corporate unallocated costs that we should apply to LTL? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Scott. Let me start with the 18 months. You know, from a timing standpoint, the 18 months period for a transaction of this magnitude is really consistent with what is reasonable to expect. We do look forward to keeping you posted on our timing and milestones along the way. We'll look forward to keeping you posted on there.\nYou know, with regard to the Postal Service, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are on track to take out cost as planned with the US Postal Service contract expiration. We talked about the flight hours taken out. Roughly 60% of our US domestic daytime flight hours have been taken out, and that makes up about 24% of our total daytime hours. We're also going after all the other related costs. You know, as I mentioned in my remarks, Q3 will be impacted because it'll be a full three months of impact from the Postal Service contract, and that'll start to wind down in Q4, and we'll start to see it as a tailwind into FY2026.\nYou know, that just gives you some background and perspective. We're pleased with the work that's been done. There's more to be doing and taking that cost out. Hopefully, that gives you some good color on the postal service.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for getting me on for a question. I appreciate it. Let's see on the LTL. Thanks for all the detail on this spin. It's complex, but it's helpful to hear your thoughts. Raj, would you anticipate that you get somewhat more volume focused with LTL in the future? You talked about the 1,100 basis points of improvement in the margin over a period of time, and I think that was driven by some of the change in focus on pricing and a lot of discipline.\nI'm wondering, would you anticipate that hiring a bunch of salespeople, focus on SMB, those things, would you potentially be more volume focused and maybe compete harder for freight in the future, or is that the wrong way to look at it? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Thomas. Bri.\nI think first in the main, we're really pleased with the discipline that we've got across the team from a revenue quality perspective. You know, we've made great strides as we look forward. We do see this as an opportunity to play offense. We are going to invest commercially and new salespeople. We know we've got an opportunity from a different industrial mix, and as I mentioned earlier, from a weight.\nWhile our weight is down right now in our base because of the macro, when we look competitively, we think there is some opportunity using technology to fill up the capacity. We know the FedEx Freight network right now can run very comfortably at 100, 105. We've got some opportunity to be a little bit more strategic also to look at the 3PL market.\nYes, we're going to play more offense, and we think there's some great things to come.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for fitting me in here. Coming back to Network 2.0. I think Raj, you mentioned like 225 stations would be consolidated or something like that by the end of, I think it was fiscal 2025. Can you give us a sense for kind of what percentage of volume you might have touched with the Network 2.0 integration to date?\nAs you think about the timing of when the more difficult to tackle major metros may start to be coming in play, is this a fiscal 2026, fiscal 2027 sort of timeline? Just trying to get a better sense for when the rubber really starts to meet the road, so to speak, on the physical integration of the courier operations in the heart of the domestic network. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, David. The FY2025 number is 250 stations integrated. I think the big lift is going to be in FY2026. We have FY2026 and FY2027 are the two big years. FY2026 will be the big lift for us, for Network 2.0.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, operator. In closing, I'd like to thank our team members for delivering this outstanding peak season. We have five more days to go, and I really look forward to a very strong finish. Let me wish all of you listening on this call a very happy holiday season. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nYou are muted."

Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. Our Q4 performance marks a strong end to a year of successful execution. We delivered year-over-year operating profit growth and margin expansion in every quarter of FY2024. We lowered our capital intensity, reaching our FY2025 target of less than 6.5% a year early. With lower CapEx and higher free cash flow, we returned nearly $4 billion to stockholders, and we meaningfully improved our return on invested capital. The entire industry faced a challenging demand environment in FY2024. Our team focused on what we could control, and as a result, we delivered full-year earnings towards the higher end of our original guidance range, up 19% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. We did this despite a decline in revenue compared to our initial growth expectations.\nWe also advanced our network transformation, continuing to roll out Network 2.0 and finalizing the transition to One FedEx, which went into effect 1 June. We did all of this while maintaining an intense dedication to serving our customers, a relentless pursuit of innovation, and an unwavering commitment to our people, service, and profit culture. Our transformation journey will continue in FY2025 as we build on the team's outstanding progress. Now turning to the quarter in more detail. At the enterprise level, revenue growth inflected positive this quarter, as expected. While we saw modest yield improvement and signs of volume stabilization across segments, we have not yet seen a notable increase in demand. Continued execution of DRIVE, alongside effective expense management, enabled year-over-year improvements to adjusted operating income, margins, and earnings per share. Let me pause here to acknowledge and provide context around the team's tremendous Q4 and full-year results.\nGround delivered its highest adjusted operating income in company history for both Q4 and the full year. At Freight, Q4 operating income increased despite significant demand weakness. In fact, because of our strong Q4 performance, Freight ended fiscal year 2024 with full-year operating margin equal to last year's all-time high. Adjusted express operating margin increased sequentially in the quarter but declined year-over-year as expected. We continue to take action to unlock the full profit opportunity that exists in this business. DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We've achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in FY 2024, with approximately $500 million from air network and international, $550 million from GNA, and $750 million from surface network. In our air network, structural network transformation and reduced flight hours drove the Q4 savings.\nWithin GNA, we realized procurement savings by centralizing third-party transportation, sort equipment, and outside service contracts. Our surface network continued to maximize the use of rail. As part of that effort, Freight now handles nearly 90% of the drayage volume, up from about 25% just one year ago. Looking ahead, we are firmly on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings in FY2025 compared to the FY2023 baseline. Let me spend a moment on Europe, where we are executing on the $600 million FY2025 DRIVE savings target we have shared previously. I would like to thank Karen Reddington for her more than 27 years of service at FedEx, most recently as our Europe Regional President. A couple of weeks ago, Karen announced her impending retirement. We wish her all the very best.\nWalter Roels, who is an exceptionally seasoned and experienced executive, will become our Europe Regional President on 1 July. Walter has been leading our Europe DRIVE domain since his 2022 inception. I'm confident that under Walter's leadership, the team will continue to advance DRIVE initiatives to support improved performance. John, Brie, other FedEx executives, and I were in Europe visiting the team just last week. Our team members there are working with rigor to execute on our efficiency plans, and our performance improved on a year-over-year basis. The Q4 route optimization, improved thought processes, and productivity gains led our Europe DRIVE domain savings. Key actions are already underway for FY2025. I left the continent encouraged by our progress and with even more conviction in the opportunity ahead. On 1 June, we reached an important milestone in our transformation, what we call One FedEx.\nThis is the consolidation of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation. There are many benefits. This foundational step improves efficiency and reduces costs, allows our teams to move with speed, and makes it easier for our team members to manage their FedEx careers. In Q4, we also continue to roll out Network 2.0, including the launch in Canada, our largest market yet. In the first half of FY2025, we will complete the Canada transition and optimize dozens of additional locations in the US. We expect to significantly pick up the pace into FY2026. Importantly, even as we streamline our structure, we are maintaining our strong service levels, and we continue to offer the widest portfolio of services with the most compelling value proposition for our customers.\nOur integrated portfolio offering is a long-term driver of sustained profit improvement and a key enabler of our Tricolor network design. We also continue to leverage data to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. In November 2023, we began introducing a new tool to our contracted service providers in the US to track and drive improvement across key operating metrics tied to demand, safety, service, and productivity. This tool is a common platform that we plan to scale globally, providing insights and enabling outcomes that are beneficial to FedEx, our contracted service providers, and our customers. Across the 65% of service providers currently using the platform, it's already driving service and safety improvements, which are translating into cost savings. Real-time visibility tools like this are critically important as we start to flow packages across our network irrespective of service offerings.\nOur FY2024 results create a strong foundation as we kick off the new fiscal year. In fiscal 2025, we will continue to execute on our transformation strategy and expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 24%. John will provide more detail on our outlook and the underlying assumptions shortly. With the recent completion of the FY2025 planning process, we have turned our focus to the next phase of our long-term stockholder value creation plans. As a part of this work, our management team and the board of directors, along with outside advisors, are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx Freight in our portfolio structure and potential steps to further unlock sustainable shareholder value. We're committed to completing this review thoroughly and deliberately by the end of the calendar year.\nWe'll conduct this assessment while continuing to focus on customers, team members, and the safety of our operations. Before I close, I want to thank our FedEx team members for their continued commitment to our customers and their focused execution in FY2024. I'm truly excited about the value creation opportunities in front of us as we continue to win profitable share, execute on our structural cost initiatives, and leverage the insights from the vast amount of data we compile from moving more than $2 trillion worth of goods every single year. We are firmly on track to achieve our $4 billion FY2025 DRIVE cost savings target compared to the FY2023 baseline. We expect another $2 billion to follow from Network 2.0. Our Tricolor strategy will improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system.\nWe expect to continue lowering our capital intensity, improving our ROIC, growing free cash flow, and delivering significant returns to stockholders. We have a clear line of sight to achieving 10% adjusted operating margin on $100 billion revenue. I have never been more confident in our future as we create the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. With that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to congratulate our team on their outstanding Q4 and full-year performance. Our service and speed advantages continue to attract customers in high-value industries and segments. With this focus on profitable growth, we have continued to gain market share both in the United States and around the world. We are very pleased to see revenue growth turn positive in the Q4 with volume stabilization and modest yield improvement.\nLet's review Q4 top-line performance by segment on a year-over-year basis. At FedEx Ground, revenue increased 2% on a 1% increase in yield and a 1% increase in volume driven by ground commercial. At FedEx Freight, revenue increased 2% driven by higher yield. Average daily shipments increased slightly. At FedEx Express, revenue in the Q4 was flat with package yield up 2%. While positive, yield growth was pressured by a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of deferred services. International yields were also pressured by an increased capacity in the global air cargo market. Turning now to monthly volume trends during the quarter. Volumes continue to stabilize. In US domestic package, year-over-year volume declines continued to moderate. International export package volume increased 8% in the quarter driven by International Economy, largely consistent with the monthly trends we saw last quarter.\nOur continued focus on reliable service at Ground drove volume improvement in Ground commercial. FedEx Freight shipments inflected positive as the quarter progressed as we lapped last year's demand softness. As we previously announced, our contract with the United States Postal Service will expire on 29 September 2024. Until then, we will continue to meet our service commitments. We expect volumes to be near contract minimums consistent with what we saw in the Q4. After the expiration of the contract, we will implement adjustments to our operations and network that will drive efficiencies and create more flexibility. Similar to last quarter, the pricing environment remains competitive, but rational. During the Q4, we continue to grow yield as we focus on profitable growth and revenue quality. At Express, package yield increased 2%, driven by higher US domestic package yield, partially offset by international export yield pressure.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1% driven by home delivery and ground commercial. Our value proposition is translating to increased ground commercial market share gains, which positively contributed to our yield. And at FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was up 1% driven by a continued focus on revenue quality as we grew share in the most attractive parts of the market. This was Freight's strongest yield performance since the Q3 of fiscal year 2023. In light of the overall pricing environment, I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong US domestic capture rate on the 5.9% GRI in January. We recently announced fuel surcharge table increases across our services, which should also benefit yields in fiscal year 2025. We continue to enhance our portfolio and value proposition to drive profitable growth.\nOur world-renowned brand, the breadth of our network, and our strong reliability, along with our digital portfolio, are winning the hearts and the minds of customers around the world. A few commercial highlights I would like to share. We are very proud of our healthcare portfolio. Last year, as part of our commercial drive focus, we increased focus on this attractive segment and experienced great results. We have over $1 billion of healthcare-related revenue that comes from customers who utilize FedEx Surround. The FedEx Surround platform provides insights to help our customers monitor and solve their supply chain challenges. Surround gives customers real-time visibility into their shipments by combining information about the package with external data, such as weather, to predict delivery timeliness and to mitigate the risk of disruption.\nAnother critical element of our healthcare strategy is our ability to demonstrate our high reliability and our ability to meet customer Quality Agreements. The Quality Agreement is essentially a customized standard operating procedure for critical healthcare shipments. In fiscal 2024, we signed new Quality Agreements for customers tied to over $500 million in revenue. As we expand our healthcare portfolio, we'll continue to focus on high-value areas like clinical trials. Earlier this month, in the Netherlands, we opened our first European Life Sciences Center. This state-of-the-art cooling facility is the sixth of its kind in our global network, offering an end-to-end supply chain solution for temperature-sensitive medical storage and transport. In addition to the tremendous work with our healthcare customers, our e-commerce portfolio is the most robust in the market. We have the best speed, coverage, and capabilities.\nPicture Proof of Delivery was a great new feature to improve customer confidence. We recently launched our Picture Proof of Delivery APIs. These APIs enable our customers to expose Picture Proof of Delivery within their own branded notifications and websites. This quarter, we signed several new pricing agreements with large retailers for our new Picture Proof of Delivery API. This is a great differentiator and represents what will be the first of many wins for our new FDX platform. Looking ahead in fiscal year 2025, we expect the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year. Currently, we expect US domestic parcel and LTL volume to continue to improve with the year-over-year increase growing as the year progresses. International air cargo demand from Asia accelerated in early May and is stronger versus previous expectations. We expect year-over-year growth to be driven by e-commerce and low inventory levels.\nShippers are facing tightened capacity both in air and sea freight services. Red Sea disruptions have further exacerbated shipper challenges from Asia to Europe. These conditions should bring strength to the overall air freight yields from Asia. In closing, I am very confident in our outstanding team, our strong value proposition, and our new digital solutions. These will continue to power our success as we build on our momentum in fiscal year 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. For fiscal year 2024, we delivered $6.2 billion of adjusted operating profit, which is nearly a $900 million or 16% year-over-year improvement, adjusted operating margin expansion of 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS up 19%. This is a very strong result in a year where revenue was down 3% or nearly $2.5 billion.\nWe also reduced our capital intensity and achieved our CapEx to revenue target of 6.5% or less a year ahead of schedule. With the continued strong cash flow and lower capital intensity, we returned nearly $4 billion to stockholders. These results reinforce that our transformation efforts are taking hold and demonstrate our commitment to creating value for our shareholders. Taking a closer look at our Q4 consolidated performance on a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating income increased by over $100 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. At Ground, the team delivered another strong quarter. Adjusted operating income increased by $133 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. This was driven by continued progress on DRIVE, increased yield, lower self-insurance costs, and commercial volume growth.\nAt Freight, operating income increased by $58 million, and operating margin improved by 220 basis points driven by higher yield. Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and cost management has enabled improved profitability despite the soft demand environment. As directionally expected, adjusted operating income at Express fell by $92 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 90 basis points. Express results were pressured by lower international yield, higher purchased transportation costs due to the launch of our Tricolor initiative, and a headwind from annual incentive compensation. DRIVE cost reductions and higher US domestic package yield partially offset these pressures. With respect to Europe, earlier this month, we announced a planned reduction in the size of our European non-operational staffing to further support Express profit improvement. We expect $125 to 175 million in annualized benefit beginning in FY2027, with tailwinds starting later in FY2026.\nDecisions like these are never easy, but are a necessary step to improve profitability in the region. In addition to our segment results, our Q4 results include a non-cash impairment charge of $157 million relating to our decision to permanently retire 22 Boeing 757 aircraft from our US domestic network, along with seven related engines. These actions, coupled with the previously announced retirement of nine MD-11s in the quarter, resulted in the permanent removal of 31 jet aircraft from our fleet in FY2024. This reflects our strategy to continue to right-size our air network capacity with demand and unlock additional operating efficiencies. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted earnings outlook range for the year is $20 to 22 per share. Let me talk through our key assumptions and variables. Starting with revenue, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth driven by improving trends in US.\nDomestic parcel and international export demand. The primary factors that will ultimately determine our revenue growth are the rate of yield expansion, the pace of global industrial production, and growth of domestic e-commerce. We expect FY2025 yields to benefit from both improved base rates and increased fuel surcharges. Consistent with what we have seen over the past year, we're anticipating a pricing environment that is competitive but rational. On the expense side, we remain committed to aggressively managing our cost structure, including the incremental $2.2 billion benefit tied to DRIVE. I'll walk you through the puts and takes in our FY2025 operating profit bridge in a moment. But at the business level, in fiscal year 2025, we expect the newly combined Express, Ground, and Services segment, now called Federal Express, to be the larger driver of FY2025 adjusted income and margin improvement.\nWe expect FedEx Freight margins to be up modestly year-over-year due to both yield and volume growth. I'd also like to provide some color on our quarterly cadence in light of the US Postal Service contract expiration at the end of September. We anticipate headwinds from the expiration of that contract to begin in Q2 starting in October. With this headwind lessening in H2 as we aggressively reduce our Postal Service-related costs, including our US domestic air network costs. Turning to other aspects of our outlook, our estimated effective tax rate for the full year is approximately 24.5% prior to mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. We're also forecasting $560 million of business optimization costs in FY2025 associated with our transformation. Our operating income bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full-year outlook.\nBy way of illustration, we're using adjusted operating profit of $7.2 billion, equivalent to $21 of adjusted EPS, the midpoint of our outlook range. To get to $7.2 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming revenue net of variable costs and continued inflationary pressures is up $100 million. The US Postal Service contract termination results in a $500 million headwind, international export yield pressure of $400 million as demand surcharges diminish and mix continues shifting toward our deferred services, and two fewer operating days in the year decreases profitability by $300 million. And as a side note, we have not experienced this adverse calendar dynamic since fiscal year 2001. And lastly, performance-based variable compensation increases by $100 million. DRIVE, however, will more than offset these pressures, delivering an incremental $2.2 billion in structural cost savings.\nAs a result of all of these factors and at the midpoint, we would expect fiscal year 2025 adjusted operating income to increase by approximately 15% year-over-year. In FY2024, we remained focused on reducing our capital intensity, increasing ROIC, and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $5.2 billion, which is a decline of nearly $1 billion compared to last year. We delivered ROIC of 9.9%, which is an increase of 120 basis points from last year's 8.7%, and we'll continue to focus on improving ROIC, and it is now a significant element of our long-term incentive program. Consistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed $500 million of accelerated share repurchases in the Q4, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $2.5 billion.\nThis is $500 million above our plan that we came into the year with. For the full year, we also generated $4.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow, which is up about $500 million year-over-year. Looking ahead to FY2025, we anticipate capital spend of $5.2 billion, which will again be down year-over-year as a percentage of revenue. We'll work by prioritizing our capital toward optimizing our network as part of Network 2.0 and further enhancing our fleet and automation to improve operating efficiency. We remain committed to decreasing aircraft CapEx to approximately $1 billion in FY2026. Due to improved earnings and CapEx discipline, we expect to further grow adjusted free cash flow. This will enable us to deploy $2.5 billion in stock repurchases in FY2025, including a planned $1 billion of repurchases in Q1.\nAs previously announced, we're also enhancing our stockholder returns by increasing our dividend by 10%, and this is on top of the 10% increase we implemented in FY2024. Lastly, we're planning for $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans, and these plans continue to be well funded, and we're at the 98.6% funding level at fiscal year end. Finally, a quick update on our segment reporting changes. Now that we have successfully completed the consolidation of Express, Ground, and Services into Federal Express Corporation, I'm pleased to announce that our reportable segments in FY2025 will be Federal Express and FedEx Freight with no changes to corporate and other. FedEx Freight will include FedEx Custom Critical, which was previously included in FedEx Express. We're making this change to Freight due to the business synergies between Custom Critical and Freight.\nOur new segment structure reflects our commitment to operating a fully integrated air and ground Express network. And let me be clear, notwithstanding the consolidation of Express and Ground, optimizing our Express services and associated costs, including the cost of our global air network, remains critical to our profit and return objectives. This consolidated structure will support One FedEx and Network 2.0 objectives and will provide a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network as One FedEx. We'll continue to provide service-level volume and yield detail, and we plan to share a revised statistical book in late August, which will include our recast results for FY2023 and FY2024. Overall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in delivering these strong FY2024 results and improving profitability despite a very challenging demand environment.\nI'm also really inspired by their commitment to achieving even stronger results in FY2025 and beyond as we continue to deliver on the purple promise. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask on the Express side. So some margins obviously came in at 2.6% for the year. I think obviously it's been volatile, but with the cost progress in Europe, the USPS contract shift, and then just other moving factors in the core business, can you talk about how you expect those margins to trend both in the near term and then as we move through fiscal 2025? Raj, you gave a little bit of color, I think, on some of the USPS headwinds and timing, but any more detail there in quantifying, that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, Daniel, for that question. Let me start, and then John can fill in on some of the other details here too. Firstly, we are sequentially improving our performance in our Express services. It remains a top priority for me and the entire team. We're taking multiple actions here. Firstly, we're aligning capacity with demand, as we already heard. We moved 31 aircraft from our jet fleet in Q4. As I've mentioned to you in some detail last time we spoke, I talked to you about Tricolor. That's a fundamental restructuring of our network. It does two things. One, it improves our density, it improves our asset utilization, and expands margins. Secondly, because of the reduction of cost to serve, it puts us in a position to profitably take share in the premium freight segment.\nNext, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will improve our European performance. Our DRIVE commitment is to improve $600 million from FY 2023 baseline, and that's a critical part of how our Express services get better in FY 2025. Finally, we are taking active efforts to make sure that our global SG&A is streamlined. We are extremely confident that we can continue to unlock significant value in our Express services business. Now let me turn it over to John to add more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, no, thanks, Raj. And I think you covered it very well. We were pleased to see the sequential improvement in our margins, but recognize we have more to go. I will also add there is a significant sense of urgency as well. DRIVE is heavily focused on the Express business. And as Raj mentioned, this is going to be a key part of our margin expansion as we go forward here. And we'll look forward to updating you along the way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So in the bridge, the $500 million postal headwind for the year, how much of that is in Q2, and what do you think that should mean for sort of the quarterly earnings cadence? And I guess ultimately, how much of the revenue decline with the post office do you think you can fully offset over the next few quarters? And then if I may, just a separate topic, Raj, just can you just talk about the puts and takes of why you would or wouldn't go ahead with an LTL spin? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo thanks, Scott. And I'll start with regard to the $500 million. We haven't laid out the spread of where it's going to impact us the most. What we can say is we've got a pretty good hold on what those costs are. We're going to be aggressively going after them beginning in Q2, and it's going to flow into Q3. And those aggressive mitigation efforts should start to really take hold in Q3 and beyond. And look forward to keeping you posted on that. And Raj, I'll turn it over to you on the other question.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, Scott. At this point, all I'm going to say is that the assessment of FedEx Freight and the company's portfolio structure is well underway. We'll do this analysis thoroughly, deliberately, and when we have something to communicate on this, we'll, of course, do so. Thank you, Scott.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nI'm sorry, I guess I didn't touch your revenue question on that part. As you can see from our outlook, we are looking to year-over-year improve our revenue. That's part of our plan as well as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks. Maybe kind of just a follow-up again. On the LTL piece, Raj, just want to get a sense. Does this include a spin or sale of the assets? Just want to make sure we understand that all opportunities, or potential, is on the table. And then, I guess, John, maybe you're thinking about that kind of revenue cadence, I guess. How do you think that sort of plays? I guess that's the piece I'm looking at as the first step in the bridge on the revenue side, how that sort of plays out. Obviously, you have the big dip in revenue relative to USPS starting in Q2. Just want to get a sense of kind of how to think about that over the course of the year.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nOkay, let me start and then give it to John. Honestly, at this point, I'm not going to say much more on this topic than what I've already said. As I said, we are looking at the FedEx Freight and the company's portfolio structure, and we'll do the analysis, and we'll come back to you when we have something to say.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo I'll touch on the cadence. Well, we're not going to give quarterly guidance by segment, but for your modeling purposes, we're anticipating normal seasonal trends to hold steady in FY2025 Q1. I will note that Q2 will be impacted by a couple of events, including the impact of the US Postal Service contract termination, as well as Cyber Monday moves from Q3 of last year to Q2 of this year. We'll look forward to keeping you, I'm sorry, the other way around, from Q3 to Q2. Q2 to Q3, I'm sorry.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone, thank you. Just in the context of your revenue assumptions, just curious if you could frame up some of the moving parts, just maybe on when you expect volumes to inflect positive, and then just any of the, and this doesn't seem like a macro-driven plan, but just any of your assumptions around the macro environment, what you need to see there to kind of see volumes perk up. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure, thanks, Conor. It's Brie. From a macro perspective, we are expecting sort of moderate improvement as we work our way through this fiscal year. As we look at kind of the subsegments of our business, from a B2B perspective, we are forecasting the overall B2B market to be around 2% growth. E-commerce will be ahead of that, as we've just seen. E-commerce reset is somewhat done. When we just looked at e-commerce as a percentage of retail in calendar year Q1, we actually were up 1% year-over-year. So we do like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world. And then from an air cargo perspective, we are looking at the growth in the market around 4%. So as we work through the year, we do expect there to be modest improvement.\nWe are forecasting that we will have to take some small market share in our profitable target segment, and we feel really good about the plan as we move forward through the year.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nI'll just add one more point here, just to make sure. We will obviously monitor this demand very, very carefully, and we'll make adjustments as needed. I would just point out on our tremendous execution in fiscal year 2024, where we drove significant bottom line growth despite a lack of any revenue growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you. Good afternoon. So, Raj, lots to digest here, and thanks for all the detail. Maybe just thoughts on the integration of the networks, your early take on how that's proceeding. And I don't know if it's for you, John, or Brie, but your $20 to 22 range, maybe thoughts on what's the upside and downside within that range from the midpoint. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you. Let me start, and then John can weigh in on this. Again, I appreciate the question. We are very pleased, firstly, with the execution and transition to One FedEx, which delivers multiple benefits. Firstly, it's more efficient in reducing overlapping costs. But more importantly, it's much more effective. We are one organization. It makes it also easier for our team members to manage their careers much better. On the Network 2.0, we continue to make significant progress in this regard. As one of the biggest markets, obviously, the one is Canada. In the first half of fiscal year 2025, we'll complete the Canada transition. Then we expect to significantly pick up the pace into FY 2026. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. Hey, Ken, look, on the guidance, as always, we continue to take a very thoughtful and methodical approach. There are a number of factors we've taken into account. As Brie mentioned, we expect a modest improvement in the demand environment in FY2025 and supporting our revenue outlook of a low to mid single-digit percentage increase, as we noted. That'll be driven by improving trends at US domestic parcel and international export. While headwinds remain, and we align those out in our bridge, we continue to focus on aligning our costs across the enterprise with expected volume and are focused on executing on revenue quality strategy. We're going to be focused on DRIVE. I would direct your attention to the right side of that slide, the $2.2 billion of focused on DRIVE and controlling those things within our control.\nAnd that's going to be critical for us to deliver on this guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good afternoon. Maybe if I can just follow up from Ken's question there, Raj, on Network 2.0 and the integration, I think investors are pretty excited about this, but also concerned that there could be network disruption. I mean, if we've just looked across 20 or 30 years of transportation network integration, it always hasn't gone all that well. We can look no further than TNT. So what are you guys doing from a systems perspective and maybe a physical network and facility pickup and delivery linehaul perspective that mitigates some of those risks? And what are the lessons learned thus far?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I'll start first, and then maybe Brie can comment on it. Absolutely, we are making sure that our customer experience actually gets better. And we now have a very rigorous process through DRIVE. The rigor and discipline that we have established on multiple projects that's associated with this is very critical. So we will follow this very carefully and rigorously and make sure that our customer experience gets better as we go through this process.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThe only thing that I would add, Brandon, is when we looked at Network 2.0, is we've given ourselves time. From a pace perspective, we have built in the right cadence so that if we do need to pause, we can. We haven't needed to. I think that's really important. The rigor, the planning, the technology, and the tools that Scott Ray and John have worked. Service is good. And in fact, as I've mentioned previously, this also solves our single pickup feature of service, which has been just a huge opportunity for us as we move forward from small business acquisition. So I feel really good. Service is the strongest in the market at FedEx, FEC, I guess I have to say, moving forward. And I feel really good about the domestic network right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. So or good morning. Good afternoon. Day's going by quickly. Let's see. Wanted to see if you could give, I know you talked a little bit about some of the factors in DRIVE. Wanted to see if you could give a little bit more maybe on Europe. I think some of the cost savings you announced, the headcount reductions come a couple of years out, not in fiscal 2025, or they ramp in 2026 and more so in 2027. Can you give just a little more perspective on the changes in Europe and just how important the $600 million improvement in Europe is to the overall DRIVE? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks. Tom, it's John. Yeah, the $600 million is very important to drive, and it's one of our top priorities. As Raj mentioned, we were all just in Europe last week, meeting with the team, the leadership, not only there to support them, but also to stress the urgency of how important this is. We're looking at every aspect of our operation in Europe. There will be new leadership as well, and we're going to continue to focus not only on the commercial side, but some operational efficiencies, including the network. There's also opportunity now that we're in Network 2.0, full swing of implementation, to leverage the expertise that John Smith and his team bring on the US side, which is where we're very strong, to work in coordination with our team in Europe.\nSomething that's been done in the past, but we're really taking it to the next level. So I think all those things are key, and we're serious about the $600 million, and we'll look forward to updating you on our progress in the other main categories. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, and Tom, the point that John just talked about is very important. I think the biggest opportunity that we have in Europe is the intra-Europe theater, and that is ground-based. We have a significant amount of interaction now between the management teams, and between Walter and Scott Ray, for example, and everyone below that. Also, we have now established KPI dashboards that very much provide real-time visibility on package flows, and to improve service and reduce costs. It's a lot of work going on here. Very excited about what we can make happen.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. John, you pointed to the right side of the bridge again on the $2.2 billion. I think maybe some of the debate is that $2.2 billion gross or net. It feels like you're saying it's both. How much of that is truly in your control, kind of independent of everything else going on in the macro environment and even the yield environment? And I guess the other part of it would be, if the non-peak demand even doesn't play out the way that you've kind of expected it to, are there other kind of variable cost levers to pull, or is this strictly just more of a structural DRIVE cost initiative for fiscal 2025?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure, thanks, Jom. Yeah, the 2.2 is structural in nature. So from our perspective, that is all within our control. And to the extent the macro environment doesn't cooperate, we're going to keep at it. The 2.2 includes projects that are in motion now. And as I've said in prior calls, some of our programs are going to overdeliver, some may underdeliver, but the pipeline is constant. So we're going to adapt aggressively, not only to the plans that are in place, but also to the change in the demand environment as well.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nJohn, look no further than what we did in FY2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi, afternoon. Question. So the low to mid single-digit revenue growth that you talked about for the year, is there a way to think about the blend between the yield and volume? Is it two and two, something along those lines? And then just sort of along those lines, I think you get some color around B2B volumes or demand of up 2% or so. I'm just sort of wondering, with retailers maybe doing more of this just-in-time focus these days, does that sort of play into B2B and fast-cycle logistics companies like FedEx? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, great question, Jordan. So as we think about this year's revenue plan, you will see it be largely volume-driven, and it will be driven from a deferred and an e-commerce perspective. As we have just mentioned, we do think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth. To your point, from a speed perspective, we are actually seeing the speed conversation elevate in the market, especially with what we would consider sort of your tier one or your household brand. From a competition perspective, we're absolutely increasing that conversation. And actually, there is increased demand from a speed perspective within it. So I hope that gives you a little bit more clarity, but we do see volume moving throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So Brie, maybe just to follow up on the demand environment, can you tell us what you expect from peak season and how the planning and integration visibility, I guess more importantly, is going with the major approvals over the prior years, where it's been a little bit harder to get maybe the right information and the right assets in place? And then John, can you just give us any sense, and you don't want to give formal guidance, but any sense in terms of how the DRIVE $2.2 billion will roll out throughout each quarter this year? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. So from a peak season perspective, we had a really phenomenal peak last year. That's going to be hard to top, but if there's a team that can do it, it's John. From a collaboration and an insight, we are actually getting further integrated with our largest retailers. So we have even better information than we have ever had. So from my perspective, I think from an asset and an alignment with capacity, this peak, I can't control the weather, nor can John Smith. He can do a lot of things, but he can't control the weather. But I do feel really good going into peak. And in fact, we have taken all of our peak best practices from the United States, and we are expanding them around the world. We just had an incredible hot sale in Mexico domestic as an example.\nI feel pretty confident about peak season.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBefore John goes, I just want to make sure that in terms of the volume growth, what we're expecting is low single-digit volume growth for the year.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, and with respect, Brian, to your question on DRIVE, the $2.2 billion, we are committed to that. And as I said, a number of plans are already in place. We talked about the $600 million for Europe. The majority of the savings will come from the surface network and our legacy express operations as we're looking to optimize our processes and improve efficiencies there. And G&A, IT, and procurement will be key drivers for the savings. I know you asked about the timing of that, but we look forward to keeping you updated as these plans solidify and as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nFor the investment community, it's very clear to see the potential benefits of separating the Western Truckload business, just looking at multiples and investor favorability there over the last three or four years. What do we miss when looking at the other side of that? What do you lose? What are you thinking about as the offset when you make that decision over the next six or so months? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBascom, as I've said before, I'm not going to comment too much more on this. We have already said historically about what value FedEx is part of the network. We'll do the full analysis. And again, like I said, it's going to be very thorough. And when we have something to talk about, we will definitely communicate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for that, everyone. Just want to confirm that the headcount reductions in Europe, were they part of DRIVE? I mean, given that you're going to see the benefit of that in FY2027, just wondering if that was incremental. And also kind of when you think of the actions you're taking right now, kind of how much of that is commercial, kind of operating, kind of revenue-driven versus actual cost cutting in Europe? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo it's certainly in line with the DRIVE philosophy. Because some of the benefits are going to flow beyond the DRIVE FY2025 period, we haven't included it in that number. It truly is cost takeout. These are non-operational positions. We look forward to keeping you posted.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, guys, and thanks for the time. So Raj, I hate to come back to the same topic again, but when you were with us a few weeks ago here in New York, you were sounding like it was a little bit more of you're moving in the direction anyway of more closely integrating some of the freight stuff with the Tricolor network strategy. So my question for you is really kind of what's changed in the thinking in the last couple of weeks? What's the impetus for the decision to do a review here? And secondly, as you think about what that review will mean, are there any downstream implications for that Tricolor network strategy that we should be thinking about?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation",
    "content2": "Well, David, thank you for the question. As we've heard from several investors and analysts in this regard, and obviously, we take input from our shareholders very, very seriously. And so this is the right time in our national planning calendar. As for Tricolor goals, no changes. We're moving on ahead. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe a question for Brie here. You noted you're pleased by the pricing capture that you've been able to achieve, noted in light of the current pricing environment. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the current pricing environment, from a competitive standpoint or overall rationality? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Stephanie. So from a market perspective, it absolutely is competitive. That's nothing particularly new in this market. So it's competitive, but it's rational. I think our team has been very disciplined. We have absolutely been able to maintain the yield increases that we captured in CY2022 and CY2023 and then built on there. I think it's also really important to note that we're very focused not just on total yield, but getting yield in the right place where we need it. So for example, I think our team is doing the very best in the market at getting peak surcharges. I should have said that when the peak question just came up. The team has done a really good job in getting the increase we need to deliver an amazing peak where we do have to expand capacity.\nThe same goes to rural coverage as well as large packages. So yes, it's competitive, but I think the team is doing a really good job of navigating kind of market share, profit market share growth with getting the right yield for the right package and working really, really closely with the operation. So I'm incredibly pleased.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks. And good afternoon, everyone. Lots of good and interesting stuff happening here. But maybe just switching gears a little bit, we've got some elections coming up. And I'm just curious how big of an issue tariffs have been as part of your customer discussions to date. And maybe more specifically, just given your commentary, Brie, around China e-commerce, you've got a couple of big direct e-com customers. Can you just maybe remind us of how big they are right now as a percentage of your book and what's maybe the risk to volumes here if there is a change in trade policy?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. I'll start with the last question, and then I'll certainly turn it to the boss to talk about the overall tariff situation. So from an e-commerce perspective, yes, e-commerce is the largest driver of intercontinental out of China, but actually around the world, both domestically and internationally. We are really proud of how diversified our revenue base is. Yes, we have a great relationship with all of the major e-commerce players out of China. But the benefit of those customers is that they're really large. And so we can partner with them to find the right solutions, what makes sense for us, as well as what makes sense for them. No one carrier can serve their entire needs. And I think we found a very productive and profitable relationship. And again, I do want to emphasize very diversified base. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd on the broader point here, the trade as a percentage of GDP has essentially flatlined since about 2016. So we've been operating in this environment for some time. Now, it's important to note that the trade patterns are fundamentally shifting. And the good news for FedEx is our network. We are here, there, and everywhere. And we get the intelligence from the market at the ground level. That is, we are a referendum on a global supply chain every single day. And so because of that, we are able to react very quickly, much faster than manufacturing can move. And so the supply chain pattern changes actually works in our favor in many ways because the only companies that have established networks that connect all these countries can actually do these things.\nSo for example, when manufacturing moves to Mexico, we have a significant presence in Mexico and the United States. In fact, our competitor said we are the only one who can say that with conviction. So while we see the overall trade trends flatten out, there are opportunities as supply chain patterns change. And again, our established networks that we have in place and the digital tools that we now have make us very compelling.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Before we wrap, I want to congratulate Rob Carter once again on his upcoming retirement after more than 30 years of dedication and service to FedEx. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Sriram Krishnasamy into his expanded role as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective next week. In closing, I'm extremely proud of our FedEx team for a strong end to a year of incredible performance. Margin expansion and operating profit growth for four consecutive quarters, despite revenue decline in three of those quarters, is a tremendous achievement. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to focus on enhancing our profitability and stockholder returns while providing outstanding service for our customers. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jeni Hollander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJenifer Hollander\n\nHead, IR, Kyndryl Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to 1 question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nCertain statements in this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nToday's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO.\nNow I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Jeni, and welcome to your first earnings call at FedEx. We are happy to have you on board leading the Investor Relations team.\nBefore we discuss the quarter, I would like to congratulate Rob Carter on his upcoming retirement, which we announced last week. He has served as CIO for the last 24 years leading FedEx in modernizing our IT infrastructure. I'm immensely grateful to Rob for his numerous contributions in establishing FedEx as an innovative, data-driven and a people-focused company. We thank him for his dedication and service to FedEx over the years, and wish him well in his upcoming retirement.\nThank you also to the FedEx team for their exceptional work in Q3 by providing superior service for customers and delivering strong results, all while advancing our transformation initiatives.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion in a declining revenue environment. This is a very positive dynamic and a unique one in our industry. It demonstrates clear progress on our transformation and ability to manage what's within our control through DRIVE.\nWe're strengthening our value proposition, improving the customer experience and increasing profitability. This progress supports our long-term goals for sustainable margin expansion, improvements in ROIC and value creation for our stockholders.\nNow turning to the details. Our transformation is driving continued improvements in adjusted operating income, margins and earnings per share. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 16% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin expansion of 90 basis points compared to the prior year, even as revenue declined 2%.\nAdjusted operating income growth was driven by continued strength at Ground and improvement at Express. At the segment level, I'm particularly pleased with the results at Ground, where adjusted operating income increased 14% on 1% revenue growth and adjusted operating margin improved to over 11% in the quarter. This reflects continued progress controlling expenses and effective yield management, including the ramping benefits from DRIVE.\nAt Freight, the team's continued focus on profitable growth and cost management delivered strong margins and mitigated year-over-year volume challenges. Service levels remain exceptionally high, demonstrating our differentiated execution capabilities.\nWe're also making progress at Express, where adjusted operating income increased enabled by our ability to remove structural costs.\nLooking ahead, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our fiscal '24 adjusted EPS range while narrowing the range to $17.25 to $18.25. In fact, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings above the midpoint of the range we shared last June despite full year revenue expectations that have deteriorated significantly over the past 9 months. This is clear evidence of our ability to execute.\nTurning to the Express business. It is my top priority to continue to make the changes necessary to align our air network with an evolving demand environment and unlock the full profit opportunity. While we have made progress at Express this quarter, there are several areas we are aggressively working to address in order to accelerate profit improvement: service mix, network utilization, continued inflation and other cost headwinds.\nFirst, with respect to service mix. We're seeing a clear international market shift towards deferred services. This is tied in part to the rapid growth of many of our e-commerce customers, where we are a critical enabler of global trade, offering unique solutions for our customers. More on how we are addressing this mix shift shortly.\nSecond, weakness in global trade continues to constrain demand in our international business, which has remained challenged for longer than expected. As such, we're continuing to proactively realign our air network to match capacity to demand.\nAnd third, this quarter, Express experienced over $200 million of inflationary pressure on a year-over-year basis. We offset this with benefits from DRIVE as well as responsible head count management. The dynamics I just outlined create significant opportunities for us to improve our network utilization.\nLast quarter, we introduced our Tricolor strategy. Ultimately, this network design will enable us to improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system; put the right product in the right network, taking advantage of our continental surface networks in Europe and our market-leading FedEx Freight LTL network in the United States; and profitably penetrate new market segments at the right cost structure, including the premium air freight market. As we move forward, we are managing the execution of Tricolor with the rigor and discipline of DRIVE, and this will be a key element to our success.\nMoving to another area of opportunity. In Europe, we continue to improve our service levels and focus on commercial execution. However, the B2B environment remains challenged. And in this context, we are making progress on DRIVE on track to generate $600 million of savings in fiscal year '25 and seeking further profit optimization opportunities.\nAs we have mentioned in previous calls, we are also experiencing a continued headwind for the United States Postal Service, which has reduced volume. Despite this volume and revenue drawdown, our service obligations to the USPS remain fixed.\nAt Express, and across the business, DRIVE remains a key enabler of improved profitability, both in the near and the long term as we change the way we work and identify areas for structural cost reductions. In Q3, we delivered $550 million of benefits from DRIVE, offsetting the impact of revenue declines and cost pressures.\nI'm encouraged by the progress across all 3 categories. This includes $290 million in our surface network, $110 million of savings in air network and in international operations and $150 million of G&A. Given the progress we have made year-to-date, we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in permanent cost reduction benefits from DRIVE this fiscal year and are highly confident on the additional $2.2 billion in fiscal year '25.\nThe work we are doing with DRIVE is also helping advance planning for Network 2.0. This quarter, we rolled out our new surface operations leadership structure. Under this new structure, leaders and their teams will be responsible for all Express and Ground package operations and facilities in their respective divisions, regions and districts. This will enhance operational execution and offer greater insights into the package business overall with accountability at all levels.\nMore broadly, we have now implemented Network 2.0 in over 50 locations, with dozens more to follow in calendar 2024, all while maintaining outstanding service. And as a reminder, we will begin the rollout of Canada in April and expect to complete this transition by October of 2024.\nAnd as part of our transformation, we are on track to complete the consolidation of FedEx operating companies into one streamlined and simplified organization, creating efficiencies as we build a stronger, more profitable enterprise. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services will consolidate into Federal Express Corporation.\nThe work we are doing to create a more flexible, efficient and intelligent network is translating into direct improvements in our customer offering and profitability. When severe weather hits, it can cause a domino effect of delays and reduced service levels across our network. While we have always used data and analytics to assess the effect of weather events, our new weather contingency playbook developed by our planning, engineering and data works teams enhances the process by leveraging predictive capabilities to proactively divert storm-bound volumes across our networks.\nBy combining the power of digital insights and predictive analytics with our physical network, we effectively mitigated the impact of the January winter storm that hit our Express hub in Memphis, by shifting Memphis down Express volume to ground our freight at the origin location. Despite this year's event having a longer impact to Memphis operations when compared to the weather event in February 2023, our network recovery was twice as fast.\nThis quarter, we also announced a significant initiative, fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey from demand to returns. It will provide real-time visibility to help our customers optimize and grow their business, leveraging our analytical capabilities and data from the 15 million packages we deliver every day.\nI'm excited to have Sriram Krishnasamy serving as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective July 1. His proven track record of driving optimization and innovation for our business through data and insights, combined with his deep knowledge of the network, will be critical to moving FedEx forward as we become a data-driven, digital-first company.\nAs I look across the business and these financial results, there are clear signs of progress on our transformation. Our strategy is generating results, and we are well placed to maintain our leadership position while delivering improving financial outcomes. Together, we remain focused and committed to our long-term goals, supporting the creation of significant, long-term value for our stockholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank our FedEx team for strong performance during the peak season. As a result of their hard work and commitment, we once again delivered the best service offering in the industry.\nWe continue to execute on our commercial priorities, with a focus on revenue quality while maintaining our industry-leading service. As a result, we took profitable share in the quarter at market rates and we continue to retain the vast majority of the volume we gained from UPS in the second half of 2023.\nOur unmatched value proposition has enabled recent high-value wins in the semiconductor, health care and aerospace industry. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to compete and grow further in the high-margin areas of the market.\nLooking now by geography. In the United States, conditions have been weaker than we anticipated. And internationally, we continue to see softness. We, however, remain very focused on strong commercial execution.\nTaking a look at third quarter revenue performance by segment. At FedEx Ground, revenue was up about 1% year-over-year on a modest yield improvement and flat volumes. Our team remains disciplined on growing with the right customers and mix while offering the best value proposition in the industry.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue declined 3%. While volume decreased compared to last year, the year-over-year decline moderated on a sequential basis. Revenue was also negatively affected by lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in weight per shipment, although the decline was partially offset by higher base yields.\nAnd at FedEx Express, revenue was down 2% year-over-year, driven by continued volume softness, lower fuel and demand surcharges and a mix shift towards deferred and e-commerce products. The actions Raj outlined will allow us to profitably grow this business while continuing to deliver excellent service for our customers.\nTurning to our monthly volume trends during the quarter. Broadly speaking, volumes are stabilizing as we lap weaker demand from a year ago. International export increased 4% in the quarter, driven by a 29% growth in international economy, which, of course, is the market reset we expected. Freight shipments declined, but they continued to moderate sequentially.\nAs Raj mentioned, postal volumes were a headwind in the quarter. Our current contract with the United States Postal Service expires on September 29. We have made significant progress in negotiations for a new contract that aligns with our ongoing network transformation plan while providing the USPS with the operational reliability and outstanding service we have delivered for them for more than 2 decades. A new multiyear agreement would provide a more efficient network with service to fewer markets. It would allow us to better adjust our overall network to demand. We, of course, will let you know when we have an update.\nWe continue to operate in a competitive but rational market environment. During the quarter, yield trends were similar to what we saw last quarter, with dynamics remaining mixed across the segments. At FedEx Express, yields remained pressured due to a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of lower-yielding e-commerce and deferred products. Yield was also pressured by increased capacity in the market.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery, partially offset by ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year. And at FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 1%, driven by lower fuel surcharges and lower weight.\nIn January, we rolled out a 5.9% GRI. And importantly, we've been able to capture a high percentage of that rate increase. During peak, our holiday peak residential surcharges enabled us to respectively offset higher costs, delivering $120 million in profit. We are very confident we have the right strategy in place balancing both volume and yield growth.\nWe are building our network of the future with digital and data-driven solutions that simplify the customer experience and further strengthen our best-in-class customer offerings. For example, earlier this month, we enhanced our health care offering with more powerful capabilities to prioritize critical life-saving health care shipments above other volume within the network.\nHealth care customers now have the ability to select monitoring and intervention service options. They cover categories such as temperature requirements and vaccines, and they do this at the package level. Each Express shipment now includes specific health care identifiers so that if we need to intervene, we are able to do it with more speed and more precision.\nAnd of course, in January, we announced the fdx Commerce platform. fdx connects the entire customer journey by offering end-to-end e-commerce solutions, making it easier for companies to grow demand, increase conversion, optimize fulfillment and streamline their returns. The fdx platform will enable us to enhance our longstanding relationships with merchants of all sizes to help them optimize and grow their business. We have opened a private preview for select brands and retailers. And based on their feedback, I am incredibly excited about the official launch later this year.\nIn closing, I am very proud of our entire global team and how they continue to deliver outstanding service as we navigate a very dynamic market. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover our financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, Brie. Our third quarter results reflect ongoing progress on our DRIVE initiative as well as our continued focus on service and revenue quality. As a result of these efforts, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion for the third quarter in a row despite declining revenue in a challenging market environment.\nTaking a closer look at our performance in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income increased by $192 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points. At Express, adjusted operating income increased by $134 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. The benefits of DRIVE initiatives and an additional operating date more than offset lower revenue.\nAt Ground, the team delivered another quarter of strong results. Adjusted operating income increased by $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points due to cost reductions and yield improvement. Despite slightly lower volumes and in an inflationary environment, ground cost per package was flat year-over-year, with lower line-haul expenses and improved dock productivity offsetting higher first and last mile costs.\nAnd at Freight, while operating margin remained strong, operating income declined by $46 million and operating margin declined by 170 basis points driven by lower fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment and lower shipments. These results also reflect the lapping of a $30 million facility gain last year, partially offset by the benefit of an additional operating day during the quarter. Looking at the quarter overall, weather had an immaterial year-over-year effect on profitability.\nBefore turning to the outlook, I'd like to spend a few moments updating you on our cost reduction initiatives, including DRIVE and more specifically, G&A. As an initial matter, and as part of responsible headcount management, we have reduced our workforce by nearly 22,000 over the last year and expect additional opportunities in the future as we move forward with our transformation.\nWithin G&A, we continue to make significant changes to how we approach areas like procurement and technology so that we are a more efficient, digitally led organization. In addition, global functional alignment provides savings opportunities. I'm pleased that we have achieved $350 million of G&A savings year-to-date, including $150 million in the third quarter.\nTaking a closer look at sourcing and procurement, we've continued to evolve the sourcing and procurement function from a segregated and regional structure to a centralized global organization that will manage most third-party spend across the entire enterprise. With new leaders in place, we're developing new category strategies and have already identified about 20 discrete categories that we'll manage centrally in cooperation with functional leaders.\nBy implementing these new strategies at the enterprise level will have tighter spend oversight, will better leverage our scale and buying power and generate significant cost savings. Overall, I'm very pleased with our enterprise-wide DRIVE progress this quarter and we will deliver $1.8 billion in savings for the full fiscal year.\nNow turning to our fiscal year outlook. And as Raj shared earlier, based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range while narrowing our outlook from the prior range of $17 to $18.50 to $17.25 to $18.25. At the midpoint of the narrowed range, we continue to assume a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue for the full year. As always, we'll closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory restocking, global trade, inflation and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected revenue.\nWith regard to our fourth quarter expectations, as implied by our outlook range, we expect year-over-year profit improvement despite lapping the onset of certain structural benefits executed in last year's fourth quarter at Express and Ground. Looking on a sequential basis, the leap day in the third quarter affects our typical seasonality. At the segment level, we're maintaining our full year expectations for a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express, adjusted margin improvement at Ground and strong but lower year-over-year margin at Freight.\nAt Express, we're looking at every aspect of the business, including taking a fresh look at additional opportunities to improve our European business. And we're confident in our ability to unlock more value at Express and across all our businesses as we continue to seek optimization opportunities.\nOur bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full year outlook. For illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, the equivalent to $17.75 of adjusted EPS, as the midpoint of our narrowed outlook range.\nTo walk the bridge to $6.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming that revenue net of cost increases is up $200 million that we experienced $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges diminished and product mix continues shifting toward deferred, variable compensation increases by $300 million and that these pressures are more than offset by $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from DRIVE. At the midpoint, we would expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to increase approximately 17% despite revenue declining by a low single-digit percentage.\nAs I've discussed on prior calls, we remain focused on reducing our capital intensity and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet prudent capital allocation and improving return on invested capital. Our capital investment priorities will be on improving efficiency, modernizing facilities and optimizing our network.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $1.4 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $4 billion. We now anticipate capital spend of $5.4 billion for the full year, which is down over $700 million from last year and down $300 million from our prior forecast of $5.7 billion. We also continue to expect aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '26. And we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue will keep declining in the future as we reduce our facilities footprint through Network 2.0 and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx beyond fiscal year '26.\nWe currently have 37 jet aircraft parked, which is up from 20% last quarter. And as previously communicated, we will retire 9 more MD-11s in Q4.\nConsistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction in the third quarter bringing our total share repurchases for the first 9 months of the fiscal year to $2 billion, and we expect to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock in the fourth quarter bringing total fiscal year '24 repurchases to $2.5 billion, while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan.\nI'm also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which augments the $600 million that remains available for repurchase under the $5 billion 2021 authorization. This reinforces our commitment to support long-term stockholder returns.\nOverall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in continuing to improve profitability in a challenging revenue environment. We have more work to do, but I'm encouraged by the commitment and focus I've seen from our teams to advance our transformation and provide our customers and stockholders with even greater value.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

Let me begin by thanking the FedEx team for their commitment to delivering yet another -- FedEx has the best service offerings in the industry. This includes the most expansive global network and the fastest U.S. Ground service with -- broadest weakened residential coverage. Strong service and speed are also coming with a more aggressive peak transit compared to this time last year with a Ground time in transit in the U.S. at [ one ] incredibly proud of the team's ability to sustain superior service levels while we continue to transform our global network.\nOur second quarter performance reflects clear signs of progress in our transformation in what remains a difficult demand environment. We are moving at speed and agility to deliver on Drive, which is supporting improved profitability and enabling us to maintain our earnings outlook for the year even as our revenue expectations have moderated further.\nYou can see in our results in Slide 6, our transformation is driving improved profitability. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 17% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin improvement of 110 basis points compared to the prior year even as the total revenue declined 3%. These results reflect benefits by a continued focus on revenue and meaningful differentiation across our products and services as we build the world's smartest logistics network. Our focused execution enabled us to retain a majority the high-quality volume we won over the summer from UPS and as a result of the Yellow [ shut ].\nAt the segment level, Ground continued to deliver outstanding results with adjusting operating income of 57% and adjusted margin expansion of 370 basis points. This was driven in part by revenue growth due to higher yield and volume combined with solid operational performance.\nFreight delivered strong performance as well driving double-digit profit improvement and margin expansion of over 270 basis points compared to the prior year. Express total revenue declined due to both volume and yield pressures. These headwinds more than offset continued benefits will drive and led to a margin decline compared to the prior year. There's more work to do at Express, whereas [ are density ]. We continue to make progress at Express to unlock the value that exists across this business.\nTurning to Slide 7. In Drive continues to fundamentally change the way we work. The impact of Drive is clear as our lower cost structure enables improved profitability. Let's look at the powerful chart on the left-hand side of the slide, if you look across market cycles over the last 15 years, we have now delivered 2 consecutive quarters of operating income growth against declining revenues. When you step back and review how our business has performed in environments with suppressed demand, we are delivering much better profitability today than we have historically.\nIn the quarter, we reduced cost by approximately $200 million in our surface network, including our U.S. Express operations. This was driven by shifting to a single daily career dispatch applying dock product initiatives, consolidating underutilized sorts and maximizing the use of rail. Across our air network and international operations, our Drive initiatives are helping offset pressures with about $115 million in total cost reductions in Q2, primarily driven by structural flight takedowns.\nAnd in G&A, we're making significant changes to how we approach procurement and functional. In the second quarter, we realized over $100 million in savings driven by reducing the use of temporary labor, leveraging the scale of the enterprise to negotiate favorable surface transportation rates, optimizing certain benefit programs and lowering headcount. Given our progress, we are highly confident that we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in cost reduction effects from Drive this fiscal year.\nTurning to Slide 8. Despite progress on Drive, profitability at FedEx Express was pressured by an ongoing volume mix shift and related yield headwinds. Our ability to drive margin improvement in the near term has been constrained by transitory factors, including the year-over-year decline in the U.S. postal service volume, combined with minimum required service obligations associated with our current USPS contract. And also the timing of the structural redesign of our air network.\nHistorically, our unmatched global air network was primarily built on a hub and spoke system to support speed and global connectivity. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and as volume mix shift to deferred, we recognize the need to reconfigure our network to focus on both speed and density. This fundamental network redesign, which we call Tricolor design, is moments in our history and includes several key elements.\nFirst, we will deploy what we call our, Purple tail fleet which is our FedEx owned assets time for delivering high priority, high-margin volumes using the existing hub and spoke model. This is our Purple network which will be the backbone of our International Priority Parcel business.\nSecond, we will retime a portion of our Purple tail flights for what we call our Orange network which will operate off cycle. This change will give us time to build density, decongest our hubs during the precious night sort and feed into our surface networks including our international road network as well as FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight in the U.S. This provides us a differentiated capability to drive profitable, less capital-intensive growth, a sizable global deferred parcel and air freight markets. And third, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes. This is our white network.\nThese changes will improve utilization of our assets, increase margins and enhance ROIC. The air network redesign is a critical piece of our Drive execution at Express and will support the realization of our targeted $4 billion of total Drive savings in fiscal year 2025. We're approaching this network in a deliberately measured manner to ensure we continue to provide our customers with the best service levels in the industry.\nSimultaneously, as you know, we're executing Network 2.0. Taken together, these efforts improve our ability to protect profitability and returns through various market environments. Big picture, we're making clear progress on our transformation and drive is having a real impact. Additionally, our team is advancing efforts to combine the strength of our physical transportation network with our digital and data-driven solutions. We are leveraging our world-class engineering skill base to deliver cost-effective cutting-edge capabilities globally.\nEarlier this month, we opened our first advanced capability community or ACC, in Hyderabad, India. Which will serve as a hub for our technological and digital innovation. I'm truly excited about the opening of the ACC and the vast opportunity to use digital to run our business better, enhance our customer experience and generate new profitable revenue streams.\nOverall, I'm confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to create significant stockholder value. In these last few months and weeks, our team's dedication to the Purple Promise has been tremendous. And I would like to express my sincere thanks to our colleagues. This performance has put FedEx in good portion as we enter the full structure peak and deliver the best service offerings in the industry.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue quality and industry-leading service remains top priorities for us in the quarter. Our ability to retain the majority of the business we won from both UPS and Yellow is a testament to the team's hard work and our value proposition, which is the best service offering in the industry. And as a result, we are gaining parcel share here in the United States and around the world.\nLooking at the U.S., market conditions remain soft, with Q2 demand lower than we anticipated. The Indus now experienced 10 consecutive quarters of decline in U.S. domestic average daily volume. Additionally, international market pressure continued. Despite this pressure, our Europe and EMEA teams did a great job of growing parcel volume.\nLet's now look at each segment. At FedEx Ground, second quarter revenue was up 3% year-over-year, driven by higher yield and volume. We remain focused on growing our business with the right customer and service mix to improve profitability and maintain our position as the price leader in a domestic market segment. At FedEx Freight, new customers that came over as a result of the Yellow shutdown are enjoying a better value prop and we have retained a majority of this volume. Freight results showcase our disciplined focus on revenue quality as we gained share amid the industry disruptions. The market was down and revenue declined 4% as lower shipments offset an increase in yield. But on a sequential basis, our revenue decline moderated significantly as volume pressure lessened and revenue per shipment inflected positively.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 6% year-over-year, driven by market contraction and lower fuel and demand surcharges. Global Freight pounds were down 18% year-over-year, driven by lower postal service volume as well as the weakness in industrial production. Despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by the progress in areas we can control. For example, the improvement in European service levels enabled profitable share gains. With less than 1 week to Christmas, our focus remains on delivering outstanding service. Our networks are running extremely well, and we are receiving very positive customer feedback this peak. We are delivering this excellent service while creating new value for customers and driving customer acquisition.\nThis holiday season, we estimate over 365 million packages will be delivered with a picture showing proof of delivery, CPOD as we call it. It's a great new feature that has helped us win new customers. CPOD and other digital tools such as estimated delivery time window and FedEx Delivery Manager provide customers with peace of mind when it comes to holiday shipments. Overall, this year's peak season has been relatively similar to last year, and it's in line with our expectations. But looking ahead, we're ready to support our customers for post-holiday returns. Our robust returns portfolio is well positioned to handle the returns that inevitably follow peak. Our portfolio includes both a prelabeled and a no label no-box solution that creates convenient, seamless experiences for retailers and for consumers.\nNow taking a step back to look at monthly volumes during the quarter. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we gained parcel share in both the United States and in international markets. This is a clear indication of our winning value proposition in a contracting market. Volumes have continued to improve sequentially with ground and international export maintaining last quarter's trend of growth on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to Slide 14. Overall, the market is competitive but rational. And we are committed to delivering on our revenue quality strategy. During the quarter, yield trends improved slightly, but the dynamics were mixed across the segments. At FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery and commercial Ground offset by Ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment increased 1%, with base rates strong despite lower surcharges and weights. At FedEx Express, yield was pressured due to lower fuel and demand surcharges. Shift towards e-commerce and the reopening of our international economy service in EMEA also pressure yield. We continue to focus on our revenue quality strategy. Earlier this month, we raised U.S. Express and Ground fuel surcharges by 1% and international Express fuel surcharges by 1.5%.\nLooking ahead, we expect a high capture rate from our 5.9% general rate increase. We will reset our delivery area surcharges consistent with our usual practice. As we've shared previously, we are also resetting our approach to dimensional pricing for international shipments. This is moving from a shipment to a per piece dimensional pricing, which is the global market practice. We are confident in our strategy, and we are balancing both volume and growth.\nMoving now to Slide 15. Raj mentioned our focus on digital and efforts to identify new revenue streams. I am particularly excited about our new tracking API that we will launch in early 2024. Our tracking API is for both e-commerce shippers and platform, providing them with best-in-class visibility for their customers, including a picture proof of delivery. This new for offering is a significant enhancement for our retail customers as well as for those third-party e-commerce platforms that rely on our data as an integral part of their value proposition. This is just one example of how we're thinking about our digital capabilities to better serve our customers and generate profitable incremental revenue for FedEx.\nIn closing, I want to thank our entire global team for how they are executing around the world to deliver an absolutely positively outstanding peak season.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it to John to discuss the financials.\n\nJohn W. Dietrich\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on Slide 17. Despite a revenue decline, the FedEx team delivered improved profitability with strong adjusted operating margin growth driven by a continued focus on revenue quality and execution of the company's drive initiatives.\nTaking a closer look at our segment performance in the quarter, starting with Ground. The team continues to deliver strong results. Adjusted operating income increased 57% due to yield improvement, cost reductions and higher volumes. Cost per package -- by 2% driven by lower linehaul expense and improved first and last mile productivity.\nAt Freight, operating income increased 11% during the quarter, driven by higher yield and increased efficiency, partially offset by lower shipments. The team continues to focus on improving profitability while navigating this lower demand environment -- and profitability was pressured as impacts of softening demand on revenue were only partially offset by structural and volume-related cost improvements. Adjusted operating income at Express declined 49% during the quarter on a decline in revenue. As Raj mentioned, we have more work to do at Express, and I'm confident that the structural redesign of our network and other drive initiatives once complete, will make us more resilient in future periods of demand weakness.\nNow turning to our fiscal year outlook. Based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EPS in the range of $17 to $18.50. At this midpoint of the range, we're now assuming a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue. This is lower than our previous assumption of flat revenue growth. Reformation of our earnings outlook despite the weaker demand environment reflects the continued benefits of our transformation. We'll continue to closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory risking, inflation and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected performance.\nWith regard to our third quarter expectations, as we've shared previously, we anticipate our typical seasonality, which implies a lighter quarter sequentially for earnings. We're also facing a higher comp at Ground given our exceptionally strong operating income performance during the third quarter year. At the enterprise level, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted margin expansion in FY '24.\nAt the segment level, we continue to expect adjusted margin improvement in FY '24 Ground. We also continue to expect freight margin to remain strong in FY '24, but lower than FY '23, given volume reductions in yield -- we now anticipate a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express.\nTurning to Slide 19. And consistent with previous quarters, we're providing a bridge to share how we're thinking about operating profit considerations embedded in our full year outlook.\nFor illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion equivalent to the adjusted EPS midpoint of $17.75. As a reminder, and while our revenue performance will vary based on market trends, we are committed to delivering the $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from our Drive initiatives. Importantly, while this bridge remains the same as what we showed you in the first quarter, the composition of the second bar showing revenue net of cost increases has changed significantly. We now forecast materially lower revenue but expect to achieve the same net profit impact of $500 million at the midpoint as we proactively manage volume-related expenses and revenue quality in this difficult demand environment.\nNow moving to Slide 20. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation, improved return on invested capital, all while providing increased shareholder returns. Our liquidity position remains strong, ending the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.3 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $2.6 billion. And we continue to expect to achieve our target of less than 6.5% CapEx to revenue for the year. As we previously stated, our capital expenditures will decline as we continue to reduce capital intensity by reducing facility and other capacity investment and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx. We still anticipate aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '26.\nConsistent with our capital return priority, we completed another $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction in the quarter. This brings our total share repurchases for the first 6 months of the fiscal year to $1 billion and $2.5 billion over the last 18 months. Looking ahead, we expect to repurchase an additional $1 billion in common stock this fiscal year while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan.\nBefore we turn to Q&A, I just wanted to comment that now that I'm nearly 5 months into my new role as CFO, I'm even more excited about our strategy. Let's focus on execution and the opportunity ahead to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank all our team members for their continued efforts and focus on our common goals.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of Investor Relations, FedEx\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Q1 earnings release, Form 10-Q, and Statbook are on our website at fedx.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about one year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the investor relations portion of our website at fedx.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I turn the call over to Raj, I wanted to let everyone know that I'm retiring from FedEx at the end of October. It has been a privilege being a longtime part of the FedEx team. I truly believe that FedEx's best days are ahead, but I will be cheering from the sidelines as I am 67 years old, and I want to spend more time with my family. With that, I will now turn it over to Raj for him to share his views on the quarter.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon. I would like to first congratulate Mickey on his upcoming retirement. He has led our investor relations team for nearly 18 years, spanning 70 earnings calls and, after tomorrow, 18 annual meetings. He will be missed by all, and especially this audience, and we thank him for his outstanding service to FedEx over the years. Let me also take this opportunity to welcome John Dietrich, our Chief Financial Officer for FedEx. With more than 30 years of experience in the aviation and air cargo industries, John brings a unique blend of financial and operational expertise to our leadership team at a very important time for this company. He's already hit the ground running, and I'm very happy that he has joined FedEx.\nSo now, turning to the quarter, we entered Fiscal Year 2024 with strength and momentum, delivering results ahead of expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. I'm proud of what the FedEx team has accomplished over the last 12 months. Amid significant demand disruption, we delivered on what we said we would do, driving over $2 billion in year-over-year cost savings in Fiscal 2023. We are now well advanced in executing on that transformation to be the most efficient, flexible, and intelligent global network. Our Q1 progress gives me great conviction in our ability to execute going forward. We came into the quarter determined to provide excellent service to our customers despite the industry dynamics. We achieved that goal while delivering innovative and data-driven solutions that further enhance the customer experience. As a result, we are well positioned as we prepare for the peak season.\nAs you can see in our results on slide six, our transformation is enhancing our profitability. Ground was a bright spot with higher revenue year-over-year driven by higher yield. On top of this growth, Ground drove exceptional operational performance, leading to its most profitable quarter ever on an adjusted basis. As expected, total revenue declined as volumes and yields were pressured at Express and Freight. We indicated last quarter that Express revenue would be adversely impacted by international export yield pressure, as well as a change in strategy by the US Postal Service, which we are addressing through DRIVE as we build a more nimble airline. For the total company, we delivered 200 basis points of adjusted margin improvement as we realized efficiencies across our networks. This performance is a testament to the power of DRIVE and the FedEx team working collaboratively to implement structural cost reductions throughout the enterprise.\nDuring the quarter, labor negotiations at our primary competitor and the bankruptcy of Yellow disrupted the market. Our priorities were clear: protect our customers, deliver outstanding service, and focus on high-quality revenue. We delivered on those priorities, leveraging our flexible network to profitably add volume while maintaining the highest levels of service. While we captured upside as a result of these one-time events, we were highly discerning in terms of the business we accepted, in keeping with our goal to drive high-quality revenue. Importantly, we expect to maintain the majority of the volume we added in the quarter. I want to thank our FedEx team for deftly navigating these conditions to execute on our disciplined strategy. Now, turning to DRIVE, we are fundamentally changing the way we work.\nDRIVE is taking cost out of our network, and we are on track to deliver our targeted $1.8 billion in structural benefits from DRIVE this fiscal year. At Ground, our DRIVE initiatives reduced costs by $130 million this quarter. These savings were primarily driven by lower third-party transportation rates as a result of a newly implemented purchase bid system, as well as optimized rail usage, the continued benefit from reduced Sunday coverage, and the consolidation of sorts. At Freight, we continue to manage our cost base more effectively. For example, during the quarter, Freight completed the planned closure of 29 terminal locations during August. And at Express, despite headwinds from Asia yields and the US Postal Service, we delivered on our plan. We're making our global network more efficient primarily through structural flight takedowns and efficiencies at our hubs and sorts as we right-size the capacity across the network.\nIn Europe, DRIVE initiatives are on track, and we expect them to gain further traction over the course of the year and into FY 2025. Looking ahead, we're excited to leverage John's aviation experience as we continue to transform our air network. Our DRIVE expectations for this year include the G&A savings we have previously outlined, which we believe will start to ramp in the second half of this fiscal year. Finally, on slide eight, I'll provide a brief update on our key strategic focus areas as we move into the next phase of our transformation. This includes OneFedEx, which is how we are better aligning our organization to enable Network 2.0. We are well underway with plans to simplify our organization. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services will consolidate into one company, Federal Express Corporation.\nThe reorganization will reduce and optimize overhead, streamline our go-to-market capabilities, and improve the customer experience. To date, we have implemented or announced Network 2.0 in several markets, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada. As each market is different, we're continuously learning and tailoring the network to adapt to the operational characteristics unique to each region while delivering the highest quality service for our customers. We'll continue to use both employee couriers and service providers for pickup and delivery operations across the network. As with any significant transformation, these changes are being thoughtfully executed and will take time to complete. The network that FedEx has built over the last 50 years provides us a foundation that is unmatched. This physical network enables us to transport millions of packages a day around the world, generating terabytes of data that contain invaluable insights about the global supply chain.\nWe are focused on harnessing the power of this rich data to make supply chains smarter for everyone, for our customers, for our customers' customers, and for ourselves. As we move to the next phase of our transformation, I've given the team three specific challenges: to use data to make our network more efficient, make our customer experiences better, and drive new profitable revenue streams through digital. Looking ahead to the rest of FY 2024, we remain focused on delivering the highest quality service and aggressively managing what is within our control. Factoring in better-than-expected Q1 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS outlook range. As we continue to deliver on our commitments, I'm confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to create significant value. With that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q1, we remained focused on revenue quality and being a valued partner to our customers. We did this in an operating environment marked by continued but moderating volume pressure, mixed yield dynamics, and unique developments in the competitive landscape. Let's take each segment in turn. At FedEx Ground, Q1 revenue was up 3% year-over-year, driven by a 1% increase in volume and 3% increase in yield. Revenue at FedEx Express was down 9% year-over-year. Volume remained pressured, though total Express volume declines moderated sequentially. International export package volumes were up 3% year-over-year. Similar to Q4, parcel volume declines were most pronounced in the United States. Additionally, US freight pounds were down 27%, continuing the trend we mentioned last quarter tied to the change in strategy by the United States Postal Service.\nAcross Ground and Express, volumes improved sequentially, aided by the threat of a strike at our primary competitor. We onboarded new customers who valued our service and were committed to a long-term partnership with FedEx. As a result, we added approximately 400,000 in average daily volume by the end of Q1, and the team did an excellent job focusing on commercial ground business acquisition. At FedEx Freight, revenue was down 16%, driven by a 13% decline in volume. We experienced significant improvement in volume in August due to Yellow's closure. Freight benefited from approximately 5,000 incremental average daily shipments at attractive rates as we exited the quarter. As you can see on slide 11, monthly volumes have improved sequentially, with Ground and international export volumes inflecting positively on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue benefiting from this quarter's market share gains throughout the fiscal year.\nWe anticipate improved year-over-year growth rates, especially late in the fiscal year, albeit within a muted demand environment. The yield trends we shared last quarter persisted, particularly at FedEx Express, where we saw reduced fuel and demand surcharges year-over-year. Product mix shifts, including an increase in e-commerce volume, and demand for our international economy service after the May reopening in EMEA, also put pressure on yield growth. At FedEx Ground, we saw better-than-expected yields as a result of higher weight per package and product mix. At FedEx Freight, base rates were strong despite lower weights. The revenue per shipment year-over-year decline was due to lower fuel surcharges. Now, looking ahead to peak, we recently announced demand surcharges for the holiday shipping season to stay well-positioned relative to market. We also announced a 5.9% general rate increase effective this coming January.\nThis average annual increase, one point below last year's rate, reflects the current costs and market environment, along with the investment we need to serve customers effectively. We had a high capture rate for our GRI in FY 2023 and believe this year's increase will ensure that continues. We continue to find new revenue quality opportunities. In 2024, we will implement technology changes to increase our capture of package dimensions in several markets outside of the United States. Further, we are updating our dimensional pricing to market practice in Europe, moving from per shipment to a per piece strategy. Moving to slide 13, I was very pleased with our service levels around the world. I'm proud of how our team delivered here in the United States as we added volume late in the quarter. We are also building momentum in Europe. We improved service year-over-year in the region.\nAs a result, the Europe team was able to win back market share that we lost due to previous service challenges. There's still work to do, but our service improvements are also leading to better financial performance in Europe, with much more to come. As Raj stated, we have a vision to make supply chains smarter for everyone. I have a few examples of how our digital infrastructure is enabling new capabilities for our customers. We are improving the customer experience through technology with recent investment in Salesforce Data Cloud. We will integrate three customer platforms: customer service, marketing, and sales into one, giving the customer a more informed, efficient, and personalized experience when doing business with FedEx. We are now offering our estimated delivery time window, which provides customers with a four-hour window for their package delivery for 96% of inbound volume globally across 48 countries.\nThis growing capability is nicely complemented by Picture Proof of Delivery, or as we like to say, PPOD, which has expanded across Europe in the Q1. Now available in 53 markets, PPOD provides shippers with increased confidence in package delivery and helps reduce the volume of customer calls and claims. OneFedEx and Network 2.0 will simplify how we do business, which is particularly important for our small and medium customers. For example, our current customer contracts reflect three independent companies. OneFedEx will enable us to change that, making doing business with FedEx and becoming a new customer easier. Network 2.0 will be more efficient for FedEx, but also more efficient for our customers. When we integrate a market with one truck in one neighborhood, that's not just for deliveries. It also means a streamlined pickup experience: one pickup per day versus two.\nThis is a simple but very impactful change, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Small and medium businesses are a high-value growth segment, and we are confident that the improvements underway will further enable share gains. Lastly, we've expanded MyFedEx Rewards beyond the United States into nearly 30 other countries, with nine more European countries to launch later this year. MyFedEx Rewards is the only loyalty program in the industry and benefits our customers by providing them with rewards they can invest back into their business. They can use them to recognize their employees for a job well done or give back to their communities. MyFedEx Rewards has been a successful program in the United States, and we've built lasting relationships as we continue to invest in our customers. We are excited about the potential to replicate this success in Europe and around the world.\nStriving to anticipate customers' needs and provide them with superior service is deeply embedded in our FedEx culture. I'm proud of how our teams work together to support our current customers, build relationships with new ones, and ensure that FedEx was positioned to succeed during the quarter. Now, I will turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to be here. It's been a full sprint these last few weeks as I continue to get up to speed with this great company. As some of you may know, I've done business with FedEx throughout my career. Through that experience, I've always admired how FedEx literally created a new industry and has built a differentiated network that serves customers all over the world. I've also admired its great culture that has thrived through the People, Service, Profit, or PSP philosophy. After only being here a few short weeks, I've seen the incredible opportunity we have before us. Not only will we continue to provide our customers with the best service and product offerings, but our plans to bring our businesses together through OneFedEx and execute on DRIVE and Network 2.0 initiatives will be truly transformative.\nThese initiatives will leverage and optimize everything that the talented teams across FedEx have built over the last 50 years. It will make us smarter, it will make us more efficient, and it will enable us to serve our customers better. Before getting into the numbers, I want to share a brief overview of the priorities that will guide me and the finance organization as we move forward. First and foremost, I'm committed to setting stringent financial goals that reflect the significant opportunity we have to improve margins and returns. This will be enabled by the Drive initiatives and the integration of Network 2.0 as we move towards OneFedEx. I've been really impressed by the tremendous amount of work already completed on DRIVE from the initiatives in place, the accountability embedded in the program, and the team's steadfast focus on execution.\nIn terms of our capital priorities, I'll focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders, and reinvesting in the business with a focus on the highest returns. Our finance organization will partner closely with Raj and the leadership team to ensure we deliver consistent progress towards these priorities with the goal of delivering significant value for our employees, partners, customers, and shareholders in the years to come. Finally, a guiding principle for me will be to have open and transparent communication with all key stakeholders, including all of you in the financial community. I already know some of you from my prior roles. I look forward to continuing to work together and engaging with the rest of you in the weeks and months ahead.\nNow, taking a closer look at our results, our Fiscal Year 2024 is off to an outstanding start, as demonstrated by the strong operational execution in Q1. At FedEx Ground, DRIVE initiatives are taking hold, and we delivered the most profitable quarter in our history for that segment on an adjusted basis. Adjusted operating income at Ground was up 61%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 480 basis points to 13.3%. These strong results were driven by yield improvement and cost reductions, including lower linehaul expense and improved first and last-mile productivity. As a result, cost per package was down more than 2%. At FedEx Express, the business was able to improve operating income despite a decline in revenue. This further demonstrates that DRIVE is working. Adjusted operating income at Express was up 14%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 2.1%.\nCost reductions and transformation efforts at FedEx Express included structural flight reductions, alignment of staffing with volume levels, parking aircraft, and shifting to one delivery wave per day in the US, all of which more than offsets the impact of lower revenue. It's important to note that expanding operating margins and reducing costs at Express will be a key focus for me and the team. At FedEx Freight, the team diligently managed costs and revenue quality amid a dynamic volume environment. Operating margin declined 290 basis points based on lower fuel surcharges and shipments, but remained strong at 21%. Now, turning to our fiscal year outlook on slide 17. As we've been discussing, we're beginning to see the benefits of our DRIVE initiatives and our focus on improved revenue quality.\nBased on our solid first quarter performance and our view of the rest of the year, we're raising the low end of our full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.50. We're now expecting adjusted EPS in the range of $17 to 18.50. We're confident we can deliver on this higher earnings outlook despite the constrained demand environment. We're now assuming revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint of our Fiscal Year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook range. Of course, an improvement in demand would translate into greater operating leverage and earnings upside, supporting the high end of our range. We'll be closely monitoring the demand environment going forward, including economic activity in North America, Europe, and Trans-Pacific trade. We'll also be keeping a close watch on other key factors that impact the demand environment, including inventory restocking, inflation, and e-commerce trends.\nTurning to slide 18, and consistent with last quarter, we want to share how we're thinking about the operating profit considerations embedded in our full-year outlook. For illustration purposes, we used adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, which is the equivalent of the adjusted EPS midpoint of $17.75. Within this outlook, we're highlighting a few key assumptions. Revenue net of cost increases is now expected to be up $500 million due to improved revenue quality and flow-through at Ground. We continue to expect approximately $800 million of international export yield pressure as demand surcharges significantly diminish and service mix continues shifting towards deferred offerings. As a result of our strong first quarter performance, we're also planning for a $600 million increase in variable compensation.\nThese headwinds are more than offset by the $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from our DRIVE initiatives, which we shared with you last quarter and are on track to achieve. Moving on to slide 19. We remain steadfast in our commitment to prudent capital allocation and shareholder returns. Our liquidity position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.3 billion, and we continue to expect to achieve our target of less than 6.5% CapEx to revenue for the year. Our capital expenditures at Ground will decline as we reduce capacity investment, and we're planning for lower annual aircraft CapEx over time, which we expect to be approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2026. As we've previously communicated, we're standing behind our commitment to capital discipline by tying executive compensation to ROIC.\nGiven improved earnings, we're generating significant and improved cash flow. This is supporting our ability to enhance shareholder returns, demonstrated by the completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in common stock this fiscal year, while we're also paying our dividend. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question at this time. We will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Thank you. The first question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie, if I can ask you a question, you've had a major competitor that's really been very disciplined on price over the last few years, but now, after some of the disruptions that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it seems like they may be more aggressive on price to win back volume. How does that change the way you think about strategy, both as it relates to share and pricing, not just for this year, but kind of for the two- to three-year time period?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Jon. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things that I would like to comment on. I think the first and foremost is the pricing market has been very rational for the last several years. I think it's also important to remember that we are the price leader in every market segment in the domestic market. We actually lead on price, and that's because we have the better value proposition. We've got seven days a week, so we've got Picture POD, and we've got the faster network. So as I think about responding to the current competitive pressure, my job is to make it very difficult for our primary competitor to win back that share. The team has done an outstanding job of onboarding the business that we won in the last quarter, and we had some time to prepare for it.\nSo the executive team has been out. We've met with a lot of these new customers. They're happy. Service is good. And that's really what I'm focused on right now, is delivering just awesome service. And so they want to stay with FedEx because they're the better provider.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Brie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. And first, John, congrats to you on your new role with FedEx, and Mickey, congratulations on your great career. So I guess I would like to maybe dig into the revenue guidance for a moment in terms of what's changing there. It feels like the macro assumptions are perhaps a bit weaker, but we have some competitive dynamics both in Freight and at Ground that are helping. Could you maybe kind of help us understand a little bit, Brie, in terms of what's changing to your macro outlook? And it seems like you're a bit more conservative there.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, absolutely. Fair question. So as I just mentioned, we really did feel good about how we executed within the quarter, but the macro did not help. As we're thinking about the domestic market specifically from a parcel perspective, if you look at calendar year 2023, total volume for the whole year will be down about 0.5% for the total year. That's a little bit lower than we anticipated the full year. So we have adjusted. Like I said, the market's not helping, so we really have to work hard to kind of grow the yield, and the team's doing a great job. When we get to international, again, the team executed. They took share in Europe, but when I look at the macro, a couple of things. Trade is growing at a 1.7%. That's down versus 2.2% the previous year.\nAs we look at inventories, they're in a pretty good place in that from a retailer's perspective, I think the retailers have done a good job. They're not carrying a lot of extra inventory. Wholesalers are, but the net takeaway is that inventory restocking is not going to help us. And then if you look at capacity, from a PACS perspective, Transatlantic PACS capacity is back. And while it's not that coming out of Asia, total capacity is back to pre-COVID levels. So we don't see inventories helping. We don't see trade giving as a huge boost, and so we're going to work really hard to execute. That being said, I think it's really important to note that this revised sort of demand outlook is already reflected in the range. And so despite the fact that the macro is a little bit softer, we raised the midpoint. So really good.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Jack, let me just add on to the last point that Brie just mentioned. That's really important as we, even despite the fact that we have lower revenue expectations, we actually raised the bottom line. This is the sign of our DRIVE execution working. Last time on the call, I gave you all a simple formula of one, two, three. 1% revenue growth at the bottom of the range and 3% at the top of the range. Well, I can now say it's minus 1, 0, 1. It's not quite as catchy as one, two, three, but in fact, it's better performance. Thank you for the question, Jack.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Congratulations on the good results, particularly in Ground, a very impressive margin performance. I wanted to ask you about how we think about that Ground margin going forward and what happens if the volume side is a little bit softer. We would think that some volume probably came over from diversion, maybe from UPS. Kind of how much was that a factor in driving this Ground margin performance? If you lose a little momentum on volume, should we still expect a lot of momentum on that Ground margin? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. Hi, Tom. This is John. Thanks for that question. Yeah, look, we've demonstrated substantial improvement in year-over-year margins in Q1, and we anticipate continued improvement in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. Also, we're focusing on revenue quality, which resulted in solid yields in Q1, up 6% year-over-year, excluding fuel surcharges, which also helped boost margins. I think the team's doing a great job identifying those opportunities with the best revenue quality, and we'll continue to do so. And as Brie mentioned, we got this business and we want to keep it. So thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks. Just curious, can you talk a little bit more about DRIVE? You sort of talked about some of the things that you've worked on this quarter, but can you maybe tease up what we could expect upcoming quarters or two, whether it be cost saves, aggregate cost saves expected in Q2, and maybe some of the targeted areas in Ground and Express from here, what we could look forward to? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Jordan. Let me start off, and then I will turn it to John for additional color here. I am just delighted with the way we are executing against Drive. It's not any one thing, and there's a series of initiatives. It's changing the way we are working inside this company with a lot of rigor, a lot of accountability, and a lot of measurement. In fact, last week, we had an internal DRIVE meeting with all the stakeholders.\nI have not seen a much energetic conversation and with real numbers. So that's one of the, if you look at Q1, obviously, we got some benefit from the competitive activity, but the bigger issue is really the execution of DRIVE, which we expect to continue to perform as we go forward. So momentum that we have in Q1 gives me a lot of confidence. So let me give it to John to give some more color on that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. I echo everything that you said. As I said in my remarks, one of the things I'm most impressed with is the rigor around this program, the accountability, and the project plans. It's really extraordinary to see that come together such that we're really confident in our reaching our goal of the $1.8 billion for the year. To Raj's point, it's coming from everywhere in the organization. One of the examples we used was the example of Ground. I think it was the $130 million we referenced. The reason I referenced that, not only because of the significant savings, because it also adopted some technology tools, which helped us, and our bidding system, which allowed us to capture more revenue on a more efficient basis with bidding systems. So it's a combination of everything: operational execution, leveraging technology, and going after the market. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. I'm in a car. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. John, any color on how much of the $1 billion in DRIVE you've gotten so far? And then I know you said Ground margins would continue to improve year-over-year in Q2. Any thoughts on sequential margins of Ground and just across the rest of the business for Q2? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. And good to talk to you again. Yeah, with regard to DRIVE, we're at $1.8 billion. We expect it to be reasonably spread out fairly evenly through the year. We had an exceptional Q1. We're expecting that to continue to ratchet up in Q2, maybe a slightly heavily loaded in the back half of the year as some of these programs get their traction and start to show the results through the year. So again, I'm not going to sit here and say there's any dramatic changes for any one quarter. It's fairly evenly spread.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, John, just to follow up on that, I guess, can you outline what the savings were realized from DRIVE in the other segments, Freight and Express? I know you outlined the Ground, the $130 million there. That would be helpful. And I just wanted to sort of think about the guidance a little bit bigger picture. So it sounds like you want to hold on to or expect to hold on to a big piece of the 400,000 packages per day that you captured from a competitive standpoint. But can you walk us through the puts and takes of the guidance of what you're adding in at Yellow and maybe UPS into that, and then maybe some of the macro there to help kind of bridge from where you were before to kind of move in that midpoint up a little bit?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. With regard to DRIVE first, it really is coming from every aspect of the organization. We highlighted Ground, but for some of the flight restructurings, for example, I think Express is doing a nice job there as well, taking down aircraft as well as revised flight schedules. And that will be a continued focus for me. I'm not going to be listing by group exactly specifically on the savings, but in the aggregate, what I will say is we're committed to achieving and will achieve that $1.8 billion for the year. With regard to the guidance, look, we took a thoughtful approach on guidance. It was a strong quarter. We recognize that, and we're delighted to have been able to raise our guidance for the full year.\nNot only does that reflect strong execution for the quarter, but really a focus on those things that we can control amid a soft market. Things are playing out largely as we expected, and there are going to be puts and takes. Yes, we enjoyed some upside from UPS and Yellow, but as Brie mentioned, it was a soft market. There were some offsets there, and yield pressure in the soft market. Also embedded in our outlook is $600 million in incremental variable compensation through the balance of the year. That's $100 million more than our prior estimate. But at the end of the day, we're really pleased to have increased the lower end of the range, even when we're seeing this uncertainty, and we will keep you posted as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHey, thanks. Good evening. I just wanted to ask about another angle of the Teamsters contract negotiation. Obviously, we've seen a lot of these union contracts get reset higher. This one reset the bar for comfort benefits and logistics, and I think it came in even higher than you guys expected. So do you think there's a catch-up across the board from a cost perspective as you look across your various segments as they now deal with what was reset and the reality in the market? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Brian. As you all know, or maybe recall that in FY22, we increased compensation annually by about $1 billion. I mean, we were dealing with market conditions in real time, and we knew that our competition would see a step change. It's exactly what happened. And also, we have two pickup and delivery models in the market. And while we have taken a majority of the increase, we will continue to invest in our people. That's a given, and our outlook reflects that.\nIn fact, coming up in October, we have our annual merit increases, which are a regular and important component of our overall compensation structure. It's also important to remember that beyond compensation, working at FedEx offers our team members a great overall value proposition, a collaborative culture, and offers great career opportunities, among other things. So it's a very important for all of us, an issue for all of us, and we are staying right on top of it, and we appreciate your question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good evening. Raj, you mentioned peak season, the upcoming peak season in your opening remarks. Just given sort of the dynamic environment, your approach to disciplined revenue quality and such, has your approach to this peak season changed at all? Just any colors there?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question, Allison. The peak season, I would say, is that there is really no difference in our approach other than to say our service is really strong. There's not what we expect normal seasonality versus the volumes we are seeing today, and probably year-over-year comparable to where we were last year. The networks are running very well, and the team is ready to support our customers during this most important season. Brie, I don't know if you want to add any more to it than I just said.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nNo, Raj, I think you covered it. We feel good about peak, and from a pricing strategy perspective, we're committed to our strategy, which does include peak surcharges. We think that's really important. We need to invest in the network. This is a really important time of year for us, but it's also a really important time for our customers. And so having that surcharge there allows us to flex the network, deliver great service, and then we'll wind it down in January, but we see no major change in strategy this week.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKenneth Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Corporation\n\nHey, great. Good evening. Mickey, best of luck in retirement. It's been a great 18-year run, and John, welcome. Look forward to working with you. Just overall, great job and results, and particularly at Ground. But at 2% margins at Express, any reason we're not seeing maybe more leverage at Express given the moves you've made with parked aircraft and the structural change you talk about? Maybe walk through some of the timing on the gains at Express in particular.\nAnd I guess to wrap it up, given the beat of $0.80 in the quarter versus the street, yet you're raising the bottom target by $0.50. Is that, are there softening gains the rest of the year on some of the margins? I know you talked about the $600 million in cost, but you had prior talked about $500 million. I'm just wondering if there's maybe some slimmer margins that you're looking at in other areas. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, again, let me start off, and John, can I add to what I say here? I think it's important to remember for Express some of the key headwinds that we're facing in this quarter. Firstly, the demands or charges declined substantially year-over-year. We also opened up the international economy, and the reopening of the international economy resulted in yields decline. As you had mentioned in the talk track earlier, that the volumes from USPS also declined as part of their strategy. That's number three. And then at the same time, we also have market-driven headwinds from fuel prices. So net-net of all that, there was a revenue decline of $1.1 billion. In addition to that, the variable compensation increase for Express was also there. Despite all that, we increased our earnings and improved profits, and this is actually DRIVE working.\nAnd as we start to lap these headwinds, DRIVE progress will become even more visible in the numbers. And again, we think there's a tremendous opportunity, and the teams are working hard to capture that. I'll just make a quick comment on the forecast, and then I'll turn it over to John. The demand environment remains uncertain, and we are being prudent in our financial projections given the environment. And once again, our ability to drive better results even in a lower demand environment is what's really encouraging to me. Now, the environment changes, and we are more positive. Obviously, there's significant leverage on that. So John, if you want to add anything to it?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nNo, Raj, I think you've really captured it. All the significant headwinds that Express faced, yet they were able to turn a profit, and a year-over-year improvement is exceptional. But that said, we're going to be focusing on those margins. We're going to be focusing on continuous improvement. We're going to be focusing on the DRIVE initiatives to keep improving those margins. And on the guidance, yeah, I think, Raj, you covered it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, operator. Hi everyone. Congrats on the quarter. John, I guess I'm wondering on the Ground performance. Obviously, it's incredibly strong. I'm just wondering if you would, is there anything to ring-fence there that you would consider kind of one-time due to the volume diversion opportunity? I'm just looking at that plus four in August and wondering, is there any cadence shift throughout the month and some of that volume went back? And I guess just clarifying on Express, I think it sounds like there was a $150 million step-up sequentially in Express related to the incentive comp. Can you just confirm that? I can get it from the 10-Q, but I was just wondering that maybe that may explain why the decremental sequentially were so high, and I guess that moderates as we go on because that's now in the cost structure. If you can just clarify that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nI think what I said was $100 million incremental to our last report from the last time we reported on it. So that piece of it. With regard to Ground, look, as I mentioned just a short while ago, we think the improvement is going to continue on a year-over-year basis in terms of ring-fencing anything as Brie talked about. We're going to be looking to keep that incremental business and, in fact, have terms that require we are very discerning on the customers we took on and have agreements in place with those customers. And on the Freight side as well with Yellow, that capacity, at least for now, has come out of the market, and Freight is going to be taking advantage of those additional volumes.\nBut I mean, just getting back to Ground for a moment, we're expecting continued year-over-year improvement and no ring-fence to identify. With regard to Express, we're going to be focusing on the margin expansion. I'm not exactly sure on your question from a perspective otherwise, but we're going to be focused on that margin expansion and continuing to grow and leverage the opportunities we have at Express.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThis spring, your primary competitor talked about potentially launching some dynamic pricing products in the parcel space, which we haven't seen a lot of from the larger carriers before. Can you talk a little bit about where and if FedEx uses dynamic pricing in its US domestic products at this point, and has that evolved in the competitive landscape as a tool for market share and network efficiencies? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure. Great question. We're actually really pleased with the progress that we're making. Our pricing team, along with DataWorks, are building a great platform to be able to price more dynamically. Where we are currently using this capability now is we have made our peak surcharges around the world more dynamic. We have a great spot pricing capability that we're using in our air freight products that we are using to kind of match capacity to the market, as well as we're starting to use that domestically in some backhaul lanes. We've got a long roadmap of things that we're going to bring to market that we're very excited about to drive revenue quality. But I have to admit, I really don't want to share much more than what's already visible in market because I certainly don't want to provide any competitive intelligence that I don't need to.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good evening, and thanks for making the time. Mickey, congratulations, John. Welcome to the circus. Quick question for you on the cost per piece in the Ground segment. The $10.30 sort of sequentially is a big surprise. How should we feel about that number in absolute terms as we look at the rest of the year? Should we be kind of running at that $10.25 to 10.35 range? Are there additional things that are going to be popping in and out of that on a cost per piece basis? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of where we should be expecting the cost structure for the full year. If you could talk a little bit more about the DRIVERS in this quarter, you mentioned line haul.\nI'm just wondering if you renegotiated a bunch of line haul rates in a down truck market, that kind of thing, which should be sticky for the rest of the year. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSo I'll take that in reverse order on the measures taking. Yeah, it's across the board with DRIVE, line haul, and all the things we mentioned in our prepared remarks. With regard to the rate environment, we're expecting it to remain consistent. So that's factored into our forecast, but we will continue to update as time goes on. Again, line haul, dock productivity, higher wage and settlement rates that we're focused on, as Raj touched on. Just across the board, focused on productivity. That's true at Ground, and that's going to be true at Express and with Freight as well. I mentioned first and last mile in my remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglensky with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening. This is Eric Morgan for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats to Mickey, and welcome to John. I wanted to ask on Network 2.0, Raj. You mentioned you're continually learning and tailoring the network as you go through this process. So can you give us some color on what has gone right and wrong so far with co-locating the Express and Ground terminals and on the employee service provider decisions? I know it's market by market, but maybe could you give us some insight into what variables you're considering when making those decisions? Just trying to better understand the strategy there and how confident you are in execution.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question. Things have been going quite well as we feel we are on track to complete our network through our commitment of fiscal year 2027. As you know, we have announced and/or implemented optimization changes in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, as well as several other locations in the lower 48. We are definitely learning a lot in this process. I mean, we have technology, we have facilities, we have people, and our principle is pretty straightforward.\nIt's going to be data-driven, and it's going to follow the PSP philosophy. Again, it's important to note that we'll continue to use both the courier and the service provider model for pickup and delivery operations tailored to the characteristics of each market. So so far, so good. Again, we're putting all this in place as we move forward. Post-peak, we'll announce the next wave of rollout of network throughout.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Helene Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Head Advisor, TD Cowen",
    "content2": "Thanks very much, operator. Mickey, congratulations. John, welcome on board. And thanks for the time, team. So my number one question is, the UAW is doing these targeted strikes, and I know automotive and automotive parts is a big part of your vertical, one of your big verticals. I'm kind of wondering how you're thinking about that, the impact in the current quarter, how you're thinking about mitigating any impact, and so on, if you can help out there. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Helene. Yes, it's a fair question. We do have a healthy business in automotive here in the United States and around the world, but we're also highly diversified. We have looked at our initial numbers, and we have accounted for in our current demand forecast for some fluctuations in automotive. We do anticipate that there will be, in certain locations, some rolling strikes, and so we have accounted for that within the current demand outlook. Right now, we believe that both FedEx and the entire economy would benefit, obviously, from a fast resolution, but we've accounted for it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone. Mickey, John, congrats to you both. If I could maybe go back to something that you talked about, Brie, FedEx having a superior value prop with regard to service and speed. Does Network 2.0 make FedEx even faster? And if so, do you think that opens more yield capture opportunity that maybe goes beyond some of the guidance that you've given around the initiative?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSo from a Network 2.0 perspective, I'm actually really excited about this from a FedEx service perspective. The piece that I mentioned in my opening remarks is pickup, and I just wouldn't underestimate this. We have long known that this was an opportunity. When Raj talked about some of the early learnings in the US market, we knew it was an opportunity, but the enthusiasm from customers on how much easier it is to manage as we collapse and make not just the pickup experience, the physical pickup one, but we also will rationalize our pricing there. We will automate pickups in a more streamlined fashion.\nSo it's a better customer experience. To date, we have not yet found opportunities to speed up the network from a Network 2.0 perspective, but we continue to iterate. What we have found is it's a lot easier to respond and adapt in the network as we bring them together. And so that has also been something that customers have asked for, especially in the B2B space in healthcare. So we are learning a lot, but the net takeaway is customers are actually very supportive and excited about Network 2.0.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, everyone. Mickey, good luck again, and thanks for the help over the years. Brie, just one quick follow-up for you. You said that pricing traction was good so far, and you're converting a pretty decent amount of the base rate increase. What percentage of that? I think historically it's been closer to 50%. Kind of what rate are you converting right now? And also, you said that the pricing environment remains pretty rational, but you saw the USPS basically say they're not going to have any pricing surcharges in the USPS. So the UPS changes were noted on the call. I think Amazon is launching some competitive services as well. Do you think 2024 could be a tougher environment pricing-wise across the industry?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay, that was a lot, but I think I got it, Ravi. Jump in here if I don't get it all. So from a GRI perspective, if we go back to last January, the answer is the vast majority of our customers pay the full GRI. That is excluding the large customers where we've already pre-negotiated, but the customers that are on our service guide terms, we get a very high capture rate. And so we anticipate that we will see the same thing this coming January. From a peak surcharge perspective, I think it's really important to understand that we structure our peak surcharge to really target volume that will surge and drive the network to flex. So the vast majority of our customers actually do not pay a peak surcharge because their volume just doesn't flex up enough to qualify for the peak surcharge.\nSo when we look from a competitive environment, I actually don't think the USPS's peak surcharge is particularly relevant in what we're doing. So I'm not worried about that and actually continue to feel good. And we've also pre-negotiated peak surcharges with the vast majority of those customers that pay them. So I feel good heading into peak. And then when you think about Amazon or ship with Amazon, I think it's really important to remember we spent the last 50 years building the best transportation network in the world. We get up every day thinking about nothing other than making our supply chain better for our customers. And the market and customers, I think, really value the fact that when they win, we win, and they don't have to worry about a provider who's going to compete with them.\nI do think that we take competition very seriously, and I'm focused on continuing to provide an even better value proposition. We've got some things planned for 2024 that I'm really excited about sharing with you in a couple of months. I feel good. Thanks, Ravi, for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for the question. I appreciate the color that you gave on the Freight segment and kind of what you're seeing in August. Given just the major disruption in the market, could you talk a little bit about how some of those diverted volumes, just the mixed quality fits with FedEx's current Freight mix would be helpful just for context? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure. Happy to answer that question. So when we talk about the volume that came on, I think it's important to split it. Actually, if you look at it, about half of it came directly from Yellow customers. So give or take about 2,500 pieces a day. And the reason being is that Yellow had a lot of low-quality revenue. And so there was some revenue there and some customers that really didn't want to pay for the value of the FedEx Freight speed and the quality that we provide.\nWhat happened, however, was some competitors took on more Yellow volume, and their service was not what it needed to be. And so as a result, we went and got an additional 2,500 pieces from the market. Net takeaway is the margin of the 5,000 was very healthy. The sales team was incredibly disciplined, and both Lance and I are very, very pleased with that volume. The network is running really well, and I am confident that we will keep the majority of that, and that's what we have planned to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much for squeezing me in. Congratulations, John. And Mickey, it's been great working with you all these years, so thank you. John, question for you, and I just wanted to go back and clarify kind of what Ken Hoexter was asking on the guidance. The adjusted earnings went up, I guess, about $0.25 at the midpoint, and you highlighted the reasons why, but it looked like the unadjusted earnings went down about $0.15 at the midpoint. You took the high end of the range down to $16.60 and the low end up a little bit. And I just want to understand, you talked about the $100 million of incremental incentive comp. You talked about some of the continued yield pressure.\nYou talked about some of the negatives, and then I saw that it looked like you also extended the adjustment range for the business optimization costs up from about $500 to 620 million. So is that the net that explains the difference between the $0.15 reduction in the unadjusted guidance and the $0.25 increase in the adjusted guidance at the midpoint?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYes, Jeff, that's correct. You have that right.\n\nJeffrey Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay, that's my question. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you very much, operator. Let me say that, in closing, how proud I'm of our team for delivering such a strong start for the year. Our execution of the structural cost reductions remained on track, and as we prepare for peak, we will continue to make every FedEx experience outstanding for our customers. We've proven that DRIVE is changing the way we work, and we're enabling continued transformation across FedEx as we build the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Thank you for your attention today. I will see you next time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Now over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Before I start my remarks, I first want to acknowledge the upcoming retirement of Mike and his terrific contributions and accomplishments at FedEx over the last 18 years. Mike was named CFO in March 2020, and I'm grateful for his leadership over the three years since then as we navigated a global pandemic and significant change. Due to his tireless work, FedEx is on solid footing as we execute the next phase of our strategy. Above all, Mike has been a good friend and a colleague of mine, and I wish him all the very best. Now, let me turn to my remarks for the quarter.\nThanks to the hard work of the FedEx team, we have demonstrated continued progress on our journey to transform into the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. In Q4, we introduced and began preparing for One FedEx. At the same time, we continued to bend the cost curve through our Drive initiatives. This supported our fiscal year 2023 earnings, which came in above the midpoint of our March outlook despite continued soft demand and an unplanned year-end tax expense, which negatively impacted our earnings by $0.18 for the quarter. Our operating performance remains solid. We are entering fiscal 2024 with a continued focus on areas within our control and a commitment to execute swiftly on our priorities.\nThis focus will support sustained profit improvement in FY24 through an environment that we expect to remain marked by demand challenges, particularly in the first half. Turning to slide six, I will start with a snapshot of the quarter. Total revenue in the Q4 was down 10% year over year as volumes declined, with demand remaining soft across the market. With this said, the rate of volume decline in Ground and Express improved sequentially. As expected, yield trends have been pressured in international markets where the supply-demand balances have changed.\nWe continue to maintain our focus on revenue quality and are committed to a disciplined pricing approach focused on the long-term. While we expect these pressures to persist, we do expect moderation throughout the fiscal year. With our execution on a number of cost actions, we delivered adjusted operating profit of $1.8 billion. Our Q4 performance enabled us to close out the year with an adjusted operating margin of 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $14.96. While our revenue declines were in line with the industry, I'm pleased to note that our flow-through performance continues to improve, and we believe it is the best in the industry in the Q1 of the calendar year.\nBeyond the headline numbers, our results this quarter embed continued progress on our transformation. I'm pleased to see our cost-out efforts take hold, but I'm also equally excited about the operational improvements we are driving as we build the smartest logistics network in the world. For example, our market-leading Picture Proof of Delivery is now available to 90% of global residential deliveries, having launched in Europe earlier this month. Picture Proof of Delivery gives our customers visibility to their delivered shipments at the click of a button, and it has led to a 14% reduction in disputed delivery cases and contributed to a 17% reduction in call volume in the United States. Our four-hour estimated delivery time window, which we have rolled out to 47 countries, is also improving the customer experience.\nAt Ground, our dock modernization efforts are enhancing productivity, helping us run our docks smarter with new technology and key data insights. This includes a new network operating plan that uses machine learning to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts. Ground remained a standout in this quarter as the team delivered operating income of over $1 billion. For the first time in company history, the Ground team expanded margins despite lower volumes in the second half. This is a clear indication our Drive transformation is working and gives us confidence as we push forward. Amid continued volume pressure, cost per package this quarter increased only 1.9%. This was supported by a total reduction in operating expenses of $350 million as the company continued to manage staffing levels effectively, benefited from stock closures and consolidations, and reduced Sunday operations.\nThese actions helped bring Ground's Q4 operating margin to 12.1%. At Express, we have made significant progress aligning costs with underlying demand. Our initiatives continue to ramp, and we expect accelerating benefits in the upcoming fiscal year. Demand dynamics combined with yield pressure drove a 13% decline in revenue at Express. This performance was generally in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. In the face of these headwinds, the Express team was able to accelerate cost and productivity efforts driven by a combination of structural and volume-related initiatives. The Express team reduced total flight hours by 12% year over year and permanently retired 18 aircraft, including 12 MD-11s this quarter.\nThe team is also planning to take another 29 aircraft out of scheduled flying in fiscal 2024. In addition, we made excellent progress implementing structural cost savings initiatives beyond flights, including certain domestic efficiency initiatives. This includes the shift to a single daily dispatch of couriers, which achieved its target of $50 million in Q4 savings, as well as accelerated hub productivity measures. In Europe, we continue to improve operational execution across the region. Notably, we announced the official opening of two of our hubs this quarter. In April, we reopened our international road hub in Duiven, Netherlands, and this month we opened our new state-of-the-art road hub in Novara, Italy.\nThese two facilities have enhanced our capabilities, enabled more efficient routing, and improved our service on the continent. In aggregate, total operating expenses at Express were down $1.1 billion in the quarter. The magnitude of the operating margin decline has continued to narrow sequentially as our initiatives take hold. At freight, the team is focused on maintaining pricing discipline while flexing costs to protect profitability. The freight team was able to reduce operating expenses by over $330 million in the Q4. This will be further supported by our announced plan to close and consolidate 29 locations, which will be completed by August. Consolidation will improve service levels while lowering our cost to serve.\nFurther, we have conducted another round of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels and are limiting hiring of salaried employees. Turning to slide seven, we continue to make significant progress in taking cost out of our network, delivering a $2 billion year-over-year reduction in operating costs in the Q4 of FY23. This included more effectively matching flying with demand, marking the Q1 of this year where our flight hours declined more than the underlying volumes. Additionally, we continue to aggressively manage headcount, including attrition, to align our teams with the network changes underway. We exceeded our target with US headcount down by about 29,000 in FY23. Also included in these cost reductions are ramping benefits from the numerous initiatives we have identified across the 14 Drive domains.\nGiven our progress, we are confident that we can deliver on our previous goal for about $1.8 billion in cost reduction benefits from Drive this fiscal year and $4 billion of permanent cost reductions in fiscal year 2025. As we introduced in April, between now and June of 2024, we will be consolidating our operating companies into one unified organization. One FedEx is the next step of this journey to realize our full value potential. It aligns our organization to one corporate structure that will facilitate the execution of our Drive transformation and will further enable the work that's underway in Network 2.0. Our work toward this goal is already taking shape. We have taken a significant step forward in the implementation of Network 2.0 with today's announcement of the transformation of our Canadian operations.\nIn April of 2024, we will begin to transition all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express, creating a truly integrated and unified Canadian network. This unification is enabled by the nature of the Canadian market, where the population is heavily concentrated in a few key geographies currently serviced by both OPCOs. Consolidation will create significant efficiencies throughout the business from first to last mile and across our support teams. We expect this change in Canada to generate an annualized benefit of over $100 million upon completion in FY25. We have announced transitions in 20 markets, and Canada marks the first large-scale implementation of Network 2.0, which builds on the learnings from our completed transitions in other geographies.\nTo be clear, we're not taking a one-size-fits-all approach to our Network 2.0 strategy. Success depends on a mix of models, including employees and contracting with service providers, as all are important pieces of how FedEx moves packages. Looking ahead to FY24, we're entering the year with a clear focus on what is within our control in an underlying environment that remains dynamic across geographies. This backdrop is likely to pressure revenue growth, particularly in the near term. As a result, we're taking a prudent approach to our full-year outlook that builds upon our solid finish to FY23. We'll also make progress on reducing capital intensity by continuing to focus on the highest return opportunities in an efficient manner. After FY25, we have no additional firm commitments on jet aircraft CapEx.\nAs such, we expect our aircraft-related CapEx to decrease after FY24 and be approximately $1 billion in FY26. This capital allocation strategy represents our approach to a more efficient and nimble network. We will continue to look for additional opportunities as we proceed with our aircraft modernization strategy. We'll bring this discipline, along with our improved flexibility and agility, to ensure that we are successful given the uncertain external environment. In closing, I'm confident that the progress we are making on our transformation will translate into improved margins, returns, and cash flow throughout the year. At the same time, our commitment to driving operational improvement will further enhance the customer experience. Now, let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, who will discuss market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. As expected, the Q4 operating environment remained pressured with year-over-year volume declines and sequential moderation in yields across all transportation segments. We remained focused on revenue quality and creating meaningful differentiation while managing through these dynamics. Let's take each segment in turn now. At FedEx Ground, Q4 revenue was down 2% year-over-year, driven by a 6% decline in volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in yield due to surcharges and product mix. We once again delivered strong service levels and best-in-class market transits. Revenue at FedEx Express was down 13% year-over-year. Parcel volume declines were most pronounced in the United States. And in addition, US freight pounds were down over 25% due to a change in strategy from a very large customer. International export volumes were about 4% lower year-over-year.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue was down 18%, driven by an 18% decline in volumes, with revenue per shipment flat. This decline was driven primarily by the slowdown in the market and high inventory levels. Although the pricing environment is moderating, our pricing discipline remains strong. Let's move now to slide 11. As expected, yield was pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalized. Customer demand rebalanced between priority and economy services with capacity availability. This is most notable in the Asian markets. In response, we remained focused on revenue quality while managing our mix. At ground and US domestic express, yield improved year-over-year, but at a moderating rate versus the previous three quarters. And as I mentioned a moment ago, freight yield was flat.\nTurning now to slide 12, our efforts to make the network the most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network in the world are taking hold. We are delivering better service and outcomes for our customers, creating deep relationships, and of course, incremental revenue for FedEx. These efforts are supported by a fantastic portfolio of services. Raj spoke earlier about the benefits we and our customers are seeing from the expanded rollout of Picture Proof of Delivery and continued enhancements to the estimated time delivery window. Later this year, we plan to narrow our four-hour delivery window in many locations and provide new enhanced mapping capabilities to help customers track their package movements.\nReturns is also an area where we're underpenetrated, and so we're focusing on growth. Returns move through our network similarly to B2B shipments and are highly efficient in our network. In Q4, we introduced our new returns program, FedEx Consolidated Returns, which is available at FedEx Office locations. For merchants, it's a low-cost e-commerce solution for lightweight apparel returns with end-to-end visibility. For shoppers, it's a convenient, no-label, no-box drop-off experience using a QR code. We have received excellent feedback and look forward to continuing to scale the solution very quickly. Finally, last month, we launched FedEx Sustainability Insights, a cloud-based tool that enables customers to view estimated carbon emissions for both individual tracking numbers and all their FedEx accounts.\nThis platform marks the foundation of a new suite of tools for our customers. It enables customers to transfer their carbon data to their own internal systems via an API. The insights are also available online for our small customers. Leveraging the vast shipment data that we have and using our AI and machine learning capabilities, we are able to provide information to our customers in a meaningful and actionable manner. I am very excited about these portfolio expansions and firmly believe that a supply chain powered by FedEx is a competitive advantage for our customers. I'm proud of the team for their unwavering commitment to service and for delivering these innovative solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on slide 14. The FedEx team demonstrated strong operational execution to close out fiscal 2023. Looking at our transportation segment performance for the Q4, starting with ground, which continues to deliver strong results. Operating income increased 18%, and operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 12.1%, even with volumes down 6%. Margin expansion was supported by yield growth of 5% and strong cost controls driven by lower linehaul expense. At Express, we're seeing sequential operating margin improvement as our team continues to move with urgency to drive structural and volume-related cost improvements. Adjusted operating income declined 47%, and adjusted margin contracted 320 basis points to 5% as package volumes were down 7%, and yields declined 3% due to international package yield pressure.\nAt Freight, the team continues to navigate a softening volume environment. Operating income decreased 26%, and operating margin declined 210 basis points as shipments declined 18% and yield moderated. Our Q4 results include several non-cash items. We recorded an impairment charge of $70 million related to the decision to permanently retire from service 18 aircraft and 34 related engines. The results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges related to the ShopRunner acquisition. In addition, we incurred an unplanned tax expense of $46 million from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. To provide additional color on recent demand trends and what we are planning for in our outlook, slide 15 shows trailing monthly volume trends over the last six months for our major service categories. Volume declines continued in the quarter.\nWhile still negative, Ground and US domestic Express year-over-year package volume trends improved into May on a sequential basis. As we look to the Q1 of FY24, we expect volume declines to continue to moderate at Express and Ground as we lap the onset of softer volumes, while freight will continue to experience pressure. This brings me to our FY24 earnings outlook on slide 16. We remain acutely focused on maintaining our strong commercial position, prioritizing revenue quality, and driving profitability improvement through our efficiency initiatives supported by Drive. These efforts are more effectively aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent costs, and increasing the flexibility of our network.\nWe do expect external business conditions to remain challenging near term, and there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the timing of demand recovery, particularly in the back half of our fiscal year. As a result, we are preparing for several potential outcomes as we think about the year ahead. This led us to establish an Adjusted Earnings Per Share outlook range of $16.50 to $18.50 for fiscal 2024. In a demand environment that remains consistent with what we are currently experiencing, we anticipate flattish revenue for the full year and full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share toward the low end of the range.\nShould macroeconomic conditions support an improving demand environment in the back half of the year, we expect to see modest volume improvement for the year. In this scenario, we expect revenue to be up low single-digit percentage for the full year. This would also translate into greater operating leverage from our more efficient network on a higher revenue base, driving an outlook for full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share closer to the high end of our range. The key external factors that will determine the FY24 outcome are broader economic activity in North America, Europe, and in trans-Pacific trade, inventory restocking, and the development of e-commerce activity as we continue to differentiate our offering. At Express and Ground, we expect to build on fourth quarter cost momentum and see adjusted margin improvement in FY24.\nFreight margins will remain strong in FY24, but lower than FY23 given significant volume reductions and yield pressure. Turning to other aspects of our outlook, first, we expect a $230 million net non-cash pension headwind with a $330 million headwind below the line, offset by $100 million lower pension service costs. Partially offsetting this below-the-line impact, we expect higher interest income on our cash balances. Our projection for the full-year effects of tax rate is approximately 25% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. We are projecting $500 million of business optimization costs in FY24 associated with our transformation. We still expect a total pre-tax spend of $2 billion through FY25, and the timing and amount of these business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.\nMoving to the next slide, we want to share how we're thinking about the operating profit considerations embedded in our expectations for the full year.For illustrative purposes, I'll use adjusted EPS of $17.50, the midpoint of the outlook range. This scenario is based on modest demand recovery leading to limited coverage of base cost inflationary pressures. In addition, we expect approximately $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges significantly diminish and product mix continues shifting toward deferred offerings. We also include a $500 million increase in variable compensation to ensure our compensation package is competitive. This is critical to retain key talent as we execute our Drive transformation. Importantly, though, these pressures are more than offset by the $1.8 billion in cost savings from Drive.\nTogether, these illustrative components lead to FY24 adjusted operating profit of approximately $6.2 billion at the midpoint of our outlook. Moving to slide 18, we continue our unwavering focus on efficient and responsible capital allocation in our pursuit to drive shareholder returns. For the year, we ended with $6.8 billion in cash, in line with where we began the year, despite the challenging business environment. We accomplished this through continued improvement in cash conversion cycles and net working capital, along with reduced capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $6.2 billion, which represented 6.8% of revenue versus 7.2% of revenue in fiscal 2022. FY23 CapEx was slightly higher than our projection due largely to timing, as easing supply chain constraints accelerated the delivery of equipment and other projects.\nWith a slight acceleration of certain spend into FY23, we are now projecting $5.7 billion in CapEx for FY24, which achieves our target of less than 6.5% CapEx as a percentage of revenue a year earlier than we projected. Our fiscal 2023 adjusted free cash flow of $3.5 billion supported the repurchase of approximately $1.5 billion in stock at an average share price of approximately $163 a share. We paid $1.2 billion of dividends. In addition, we funded $800 million in voluntary pension contributions. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in attractive return improvement initiatives. We're committed to further reducing capital intensity. Capacity investments at Ground will decline, in addition to the lower aircraft expenditures Express Raj mentioned.\nWe expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion of stock in fiscal 2024. As previously announced, we are raising our dividend by 10%, which increases our adjusted payout ratio to over 30%. These significant stockholder returns reflect confidence in our continued execution of profitability and return improvement initiatives. Lastly, we are planning for $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to our US plans, which were 94.5% funded at year-end. In closing, we are making progress on our transformation and remain focused on delivering shareholder value by driving improved profitability, lowering our capital intensity, while continuing to deliver strong return of excess cash to shareholders. And with that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Before we close, to ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. And to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Allison Poliniak-Cusic with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good evening. Just want to go back to the optimization in Canada. I know you talked a little bit about the uniqueness of the region. Could you maybe talk to how does that impact the deployment of the optimization? And then, more importantly, relative to, say, the US, how is the scale different in Canada versus the US and how that deployment would go forward? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Allison, thank you for your question. Of course, Canada is a unique market, and we're taking a different approach there than the market-by-market approach we're taking in the US. The Canadian population is heavily concentrated in a few key geographies, and the volume is split roughly 50/50 between Express and Ground. We made the decision to consolidate everything under Express. It's the right time to take these steps because we'll begin in April 2024 and complete by September of 2024.\nIt's very important that you understand that this is unique to Canada because we're going to take a market-by-market approach in the United States, and we'd have a hybrid in the United States between couriers and package handlers. It's a very important step for us in Canada. It reduces our cost by about $100 million and, importantly, improves our portfolio and service differentiation. Thank you for the question, Allison.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi, thanks. You sort of gave some parameters for the EPS range, $16.50 to $18.50, and mentioned in the second half what it would mean if the macro sort of accelerated in terms of the revenue side. But I'm sort of curious, as you think about the first half of the fiscal year and the second half of the year, is a way to give a sense, maybe at the midpoint, the proportion of EBIT in both halves? Because I suspect that it's more of a second-half acceleration with the cost in the economy. Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure, Jordan, this is Mike. So let me break that down to a couple of elements. First, the demand projection we're talking about for the second half of the year would be relative to what we have been currently experiencing. So that's the degree of uncertainty there in terms of how that flows going to the back half of the year. In the front half of the year, keep in mind that the significant inflection that we saw last year was very late in Q1, with that most pronounced at Express. So we will be lapping that for Q1. And in addition, the trail-off in freight volume accelerated into the mid to upper teens later in the calendar year as well, largely in the fall when that started.\nSo you got to think about the Q1 considerations there as you put the whole year together and are modeling. But in terms of the outlook overall, we're not projecting any material inflection in the demand environment to get to that point there that you've referenced.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Mike, just sticking with you on the Slide 17, the $300 million revenue net of cost increases, is there any way to break down how much of that is volume versus price? And if it is more kind of price-driven, the $2.7 billion of variable costs that you took out this year, how much do you have adding back in fiscal 2024?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Jon, let me take a swing at that here. So the way we have framed this is that our expectation is for continued but moderating underlying inflation. So what we illustrated here in this midpoint scenario is positive contribution beyond inflation amidst a muted demand growth scenario. Then, obviously, on top of that, the Drive savings are greater than the non-recurring headwinds. So again, as Brie mentioned, we'll see moderating volume declines as we move through the year here. But at the same time, the degree of yield increases that we saw last year are not going to continue into this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Transfortation, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. For Brie, can you just talk about any signs of demand destruction or trade down in this uncertain environment? You mentioned one customer making a change. I think it was within US air freight, I believe it was. And then relatedly, can you just talk about if you're seeing any diversions from the UPS network that might be driving some of those month-on-month incremental gains in terms of ground and express? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay, I think I got all that, Brian. I think you had a couple of questions. Let's start with the last part first. So I think the question was, are we seeing any benefit from the UPS labor negotiation? So the short answer is in Q4, we did not see any material benefit because of those discussions, and we have not planned for any benefit moving into fiscal year 2024. What I can tell you is that this has opened a lot of doors. We're having a lot of great conversations with legacy UPS customers, and we feel really strong. We feel really good about the sales pipeline because of the strong value proposition we have versus our primary competitor.\nI think the other question was about the mix, and are we seeing any customers make trades within the portfolio? Where we're seeing that most pronounced, and we have planned for it, to Mike's point, it's in our range accounted for, is in Asia. Obviously, capacity has come back relative to demand, and we did reopen our IE product in the Q4. That has performed well. And actually, I'm really pleased with the performance that I'm seeing from the Asia Pacific team and their sales pipeline, but that's where we've seen the biggest shift.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess maybe, if I could, a two-parter here. The guidance itself, I think the bottom end, Mike, if the way you described it, if I understood it correctly, contemplates the operating environment sort of remains as is right now. If we were to see things deteriorate in terms of just underlying customer demand, is the company prepared to maybe pull forward some of the Drive savings from FY25 into FY24?\nIs that even really plausible at this point? If you maybe could talk about that. And then for Brie, for the second part of the question, is the $800 million of international export yield pressure that you guys are going to be seeing this year going to fully capture sort of getting back to sort of pre-COVID levels there? Again, thanks for the two-parter, but would appreciate the insights.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Jack, we'll give you a special pass then. So on the low end there, I characterize that's flatish revenue year over year. So that would be the low end of our expectation. But in terms of how we navigate and manage through that, the flexibility that Raj mentioned too that we are incorporating into the network is allowing us to then react to that and adjust. And again, point to the tremendous progress we've made and the results you've seen at Ground in the last few quarters of material volume declines, yet improved margins and profitability. And you saw in the last quarter here, Express is mitigating the flow-through from the reduced demand. So we will move with great urgency should it be below our range of expectations.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAnd let me just jump in before I turn it over to Brie here. So it's a simple one, two, three formula. At 1%, we are at the low end of the range. At 2%, we are in the middle. At 3%, we are at the higher end of the range in terms of revenue growth. Now, to go beyond that, we become non-linear in terms of significant operations leverage. So yeah, Drive is working, and we have flexibility to pull additional levers as we need to. Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks, Raj. So Jack, the short answer is yes, that we have planned for the $800 million impact this fiscal year. And then as we lap that impact, we will be able to build back from there. So the short answer is yes.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah, hi. Maybe just on the one point going into the call, say, can we just understand the timing of that as we go through fiscal 2024? How much of that comes, I guess, in one Q or in the first half, and how much should be sort of spread out over the rest of the year?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure, Chris, this is Mike. Of the $1.8 billion, it is a sequential build as we go through. We continue with the discipline and rigor of the Drive framework. So as certain things are implemented during the year, we won't get the full run rate of that because there is a continuous flow of initiative. So it'll be the least amount of that 1.8 will be in Q1, and it'll build as we go through the year. And then that gives us the run rate momentum then to get to the $4 billion fully by FY25.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglanski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nYes, thank you. And good afternoon. Raj, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that you've already transitioned something like 20 markets to one FedEx operation, but not every market is the same. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? And how is this hybrid model going to work in the states where you do have overlapping contractors and potentially employee drivers? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Brandon, the markets that we have transitioned over are in Alaska. We're working through Hawaii and certain other markets in Minneapolis. So we have learned a lot in this process from technology, from facilities, and people. And the hybrid model is that in some markets, we will have couriers. In some markets, we have a contractor. So those things will be determined. They'll be data-driven, and they'll work through with our people first, PSP philosophy. And as I said, this is going to take a little bit of time, as we told you, but I'm glad we're making the progress we're making already. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. So Raj, if I take a look at what happened last kind of August, September, the outcome was quite a bit different than you expected. I think your international fell off quite a bit, maybe some other things. I think the way you guided looking forward, if we look at your results in November quarter and February quarter, you set a bar that was achievable. Maybe you just executed a little better. How do you think about the guidance that you're giving us for fiscal 2024?\nYou've talked about the different macro assumptions and revenue, but is there some element of having a conservative bar where you could potentially do better on cost or maybe pricing comes in a bit better? Just kind of reflecting what seemed to be a pattern of giving yourself a little bit of room to overachieve in the last couple of quarters. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nTom, firstly, let me say this much. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's the first time in the history of FedEx that in FedEx Ground the volumes declined and our operating margin expanded. So clearly, this is beyond just flexing for volume, and this is really Drive taking effect as well. So we are just very, very pleased with how John and his team are performing in Ground. And by the way, I'll give kudos to the Express team and Richard's team as well as we have started to see significant improvement in the Q4. To your question about the macro, so when we talked in September, we pointed to three things. We said that the industrial economy was slowing down because of inflation, interest rates, and slowdown in global trade.\nWe said that the consumer spending was shifting to services versus goods. And then thirdly, there was an e-commerce reset coming out of the pandemic. Well, all those three things happened, and they were detrimental to volume for the whole industry. So I mean, we're roughly the same revenue performance on the calendar quarter that is comparable across the sector. If you look ahead here, at this point, the one and two are basically along the same lines we've seen in the last few months. I think on the e-commerce side, we expect to see growth now. I think the reset is probably complete, and e-commerce is going to grow into the next calendar, sorry, the next FY24 timeframe. So we are watching this very carefully.\nVisibility, especially in the second half, is very difficult given the dynamic circumstances we're seeing. We'll see how the industrial production goes. We'll see how GDP and trade goes, and we'll follow the inventory stocking and inventory to sales ratio very carefully. But at the end of the day, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a determination that we're going to come out of this stronger than we went in, and it's exactly what we're doing. And I'm very, very pleased with the way we are executing Drive. So sorry for a long answer, Tom, but I thought I wanted to give you a full perspective there.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. And Tom, this is Mike. I want to just amplify one aspect there as well to just highlight. We talked about Ground and the progress and the numbers there, but there has been tremendous progress at Express amidst the headwinds here.\nSo you ask about the guidance broadly, but keep in mind all $800 million of that international headwind is at Express as a non-recurring headwind. A significant component of the variable compensation is at Express. And the domestic freight headwind that Brie alluded to earlier, that's about $400 million right there as a headwind in 2024. So despite all that, through the discipline and rigor of drive and a muted demand environment, we are projecting up margins at Express in 2024. So again, just to reiterate, we're looking at this very thoughtfully and are planning to adapt to any further changes in the environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Mike, if I can just follow up on a couple of thoughts there. Your thoughts on the scale of improvement at Express, can you reach mid-single digits? Is there kind of a range as you'd put within the target? Same at Ground, is that going to reach double digits if we're going up? And then magnitude at Freight margin, if you're looking at declining expectations. And then I guess within that, any thoughts on Europe and TNT integration within that Express category? Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThat was a lot. Certainly, like I said, we will see margin improvements at Express and at Ground in 2024. Freight, we'll definitely see some margin pressure there. So I'm going to leave it at that. The Freight will mitigate. Like I said earlier, we'll see the largest margin pressure at Freight in Q1, and that will mitigate as we move through the year. Similarly, I would expect Express margin improvement to improve to a greater degree beyond Q1 as well as we move through the year. So I'll leave it at that.\nAs it relates to Europe, we are absolutely, as a component of that Express improvement, projecting improved profitability in Europe. Keep in mind that within the Drive domains, we've identified $600 million of value that we'll realize from the Europe initiatives there. So we will absolutely see progress on that in 2024 and going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So Raj, in one of the earlier answers, you basically said one, two, three, right, for the earnings sensitivity and revenue sensitivity. So that's basically every billion of revenue gets you an extra dollar of earnings. Is that the right sensitivity to think about just longer term beyond just this year as freight eventually recovers? And then just separately, the $5.7 billion of CapEx this year, how much is included in aircraft? I just want to get a sense of what the CapEx could look like in a couple of years when we're spending a lot less on planes. Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Scott. So first, on the aircraft CapEx, we came in at about $1.7 billion in 2023, about $1.5 billion for 2024, slightly lower than that in 2025. And then as Raj said, approximately below that even into 2026. So that's the aircraft component of it.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAnd Scott, on the one, two, three, I just wanted to keep the math straightforward here. It's a simple one, two, three formula. But the point I wanted to make also is that as it accelerates beyond that, then the curve becomes non-linear. As we have significant operating leverage, I think you are the one who called it the opening the jaws of the crocodile, then that's kind of what's going to happen.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector of Travel and Transport Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, everyone, thank you. Just on the 2024 revenue assumption, I'm a little confused on how that will work with export yield pressure. It just seems like the other lever is going to be volumes in general. Just to be super clear, are you assuming a year-over-year increase in 2024 at the midpoint? Just any help there would be great. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure, Conor. Yes, the assumption at the midpoint, as Raj just mentioned, would be 2% revenue growth. As you think about the build back from a revenue perspective, it's important to note, as I think Mike mentioned earlier, in the US domestic, as we get late into Q1, early Q2, you will see volumes, domestic Express and Ground parcel.\nThey'll get to flat, and then we do anticipate they will build back from there. FedEx Freight will lag that slightly because, as Mike talked about, the impact lagged. And then when we get into our international business, the 800 is really yield impact. We are anticipating to build back some volume in our international business this year. And again, that will happen throughout the year. So yes, 2% is the midpoint. Volumes will start to build back throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. Brie, I just want to follow up on that if I can. You gave your range of outcomes, but we do have higher interest rates, credit cards. I know there's been a lot of chatter about school loans being paid later this year, and that may be a negative for holiday season and e-commerce. As you look around the world, let me phrase this a little differently than you've been answering. Where are potential green shoots starting to show up in your network or reasons for optimism? And where are we seeing, let's forget the international yields, but more in terms of activity that you're seeing out there, incremental red?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, absolutely. It's a fair question. So we plan right now for flattish to low single revenue growth. And that's really basically on the backdrop of the economy that we're experiencing right now. We're all watching the consumer. As Raj talked about, we are still seeing consumer strength here in the United States, but we are seeing an e-commerce reset. So from a green shoots perspective, one of the things that we're going to be looking at is that e-commerce growth. It's sitting at 7% to 8%. It's important to note our percentage of that is closer to 2% to 3% because we don't play in grocery. And obviously, within that 7% to 8% is also a buy online, pickup in store.\nSo we will be keeping an eye on that consumer strength here in the United States and would love to see, as we head into peak, a little bit of a different shift. We have not seen that yet, but we'll be watching for it. And then the other thing from an Asia perspective is we are going to watch closely on Asia reopening. We haven't seen significant uptick there, but if that happens to Raj's point, that will absolutely be a tailwind for us. And then honestly, our own execution in Europe. I'm really pleased with the service that the European team is delivering. We've got some green shoots in the domestic markets in Europe, and we're working that really, really hard from an operations and a sales perspective. So there are definitely some green shoots we're working on.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Advisor, TD Cowen\n\nThanks, operator. Hi, team. So, easy questions. I think the pilots are voting on a new contract, and I'm wondering if the cost increase associated with that is included in the guidance. And the other part of the question is, as you retire your older aircraft, are you also retiring pilots, or is there an excess of pilots?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Helane, a couple of questions there. So first, as it relates to the aspects of the pilot tentative agreement there, a component of that is a payment upon implementation. So we've previously accrued for that date of signing payment there. And then within the guidance here, we have the FY24 scale increases. And then within the pension figures I gave earlier, that incorporates the considerations as it relates to that as well. So that's fully incorporated into the outlook there. And as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting to park 29 additional aircraft during the year, nine of which will be permanently retired.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Schneebeger\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much. Good afternoon. I'm going to keep it on the airplanes.Just curious on flight, if you can kind of frame the answer in where you were a year ago, where you are now, and where you anticipate being in a quarter or two with regard to taking out flights, Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic, Asia-Europe, if we could just get an update on that for what you've done and what may come going forward. Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nScott, look, as Raj mentioned, flight hours were down 12% in the Q4, which is greater than the volume decline. So we've taken significant flying out of the network. We've said that that was anticipated once the supply-demand constraints were eased. And so that is the decision to then retire these aircraft because we continue to reduce the Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic flying to match demand. And we'll continue to lean into that as well as utilizing the flexibility of capacity in the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for fitting me in here. So Mike, in the scenarios you've outlined for us, is there a scenario where margins on a consolidated basis don't get better on an adjusted basis in 2023? Or are we looking for margin expansion? And then Brie, as you think about the large customer change in behavior, I'm assuming we're talking about the post office. Are we expecting more of that priority mail revenue to decline given what DeJoy has said publicly around his desire to ground some of that traffic? And then how do we think about that sort of in connection with your desire also to kind of reduce the flying network a bit?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Yeah. Well, I mean, David, the shorter answer is we're projecting margin improvement with the outcomes here that we have highlighted and the specific drivers within that.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYes. And the customer we are talking about is the United States Postal Service. Obviously, we've had a long and productive and profitable relationship with the post office. You're correct. Their 10-year strategic plan is to track more volume and fly less. So to Mike's point earlier, we have accounted for that in this year's fiscal range. We are committed to meeting the service obligations in that contract, which does end in September 2024. And so we've accounted for that headwind. At that point, it will become a tailwind as we either renegotiate or we will adjust our network accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Jefferies)\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Good evening. This is actually Joe hopping on for Stephanie. Thanks for squeezing me at the end here. I'll keep it to one. My question is maybe for Mike. It's a bit in the weeds. Looking at the Ground operating profit expansion, purchase transportation costs are obviously down big year over year at 40%. I think it's the lowest % of revenue in 10 years or something with the softer macro. So how should we think about PT, particularly in the context of volume rebound and the need to maybe source third-party capacity if the macro improves, especially as more costs are coming out of the network? Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Joe. Well, in my remarks, I mentioned how one of the drivers of the margin expansion and cost control at Ground was lower linehaul expense. So we moved a lot of high-cost ad hoc external linehaul spend into our scheduled network as we optimize that and lower rates on the planned linehaul purchase transportation. So again, it's all part of the broader optimization of the networks holistically, both pickup and delivery, linehaul, as well as the sort and facility operations.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks. And good evening. And congrats, Mike, on the retirement. Just want to ask about the LTL side since we haven't talked about it too much. You recently had a large competitor announce some material solvency concerns. And I just wanted to see what the playbook here is if we do see a major competitor exit. Would you rethink some of the facility closures and furloughs at that point, or even just if it's a stronger-than-expected LTL market?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. And thanks for that, Bruce. But yeah, on the LTL side, look, you've seen how fast the team reacted to the declining volume environment earlier in the year, and we still were expanding margins. That accelerated, so that was more challenging. So look, we will continue to look to optimize the facilities. It's a holistic perspective. So the 29 facilities were smaller ones that weren't the most efficient. So as we lean into what could be a demand recovery, that volume could be accommodated within the larger facilities. And that just has that much more incremental contribution as and when that comes back.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Hi everyone. Mike, I know there's a lot of questions on the long-term 12-month view. That's hard. I get it. But maybe help us calibrate expectations for the near term. Do you expect Express and Ground profits to be up in the next quarter? I know there's seasonality, but the question, there's obviously Drive savings. And then Raj, the decision to go external for the CEO search, that obviously wasn't lost upon me, that external criteria. That's a big deal for FedEx, obviously. And wondering if you can talk about what the board, what you're trying to achieve there in terms of hiring somebody from the outside, which really hasn't happened before for such a senior position. Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Amit. This is Mike. So first, I'll reiterate, as I mentioned earlier, freight margins will be down for the year, and that will be most pronounced in Q1.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAt Express, as we saw the significant inflection in demand very late in the Q1 last year, Express will see the smallest year-over-year margin change in Q1 relative to the rest of the year. So I'll leave it at that and go from there.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAnd Amit, yes, first of all, and again, thank Mike for just incredible work over the last 18 years, and particularly in the last three. And we have a fantastic finance team and a great organization. From a succession planning, we are looking at somebody who has deep financial expertise, but also strong operational capabilities and help lead FedEx through our Drive transformation program. So again, thank you for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, operator. Before we close, I want to give Mike an opportunity to say a few words.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. The last 18 years at FedEx have been a tremendous experience, and it was my great honor to serve as CFO for the last three years. Who would have known when I was named to this position in March of 2020 what we in the world were about to face? But this team rose to the occasion again and again through many obstacles, and we are now well-positioned for the future. I want to express my gratitude to the entire FedEx team and the finance team in particular for their dedication throughout all of the change. To Fred and Raj for their vision and leadership, and most importantly, to my wife, Jane, and our sons for their support along the way.\nI've also valued the engagement with this audience in sharing the exciting plans and bright future for FedEx. As I start my next chapter, I leave knowing that FedEx is in a strong position. I couldn't ask for any more than that. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Mike. In closing, I also want to thank our team members for the hard work and dedication as we build the world's smartest logistics network. We made tremendous progress on our transformation efforts in fiscal year 2023, and the team is already moving with urgency as we enter fiscal year 2024. We know there's significant opportunity ahead, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

And now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks to the hard work of the FedEx team, our third quarter earnings were ahead of our expectations in what remains a challenged demand environment. The team delivered outstanding service throughout and following peak despite significant weather disruptions across the United States.\nImportantly, our third quarter results also reflect our continued progress on the fundamental transformation of FedEx as we moved with urgency to realign our cost structure. Our cost reduction actions supported margin expansion at both Ground and Freight but have not yet fully offset the impact of continued pressures at Express. Results at Express came in below where they need to be and below the potential we know exist in this business. We're committed to addressing these cost imbalances, and we'll be taking further actions in the coming months, including a more pronounced readjustment of the air network. Because of the magnitude of changes we are planning across our air network and our continued need to maintain high service levels, there's a lag in the timing of expense adjustments. We expect to see sequential progress in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our efficiency efforts are gaining traction ahead of schedule, and I'm pleased that this translates into an improved earnings outlook for fiscal year '23.\nNow turning to Slide 6 for a snapshot of the quarter. Volumes declined by a low double-digit percentage across all segments, partially offset by higher yields at Ground, U.S. Domestic Express and Freight. This led to a year-over-year revenue decline.\nWhile revenue fell across all segments, the decrease was most pronounced at Express. Adjusted operating margins and EPS declined year-over-year as volume softness was partially offset by higher yields and cost reduction actions.\nLast quarter, we shared our expectation for continued pressures from lower volume and inflation. But what is also embedded in these results and what I'm seeing firsthand every day are tangible signs of the fundamental transmission happening at FedEx through DRIVE. We are rightsizing our cost base to match today's realities and creating a more efficient and agile network. We're not simply taking out cost. We are simultaneously focused on running our business more efficiently, flexibly and profitably, which will create significant value for our stockholders in the years to come.\nI'm particularly pleased with the progress we are seeing in Ground. The team has taken aggressive actions to address its cost structure and has effectively mitigated volume pressures. One of the key drivers at Ground was the ability to manage staffing levels and associated expenses which resulted in reduced salaries, benefits and purchased transportation costs. Combined, these expenses were down 8% year-over-year.\nDespite the dynamic environment, Ground continued to deliver customers during peak with an average time in transit of approximately 2 days compared to 2.35 days in fiscal year 2022. In aggregate, these initiatives led to a modest increase in cost per package of 1% despite 11% volume declines, and total operating expenses were down $345 million year-over-year. When combined with our continued focus on revenue quality, total operating income was up 32% year-over-year and operating margin of 9.7% that improved 240 basis points year-over-year.\nFreight has also illustrated disciplined commitment to profitable growth, revenue quality and managing cost to volumes. The team continues to execute cost reduction actions in this regard. Beyond day-to-day management of variable costs, the Freight team is temporarily parking and selling equipment to rightsize the fleet and reduce future maintenance costs. The team is also limiting hiring and furloughing employees to match staffing with volume levels. We're taking the relevant learnings from this proven Freight model and implementing them at both Ground and Express.\nTotal operating expense at Freight was down 6%, supporting 270 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Importantly, our cost initiatives did not compromise the consistent outstanding service levels delivered by the Freight team.\nTurning to Slide 7. We have made significant progress in taking cost out of our network with $1.2 billion in year-over-year cost savings in the third quarter. We are highly focused on taking permanent cost out of the system and remain on track to generate permanent savings of $1 billion this fiscal year relative to plan.\nLast month, we announced a streamlined reporting structure that will reduce the size of our officer and director team by more than 10%. We will continue to aggressively manage head count, including attrition, to align our teams with the network changes underway. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect U.S. head count to be down roughly 25,000 year-over-year.\nAt Express, our cost base is constrained in the short term. Our Express network is vast and complex and requires time to adjust to changing demand conditions. Therefore, we are taking additional steps to address our fixed expense structure. This quarter, we reduced flight hours by 8% and salary and benefit expenses by 4%. We also parked an additional 9 aircraft, down-gauged on certain routes and implemented various productivity improvements. As a result of these actions, we mitigated 45% of total revenue declines on an adjusted basis. This was a significant improvement versus the first half.\nWithin the U.S. Domestic Express, we implemented a single daily dispatch of couriers in February. This change removes domestic pickup and delivery routes, improves hub and ramp efficiency. We expect this will achieve about $50 million in savings in Q4 and ramp up to about $300 million annual savings by fiscal 2024. We expect progress to accelerate in the fourth quarter, with total flight hours expected to be down double digits and further FTE reductions by year-end. This will support mid- to high single-digit reductions in total expenses year-over-year at Express. We also plan to temporarily park additional aircraft in the fourth quarter. With continued cost discipline, we anticipate sequential operating margin improvement in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter.\nAssuming the challenging demand environment persists in Q4, we expect to be able to mitigate at least 60% of the revenue-related headwinds we are facing in Express. This supports improved profitability in the fourth quarter compared to the third. We will build profitability from here at Express.\nBefore we dive into the financial results in more detail, I'll provide a quick update on DRIVE, the program to support our transformation to create a more nimble, efficient and profitable FedEx. We are on track to deliver $4 billion of permanent cost reduction by the end of fiscal 2025.\nI'm very pleased with the progress the team has made in identifying actions that will not only reduce costs but will make our network more agile and flexible as we execute Network 2.0. One part of this effort, as shown on Slide 8, is to reconfigure our air network. This requires many steps, including plans currently being developed to phase out our fleet of MD-11s. Our aircraft modernization program and use of 777s and 767s affords us the ability to flex our plans. And as we operate more collaboratively, we are leaning into the ground transportation more, requiring less CapEx while enabling us to reconfigure our network more quickly. This directly supports our goal for meaningful ROIC improvement in the coming years.\nWe're excited to share more about the strategy at our DRIVE program update on April 5. There, we will focus on the actions we are taking to improve our performance, along with additional information to help you better model the impact on our progress.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, who will discuss market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail. Brie?\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. As expected, the operating environment in the third quarter remains challenging. The trends we saw through the first half of the year persisted, but we started to see some moderation, and importantly, our team delivered excellence for our customers.\nAt FedEx Ground, revenue was down 2%. The volume decline was significantly offset by a double-digit percentage yield increase driven by better product mix, fuel and large package and peak surcharges. We are very pleased with the results from the implementation of our global rate increase this past January, which has maintained a very high capture rate.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue was down 3%. The team's continued execution on revenue quality actions and profitable share enabled us to offset 12% volume decline throughout the quarter. Importantly, pricing discipline across the LTL industry is strong, and we expect the market to remain rational.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volumes globally and yield softness in Asia and Europe.\nIn Europe, we're seeing improved operational execution with service at the best levels they have been since fiscal year '21. There's more work to do but the momentum is building as our team has improved service levels while maintaining a healthy sales pipeline. Our pipeline and signed contracts are at their highest levels this fiscal year and our closes per week are at a double-digit percentage higher than they were in Q1. Additionally, having a freight and parcel bundle for our customers in Europe differentiates us from the rest of the market.\nIn Asia, market demand is rebalancing, resulting in lower yields and softer demand for priority services. The reopening of our international economy service this May will help stabilize our volumes out of Asia, given the market's increased shift to deferred services.\nMoving now to Slide 11. As expected, yield growth has been increasingly pressured across segments as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shift. FedEx Express international turns negative driven primarily by Asia, with Europe also softening. U.S. Domestic Express, Ground and Freight yield growth also decelerated. Despite market headwinds, we're pleased with the team's ability to manage volume, share and margin at both FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Looking ahead, we remain prudent in our expectations for yield in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 12. Service is always top of mind for us at FedEx. Our team delivered another busy peak season highlighted by FedEx Ground achieving pre-pandemic service levels. In fact, across the board, FedEx Ground delivers to more locations in 1 or 2 days than our nearest competitor's ground service. I would also like to share progress we're making at Express where service levels improved significantly over fiscal '22 peak and are quickly approaching pre-pandemic service levels. While this is great progress, we know we have more to do, and we're taking meaningful action to continuously enhance our service.\nFor example, in Europe, with the reopening of our Duiven Netherlands road hub this past October, we have expanded capacity, enabled a more efficient routing and we have improved our service. These improvements are a testament to our team's ability to deliver outstanding service while we change our business.\nComing out of peak, service improvement has translated into good momentum for our sales team. Jill and I are also very pleased with the market's response to several new or enhanced offerings that further improve customer experience. First, the online FedEx Ship Manager has been fully modernized to make shipping more efficient, highly personal and easier to use for all of our customers. Our customers can cater the interface to the way of working they prefer and that fits their business. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we're finding that the more customers engage with Ship Manager, the more they appreciate it. FedEx Ship Manager is the primary tool for small business customers, and we plan to migrate 98% of all parcel shippers to this new experience before next peak.\nNext, we launched Picture Proof of Delivery ahead of peak season, making us the first to market with this great capability. It has fulfilled a key customer need, driving confidence around successful package deliveries. Benefits from this launch include fewer delivery disputes and fewer customer service calls post proof of delivery. We are winning new business because of this unique feature here.\nWe have also continued to build on our dynamic pricing infrastructure with our DataWorks team. In peak, our dynamic pricing capability enabled holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on individual customers' weekly peaking factor, delivering $150 million in profit. In the coming fiscal year, our predictive anomaly detection will improve revenue quality. We have already built infrastructure that helps us identify instances when we have overbilled our customers. Now we will use those same capabilities to better manage customer performance and contract compliance. Finally, in January, we rolled out new visibility insights in 13 countries, providing customers with a 4-hour time window for their package delivery. By delivering these innovative solutions, our teams are creating great value enhancing the overall customer experience.\nNow I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie. Starting with our performance in the third quarter. We delivered earnings ahead of our expectations as our team moved with urgency to align our costs with lower revenue as global volumes remain under pressure.\nTurning to the Transportation segments. At Ground, operating income increased 32%, and operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 9.7%. Margin expansion was supported by both yield growth of 11% and cost reduction actions. These factors were partially offset by lower package volume, higher infrastructure costs related to previously committed projects and increased other operating expenses.\nAnd at Freight, the team's focus on revenue quality and managing costs drove better profitability as operating income increased 15% and margins expanded 270 basis points. This was driven by revenue per shipment, up 11%, as well as a gain on a facility sale and partially offset by decreased shipments.\nAt Express, our results continue to be pressured, and our team is acutely focused on driving improved profitability. Adjusted operating income declined 81% due to 10% lower package volumes as cost reductions lagged volume declines. Volume pressures were partially offset by improved yields. Revenue per package grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates, partially offset by exchange rate impacts. Yield growth decelerated and inflected negatively in international export, increasing pressure on profitability. Despite our performance in the third quarter, due to the actions we are taking in Express, we expect to see sequential operating profit and margin improvement in the fourth quarter.\nTo provide additional color on recent demand trends and what we are planning for in our outlook, Slide 17 shows trailing monthly volume trends for our major product categories. Volume declines continued throughout the quarter. While still negative, U.S. Domestic Express, International Priority and Ground Package trends improved somewhat into February on a sequential basis. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect volume declines to continue moderating at Express and Ground as we lap the onset of softer volumes. Yield growth will be pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shifts most prominently in Asia.\nMoving to Slide 18. Our focus on efficient and responsible capital allocation has not wavered. We are in an era of lower capital intensity at FedEx. Last fiscal year, CapEx was 7.2% of revenue, down from our historical levels of roughly 8%. By fiscal year '25, our commitment is to be at 6.5% or lower.\nAs I mentioned in December, we reduced our fiscal year '23 capital spend forecast of $5.9 billion, which is approximately a $900 million reduction from initial plans for the year to account for the lower demand environment. We are prudently deferring and slowing the pace of projects, improving our capacity utilization and planning for moderated aircraft fleet investment to drive ROIC improvements. In line with this approach, we expect capital spend to be roughly flat in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023 and be down as a percentage of revenue.\nTurning to liquidity. Our cash position remains a source of strength. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and continue to generate solid cash flows, which supports our capital return strategy. We remain committed to rewarding our stockholders as we transform our business and execute on our long-term strategy. In fiscal year '23, we will return $2.7 billion to our stockholders.\nIn summary, our capital allocation strategy reflects our commitment to reducing capital intensity and creating value for stockholders while continuing to reinvest in FedEx for today and tomorrow.\nTurning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect market conditions to continue to negatively impact revenue and operating profit. However, on a sequential basis, we expect FedEx's fourth quarter results to follow our historical seasonal pattern, representing the high-water mark on the year. We will continue to execute on the previously identified cost actions and identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in order to mitigate the impact of volume declines on our operating results.\nAs part of these reductions, we will manage capacity to lower demand levels, including further reducing flight hours at Express and reducing Sunday operations, closing certain sort operations and taking other line-haul expense actions at Ground. We are executing targeted actions to reduce shared and allocated overhead expenses, reducing vendor utilization, deferring certain technology projects and discontinuing same-day city operations at FedEx Office. In addition, we expect to achieve savings related to further head count attrition and the elimination of certain global officer and director positions, which we announced in February. Putting these factors together, our updated expectation of full year adjusted earnings is $14.60 to $15.20 per diluted share.\nAnd with that, let's open it up for questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of FedEx Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nArthur M. Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The second quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book on our website at fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. During our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nI want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance may be -- certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; and Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague, Jeff Smith, who passed away on November 17, after courageous battle of brain cancer. Jeff's contributions to the Investor Relations and FedEx team were immeasurable, and our hearts remain heavy at his loss. He will be greatly missed.\nSeparately, I'd like to congratulate Elizabeth Allen on her upcoming retirement at the end of the month after 32 years at FedEx. Elizabeth has been instrumental to the Investor Relations team, and she will be missed by our FedEx colleagues and the investment community alike.\nAnd now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by thanking our more than 550,000 employees who are working diligently to deliver another strong peak season for our customers. I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to sustain excellent services season while we continue to transform our global network, (inaudible) to the FedEx team.\nI'm encouraged by our second quarter results and the momentum underway against our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy. We exceeded our Q2 earnings target and cost action goals shared in September, even as the environment remained challenged.\nAt the same time, there is more work to be done. The declining demand trends we saw at the end of Q1 softened further in the second quarter, and we are moving faster and with more determination than ever to accelerate our cost actions. Today, we will provide more detail on those cost actions and our plan to structurally transform our network to be nimbler, leaner and more efficient, supported by our DRIVE program.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a snapshot of the quarter. Volumes declined across all segments, primarily at Express down low double digits. As such, revenue was down 3%, driven by a decline at FedEx Express, which was partially offset by growth at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.\nAdjusted operating margin and EPS declined with volume weakness, partially offset by higher yield and cost management actions. All of this said, we knew coming into this quarter that we would continue to be challenged by volume softness and high inflation.\nI'm exceptionally proud of the team's execution to date, which enabled us to exceed the second quarter earnings and cost targets. A great example of our meticulous focus on cost actions was a result at FedEx Ground, where, despite volume being down 9% in the quarter, we were able to grow both operating income and margin.\nAnd at FedEx Freight due to operating margin improved 320 basis points due to the continued focus on revenue quality, aligning the cost structure to lower volume levels and delivering an outstanding customer experience.\nNow I'll provide an update on our aggressive and decisive plan to cut costs in fiscal '23 relative to our June plan. In Q2, we achieved over $900 million of savings, exceeding the cost target we shared with you last quarter. This brings our total year-to-date progress to $1.2 billion. As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we have identified additional savings, bringing our target for fiscal year '23 to be approximately $3.7 billion in cuts.\nTurning to Slide 8. As we execute these cost actions, we are also laser-focused on delivering upon the superior service that has defined FedEx throughout our nearly 50-year history. As I mentioned, our team is performing exceptionally well this peak season, with ground time in transit in the U.S. at just 2 days. FedEx Ground is delivering holiday shipments faster to more locations than our nearest competitor. Our ground service is now back to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued enhancements to our route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies.\nService levels also continued to improve at Express. In Europe, we have made strong progress with Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. showing sustained high levels of service performance. The service challenges at Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport have been largely alleviated, and we are capitalizing on efficiencies in the network to further improve service.\nWe're taking swift action to address the remaining issues for our intra-Europe service, including the reopening of our Netherlands ground hub in October, which will continue to improve transit and depressurize the rest of the network and completing the Novara Italy road hub in February of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'll now provide an update on our ongoing structural transformation. We have spent 50 years building our networks and growing our portfolio. As a result, we now have the most extensive network of any provider in the industry. We are now focused on optimizing this network to realize our full value potential. This includes advancing our global transformation through DRIVE, our comprehensive program to support long-term profitability and deliver on our fiscal year '25 financial targets.\nDRIVE is how we are executing that strategy, achieving more than $4 billion in annualized structural cost reductions by fiscal year 2025.\nI'm confident I have the full commitment of our executive team, our Leading DRIVE with purpose and a sense of urgency and of Sriram Krishnasamy, our Chief Transformation Officer, who is facilitating the program.\nWe have identified 14 specific focus areas, which we call domains to target for efficiency improvements. Each is led by an executive sponsor and is aligned around a strategic vision for the business. We are measuring success against each domain's FY '25 permanent cost savings target in addition to using clear operational metrics to track financial and service level progress.\nOur focus within DRIVE is in 3 main areas: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and shared and allocated overhead expenses.\nAt Express, the team is transforming the network to be more agile, efficient and digitally led. An initial priority is to optimize the global air network where we expect to generate approximately $400 million in savings. This work includes deploying digital assets that allow us to efficiently balance our Purple tile airplanes and third-party lift as we build the network of the future.\nWe are also addressing our express pickup and delivery operations globally to improve efficiency. In February, we will implement a new U.S. network design that will improve P&D efficiency and result in cost savings of approximately $300 million annually.\nIn Europe, where we expect over 1/3 of Express' drive savings, we have spent the last several years bringing the networks together.\nWith integration behind us, we have shifted to optimization. We're adjusting our network, deploying route productivity tools and investing in digital capabilities for planning and automation. Additionally, we are rightsizing our intra-Europe air network and improving processes to enhance the end-to-end customer journey. This will all serve to improve both service and profit of our European business.\nNow turning to FedEx Ground. We are focused on every portion of the package life cycle. For instance, in linehaul operations, we are applying new tools, technology and processes to drive increased packages per trailer. Within Ground, we have a dock domain. This team's responsibility is to improve packages per labor hour. In Q2, that metric increased 3.5% year-over-year, and we expect continued improvement as we deploy additional capabilities.\nAcross both the Express and Ground focus areas, we are leveraging our operational insights platform. This provides the foundational data, tools and insights critical not only for delivering DRIVE savings goals but also for sustaining those savings and transforming the way we operate.\nFinally, shared and allocated overhead expenses are a significant opportunity. This includes procurement and digitizing and centralizing support functions. One example of digitizing support functions is our ability to reduce customer service calls by redirecting customers to best-in-class digital applications, a win for FedEx and a win for our customers.\nWithin procurement, we are reducing spend through our operate collaboratively model and creating a central function to optimize our enterprise spend. For example, we are setting up a cross-OpCo initiative to consolidate our contract transportation spend to realize value in the second half of fiscal year '23.\nIn conclusion, there is strong momentum underway as our team focuses on cutting costs immediately and structurally transforming our network.\nWe will continue to provide updates on our DRIVE progress, and we plan to host a DRIVE deep dive call in the first half of calendar 2023 to provide additional details on our ongoing transformation.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, to discuss recent market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. As expected, the operating environment in the second quarter was challenging. The trends we saw toward the end of the first quarter persisted through November. As a result, we experienced lower demand for FedEx products and services, but we acted with urgency to adjust our network while continuing to deliver for our customers.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to volume and yield softness in Europe and Asia. In Europe, we're making steady progress as volume trends improved quarter-over-quarter.\nI am confident in our momentum as we have a robust sales pipeline in Europe. We are leveraging our faster road network and our unique ability to bundle parcel and freight.\nAs we anticipated, the softening demand created yield pressure, especially in Asia. Despite volume softness, I am pleased with the team's ability to manage volume, share and margin in our trans-Pacific lane.\nAt FedEx Ground, revenue was up 2% due to higher yield driven by fuel surcharges, base rate increases and improved product mix. It was partially offset by lower volumes. We once again delivered strong service levels and best-in-market transit times.\nAt FedEx Freight, we delivered solid performance despite the operating environment beginning to moderate. Pricing discipline across the LTL industry is strong, and we expect the market to remain rational. Revenue was up 8% as the team remains laser-focused on driving improved revenue quality and profitable share growth.\nWhile navigating the current environment, FedEx Freight continues to innovate. We're expanding dimensional capture and piloting dimensional weight-based pricing. We believe this simplified pricing is the future of the LTL industry, and we're leading in this transformation.\nI also wanted to provide an update on our enterprise pricing strategy and the initiatives to improve revenue quality. We remain disciplined. We are focused on growth in the right segment to optimize network profitability. We announced a 6.9% general rate increase in September, and I remain confident in a continued high capture rate. We are also continuing to leverage surcharges to align our pricing to cost. Our recent announcement for demand-based large package and U.S. export fuel surcharge are good proof points.\nI'm also very pleased with the team's progress to create new capabilities. A great example is the partnership between pricing and DataWorks to build a price anomaly detection engine.\nThe team has had success detecting overbilling and correcting invoices before they are sent to our customers. This is a significant customer experience improvement. We are now adapting these capabilities to identify underbilling opportunities, which will increase revenue quality.\nAs we look toward the back half, service improvement has translated into good momentum for our sales team. In addition, we have a robust pipeline aligned with our strategy, which includes small and medium and European segment targets.\nIn Q4, we will be lapping the impact of the beginning of the war in the Ukraine as well as the air integration disruption we experienced in the region. As a result, our year-over-year volume comps will improve as we move through the back half of this fiscal year.\nHowever, in Asia, we do expect to face continued yield pressure due to lower demand for priority services. In the current economic environment, the market is increasingly shifting to deferred services. We have the deferred portfolio to capture the shift in demand, and our DRIVE program will ensure we have the right cost to serve to profitably manage through this market transition.\nIn conclusion, we remain prudent in our expectations for volume and yield in the second half of the fiscal year. That being said, our service value proposition relative to our competition will remain strong. And in fact, our relative market position will improve in the back half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lenz.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on Slide 16. In the second quarter, we delivered improved alignment between variable costs and lower revenue amid a more challenged volume environment that impacted our profitability. Second quarter revenue was approximately $700 million below the lower end of the range we expected coming into the quarter. Approximately $300 million of this variance was due to an accelerated decline in forwarding revenue at FedEx Logistics.\nThe remaining variance versus our Q2 outlook was driven about half by Express and the balance by Ground and Freight combined. We have moved faster to offset this shortfall with cost reductions, reducing the lag between incremental volume softness and the savings offsets realized. This, combined with an additional $200 million in discrete cost actions, led to improved earnings relative to our Q2 outlook.\nTurning to the Transportation segments. Starting with Express, profitability continues to be pressured. Adjusted operating income declined 65% due to lower volumes as cost reductions lagged accelerating volume declines.\nVolume pressures were partially offset by yield management actions. Package yield grew 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates, partially offset by exchange rate impacts.\nYield improvement slowed from Q1 levels across nearly all products and regions. In Ground, operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 130 basis points to 7.1%, supported by yield growth of 13% as higher fuel surcharges, product mix and pricing initiatives drove improvement.\nOur cost reduction actions, combined with solid execution by the ground team to adjust near-term variable costs amidst greater volume declines also supported margin improvement. These factors were partially offset by increased costs, including higher purchase transportation and other operating expenses.\nAnd at Freight, the team continues to drive strong profitability with operating income increasing 32%. This was driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by decreased shipments as well as higher wage rates.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'd like to build on what you heard from Raj on our near-term cost savings, reviewing our progress by category.\nAs mentioned, we've identified $3.7 billion in discrete cost reductions relative to our plans going into fiscal '23, which is $1 billion higher than our prior projection. Express is where we have the most work to do and where the majority of the reductions are focused. A large portion of those savings is coming from reduced flight frequencies.\nYear-to-date, we've reduced 8 international routes and 32 U.S. domestic routes, while parking 5 additional aircraft. This translates into pulling down U.S. domestic flight hours by 6% and international flight hours down 7% in the second quarter year-over-year.\nMoving to 18. In addition to the expense actions, we are also lowering our FY '23 capital spend forecast by an incremental $400 million to $5.9 billion, which represents an approximate $900 million reduction from our initial plans for the year. With the lower demand environment, we're deliberately deferring and slowing the pace of projects as we maintain the emphasis on using our assets more efficiently and reducing our overall capital intensity.\nOur liquidity remains a source of strength, and we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash. We continue to generate solid cash flows supporting our capital return strategy. We executed a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, which will be completed by the end of this calendar year.\nOur capital return strategy reflects our commitment to reducing capital intensity and creating value for shareholders while continuing to reinvest in FedEx for today and tomorrow.\nProvide additional context for the changes in demand during the first half and what we are planning for in our outlook, on Slide 19, we've shown first half monthly volume trends for our major product categories. Volume declines continued to accelerate across major product categories, both in the U.S. and internationally throughout the second quarter.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we expect volume declines to begin moderating in Express and Ground by the end of the third quarter with comparisons easing further in the fourth quarter as we lap the onset of softer volumes.\nYield growth will be increasingly pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shifts most prominently in Asia.\nThis brings me to our outlook on Slide 20. While we continue to aggressively drive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second half of FY '23. Our current expectation for full year adjusted earnings per share is between $13 and $14.\nOn a quarterly basis, we expect results to follow our historical seasonal pattern with lower earnings in the third quarter versus the second quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.\nSecond quarter adjusted expenses were essentially flat year-over-year as inflation impacts, particularly fuel, offset our activity reductions on an absolute basis.\nAs we move through the second half, we project year-over-year expenses to increasingly decline as our cost initiatives accelerate in conjunction with lapping certain inflationary increases.\nClosing, I'd like to reiterate that the entire team continues to aggressively identify and implement both immediate cost reductions as well as structural cost efficiencies to drive improved performance.\nWith that, we'll open it up for your questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, we want to recognize our SEC 8-K was filed earlier than planned due to a technical issue. The first quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. (Operator Instructions) We want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nFor additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer.\nAnd now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by acknowledging our pre-announced first quarter earnings results and updated outlook we provided last week. Our network capacity did not align with the demand we experienced as the quarter progressed. But as communicated last week, we have taken swift actions to address what's within our control. Getting cost out rapidly is my priority, and today, I will outline why I'm confident in our ability to drive improved performance and profitability through aggressive cost actions.\nBefore providing more details around these actions, let me briefly discuss what happened since we last spoke to you in June. We saw a decline in our volumes during the first quarter, which accelerated in the final weeks. Our softening volumes in Asia and the U.S. were predominantly due to the economy while the shortfall in Europe was both economic- and service-related. Therefore, we had costs in the system for volumes that didn't materialize. While we immediately took action, savings from these cost efforts lagged the volume decline due to the scale of our operations.\nAs a result, while revenue was up 6% year-over-year, these dynamics translated to volumes being down year-over-year at all our transportation segments. The volume decline directly impacted our bottom line, driving total company adjusted operating income down roughly 18% year-over-year.\nNow what matters most is what we are doing about it, and this brings me to our aggressive and decisive plan to reduce costs. I'll speak to you -- I'll speak to our actions in 2 parts: first, our fiscal year '23 steps to immediately reduce costs; and second, our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow transformation strategy to permanently reduce cost and optimize our network. Starting with fiscal year '23, we are prioritizing cost actions to generate $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of savings, of which about $1 billion will be permanent.\nTaking each key contributor in turn, at FedEx Express, we expect to drive $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in savings this fiscal year. The largest single expected contributor in fiscal '23 will be the changes we are making to our express air network as we cut global flight hours. This reduction includes 11% of pan-Pacific daily frequencies, 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies and 17% of daily frequencies on the lane between Asia and Europe. As volumes deteriorated later in the quarter, we began making these structural changes to our network. The impact of these initial changes will be fully realized in October, and the benefit of our continued actions will steadily increase throughout the fiscal year.\nWe are also evaluating additional reductions to be implemented post peak. Further, we're taking steps to enhance our ground efficiency, including reducing routes, hours, vehicle rentals and other on-road expenses. For example, in Europe, we are altering ground network routes to improve productivity, leading to a reduction of approximately 11% of routes in the U.K. and 12% in Germany.\nNow turning to FedEx Ground. We expect savings in Ground to be $350 million to $500 million in fiscal '23. Our approach to cutting costs in Ground primarily centers around rationalizing our operations. We are consolidating sorts, which will reduce costs while maintaining service and have canceled several planned ground network capacity projects. And as mentioned last week, we're also reducing select Sunday operations in over 170 stations. Mike will provide more details on our capital plans shortly.\nThe final components of our expected fiscal '23 savings will be from overhead expenses as we rightsize our overall cost structure. These actions include our plans to close nearly 140 FedEx office locations and at least 5 corporate office facilities. Additionally, FedEx Services has stopped all noncritical projects. In total, our overhead reduction actions, including FedEx services, will contribute $350 million to $500 million. We realized nearly $300 million in cost savings from these actions in Q1 and expect approximately another $700 million in Q2, with the remainder of the fiscal '23 savings realized during the second half of the year.\nThe second part of our cost plan is focused on permanent reductions, and we have launched DRIVE, a program supporting our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy introduced in June. DRIVE is how we execute on that strategy. Our team has already started implementing cost reductions under this program, and this will ultimately enable Network 2.0, the long-term end-to-end trend optimization of our network. Sriram Krishnasamy, our newly appointed Chief Transformation Officer, will facilitate DRIVE and continue reporting directly to me. In total, we expect to take out an additional $4 billion in costs related to DRIVE by fiscal year 2025. To be clear, these are incremental to the fiscal '23 savings I just outlined. These transformational changes will lay the foundation for Network 2.0, which will create an additional $2 billion benefit over the long term.\nIn closing, we are focused on actions we can control as we stabilize our near-term performance and execute against our long-term strategy. I'd like to sincerely thank our highly motivated team for their hard work and dedication to deliver upon the Purple Promise.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, to discuss market trends that underpin our outlook and our commercial strategy in some more detail.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Raj discussed, during the first quarter, manufacturing, global trade and consumer spending decelerated, particularly late in the quarter and certainly more than we anticipated. As a result, our first quarter volumes were lower than we forecasted. Our current expectations for 2022 U.S. GDP growth and U.S. industrial production forecasts have declined by about 100 basis points since June.\nData shows that U.S. consumer spending has slowed as inflation remains a challenge. Further, consumption is skewed towards services, demonstrated by the fact that in June, excluding auto, the real retail inventory to sales ratio fully recovered to its pre-pandemic level. From October to June, the real inventory to sales ratio, excluding automotive, increased 14 basis points, which was the fastest gain over an 8-month period in the 25-year history of the series.\nAlso, real retail sales, including auto, after growing 4.6% and 10.8% in calendar year '21 and '22, respectively, are now down 3.1% year-over-year through July and are pacing to have the worst decline since The Great Recession.\nTurning to our transportation businesses. I'd like to spend a moment on the dynamics occurring within FedEx Express and most specifically in Asia and Europe. Starting with Asia, our results were impacted by macroeconomic weakness. Our lower demand is consistent with the broader market, with ocean and air freight rates under pressure in recent weeks. A good indicator of how quickly the market changed in Asia is to review the spot rates coming out of Hong Kong and Shanghai. In June and July, spot rates were between 20% and 40% higher year-over-year, respectively. In early August, these rates fell to single digits, and by the end of the month, Shanghai had plummeted to a 10% decline year-over-year, while Hong Kong rates were flat.\nThrough June, which is the latest data available, we have had small market share gains in our Asia region. In Europe, the economy was weaker than we anticipated and service further pressured our results. Our network integration was successfully completed in March, but it is an incredibly complicated effort to combine 2 individual networks of this scale. Throughout the quarter, we continued to refine our standard operating procedures to improve service levels and create momentum across our European division.\nMoving now to FedEx Ground. Revenue growth was driven by higher yields from higher fuel surcharges, base rate increases and improved volume mix. Despite volumes being lower than anticipated, we have held market share in the United States. FedEx Ground has strong service levels, best-in-market transit times and an exciting new picture proof of delivery capability. We are ready to deliver for peak. We will remain nimble in leveraging peak surcharges to balance demand and the capacity of our network as we monitor volume trends.\nAnd at FedEx Freight, momentum continues to build. The Freight team delivered another strong quarter marked by 21% revenue growth. The team continues to drive disciplined execution, focused on revenue quality and profitable share growth. For the company overall, we continue to execute our revenue quality strategy and pursue business that provides attractive yields.\nWe continue to deliver new pricing capabilities, and we've taken recent actions to stay well positioned relative to the market as we approach peak. We have maintained a brisk pace for repricing contracts for the renewals and continue to negotiate strong increases.\nWe just announced a 6.9% general rate increase this coming January in our response to inflationary pressures on our costs. We also announced our new remote area surcharge and peak residential pricing in the United States. In Europe and Asia, we will launch a new handling surcharge as well as [January]. In August, we implemented international fuel surcharge table adjustments for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Fuel surcharges are an important pricing tool. We rigorously monitor fuel prices to ensure that we are appropriately positioned relative to the market.\nWe're moving with speed and agility to reposition our business model for today's operating environment. As you heard from Raj, we had a great -- we have a great opportunity to align costs with volume levels. We are committed to doing this while executing against our commercial strategy and delivering for our customers. Importantly, we're still focused on the longer-term opportunity growing in high-value segments, driving improved service quality and, of course, delivering an outstanding customer experience.\nI am really pleased with how our teams have responded in this dynamic environment, and we are well positioned to deliver during the upcoming peak season. Service is strong and we have a fantastic value proposition.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lenz.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie. While revenue was up 6% for the quarter, profitability was challenged with operating income down 18% on an adjusted basis, and adjusted operating margin down 150 basis points year-over-year. At Express, adjusted operating income declined 72% due to lower average daily package and freight volume and increased expenses as cost reductions lagged volume declines. These factors were partially offset by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges. Package yield, including fuel, grew 16% year-over-year.\nTurning to Ground. Operating income increased 3%, primarily due to yield improvement and home delivery volume growth. Yield including fuel grew 12% year-over-year. These factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses, driven by increased purchase transportation and other operating expenses.\nFreight delivered another strong quarter with operating income increasing over 67% as the Freight team continues to execute. This was driven by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges. Yield, including the surcharges, grew 27%. This was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits as well as lower shipment volumes.\nTo address the changed environment, we're focused on what's within our control and moving with urgency to take costs out of the network. Our team is operating at speed to identify cost-saving opportunities and accelerate for implementation.\nThe $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion fiscal '23 savings we're targeting are relative to our initial plans heading into the year. The majority of this year's savings will come from Express where the demand change has been most pronounced. We expect about $1 billion of our fiscal '23 savings to be permanent in nature, with slight reduction as the largest component along with corporate and back office costs. These permanent cost reductions were not part of the Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy we shared in June, which is about how we structurally optimize our networks. These reductions are directly related to flexing in a changed environment with a view to build back differently in the future.\nAs Raj mentioned, we remain committed to the profit improvement objectives we shared at our June investors meeting. We have launched efforts to accelerate initiatives, identify incremental opportunities and implement metrics to track progress under the DRIVE program.\nSo next, I'll give more details on the targeted $4 billion savings by fiscal '25 enabled by DRIVE. About $1.4 billion of the total will come from the FedEx Express operating expenses. Four largest areas of opportunity we are actively advancing are: first, restructuring the air network by reducing routes and more efficiently deploying crews, aircraft and commercial line haul; next, optimization of sort, surface line haul and on-road design to improve efficiency, asset utilization and service; next, driving efficiencies of Europe, as we've discussed previously; and lastly, harmonizing global clearance processes to lower cost.\nAbout $1.1 billion of the total will come from FedEx Ground operating expenses via dock productivity initiatives, network and line haul efficiencies and reduced liability costs. And approximately $1.5 billion will come from shared and allocated overhead expenses led by procurement savings, back-office automation and infrastructure modernization, increased deployment of digital self-service and further consolidation of shared service functions.\nMoving to our capital spending plans. We've reduced our forecast for capital spend for fiscal 2023 to $6.3 billion compared to our prior $6.8 billion forecast. We're intensely focused on allocating capital to the most attractive ROIC initiatives. Our liquidity remains a source of strength as we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. And based on our cash flows and liquidity, we remain committed to our capital return strategy, including our plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2023. We expect to purchase $1 billion in the second quarter.\nOur capital return strategy reflects our confidence in our business despite the headwinds we're currently navigating. We have significant flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation and preserve a resilient balance sheet.\nNow turning to second quarter guidance. While we continue to drive aggressive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second quarter. As a result and consistent with the update we provided last week, currently expecting revenue of between $23.5 billion to $24 billion in the fiscal second quarter, and adjusted earnings per share, excluding costs related to business optimization and realignment initiatives of $2.75 or greater in the second quarter.\nFor the remainder of the year, while we are not providing guidance, given current uncertainties, our plan is based on an expectation that the weak trends we saw in late Q1 will persist across our major geographies. This is embedded in our guidance for the second quarter and driving our cost takeout initiatives for the fiscal year.\nLonger term, we remain committed to our fiscal 2025 targets for operating margin improvement, return on invested capital and capital intensity that we shared with you in June. We're leaning more heavily into cost actions to get to those goals.\nThe start of the year presented greater-than-expected challenges, but I can assure you that we are moving with urgency to address these pressures while remaining focused on creating long-term value by prioritizing revenue quality, expanding margins and elevating financial returns through profitable growth and reduced capital intensity.\nAnd with that, we'll open it up for your questions.",

I'd like to start by thanking Team FedEx for continuing to move the world forward amid unanticipated challenges. This was recently displayed during Operation Fly Formula, where, in response to the critical shortage rippling across the United States, we have moved hundreds of thousands of pounds of baby formula from Europe to the U.S. And this weekend, our team will move 52 tons of medical relief to Poland for Ukrainian refugees in coordination with Direct Relief International.\nNow turning to our financials. I'm proud to share that in the face of an increasingly challenging global backdrop, we finished fiscal '22 with our highest-ever revenue of $93.5 billion and adjusted operating income of $6.9 billion, both up 11% year-over-year. This is a testament to our value proposition and continued execution against our long-term strategy.\nAs I shared on the last call, we have worked through many network inefficiencies caused by labor shortages. Although wage rates remain higher than this time last year, they are stabilizing. Still, COVID-related conditions slowed global recovery and pressured second half performance.\nWhile Q4 volumes were down year-over-year at all our transportation segments compared to an extraordinary fiscal year '21, we successfully implemented strategic actions that drove double-digit yield improvement across the board, with Express composite yield per package up 20%, Ground up 11% and Freight yield per shipment up 28%.\nWe remain focused on revenue quality as one of the key levers to help offset the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and driving improved margins going forward.\nTurning to Express. Even in the face of higher operating expenses related to inflationary pressures, we delivered improved quarterly operating income and revenue. Thoughtful execution of our new revenue management actions has allowed us to overcome headwinds from COVID lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical uncertainty in Europe.\nAt FedEx Ground, we experienced modest revenue growth driven by higher yields as a result of pricing actions and improved volume mix. Volumes declined year-over-year due to our efforts to constrain economy volume as well as lower customer demand.\nWe will continue to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities through operational adjustments, including multiple preload and relay operations. Ground operating expenses continued to be pressured by higher purchase transportation and wage rates, although we see these pressures stabilizing.\nWe continue to proactively address labor availability head on through multiple levers as we increase the front-line retention and refined the recently launched package handler scheduling tool, will not only ensure we have the right level of staffing for every sort based on volume, will ensure a workforce that is safe, efficient and highly engaged to stay and grow with the company.\nAdditionally, we are implementing several technology-based initiatives that are driving increased productivity in our line haul and dock operations as well as continuing our efforts to optimize the last mile. We're seeing early benefit from these efforts, with productivity of Ground dock operations improving 6% in Q4 compared to Q3.\nFedEx Freight once again delivered outstanding results with fourth quarter operating margin of almost 22% driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. A job well done to Lance Moll on his first full fiscal year as Freight CEO and to our Freight and Commercial teams for their solid execution.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect the macroeconomic risks both in the U.S. and globally to continue to put stress on supply chains and trade. Brie will cover this in more detail shortly. Let me now reaffirm confidence in our key strategies.\nAs CEO, my focus is maximizing total shareholder return driven by improved revenue quality, higher margins and a balanced capital allocation strategy, which Mike will provide more color on shortly. Importantly, our foundational long-term investments have set the stage one of the strong year, driven by focus on lowering our cost to serve.\nA great example of where we are going to lower our cost to serve is in Europe. The integrated network and consolidation of many flights into our Charles de Gaulle hub allows us to improve operational efficiency and enhances our network. For instance, since April, the number of European airports we service from CDG increased by 71%, but the number of flights intra-Europe was reduced by 13%. We're confident that actions like this will drive bottom line improvement in fiscal year '23.\nAs we move forward, I'm honored to lead our global team who enable FedEx to deliver what's next. And speaking of what's next, we are looking forward to hosting our investors in Memphis in a few days. Our goal for this 2-day event is for attendees to leave with a deep understanding of our strategies, including financial targets and priorities and how we plan to execute.\nNow before I turn it over to Brie, I'd like to say a few words about FedEx Express' President and CEO, Don Colleran, whose 40-year career with FedEx has been nothing but short of exceptional. As one of the pioneers of our international business, he helped lay a foundation for the significant growth in that sector of the FedEx portfolio. Since assuming his current role in 2019, he's launched new capabilities for our customers and led our global FedEx Express team through some of the most challenging times, including the COVID pandemic.\nAs announced in March, Don will move into CEO Executive Advisor role in September of this year in support of Richard Smith's transition to the CEO of FedEx Express and will retire from FedEx in December. Don, we appreciate your service and countless contributions to this company. We wish you nothing but the best in your well-deserved next chapter.\nAnd now let me turn it over to Brie, who last week was named Chief Customer Officer in a move that aligns several teams under her leadership to give us even greater focus on our commercial strategy and our end-to-end customer experience. So Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nChief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj. It's an honor and a privilege to take on this responsibility to deliver for our customers and drive quality growth for our shareholders. I'd like to reflect on fiscal year '22, then drill down to fourth quarter '22 revenues. Finally, I will discuss the outlook for fiscal year 2023.\nFiscal year 2022 was another year of change for FedEx. The operating environment was quite challenging, requiring flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and front-line team members to ensure we deliver for our customers. I am proud of how our team rose to this challenge. We executed against our commercial strategy and remained intently focused on revenue quality across the business.\nIn the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue increased 8% year-over-year. Revenue management actions drove our growth, which was partially offset by lower shipment demand. FedEx Ground and FedEx Express generated year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and 6%, respectively, despite lower volume levels.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield management actions affecting our FedEx Ground Economy service is the primary factor behind volume declines, with FedEx Ground Economy volumes down 36%. In contrast, our commercial and our home delivery volumes declined 1% due to macroeconomic conditions.\nAt FedEx Express, COVID lockdowns, geopolitical uncertainty and slower economic growth contributed to package volume decline of 11%. In some areas, we also selectively reduced volume to ensure we could deliver the service that is expected of FedEx.\nFedEx Freight had a banner revenue quality quarter, growing yield of 28%. FedEx Freight's market-leading value proposition, combined with the disciplined execution of our sales team, drove these exceptional results. The FedEx Freight team continues to do a phenomenal job at managing revenue quality.\nNow let me take a moment to discuss 2023. We anticipate consumers will keep spending, and their spending will continue tilting towards services from goods. We expect more consumers to return to stores. With this backdrop, we do expect pressure on B2C volumes.\nThrough May, industrial activity has been solid. But today's June flash of PMI was a sharp decline. Further, after a strong build late last year and early this year, inventory restocking is slowing. This will dampen Freight demand.\nOur international businesses continue to navigate a dynamic environment. Global trade growth has slowed from disruptions related to lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine, limiting the flow of goods and reducing international export volumes. We do anticipate supply chain disruptions throughout the fiscal year.\nWe continue to expect passenger airlines to fully recover to pre-COVID levels, and that, that recovery will take some time. Belly capacity on passenger airlines is expected to remain constrained in fiscal year 2023, resulting in a pricing environment still favorable to FedEx if a little less than before.\nThe Europe to Asia lane is estimated to recover in Q1 calendar year '24, and belly capacity on trans-Pacific airlines is estimated to recover in Q3 calendar year '24. Commercial capacity between Europe and Asia is not expected to recover until Q1 of calendar year 2025.\nOur fiscal '23 forecast assumes a normalized economic environment. The factors I discussed earlier have been incorporated into our volume forecast. Our volume forecast has low single-digit volume growth.\nWe've also prepared plans to manage through a slowing economic environment, if required. We will take costs and revenue actions to mitigate impact of further economic softening, incorporating the lessons learned over the last 2 extraordinary years.\nIn fiscal '23, we will execute a very targeted growth strategy. We will prioritize revenue quality and our intent on pursuing business that provides attractive yields on our assets.\nWe expect the pricing environment will remain rational here in the United States and also around the world. We believe that the systemic changes, especially e-commerce peak surcharges, are durable changes for the industry. We are closely monitoring both inflation and fuel prices. And as a reminder, we adjust our fuel surcharge weekly in response to market rates.\nI am confident we have the tools to get -- to continue getting inflation plus pricing. Strong revenue quality is possible because we will target customers who value FedEx's unique capabilities.\nLet me talk about 4 of our favorite capabilities. First, we're the only provider to bundle our parcel and LTL portfolio. Second, FedEx Ground has 2 very significant advantages over our primary competitor. FedEx Ground is faster to more locations than UPS Ground, and FedEx Ground delivers on Sunday while UPS does not. Third, we continue to evolve our digital portfolio. Express and Ground are the first nationwide carriers to announce we will provide a picture proof of delivery for every U.S. residential delivery that doesn't require a signature. And fourth, we have a robust intercontinental offering for both B2B and B2B segments. FedEx provides fabulous solutions for the world's manufacturing, health care, high-tech and e-commerce customers.\nIn closing, this has been an extraordinary year for FedEx. We generated strong growth, executed on our revenue quality strategy and overcame industry-wide challenges. Our plan for fiscal '23 incorporates a dynamic environment, and we have the right strategies and the right team in place to deliver profitable growth and margin improvement.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings per share improving 37% year-over-year, revenue increasing 8% and consolidated adjusted operating margin expanding 50 basis points to 9.2%. These results reflect the outcome of the revenue management emphasis Brie described as we aggressively adjust to mitigate continued inflationary cost pressures.\nNotable fourth quarter year-over-year expense items included higher self-insurance costs, primarily at Ground, as well as a roughly $130 million impact from higher rates for both wages and purchased transportation. Offsetting these headwinds were favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $300 million and last year's $100 million contribution to Yale University to support our carbon neutrality goals.\nWith that overview of consolidated results, I'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. Ground reported a 4% increase in revenue with operating income down approximately $260 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10%. Self-insurance expense increased approximately $200 million, reflecting a higher loss experience as well as an adjustment to the reserve for the projected cost of claims. We have multiple initiatives underway to mitigate the cost of risk, including new vehicle safety technology and driver certification standards in our service provider agreements.\nThe strong 11% yield improvement at Ground was not enough to offset that headwind, along with higher cost of wages and purchased transportation. Looking forward, the continued revenue quality emphasis in conjunction with specific productivity and workforce initiatives will drive improved profitability. Stabilization of the labor market will also support further traction in these areas.\nAt Express, adjusted operating income increased by nearly 10% year-over-year, with operating margin improving by 20 basis points to 8.2%. This improvement was driven by higher yields, including the favorable net impact of fuel and lower variable compensation, which more than offset volume declines.\nIn addition, crew cost per flight hour have been further elevated as operating the network has had to accommodate not only COVID protocols, but also to the routing changes to avoid layovers and locations with stricter COVID regulations as well as conflict airspace.\nFreight had an incredible finish to the year, with revenue for the fourth quarter increasing 23% and operating profit growing 67%. These outstanding results are a testimony to Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth as we build on our strengths as the leader in the LTL market.\nTurning to FY '23. We are projecting continued momentum with a range of 9% to 19% adjusted earnings per share improvement. We expect margin expansion at all of our transportation segments on an adjusted basis as we execute on key priorities, including enhanced revenue quality beyond inflation, technology-driven operational efficiency improvements and increasing utilization of our assets.\nAs we begin fiscal 2023, we are seeing the lower customer demand trends we experienced in the fourth quarter continue into June and expect first quarter volumes will continue to be pressured. In addition, Express continues to experience flight constraints due to crew COVID protocols, as has been highlighted industry-wide.\nWe do expect both Express air network efficiency and year-over-year volume comparisons across all of our transportation segments to strengthen as we go through the fiscal year. In addition, our outlook includes an approximately $450 million noncash pension headwind due to lower asset returns realized in fiscal 2022. This is all below the line expense that will be recognized evenly over the year.\nOur retirement plan's operating expense will be relatively flat as lower pension expense will be offset by higher 401(k) expense. And as a reminder, our primary U.S. pension plans were closed to new entrants beginning in 2020, and we introduced a new 401(k) plan with a higher company match in January of 2022. Our projection for the full year effective tax rate is approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments and costs related to business optimization initiatives.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our fiscal 2022 adjusted free cash flow of $3.6 billion supported the repurchase of approximately $2.2 billion of our stock and $800 million of dividend payments. In addition, we funded $500 million in voluntary pension contributions and ended the year with a solid $6.9 billion in cash. As we look to fiscal 2023, we remain focused on driving total shareholder return and thoughtfully allocating capital.\nFirst, we will continue to invest in attractive ROIC initiatives. Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures are projected to be roughly the same as the $6.8 billion invested during fiscal '22, which came in lower than our initial $7.2 billion estimate as supply chain considerations extended time lines. Facility investment at Ground will decline as well aircraft expenditures at Express. Offsetting that is increased investment in vehicle replacement, including rollout of our vehicle electrification initiatives as well as additional automation projects. We project fiscal 2023 CapEx as a percent of revenue to be under 7% compared to 7.2% for fiscal 2022.\nNext, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of stock in the first half of fiscal 2023. And of course, as we announced last week, we are raising our dividend by over 50%, which increases our adjusted payout ratio to over 20%. These significant shareholder return advances reflect confidence in our continued execution and ability to adapt to the evolving market. And lastly, I'd add we are projecting $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to the U.S. plans.\nSo we entered fiscal 2023 with a strong foundation for driving improved profitability and returns. We are mindful of the uncertainty across many fronts, including the pace of global economic activity, inflation, energy prices, additional pandemic developments and further geopolitical risks. We're actively adjusting to these changing circumstances.\nIn closing, we are focused on delivering shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, lowering our capital intensity and improving returns to shareholders. And we look forward to sharing additional insights about our plans for this year and beyond at our investor meeting next week here in Memphis.\nNow we'll be happy to address your questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stack book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about 1 year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media. (Operator Instructions)\nI want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of our safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and COO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive VP, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. And now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, COO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everybody. First and foremost, our thoughts are with those affected by the ongoing violence in Ukraine. The safety of our team members in Ukraine is our utmost priority, and we are providing them with financial assistance and various resources for support. We have suspended all services in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Additionally, we are helping to move relief to Ukraine, and we have provided more than $1.5 million in humanitarian aid.\nTurning to Q3. Execution of our strategies resulted in substantially higher operating income for the quarter as Team FedEx delivered yet another outstanding peak season. December 2021 was our most profitable December in FedEx history. Our ability to handle the influx of packages was years in the making as we've taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network and support of customers large and small.\nWe have fundamentally changed our performance as we handled increased e-commerce volume during peak and set a new precedent for peak seasons moving forward. Having said that, we are laser focused on improving our margins. You'll hear us talk more about this today and then more specifically at our upcoming Investor Day.\nEven with the successful execution of peak, the new year brought new challenges, mostly driven by Omicron. This affected our business in 2 ways: first, we experienced staffing shortages, particularly in our air operations. In January alone, the absentee rate of our crew due to Omicron was over 15%, which caused significant flight disruptions. Second, our customers experienced Omicron-driven staffing shortages, which reduced demand for our services, especially in U.S. domestic and European markets. Both of those factors resulted in softer-than-expected volume levels, especially in January. We estimate the effect of Omicron-driven volume softness in our Q3 results was approximately $350 million.\nWhile it was significant, it was also temporary and we have seen volume rebound from January levels. Even with these challenges, FedEx Express delivered strong adjusted operating income growth of 27% year-over-year. Speaking of the Express team, we announced that after nearly 40 years of distinguished service, Don Colleran, President and CEO of FedEx Express, will retire later this year and named Richard Smith, current Executive Vice President of Global Support and Regional President of Americas at FedEx Express, as a successor. We'll have much more to say about Don and his countless contributions to the business during our call in June.\nFedEx Freight once again delivered strong results with third quarter operating income nearly tripling year-over-year, driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. Turning to FedEx Ground. Operating costs continue to be challenged by the competitive labor environment now primarily manifesting in increased labor rates. We estimate the total impact of approximately $210 million at ground in the third quarter, which is significantly lower than what we saw in Q1 and Q2 as we have seen substantial improvement in labor availability (inaudible)\nWith the stabilization in the labor environment, I'm pleased to share that we have successfully unwound network adjustments that were necessary to provide service but cost inefficiencies. Staffing levels and the rapid acceleration in labor costs have stabilized and our network is operating at normal levels. Despite improvement in the labor headwind, volume levels in Q3 were softer than we had previously forecasted, in part due to Omicron surge slowing customer demand. As such, we expect our second half Ground margins will be lower than our previous expectations and not reach double digits.\nOver the years, FedEx Ground has built a strong foundation to serve B2B and small and medium customers with an unmatched value proposition. As a result, we have grown market share in these segments and they remain strong priorities for the future. And then more than 3 years ago, we built upon this foundation and embarked on a strategy that positioned FedEx squarely in the center of the fast-growing e-commerce market with a differentiated portfolio and a diversified customer base. This included a period of strategically investing in our network to meet growing market demand.\nLet me note here that this strategy is different than what our primary competitor has pursued. By building on our current base of business and making those prior investments in our network to facilitate growth, we are in a position to generate improved operating profit and margins. We saw this potential in our financial results for December prior to the surge of Omicron.\nAnd moving forward, our financial performance will be further enhanced by maximizing existing assets, improving capital utilization and leveraging technologies that facilitate optimization of our existing physical capacity and staffing.\nAs we prepare to close fiscal year '22, permit me a moment to share what's on the horizon for FedEx as we continue to focus on margin expansion and shareholder return. In addition to the opportunity to enhance performance at Ground that I just discussed, we have other levers for profitable growth, which include: number one, driving improved results in Europe; number two, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks, lower our cost to serve and enhance return on capital; and number three, unlocking new value through digital innovation. Of course, we'll do this in an environment of strong revenue quality management.\nOur International business, particularly Europe, remains a big profit opportunity. Air network integration remains on track for the end of the month to complete the physical integration of TNT into FedEx Express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks, both in the air and on the road. Paris CDG airport will serve as the main hub for all European and intercontinental flights. Liege will connect specific large European markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth.\nOur expanded collaboration across operating companies will utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter and more calculated manner. For example, FedEx Freight trucks have traveled more than 7 million miles while operating on behalf of FedEx Ground this fiscal year. FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched more than 36,000 times. We'll continue to comprehensively look at all our assets and our network to put the right package in the right network and the right cost to serve.\nAdditionally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation, our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies that will drive increased productivity in our linehaul and dock operations as well as in the last mile. Enhanced sortation technology will be operational at FedEx Ground in hundreds of facilities fired as we speak. It will increase upstream efficiencies, enabling managers to do better balance and planned sortation operations, thereby unlocking key capacity. For example, during Cyber Week, this technology helped keep 1.9 million ground economy packages out of constrained sorts.\nWe're also modernizing the planning and staffing of our dock operations as well as the systems, training and technology that maximizes productivity on every sort. One such example is a recently rolled out package handler scheduling technology that will help ensure the right staffing levels for every sort and every facility across the Ground network. This will improve dock productivity. And when combined with a focus on employee retention, it will enable us to significantly reduce the cost of turnover and strategically target recruiting spend when and where necessary.\nFor last mile, we continue to improve upon the optimization technology already implemented to enable service providers to make real-time decisions that enhance their business' daily efficiency. These ongoing investments in automation and technology have helped FedEx build the most flexible and responsive network in the industry and will enable us to improve our margins.\nIn closing, we have the networks, the strategy and the right team in place as we deliver financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. With that, let me turn it over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Marketing & Communications Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. Several macroeconomic forces, including the tragic conflict in Ukraine, uncertainty around the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices and inflationary pressure have dampened the current GDP outlook globally and for the United States. Last week, we lowered our economic outlook. U.S. GDP is now expected to increase 3.4% in calendar year 2022, revised down from 3.7%, and our outlook is 2.3% in calendar year 2023, with consumer spending tilting towards services and B2B growth supported by inventory rebuilding.\nGlobal GDP growth is expected to be 3.5% in calendar year 2022, previously 4.1% and it will be 3.1% in calendar year 2023. Growth will be driven by the release of pent-up demand for services while investment demand and inventory restocking support global manufacturing and trade. Given the tremendous fluidity of the macroeconomic environment, we will continue to update our outlook. Our teams are ready to adjust plans, as required, to drive margin improvement despite the dynamic environment in which we operate.\nWith fuel prices increasing around the world, today, we announced a fuel surcharge increase effective April 4 for FedEx Express, Ground and Freight. Additional details can be found on fedex.com. The change in economic outlook does not change our confidence that e-commerce will continue to drive strong parcel market growth. We believe the e-commerce growth rate in the United States will be in the mid- to high single digits for the next 3 to 4 years.\nWe will continue to build differentiated value propositions to achieve market-leading pricing in all our customer segments, including e-commerce, our small and medium customers and our commercial B2B business. We are very pleased with the results of our revenue quality strategy and know we have a great opportunity to increase the flow-through to margin expansion. In the third quarter, revenue growth was 10% year-over-year, with double-digit yield improvement for FedEx Express and FedEx Freight, close behind with FedEx Ground at 9% year-over-year yield improvement.\nIn the United States, our package revenue grew 9% in Q3 on strong yield improvement of 10%. We executed on our peak pricing strategy in the month of December, delivering more than $250 million in peak surcharge revenue. Softness in parcel volumes came predominantly from constraining FedEx Ground economy and the effects of Omicron on both our network and on our customers.\nThe focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth drove outstanding results for FedEx Freight this quarter. For the quarter, revenue increased 23% year-over-year, driven by a 19% increase in revenue per shipment. Additionally, FedEx Freight Direct continues to gain great momentum as an e-commerce solution for heavy bulky items with phenomenal growth in Q3 year-over-year.\nOur international businesses are navigating a dynamic environment. Capacity constraints continue to be a reality. At this point, valet capacity on Trans-Atlantic passenger airlines is expected to recover faster than Trans-Pacific. Passenger airline capacity is not expected to fully recover to pre-COVID levels until 2024 or even later across our largest global trade lanes.\nScarce capacity on international lanes and strong demand out of Asia is resulting in a continued favorable pricing environment. With the completion of our integrated air network at the end of this month, we have 1 European air network and 1 road network in and out of Europe. Our international portfolio of services contains the best European road network, the broadest U.S. next-day coverage and a combined parcel and freight offering that no one else in the market has. As a result of the integration, we will be able to offer improved transit times, earlier delivery and later pickup services to more customers in more locations.\nSeven new countries will now be connected on a next-day basis within Europe, while 14 countries will be expanding our new delivery coverage. In several countries, this will be the first time we have introduced next-day service to the rest of Europe. We will leverage the expanded European portfolio to improve international profitability, drive revenue growth and gain market share.\nIn addition to the improvements in our European value proposition, we have made significant strides to enhance our digital solutions as well. In January, we enhanced our tracking service based on an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx DataWorks. This new experience delivers greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments through all tracking channels. This improves both the shipper and the recipient experience, and it will reduce calls to customer service.\nAdditionally, our new modernized FedEx Ship Manager, which is our online shipping application, has now been rolled out in more than 153 countries. In January, we began introducing customers to it in the United States and Canada. FedEx Ship Manager is the primary shipping application for our small and medium customer segment. We believe a market-leading digital portfolio will enable FedEx to continue to take market share in this very profitable segment.\nIn summary, we remain optimistic about Q4 and beyond, and we'll continue to deliver on our market-leading value proposition. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. After a strong start to the third quarter with the most profitable December in company history, January was significantly influenced by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and its negative effect on our operations and the macro environment. These challenges subsided during February, resulting in third quarter adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 37% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.\nThere are a number of factors influencing our third quarter results for both this year and last year that I will cover. As Raj explained the effects on our operations, I will give further context for the financial implications. First, labor market conditions, although much improved, once again had a significant effect on our results at an estimated $350 million year-over-year, which was primarily experienced at Ground. For the third quarter, that was primarily due to higher rates for both purchase transportation and wages. Labor availability-driven network inefficiencies were significantly less of a factor in the third quarter compared to earlier in the year.\nThe implications from the Omicron variant surge reduced third quarter operating income by an estimated $350 million, predominantly at Express, as it influenced customer demand and pressured our operations, resulting in constrained capacity, network disruptions and lower volumes and revenue.\nThe third quarter had favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $380 million, including the onetime Express hourly bonus last year and significantly less impactful winter weather that (inaudible) to $310 million.\nWith that overview of the consolidated results of the third quarter, I'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. Ground reported a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, with operating income down approximately $60 million and an operating margin at 7.3%. While pressures from constrained labor markets began subsiding, the effect was still significant at an estimated $210 million year-over-year, predominantly due to the higher purchase transportation and wage rates.\nIn addition, our volume was softer than expected due to the Omicron variant surge slowing customer demand. A 9% yield improvement partially offset these headwinds, and our teams remain very focused on improving ground performance, as Raj outlined earlier.\nExpress adjusted operating income increased by 27% year-over-year, driven by higher yields and a net fuel benefit, with adjusted operating margin increasing by 100 basis points to 5.8%. Express results also benefited in the third quarter from $285 million of lower variable compensation as well as much less severe winter weather.\nThe strong results were partially offset by the headwinds I mentioned earlier, with the Omicron surge having the largest effect, especially during January, of an estimated $240 million. Team member absences primarily among our pilot severely disrupted operations, requiring many flight cancellations and further constraining capacity. Additionally, during this time, the Omicron surge reduced customer demand in many parts of the world.\nFreight had another outstanding quarter, delivering an operating margin of 15%, 850 basis points higher year-over-year, and revenue for the third quarter increased 23% with operating income up over 180% despite the pressures from higher purchase transportation rates and wages. And for the first time in Freight's history, they realized sequential operating income and operating margin improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter. This is all thanks to Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended our quarter with $6.1 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2022. As I emphasized last quarter, our stronger cash flow provides extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation. As such, I'm pleased to share the accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter was completed during Q3 with 6.1 million shares delivered under the ASR agreement. Total repurchases during fiscal '22 are nearly 9 million shares or 3% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.\nThe decrease in outstanding shares resulting from the ASR benefited third quarter results by $0.06 per diluted share. Also during the quarter, we made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan and have funded $500 million year-to-date.\nNow turning to what's ahead. We are affirming our full year adjusted EPS range at $20.50 to $21.50. The operating and business environment uncertainty I mentioned in December did materialize to a greater degree than anticipated during Q3, but we have navigated those challenges and project a solid finish to our fiscal year. Labor-related network and efficiency effects have diminished and the wage rate component should become less of a headwind as we lap the onset of labor rate increases in the fourth quarter. Lastly, variable compensation expense will be a tailwind as it was in Q3.\nTurning to capital spending. We have lowered our FY '22 capital spending forecast from $7.2 billion to $7 billion. Much of the change is driven by extended time lines resulting from supply chain considerations. While we are still developing our FY '23 plans, our focus remains on lowering our capital intensity while investing in strategic initiatives to drive returns. We are highly focused on ensuring our capital investments generate returns to drive further growth in earnings and cash flows.\nLastly, our projection for the full year effective tax rate is now 22% to 23%, prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. While we are confident in our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including additional pandemic developments, the labor market, inflation, high energy prices and further geopolitical risk and the potential effects on the pace and timing of global economic activity. We continue to monitor these trends and adjust accordingly.\nWith that, we are all very much looking forward to sharing additional background in our upcoming investor meeting on June 28 and 29 in Memphis. Mickey and the Investor Relations team will soon provide specifics on logistics, and now we will be happy to address your questions.",

The Q2 earnings release, Form 10-Q, and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to one question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. Certain statements in this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Today's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease refer to investors.fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Jenny. We have only one week left in peak season, and I want to extend my sincere thank you to our frontline workers, pilots, and all of Team FedEx as we approach the finish line. These individuals are out there working hard to deliver a successful peak for our customers, making every FedEx experience outstanding. Before I turn to our Q2 results, I also want to acknowledge that our thoughts and prayers remain with those at UPS, along with the families and community affected by the recent tragedy. We are working closely with Boeing and the FAA to ensure the safety of our own MD-11 fleet, which we will discuss later on the call. Now, let's review our performance in the quarter.\nIn Q2, we provided excellent service to our customers, won new business in high-value verticals, and delivered strong results: high single-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, and high-teens adjusted EPS growth. Quite remarkably, we did this while navigating multiple external headwinds, including the unexpected grounding of our MD-11 fleet, nationwide air traffic constraints, weakness in the industrial economy, and, of course, the impact of global trade policy changes. We're extremely pleased with our Q2 performance, especially in the face of these challenges. It's a direct effect of the rigor we have embedded into our culture over the past several years and the resulting transformation from Network 2.0, Tricolor, and structural cost reductions, all enabled by data and technology. We're demonstrating the resilience and flexibility we have built into our network, and our ongoing efforts to reduce structural costs are leading to significant improvements in profitability.\nWe remain on track to spin off FedEx Freight on 1 June 2026, as a separately listed public company with the best value proposition in the industry. We recently appointed Marshall Witt as CFO of FedEx Freight. Marshall brings significant external public company experience, having served as a CFO of TD SYNNEX for the past 12 years. He also has deep industry and company expertise from his 15 years previously working at FedEx Freight, primarily within the finance organization. FedEx Freight's entire executive leadership team is now in place, and the team is moving quickly to prepare for the separation. Our conviction in the potential value that will be unlocked from this spin-off is stronger than ever. Turning to our consolidated Q2 results, revenue was up 7% year over year, driven by yield and volume strength across our US Domestic Package Services.\nWe achieved our targeted transformation-related savings and grew adjusted operating income by 17%. Federal Express Corporation, or FEC, delivered another quarter of strong operating leverage. On an 8% year-over-year increase in FEC revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 24% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. Nearly half of our revenue growth was driven by B2B services, an important enabler of increased profitability. This marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion at FEC. In line with ongoing LTL industry trends, freight results remain pressured, driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by higher weight and revenue per shipment. This is the result of our sustained focus on maintaining strong revenue quality. Given the strength of our Q2 results and our updated assumptions for the second half, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook to $17.80-19.\nBrie and John will detail the underlying assumptions shortly. We are demonstrating our ability to execute well in any environment, reflecting the progress of our network, organizational, and digital transformation efforts. This quarter truly showcased the importance of network integration and optimization, along with the power of a resilient industrial network. Both shifting global trade patterns and the unexpected grounding of our MD-11 fleet required significant changes to our network, which we implemented swiftly and successfully. To that end, let me provide a quick update on how we flexed our network during the quarter. From a global trade perspective, we reduced our purple tail trans-Pacific Asia-bound capacity by about 25% year-over-year. We also decreased our third party, or white tail capacity, by nearly 35%. We continue to shift some of our capacity to the Asia to Europe lane.\nAnd importantly, these flights typically have an attractive B2B mix of over 75% with high load factors. When we grounded our MD-11 fleet, our focus, as always, was on safety above all, making sure our planes would be inspected and as safe as possible. We're also focused on helping our customers and providing technical support to the regulators. Of the 34 MD-11s we own, 25 were in operation at the time of the groundings. Our network planning team immediately implemented contingencies, prioritizing protecting our customer commitments and stabilizing the network. We revised our November schedule quickly, condensing our planning process into three days.\nAnd the actions we took included trucking more volume in the United States instead of flying, given 18 of our MD-11 flights were US Domestic, shifting volume to other types of aircraft within our FedEx-owned fleet, adding capacity via third-party lift, and adjusting the timing of maintenance for our remaining fleet while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines.\nAs a result, we were able to mitigate the operational and financial impacts of the MD-11 groundings, which ultimately pressured our Q2 adjusted operating income by about $25 million. For the final week of peak, we have additional contingencies in place. We lost about 4% of our global cargo capacity before mitigating actions during our busiest season. As a result, our cross-functional teams are working around the clock to minimize any service disruption. Looking beyond peak, we are extremely focused on maintaining high service levels, the benefit of more time to plan. We'll keep you posted on the expected timing of the MD-11 return to service. Network transformation remains a key priority for us.\nIn support of this ongoing transformation, in October, we named Kawal Preet as Executive Vice President of Planning, Engineering, and Transformation. Kawal is known for creating high-performance cultures. With nearly 30 years of institutional and industry expertise, her depth of operational and engineering knowledge will support further progress towards our global integrated network. For the past five years, she served as our Asia-Pacific regional president. Kawal has a proven track record of relentlessly unlocking efficiencies and driving improved bottom-line results. And I am confident she will thrive in her new role. This global centralized planning and engineering function marks an important shift in how we deploy our assets to reduce inefficiencies and increase profitability. Additionally, it provides enhanced oversight of our ongoing Drive, Tricolor, and Network 2.0 efforts. We now have about 24% of our eligible average daily volume flowing through 355 Network 2.0 optimized facilities.\nAdditionally, we have closed more than 150 facilities. We also continue to prioritize improving our operations and performance in Europe, where the team is making good progress with significant opportunity ahead. We remain focused on driving growth in international and B2B segments, which is helping to offset the headwinds created by global trade policy changes. Our European operations teams have done an outstanding job absorbing the growth through improvements in surface, hub, station, and on-road productivity, supported by sustained improvement in net service levels. Data and technology play a foundational role in our transformation, and we are scaling AI adoption across the company to all our 500,000-plus employees. The reality is that AI is becoming an integral part of all business functions, from the back office to the frontline. And we want to ensure that every employee is equipped to thrive in this new era.\nWe recently launched a global AI program to help our teams innovate faster, serve customers better, and solve challenges more effectively than ever before. Importantly, we are customizing the curriculum to be directly relevant to each team member's specific role, experience level, and existing AI fluency. We also continue to explore new approaches that leverage our real-world operational data platform. We are actively pursuing opportunities to bring digital solutions to the market, starting with Logistics Intelligence Insights. Our recently announced strategic collaboration with ServiceNow marks an important milestone designed to make life easier for those who manage complex sourcing and procurement operations. Through this collaboration, we are giving businesses a single system that anticipates, adapts, and acts before they experience supply chain disruptions.

This partnership demonstrates market demand for what we have built. In closing, I want to recognize our team for delivering another strong quarter while navigating a very difficult operating environment. Our ability to grow adjusted earnings per share 19% year over year, despite multiple headwinds, speaks to the benefits of our transformation and the strength of our industrial network. I look forward to sharing more information on our strategic initiatives and our medium-term financial outlook at our February Investor Day. I hope to see many of you there. Now, over to you, Brie.\nThank you, Raj. First, I want to commend our commercial and operations teams for the outstanding job they are doing to support our customers during peak. Successfully picking up 25 million packages on Cyber Monday requires extensive collaboration and agility.\nOur Q2 performance is a function of momentum we have been building over the past year, managing key performance indicators to ensure a focus on high-quality revenue growth. The team's hard work and strong execution in Q2 led to a 7% year-over-year revenue growth across the enterprise, B2B, B2B, B2B. At FEC, revenue was up 8%, driven by 12% US domestic package revenue growth with strength across all services. FedEx Freight revenue declined 2%, pressured by lower average daily shipments. We grew average daily domestic volume by 6%. Our recent B2B healthcare wins supported robust growth in the United States priority and deferred express services. The onboarding of our new Amazon business, which is focused on large and heavyweight shipments, is also going well. As expected, international export volumes declined, driven again by lower volumes on the China to US lane.\nRaj mentioned how we're shifting some capacity to the Asia to Europe lane, which, along with strong growth on the Asia lane, is providing a partial offset. Additionally, we continued to grow US international outbound revenue, which further offered another offset. And of course, it has high flow-through. At FedEx Freight, weakness in the industrial economy again weighed on our average daily shipments, which were down 4%. This dynamic remains consistent with broader LTL industry trends. Importantly, our growing FedEx Freight team positions us well for the eventual recovery. We now have more than 85% of our planned LTL sales force in place, and we expect to have the full team in place by June. And of course, this is 400 salespeople. We are also very encouraged by our Q2 service quality metrics at Freight, with claims and damage performance at some of the best levels in company history.\nOn-time service is at the highest level since Q3 of fiscal year 2021. Across the enterprise, our strong yield performance this quarter demonstrates the benefits of our efforts to prioritize high-value shipments, the strength of our value proposition, and the continued improvement in the pricing environment. At FEC, US domestic package yield was up over 5%, driven by the strength across all services. International export package yield grew 3%, driven by revenue quality action, higher weight per shipment tied to the de minimis change, plus favorable currency. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment increased 2%, driven by higher weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight, demonstrating our sustained commitment to maintaining industry-leading yields. Now, let me share a few highlights on our commercial priorities. As part of our B2B focus, we have developed vertical strategies, each with dedicated leadership and resources in our targeted growth areas.\nThat B2B contributed to nearly half our revenue growth this quarter demonstrates this strategy is working. It is helping us sustain and win new business in priority areas like healthcare and automotive. For example, this quarter, we won incremental B2B business from BMW. This win is a result of our global reliability and scale, our strong service for time-critical aftermarket and production deliveries, and our collaborative shipping tools. Further, technology companies are investing extraordinary amounts of CapEx in global data center infrastructure over the next several years. As such, we have formalized our work in creating a data center and infrastructure vertical team. This will better support existing customers and also help us acquire new high-tech customers. I am confident our dedicated sales and solutions team will enable FedEx leadership in this high-value market with significant growth ahead.\nWe are very pleased with how our digital tools are supporting revenue growth while creating better outcomes for our customers and their customers. Wayfair is a great example of how we're using these tools to help our customers improve their shipment-related communications and support their customer service teams. By using our premium integrated visibility tool, Wayfair is increasing their Net Promoter Score, reducing where-is-my-order calls, otherwise known as WISMO calls, and decreasing outages with their tracking data. Turning to our revenue outlook for fiscal year 2026, we now expect 5%-6 consolidated revenue growth this fiscal year, supported by sustained US domestic yield and volume growth. We expect second-half international export ADV to remain pressured due to the global trade environment, with a partial offset from yield.\nAt FEC, the midpoint of our range now implies a 7% revenue growth year-over-year, supported by peak trends and our revenue quality actions. Peak ADV is trending in line with our expectation of a modest year-over-year increase. Peak-related demand surcharges at FEC are achieving strong capture, and we expect a year-over-year increase in this surcharge revenue. In light of the recent MD-11 groundings, we have made targeted adjustments to protect network integrity and service reliability. On 1 December, we implemented a fuel surcharge adjustment to partially mitigate the added cost required to maintaining high-quality service for our customers. We expect strong capture of our General Rate Increase of 5.9%, which goes into effect next month. At FedEx Freight, due to the continued pressure on shipments, we now expect fiscal year 2026 revenue to be approximately flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis.\nYield growth will provide an offset to a low single-digit percentage decline in shipments. In closing, we have a great strategy in place to capture high-value growth with our unmatched industrial network. Our Q2 results demonstrate that this strategy is absolutely working. Our team is doing an exceptional job this peak season. Thank you, team, for delivering the Purple Promise during the holiday season and, of course, all year round. Now, with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. I'll start by saying that I'm very proud of the team for executing on our strategies to drive margin expansion and operating income growth in Q2. We achieved these results despite multiple headwinds. Like Raj and Brie, I'm also very grateful for the dedication of our team members who are delivering on the Purple Promise every day, especially during this peak season.\nTurning to our financial results, on a consolidated basis, in Q2, we delivered $4.82 in adjusted earnings per share, up 19% year-over-year. Consolidated revenue grew by 7%, which supported 60 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 17% adjusted operating income growth. As Brie mentioned, our yield management and strong commercial execution resulted in higher revenue growth from US domestic package services, which was the primary driver of our year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement. We grew adjusted operating income by $231 million despite the headwind from global trade policy changes, higher variable incentive compensation accruals, weaker-than-expected LTL results, a $30 million headwind from the expiration of the postal service contract, and a $25 million impact from the grounding of our MD-11 fleet. At FEC, we grew adjusted operating income by $306 million, up 24%, and expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points.\nThis was driven by higher yields, continued cost reduction efforts, and increased US domestic package volume. These drivers were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates and the headwinds I previously mentioned. At FedEx Freight, we continue to experience a challenging market environment consistent with trends across the LTL sector. FedEx Freight adjusted operating income declined by $70 million and adjusted operating margin contracted 3 percentage points. Q2 was weaker than we originally anticipated, driven by lower average daily shipments. Additionally, we experienced a $25 million headwind to adjusted operating income as our sales force hiring and other separation expenses accelerated in Q2. That said, I'm encouraged that yields inflected positive in the quarter, demonstrating FedEx Freight's disciplined strategy. We remain confident that FedEx Freight is well-positioned to see strong incremental margins when demand returns. We remain committed to prudent capital allocation and maximizing stockholder returns.\nDuring the quarter, we opportunistically purchased nearly $300 million worth of stock, which, alongside our increased dividend payout, demonstrates our commitment to returning cash to stockholders. We have $1.3 billion remaining under our 2024 stock repurchase authorization and, subject to business and market conditions, will continue to evaluate repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of FY2026. CapEx year-to-date is $1.4 billion, driven by continued investments to maintain our fleet of aircraft and vehicles, Network 2.0-related facility enhancements, and hub modernization. We continue to target $4.5 billion in annual CapEx for FY2026. Given the healthy status of our pension plan, we are further reducing our expected pension cash contribution. We now anticipate making $275 million in voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans in fiscal 2026, compared to our prior forecast of up to $400 million.\nMoving to our FY2026 adjusted EPS outlook, I want to note that our outlook is based on information known to us today and our business trends from the first half of the fiscal year. Though the global operating environment remains fluid, our year-to-date results demonstrate our operating leverage and proven ability to successfully drive premium revenue growth. As a result, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $17.80-19. This compares to our prior range of $17.20-19 and reflects a range of potential scenarios for the back half of the year. At the midpoint of our range, we now anticipate a 7% increase in FEC revenue, with adjusted op margin up slightly. Also at the midpoint, we expect revenue for FedEx Freight to be down slightly, with margin down year-over-year. Our expected FY2026 effective tax rate remains approximately 25%.\nI also want to take a moment to walk through what is implied in our second-half outlook at the adjusted EPS midpoint of $18.40. We expect continued FEC revenue momentum on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal second half. We also expect to benefit from strong operational execution and ongoing efficiency initiatives. At the same time, we anticipate somewhat more limited flow-through in the second half versus the first half due to several discrete items challenging comparability year-over-year. First, variable incentive compensation accruals. For context, in FY2025, we paid variable incentive compensation well below target levels. Given strong year-to-date performance, we have embedded a higher accrual for this performance-based pay in our revised outlook. This is important compensation that our people are earning due to their strong execution in a challenged environment.\nSecond, given the sustained weak LTL industry trends, we've lowered our FedEx Freight expectations for the second half of the year. Third, we expect meaningful headwinds in the second half from our MD-11 groundings, primarily in Q3. Taken together, these items represent roughly a $600 million year-over-year headwind to adjusted operating income in the second half. For the full year, they represent nearly a $900 million headwind. Our revised FY2026 adjusted operating income bridge shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our full-year outlook in one midpoint scenario, resulting in adjusted operating income of $6.2 billion, up $200 million versus our prior outlook. Of course, this is just one scenario, and the assumptions at the midpoint may vary as the environment changes. In this scenario, for FEC volume-related revenue net of variable costs, we now expect a $500 million tailwind.\nThis marks a $100 million improvement compared to what we shared in September. This is driven largely by US Domestic Package Services, offset by a material headwind from reduced international export demand. With respect to FEC yield, we now expect a $3 billion tailwind. This marks a $700 million improvement compared to what we shared in September and demonstrates our commitment to revenue quality and pricing traction. Our bridge includes partial offsets to these tailwinds. Most remain unchanged from what we shared in September, except for the FedEx Freight headwind. We now expect a $300 million decline in adjusted operating income at FedEx Freight compared to the $100 million expectation we shared in September. Additionally, we added a bar to reflect the variable incentive compensation headwind I mentioned earlier.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, embedded in our assumptions is the $1 billion in headwind to adjusted operating profit from the global trade environment, offset by $1 billion in transformation-related savings. We're pleased with our year-to-date cost reduction progress and are on track to achieve the billion-dollar savings target. With regard to Q3 adjusted EPS, we now anticipate adjusted EPS to be sequentially lower than Q2. For further context, we expect Q3 revenue to be essentially in line with Q2, with flight increases sequentially in operating expense due to increased peak demand and higher costs due to the MD-11 grounding. As a reminder, we are lapping a Q3 that was unusually strong seasonally. We expect Q4 to be our strongest adjusted EPS quarter of this fiscal year. These directional trends are consistent with the patterns we typically experience.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I want to provide an update on our spin-off of FedEx Freight, which is on track for 1 June 2026. As previously mentioned, we submitted our confidential Form 10 to the SEC, as well as a request for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the transaction to the IRS. These were important milestones as we move toward the tax-efficient spin-off. We expect the Form 10, which will provide more details on our go-forward strategy and financials, to be available to the public in January. As a further update, upon the spin-off of FedEx Freight, FedEx Corp intends to retain up to 19.9% of FedEx Freight's outstanding shares. To preserve the tax-free nature of the spin-off, we expect to monetize these shares within a timeframe permitted by the IRS.\nAdditionally, FedEx Freight will be hosting an investor day in New York City on 8 April. John Smith and his team look forward to unveiling for you FedEx Freight's forward-looking strategy to unlock significant stockholder value in the years ahead. As Raj noted, we also look forward to seeing you in Memphis at our FedEx Corporation Investor Day in February. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star, then two. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. John, you just covered a lot in guidance there, and I'm sure we'll get plenty of questions on it. But I guess longer term, it looks like you guys are definitely capturing incremental volume share in your domestic US business, the package business that is, and seeing quite a bit of pricing upside too. So I wondered if you can talk to some of the dynamics there on both B2C and B2B, and maybe if there's more to come on yield gains. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hollander\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, FedEx\n\nHi, Brandon. It's Raj. I'm happy to answer the question. So from a volume and a market share perspective, yes, we are very pleased with the profitable market share. And again, from an FEC perspective, we were really pleased with the flow-through in the quarter.\nThe incremental margin expansion of 100 basis points at FEC is something we're really proud of. That was driven by a couple of things. One, continued focus on B2B. We've been building this strategy for over a year. We've been very focused on our KPIs and our metrics within the sales organization. We made a pivot to our sales compensation model as well to make sure that that is balanced from a B2B, and a B2C perspective. Then also, as you heard, we were really, really pleased with our overall rate discipline and the capture on surcharges. Our goal is to continue to push on this, continue to acquire new B2B market share, and we're really pleased with the underlying momentum.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie, I wanted to stick with that topic. The B2B, over half the revenue growth in Q2. Just wondering if there's any way to break down how much of that is completely new volume business, how much of that is related to kind of yield and some of the surcharges initiatives you're putting in. And should we think about that as being kind of a similar magnitude of overall growth as you think about the guide for the back half of the year?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Jonathan. Great question. So overall, from a trend perspective, and I just want to be clear, it was nearly half. It wasn't over half. Still very pleased with that metric. Let me be clear about that as well. But we expect that to be pretty consistent throughout the year from Q1 through Q4. To your question on acquisition, I will really say that the quarter had multiple things going.\nFrom a B2B perspective, yes, we did acquire new B2B. We also did a great job from a share of wallet. And I should not understate that also it was the strongest quarter that we had seen from a small business B2B perspective. So it really was the combination of all three combined with our revenue quality strategy. I don't think it was any one of those things.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nLead Surface Transportation & Airfreight Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thank you. So I wanted to ask about service, more specifically the cost of service. Recently, you shared plans regarding management's annual cash incentive, and you added a service component to that, which speaks to the significance you place on service as you work through your Network 2.0 transformation. We would think that comes with additional costs.\nSo how much do you estimate you're carrying today in terms of those additional costs and what's worked into the outlook? And how should we think about those costs trickling off? I'm sure, for instance, Canada is being run much more efficiently now than when you started your integration efforts. So how long did it take for that to become fully efficient?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Richa, let me answer that question. In fact, let me answer two components of it. One, you started to talk about the annual incentive compensation. And to add to the points that were made earlier, prepared remarks, last year, our AIC payouts were well below target. This year, we have included the service component, and we anticipated several headwinds. And despite that, the team is doing an absolutely incredible job of performing in this quarter.\nSo while it's a financial headwind for the year, it's absolutely the right thing to do as our team is going above and beyond the call of duty and delivering on that Purple Promise. So that's on the AIC. Your question was really around the Network 2.0 and the cost. Listen, first of all, we are not going to compromise on our service. Good service is good quality. Good quality is actually less waste. And we are very pleased with the progress that we are making there. And obviously, we have made very good progress in Canada as well. You can typically expect in the market roughly three to six months where we get the efficiency back. And that's all dialed into our forecasts both for the short- and long-term Network 2.0. Thank you again for the question, Richa.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Transportation Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hi. I wanted to ask a little bit about the LTL business, the freight business. As you think about some of the, I guess maybe we're curious about potential duplicative costs as you guys get prepared for the spin. Is there a sense of how much or maybe the increment on the further decline from $100 million-300 million on the EBIT decline comes from that? I guess we're trying to get a sense if there are some temporary costs associated with the spin that stuff comes out, or is it really more of a function of what's happening in the broader market? Obviously, shipments are a little bit weaker. Yield's a little bit under pressure too.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my remarks, we had $25 million in this quarter. We are anticipating of the $300 million, $100 million of that is the result of the separation cost. That is a combination of the acceleration of the Salesforce hiring, which Brie mentioned is going extremely well, as well as IT and other costs, all in the spirit of accelerating, which we're seeing some of the results in the improved performance. So thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, John, just to clarify, the costs you're talking about, are those separate from the spin-off costs, which are included or excluded, rather, from the EPS guide? And then just wanted to hear a little bit more about the MD-11 process, getting them back up to speed. It seems like it'll take a little while, but it also seems like there's an incremental step up in terms of a headwind into the third fiscal quarter. Is that more or less because of the peak season? I think we're expecting that to tail off a little bit, but it seems like it's actually increasing. So additional thoughts around that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. I'll cover the first part. Those are separate costs that I identified than the $600 million. These were included in our reportable earnings. So with regard to the MD-11, yeah, our current outlook reflects that those aircraft will return to service in the Q4. We do have some incremental costs in the Q3, particularly in December. As I noted, $25 million was in November, but in December, we'll have significantly higher costs incurred on the MD-11.\nIt's peak season, and it's an expensive time of year to be getting outsourced lift to begin with, let alone when you have fleet grounded. So I would say of the remaining $150 million, a substantial part of that $175 million will be in Q3. And let me just add one more point on this thing, Brian. Our first priority will always be safety above all. And that's the principle which we have built. We are working hand in hand with the authorities on the protocol to get these aircraft back in flight. I was there with the MD-11 hangar just on Tuesday night. We have a phenomenal set of aircraft technicians who are working on it. And we're waiting for the right protocol to get it released and the timing that John talked about. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPlease go ahead. Hey, thanks. John, just want to follow up on that $600 million headwind you talked about in the back half of the year. I think you gave; there's three pieces to it. Any way you can sort of break down that 600 million into the three buckets you laid out, and maybe how much of that's in Q3? And then maybe just along with that, I know you said earnings would be lower in Q3, but any sort of magnitude, I don't know, maybe the way to think about, do you think earnings are flat, higher, lower year over year? Maybe that'll be helpful if you give a little bit more color. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. So of the 900 million, we incurred 300 million of that in the first half of the year. To your question, for the second half of the year, we've embedded the remaining $600 million in our outlook, with about $160 million of that due to expected continued softness in the LTL business, up to a total of about $175 million for the MD-11 grounding, and for the majority of which we expect in Q3, and the remainder, about $265 million, for increased variable compensation. So with regard to your question on Q3, I'm not going to give Q3 guidance, but what I can tell you is that the Q3 adjusted EPS will be sequentially lower than Q2.\nWe expect revenue sequentially to be essentially in line with Q2. Slight increases as well in operating expense on a sequential basis due to the increased peak demand, some of the increased volumes we're talking about, and higher costs due to the MD-11 grounding.\nI think an important reminder too is we'll be lapping a Q3 that was unusually strong seasonally. We had a lot of Drive benefits in the Q3 of last year. We also expect Q4 to be our strongest adjusted EPS quarter for the fiscal year. And directionally, that's consistent with the patterns that we've typically experienced.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, thank you. So I wanted to get your sense of, I think what we've seen in the past over time is that FedEx can, as they're developing momentum a couple of quarters into margin improvement, you do tend to run into this refilling of the incentive comp bucket, and that tends to be a headwind for a period of time. Seems like sometimes that can be like you go a couple of hundred million one year, and then there's more to go the next year. So I guess I'm just wondering about, do you think this is kind of like you take the hit over a couple of quarters now, and then you're kind of ready to go for fiscal 2027 where you see more of the Network 2.0 savings come in? .\nOr I guess just how do we kind of think about that, and then relative to just the progress on your FEC margin, which has been good for, I think you said, five quarters in a row, and it seems like you're maybe pausing, admittedly, for a couple of reasons. But just kind of how do we think about broader FEC margin improvement? Is this kind of a couple of quarter headwind on refilling the incentive comp, or is this something that might carry into kind of next year as well?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Tom, for the question. Let me lead off. And if John wants to add to it, he can. As we are looking at FY2026, we're basically catching back up where we should have been comparing to last year. I think that is not a headwind that we'll have going forward into fiscal 2027. So that hopefully answers that question. The second part of it is we are very, very pleased with the underlying momentum that we have in our business. This is now working, the transformation that we have on our network transformation, our organizational transformation, our digital transformation, all are working. Our commercial teams are executing at a high level, as you can see the results.\nSo we are pleased with the underlying momentum and the flow through. There are certain things that are happening peculiarly for this. There are incremental headwinds for this next three to six months, but on an ongoing basis, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Just a question. The bridge to the midpoint is very helpful. I'm just sort of curious, though, the $19 are at the high end. Is there a way you could frame up what would push it? Is that mostly tied to volumes looking better, the LTL environment looking better, more acceleration in B2B? How do we think about framing to the north of the midpoint? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, hey, Jordan. I guess my quick response is all of the above. We're not going to really speculate as to all the factors that could go into it. Obviously, if revenue is stronger and our cost environment is better than we're anticipating, you're going to find yourself in the upward end of the range. So there are so many variables in place, but we feel comfortable with the assumptions we've laid out that we're going to be within the range and focused on being as far into the range as we possibly can. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my questions. The domestic parcel growth rates have been really solid for several quarters in a row now. And as we get, I think the indication from the guidance is that you expect that to continue. As we get further in the next year and UPS potentially gets some competitive advantages back with the relationship with the Postal Service and potentially maybe some contractual competition three years past the new Teamsters deal and some of the sheer shift that happened there, do you think that growth is something that we can maintain at a high level into fiscal 2027, or could those potentially be headwinds that we should consider tapering the rate? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question, Bascome. I do not believe that a relationship between our two competitors is a competitive threat. As we've talked about, our focus right now is high-value segments: B2B, Home Delivery, Ground Commercial. These are not services that could be serviced by the Post Office. And so if that does materialize, I do not see it as a threat to our primary growth strategy. We have the stronger value proposition, and we're very focused on continuing to take profitable market share.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon. Just on simplifying the freight, John, I guess you've mentioned it a few times, but the $300 million impact, if you pull out the $100 million in ongoing costs, is that the leftover $200 million, is that due to weakening demand? And I'm wondering what your view is of the competitive environment there. And then the $152 million in spin costs, is there anything you can maybe detail or break out what's going into that? Is that just continued? Is that ongoing costs? I just want to understand what's one time, what's, if any, and what is ongoing. Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Ken, I'll start with the numbers and basically say the $200 million is the result of lower ADV and pressure on the business that's consistent with the LTL industry. Yeah, with regard to the $152 million, those are spin-off preparation costs. And so that's why those are in our adjusted, and those are one-time costs. Thank you. And Ken, if I just add one more point to it, on a broader basis, obviously, our performance is in line with our industry at this point, and this is cyclical in nature. It's very difficult to predict when the turn would come. But however, we are beginning to see some level of industry consolidation, especially in the truckload business. And while it takes a while to translate in the LTL, that process seems to have begun.\nThe next question is from Reed Seay with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, guys.\n\nReed Seay\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nThanks for taking my question. I want to follow up real quick on that last answer about consolidation. Does that mean consolidation of LTL carriers you seem to think will be on the horizon? And then also in that $200 million that you talked about, there is definitely some LTL industry softness, but I was wondering if any of that is from an understandable rationalization of volume as you try to maybe take out some less profitable freight before I spin that off on its own, just if any of that is creating some noise in the shipment numbers. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nI'll start off, and then John can answer the second part. I just want to make sure what I said was consolidation of capacity in the truckload business. We can see a reduction of capacity starting to happen, and that will ultimately translate into benefit for the LTL sector, even though it may take a little time. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, and if I could talk, we're actually seeing a bit of positive inflection in the yield, the first increase in yield that we've seen in several quarters. So we're encouraged by that, and it also reflects the discipline on the pricing environment in our LTL business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone. So kudos to your network planning, folks. Certainly plenty to keep them busy, including what might be an imminent Supreme Court ruling on the tariffs.\nI'm wondering if we see a decision against the administration, whether you'd view that as a tailwind to trade activity next calendar year, especially maybe in the context of your $1 billion headwind estimate? And I know that's a big question, but you all are very plugged into Washington, so any perspective there would be very helpful.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nWell, Bruce, first of all, thank you for the comments on the network. I mean, these teams have done just an absolutely remarkable job and continue to do so. It's very, very early to answer any question regarding what might or might not happen on the tariff front. Any international volume increase, obviously, is beneficial, but we're not counting on any such thing in our outlook.\nObviously, we are seeing significant shifts in trade and supply chain patterns, and the fact that we have a scaled network in every part of the world stands to our advantage because we are able to get market signals from the bottom up, and we are able to act very quickly and with precision. That's what's helping us very much as far as how the environment on global trade changes and how that might impact our volumes. At this point, it's very early to comment, and we will update you as the months go by here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSenior Vice President of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you. I wanted to circle back on peak season. Maybe you could provide a little bit more color on what you've seen thus far. I know you said it's tracked in line, but I think there's been a lot of commentary at a high level that we've seen talking about a K-shaped recovery and also some questioning just around the strength of peak season. You also commented a little bit about maybe small business or B2B. So any additional color you can provide on peak season would be great. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Stephanie. It's Brie. So I am really pleased with how we're doing from a peak perspective, both from a planning as well as an execution. Right now, we are basically running right on our forecast for peak. What we had predicted was a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth on ADV. That is absolutely the case. We do have an extra operating day. And so in total volume, you're going to see a high single-digit growth from a peak period.\nFrom a forecast perspective, as I mentioned, it is basically in line. What we are seeing, however, especially early in peak, is actually our base and our small and medium businesses are slightly ahead of forecast, and our larger retailers are slightly below, which obviously, from a revenue quality perspective, is a good thing from a results perspective. From a trend throughout peak, what we did see is that right after Black Friday, we had very strong. The second week was a little bit softer, but we have seen building momentum in the last week. Time in transit is two days. Scott and John are doing a remarkable job of running the network. In addition to that, as you know, we are the market share leader in large package, and the team has done a brilliant job of actually keeping the port cities clear.\nThey've pulled that volume into kind of the middle of the country, bypassing some sorts and hubs, which is really important. So right now, we feel really good about peak. I do not want to underestimate that we have still six days to go. We have a lot of work to do. The team is ready, as Raj just talked about. I cannot say enough about the incredible airline work, but the team does need to execute next week without the MD-11. We're very focused on that, and they have demonstrated that this is definitely going to be a strong peak and could not be more pleased.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ari Rosa with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAriel Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi",
    "content2": "Hi, good evening. Nice job on the quarter here. Good to see the progress. I'm curious. In the slides, you mentioned that you have 24% of volume flowing through Network 2.0 automated facilities. I think I'm remembering that correctly. I just want to understand, what does that mean in terms of the margin profile for those facilities or kind of the cost structure per package on those facilities versus legacy facilities? And how should we think about the timeline or the pace for that to continue to ramp? And kind of going to Tom's question, does that just mean we're looking at kind of potentially structurally higher margins going forward? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Ari. We intend to talk a lot more about this at our upcoming investor day. But we also have said previously with regard to Network 2.0 benefits, we expect to see the tangible results of that later in FY2027. So I would say not a material impact financially, but great contribution from an operational efficiency standpoint that Brie was talking about earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Connor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the healthcare and small and medium-sized business markets and just talk about the opportunity set that you have from here. And then, Raj, you've talked a little bit in the past around just the tech pipeline or the potential there, just given the CapEx that's being spent from the AI players. Just curious on how FedEx kind of fits into that puzzle, if at all. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Connor. It's Brie. So sure, I'll start first from a healthcare and an SMB perspective. As we mentioned several calls ago, we had just a phenomenal build last year from a healthcare perspective. We have, I think, the best digital portfolio from a healthcare segment perspective. What do I mean by that? We can give our healthcare customers customized visibility, and they can set their own business rules for intervention and monitoring, which is really important. All customers are important, but patients obviously require that next level of service. As I just talked about some of the service performance, that means that we can actually intervene, reroute, and adjust for healthcare customers at a level of precision that I just believe is unmatched in the network.\nSo we are continuing to onboard healthcare with that tool. We also rolled out a new quality program, which is really important to the pharma segment. That is sort of early days.\nThat actually requires, with each one of our pharma customers, for us to work with their quality team, build out a custom SOP, prove we can execute that to be able to win share of wallet. And that is going quite well. So that will continue, I believe, as an ability to take share. And then from there, we're also continuing to expand our cold chain capabilities. Right now, we've got great cold chain in a reactive place. And what do I mean by that? Most of our customers are packing out their shipments. And so we use cold chain predominantly to intervene and ice something or refreeze something if there is a delay in the system. We're moving to end-to-end cold chain. So that's sort of the next wave. Had great momentum here in the United States. We're taking these capabilities to Europe and to Asia.\nSo I think we've got a long runway. We've got between $9 and $10 billion of healthcare in our base. The market is $70 billion. So this is a long-term strategy, but the team continues to execute every quarter. From an SMB perspective, we are, I think, the easiest to do business in the United States. We just had the best quarter in SMB share and performance that I have seen in several years. A huge shout-out to both our sales and marketing team. And again, we're going to keep chipping away at this. And I believe with our value proposition, we'll continue to take share. And then finally, on the data centers, while it's not as big an opportunity as healthcare, healthcare is $70 billion, the data center market's probably between $7 and $8 billion. It is rapidly growing.\nI think global CapEx is predicted to be like $550 billion. In a market that is moving that quickly, there is opportunity. This market expects precision. I don't know anybody who does precision better than we do. So yes, we're winning now, but I think there's a long road ahead of more opportunity.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. So John, coming back to the question on the Network 2.0 stuff, right? I think you guys had mentioned before you were looking at 40% of the volume by the end of FY2026 running in an integrated facility. I'm trying to sort of reconcile that with the idea that margins are just going to be up a little. I thought the idea was that when you get the integration done, you're going to be running at a higher level of productivity, and that would flow through to margin. But I think I heard you maybe say that the financial impact maybe wasn't as great. I'm just trying to kind of get my head around that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nLet me just give you the latest and greatest on what we expect on Network 2.0. As we said, we are right now at 24% of the volume pre-peak. By the time next peak rolls around, we'll be around 65%. And that's the plan, and that's what we're executing against. At the end of the day, when we are finished with it, we're targeting around a 30% footprint reduction by the end of fiscal year 2027. And those represent, along with One FedEx, $2 billion in cost savings.\nWe see the majority of those savings skewed towards FY2027. I don't know, John, if you want anything more to that. No, I would just add, with regard to our transformational cost savings targets for this year, there are elements of Network 2.0 included in those. That's what I want to elaborate further on at investor day. I don't want to say there's no savings. It's all part and parcel. We'll go into much more detail on our strategic initiatives, including Network 2.0, when we see you in February.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nLogistics Equity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me ask one for John here. John, thank you for explaining the headwinds on the incremental second-half outlook. I want to ask about the non-GAAP add-backs. You had a nice chart in the release showing about $720 million net this year, $600 million from the spin, $310 million from business optimization. You still have about $450 million of that to go and two quarters to do it. Can you give us an idea of kind of how that's going to weigh? Did you not do as much Network 2.0 integration because of peak season this quarter, and you're going to do more in the fiscal Q3? Kind of how should we think about the flow of those expenses?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, I think the overwhelming majority of them are going to be tied to our freight separation. We also have a much smaller portion with regard to the change in our calendar fiscal year. And also, finally, a much smaller portion with the ongoing business optimization that has been in play for the last couple of years. Freight separation is the overwhelming majority.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Operator. Before we go, I want to acknowledge how proud and humbled we are by the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority's decision today to rename the Memphis International Airport in honor of our founder, Frederick W. Smith. It's a fitting tribute to the man who launched FedEx, a company that revolutionized the airport, the city of Memphis, and the way the world works. We look forward to soon operating our largest hub out of Frederick W. Smith International Airport. And finally, a big thank you to Team FedEx for your outstanding work in Q2 and throughout this peak season with just one more week to go. Happy holidays, everyone. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter Fiscal '26 Earnings Call. I'm Debbie Hancock, Lamb Weston's Vice President of Investor Relations. Earlier today, we issued our press release and posted slides that we will use for our discussion today. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we will make forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on our current expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results.\nYou can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release and the appendix to our presentation. Joining me today are Mike Smith, our President and CEO; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. The Lamb Weston team delivered first quarter results that exceeded our expectations and show commercial momentum in our business. While we are early in our focus to win execution, we are energized and excited by the emerging evidence of results coming from the foundation that we began to lay earlier this calendar year. Our goal remains to drive profitable growth and win with customers by focusing on the principles that made Lamb Weston the industry gold standard, category-leading innovation, exceptional products and customer-centric actions.\nWe are early in the journey, but our North Star is clear. I want to thank our hard-working team globally for their excellent work. Let me provide a few key messages I would like to leave with you today. First, we delivered another quarter of strong volume growth. This is a result of excellent work across our organization from innovation, quality, consistency and our focus on the customer. We are seeing positive customer momentum as we invest behind strategic differentiators.\nSecond, we are acting with urgency to implement our new strategic plan, Focus to Win, including working to deliver our cost savings program, which is in the early innings, but tracking to our plan of achieving at least $250 million of annual run rate savings by fiscal year-end 2028.\nThird, we have new innovative products coming this fall, and we are winning new business and growing with existing customers as our teams go to market with a more customer-centric Lamb Weston organization. Fourth, in response to sustained volume growth in North America, we are restarting a curtailed line. Lastly, we are acting with urgency to position Lamb Weston for long-term success and shareholder value creation, including by prioritizing the specific markets and products where we believe we have a sustainable competitive advantage.\nNow let's discuss the quarter in more detail. Our first quarter results were led by volume growth in both segments. Price mix within our expectations, the benefits of our cost savings initiatives and significant progress in improving working capital, reducing our capital investments and driving strong free cash flow generation.\nAs we roll out our Focus to Win strategy and drive operational and strategic changes across our business, we are doing so from a leadership position within a category of opportunity, whether at home or away from home, let's take a minute to remind ourselves why fries. Traditional French fries are one of the most profitable items on restaurant menus. Fries are the most ordered item at U.S. restaurants. They appeal to a broad range of consumers in our America's favorite order across every generation. The fry attachment rate or how often someone order fries with their meal remains approximately 2 percentage points higher than before the pandemic.\nWhat that means is that when people go out to eat, they are ordering fries more often than in 2019. And we see positive trends around the globe. For example, global demand is growing with an estimated 44% of global menus offering fries. And as multinational and local market QSRs expand, they continue to see developing markets with fries, which is trending positive.\nFinally, global fry volume growth has outpaced total food growth versus 2019. In July, we launched Focus to Win, our new strategic plan to unlock near and long-term value. And while it is early in our efforts, we are making progress. I see it in the focus our teams have and the decisions we are making. We have clearly identified savings plans and our teams are executing. All this is happening as we work to be our customers' #1 partner, a world-class potato company and an industry-leading innovator.\nLooking at each of the pillars of our strategy. A few early examples include: within strengthening customer partnerships, we have realigned our sales teams around our priority markets. In North America, we are augmenting our successful direct sales force with a broker model to expand our reach into underpenetrated channels of the business. The Lamb Weston organization is embracing a customer-centric mentality. We have secured several new wins around the world, including expanding our share in business in key away-from-home categories such as C-stores and Cash & Carry. And outside the U.S., we've increased our business with QSR customers.\nIn terms of executional excellence, the supply chain organization is elevating Lamb Weston's operations. We have undertaken programs across manufacturing, logistics and procurement that are not just driving cost savings but meaningfully improving our run rates, our quality and our customer satisfaction metrics. In response to sustained volume growth in North America, as previously mentioned, we are restarting a curtailed mine in the latter part of the second quarter to ensure we maintain strong customer fill rates. Our global footprint and the untapped capacity in our manufacturing network allows us to take on new business and provide additional support for our customers.\nAdditionally, we began shipping from our new manufacturing facility in Mar del Plata, Argentina. Approximately 80% of production will be destined for export, primarily for Latin America, including Brazil. Finally, setting the pace for innovation. We take great pride in our position as an innovation leader, and we are working to directly improve the customer and consumer experience, drive breakthrough innovations and innovate how we operate.\nAs I mentioned in July, we've established global innovation hubs to orchestrate disruptive innovation platforms, one in North America and one in the Netherlands for our international markets. This fall, we are launching exciting new products into retail that are aligned with customer trends. This includes flavor-forward offerings from Alexia such as garlic and Parmesan crinkle-cut fries, and dill pickle season fries as well as expanding our licensed brands with Paw Patrol [ waffle ] fries and shaped tops.\nAnd internationally, we continue the rollout of our really crunchy artisanal fries, which are performing exceptionally well. Before Bernadette provides a more in-depth review of the quarter, let's discuss the upcoming potato crop. We're harvesting and processing crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe. Currently, we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are above historical average and in the Midwest are near average as growing conditions in all regions have remained generally favorable.\nIn Europe, growing conditions in the industry's main growing regions of the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Germany have also been favorable, leading to an above-average yield forecast for the region. We continue to expect our potato costs in Europe to be flat to slightly lower than the previous year's fixed price contracts. As a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a mid-single-digit percent decrease in the aggregate in contract prices for the 2025 potato crop.\nWe expect to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning late in our fiscal second quarter. We'll provide our final assessment of the potato crops in North America and Europe when we report our second quarter results. I will now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the quarter and our outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Our teams continue to perform at a high level as we began executing our new strategic plan and driving changes across the organization. In the quarter, we grew volumes, improved our manufacturing cost per pound and delivered strong cash flow. Starting on Slide 11. First quarter net sales were essentially flat, increasing $5 million, including a $24 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation. .\nOn a constant currency basis, net sales declined 1% compared with the prior year. Volume increased 6%, driven by customer wins and retention, led primarily by gains in North America and Asia. In North America, the rate of new customer volume scaled earlier than we planned. The total volume increase also included lapping an approximately $15 million charge taken in the first quarter of fiscal '25 related to a voluntary product withdrawal.\nTurning to the industry. Restaurant traffic at several customer channels was flat in the quarter, including overall QSR traffic, while some are growing, including QSR chicken, QSR hamburger, however, was down low single digits and declined another percent in August. Restaurant traffic outside the U.S. has been mixed. Traffic in certain markets, including the U.K., our largest international market, declined 4%. Our customers continue to lean into value and menu innovation, including limited time offerings to drive traffic and meet consumer needs. Price/mix at constant currency rates was in line with our expectations, declining 7% compared with the prior year.\nAs a reminder, this includes the carryover impact of fiscal 2025 price and trade investments that went into effect in the second quarter of last year as well as ongoing support of our customers. It also includes unfavorable channel product mix within our segments. Looking at our segments. North America net sales declined 2% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower net selling prices. Price/mix declined 7% and volume increased 5%, supported by recent customer contract wins and growth across channels.\nIn our International segment, net sales increased 4%, including a favorable $24 million impact from foreign currency translation. At constant currency rates, net sales were flat. Volume grew 6% in the quarter and price mix at constant currency rates declined 6%. This was primarily related to pricing actions in key international markets to support our customers. Our international segment remains well positioned for the long term, supported by new modern manufacturing facilities, a broad and innovative portfolio and an expanding global footprint.\nIn the first quarter, Asia, including China, led our volume growth, reflecting solid market performance. Growth was supported primarily by contributions from multinational chains. In Europe, we expect that a strong crop, soft restaurant market demand and increased competitive actions will continue to pressure price mix for the balance of the year. And in Latin America, we began shipping from our new facility in Argentina in early second quarter.\nWhile we are actively onboarding customers, we expect it will take time before the facility reaches target utilization levels. We've seen competitive activity increase in Latin America, most notably in Brazil.\nMoving on from sales. As expected, on Slide 12, you can see that adjusted gross profit declined. This was primarily due to unfavorable price mix. This was partially offset by higher sales volume and a decrease in manufacturing cost per pound due primarily to benefits from our cost savings initiatives and the benefit of lapping an approximately $39 million charge in the prior year related to a voluntary product withdrawal.\nWe're pleased with the progress we're making against our cost savings initiatives, and we remain on track to deliver fiscal 2026 savings targets. Our broader goal with our manufacturing initiatives, however, is to embed sustainable process improvements that will continue to enhance our manufacturing performance beyond the immediate efficiencies we are seeing. Partially offsetting these benefits was about $15 million of increased fixed factory burden absorption and about $4 million of incremental costs related to the start-up of the new production facility in Argentina.\nWhile we anticipated a decline in gross profit this quarter, the decline was less than expected due primarily to stronger than anticipated sales volumes and incremental benefits realized from our cost savings initiatives. Adjusted SG&A declined $24 million versus the prior year quarter. The decline reflects benefits from cost savings initiatives, -- it also includes $7 million of miscellaneous income primarily related to an insurance recovery and property tax refunds that will not repeat in future quarters.\nEquity method investments were a loss of $600,000 in the quarter, down from earnings of $11 million in the prior year quarter. This reflects the current lower rate of sales volume from our equity affiliate at lower prices, but also an unfavorable mix of sales. As a result, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat with last year at $302 million. The favorable impact on net sales from currency translation was almost entirely offset by higher local currency expenses, particularly cost of sales in our global markets.\nTurning to segment EBITDA performance on Slide 13. Adjusted EBITDA in our North America segment declined 6% or $18 million versus the prior year quarter to $260 million, primarily related to price and trade investments in support of our customers, which was only partially offset by higher sales volumes, lower manufacturing cost per pound and lower adjusted SG&A. Lower manufacturing costs per pound and adjusted SG&A both benefited from our cost savings initiatives.\nWe also lapped an approximately $21 million charge for the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year. In our International segment, adjusted EBITDA increased $6 million to $57 million. This year-over-year improvement, primarily reflects the absence of last year's $18 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal, lower potato prices, cost savings from our cost savings initiatives, and a $4 million favorable impact from foreign currency translation.\nThese benefits were mostly offset by supporting our customers with price investments, increased competitive actions in certain markets and approximately $4 million of start-up costs associated with our new manufacturing facility in Argentina.\nMoving to liquidity and cash flows on Slide 14. Our liquidity and cash position remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion of liquidity comprised of approximately $1.3 billion available under our revolving credit facility and $99 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our net debt was $3.9 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio was 3.1x on a trailing 12-month basis.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2026, we generated $352 million of cash from operations, up $22 million versus the prior year quarter. Lower inventories were the primary driver of the increase. Free cash flow was strong at $273 million. As a reminder, our Focus to Win plan includes approximately $60 million of incremental cash flow from working capital, mainly from reducing inventory in both fiscal '26 and '27 or $120 million in total, we believe we're on track to deliver the fiscal '26 target.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter declined $256 million to $79 million as we completed our production facility expansion projects. For fiscal '26, our capital spending is expected to be approximately $500 million, with approximately $400 million in maintenance and modernization and $100 million for environmental projects, which are mostly for wastewater treatment.\nTurning to Slide 15. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $62 million to shareholders. This included $52 million in cash dividends, and we repurchased $10 million of stock, leaving us with $348 million authorized under the plan. This brings the total cash we've returned to shareholders since the spin in 2016 to over $2 billion.\nOur capital allocation priorities continue to be anchored in investing in the business. Its capabilities and areas where we are working to competitively differentiate Lamb Weston to execute our business strategy, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders with dividends and share repurchases.\nLet's turn to our outlook on Slide 16. We are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2026. As a reminder, this outlook includes the contribution of a 53rd week with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect revenue at constant currency rates in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.55 billion, which is a 2% decline to 2% increase.\nWe expect year-over-year volume growth behind customer momentum in both segments. In our North America segment, we expect volume to grow in both the first and second half of the year. Note that while volumes in the first quarter came in above expectations, this reflects the acceleration of new customer activity that we planned for in later periods.\nIn our International segment, we expect volume in the back half of the year to be essentially flat as we lap the new customer acquisitions from the prior year, and we continue operating in a competitive environment. We also continue to anticipate price mix will be unfavorable at constant currency. As of the end of the quarter, we have secured approximately 75% of our global open contract volume at pricing levels generally consistent with expectations.\nAs anticipated, unfavorable price mix will be more pronounced in the first half, reflecting the carryover pricing actions from fiscal '25. The effect is expected to moderate in the second half of the year, supported by new contracts signed this year. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance range remains at $1 billion to $1.2 billion. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA now excludes noncash share-based compensation expense. It is available in the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures that accompanied the earnings release we filed this morning.\nDespite the outperformance in first quarter, with only 1 quarter behind us, we believe it's prudent to maintain our guidance range. While we previously excluded any impact from tariffs, the range now incorporates tariffs in the balance of the year based on our latest view of enacted tariffs by the U.S. and other governments. Additionally, given the outperformance of the first quarter's gross profit from higher-than-planned volume, we expect gross profit margins in the second quarter to be relatively flat with the first quarter, due primarily to as expected, first quarter input cost inflation being flat to slightly down compared with a year ago due to the steep increase in open market potato prices in Europe in the prior year.\nGoing forward, beginning in the second quarter, we expect low single-digit inflation, including the benefit of this year's lower raw potato prices. We also expect higher factory burden from longer-than-expected planned maintenance downtime at one of our plants and additional startup expenses and factory burden absorption related to the start-up of Argentina planned to adversely affect our margin performance in our International segment in the second quarter.\nTurning to adjusted SG&A. Our first quarter SG&A as a percentage of revenue was lower than our expectation for the full year. As I previously mentioned, the quarter included $7 million of miscellaneous income that will not repeat in future quarters. In addition, at year-end, we shared our plan to invest approximately $10 million of SG&A in innovation, advertising and promotion expenses to support our long-term strategic plan.\nThese investments are slated through the remainder of the year. While not in our guidance, the net sales and adjusted EBITDA, we are updating our tax rate guidance from approximately 26% to a range of 26% to 27%. We now expect the tax rate in the first half to be in the low 30s and the second half expectation remains in the low 20s.\nWe do not expect that the recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation will have a material impact on our fiscal 2026 tax rate. And finally, our outlook reflects the progress we are making with our customers, the cost savings. We are on track to deliver and the early but positive results of the work by our team to execute focus to win within a competitive market. I'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Bernadette. In closing, we are acting with urgency to execute our focus doing strategy, including delivering our cost savings program. We have continued to drive strong volume growth and are pleased with the momentum we are seeing with our customers. Our team is focused on improving capital efficiency and increasing cash flows as our growth investments are complete and reducing working capital.\nWe have trend forward products coming to the market and the capacity and innovation to partner with our customers, and we are managing our business strategically, deploying resources and focusing our efforts in the areas of the market where we have the most differentiation, which we are confident will best position us for sustained success. Finally, we've reaffirmed our outlook for fiscal '26. We will now be happy to answer your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Debbie Hancock, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nDebbie Hancock\n\nSenior Vice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Full Year Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. I'm Debbie Hancock, Lamb Weston's Vice President of Investor Relations.\nEarlier today, we issued our press release and posted slides that we will use for our discussion today. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we will be making forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on our current expectations. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release and the appendix to our presentation.\nJoining me today are Mike Smith, our President and CEO; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. I first want to thank our Lamb Weston team around the globe for their hard work and strong execution.\nFiscal 2025 was a year of substantial change for Lamb Weston. In addition to me becoming CEO, we recently added significant new and relevant experience to the Board with 6 new members, including a new Chairman, Bradley Alford, as well as Laurence Cursius; Paul Mace; Timothy McLevish; Ruth Kimmelshue and Scott Osfeld. Management and the new Board have a high sense of urgency and are aligned on capitalizing on the many opportunities we collectively see to drive results in our business.\nToday's results evidence the momentum we continue to build with customers and the visibility we have in our business as we work to rebuild credibility with investors. We are focused on controlling what we can control and are taking advantage of opportunities to drive results and improve execution through a cost savings program we announced today, along with our customer-centric Focus to Win strategy for long-term success. Successful execution of these plans will help drive improved performance, including free cash flow and long-term returns.\nTo drive further alignment along with sales and adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and returns on capital have been added to our compensation plans for fiscal 2026 -- this alignment continues at the Board level, which for 2026, the Board has unanimously elected to receive their compensation in equity in the company. We believe these cumulative actions are readying the organization to further support customers and accelerate our performance when demand returns to growth.\nTurning to business results. Lamb Weston ended the year with momentum and customer wins and retention, delivering results ahead of our updated expectations for fiscal 2025. The team is executing at a high level and our long-standing commitment to quality, service and innovation is driving success with customers globally.\nWe had a strong fourth quarter that came in above our expectations. Volume was up with wins across channels and geographies and net sales grew. Price/mix declined reflecting our support of customers with price and trade as we manage the competitive environment and soft restaurant traffic. We're also seeing the benefits of our cost savings in our cost structure. Adjusted EBITDA increased in the quarter, and we made significant progress in improving working capital.\nFor the full year, our success in the second half enabled us to end the year with volume up. As discussed on earlier calls, our full year profit was impacted by actions to support customers in a competitive environment, higher costs from production curtailments and higher inventories during the year as well as inflationary pressures. We offset some of this impact by delivering slightly above our cost savings target, with $59 million of savings for the year.\nSince January, when I took on the role of CEO, I've worked closely with the Board and management team to drive change with urgency and better position our business for success. Over the past several months and with the support of outside resources, we undertook an end-to-end assessment of our operations. We developed a strategic plan to drive targeted decision-making and actions and we are now executing on a plan to unlock near and long-term value.\nThis plan, which we call Focus to Win includes zero-based budgeting, assessing our noncore assets and augmenting our commercial go-to-market. We are already making progress. You can see in our better-than-expected results announced today, but we know that the work and the real opportunities are ahead of us. We are operating in an industry with rapidly changing dynamics in a global consumer environment that remains uncertain. It requires a new approach, a Focus to Win.\nGlobal demand for French fries remain strong, but the market dynamics are evolving in important ways: growth in food delivery, expanding QSR concepts and air fryers changing how we cook at home are creating an opportunity that demands innovation and new approaches. Geographic growth is greatest in emerging markets where margin profiles are lower but also where QSR formats are expanding.\nAnd following market shortages during COVID, the long-term attractiveness of our industry has created the potential for future supply-demand imbalance, most notably outside the U.S. As previously discussed, while new capacity has been announced globally, we do not expect at all to be built. We have already begun to see industry consolidation and decisions to postpone or cancel capacity additions. We believe these postponements and cancellations could continue as the industry has been rational over time.\nImportantly, not all new capacity is created equal, geographic exposure, capabilities, reliability of raw material sourcing and quality to determine the markets and channels impacted by new capacity. We believe that much of the new capacity in developing markets like India and the Middle East does not have the capability to produce higher-margin premium items, which is the strategic focus for Lamb Weston.\nWe believe the work we performed on the market confirmed our right to win in our key geographies, segments and product categories. We are operating in some of the lowest cost potato-growing regions and we are investing in capabilities aligned to growth opportunities and to our customers' needs to win and grow profitably over time.\nLet's talk about our Focus to Win strategy. To differentiate Lamb Weston in today's market, we are defining where to play through a strategic framework that focuses our resources and efforts on the most attractive growth opportunities across markets, channels and product segments. How we expect to win is targeted, strengthen our customer partnerships, execute with excellence and set the pace for innovation.\nWe are creating a repeatable cycle with four elements that drive growth and profitability for Lamb Weston. First, we are focusing investments on priority global markets and segments. Second, we are strengthening customer partnerships. Third, we are achieving executional excellence. And finally, we are setting the pace for innovation. We'll talk more about these shortly. But at the core, we will do what our team does better than anyone else -- be our customer's #1 partner, a world-class potato company and an industry-leading innovator. Our focus will be on geographies, channels and products where we can both differentiate and lead.\nWe've built our business, in part by being something for everyone. But going forward, we will continue to partner with excellence in our core markets. We will invest to grow in markets, channels and product categories with more attractive profit opportunities where customers value our full product and service offerings. We will focus our resources on markets and segments where we have the greatest advantage and reevaluate noncore assets and markets. We will close the capability gaps in our organization and we will target premium market segments where innovation is a differentiator.\nWe must transform how we operate. It is how we will win. First, strengthen customer partnerships. Lamb Weston remains a partner of choice for our customers. Our third-party research confirms that our value relationships and service are best-in-class. Our opportunity is to expand what we've done with our largest customers to our priority customer targets and geographies, enhancing our joint business planning activities and capabilities. Second, achieve executional excellence. To be a partner of choice for our customers and to successfully and profitably operate in an increasingly competitive market, everything we do, we must do with excellence across all functions of the company.\nFor example, in supply chain, we are focused on operating an advantaged global footprint aligned to our growth plan with a streamlined distribution network and revamped continuous improvement team with a focus on plant productivity. This includes simplifying and standardizing operations across locations, driving OEE improvement via our Lamb Weston manufacturing operating culture and embedding a 0-loss mindset in raw potato and materials usage.\nFinally, to differentiate in a competitive marketplace with changing customer preferences, we must continue Lamb Weston's long track record of being an innovation leader. Our innovation efforts have delivered incremental improvements that directly enhance the customer and consumer experience. Looking ahead, we're expanding our invention to include breakthrough innovations such as Lamb Weston Fast Fries that allow operators in nontraditional fried channels to provide customers with fast and crispy fry offerings. These customers unlock new sources of value in channels that don't traditionally serve fries, this next chapter broadens our innovation efforts beyond product level and into areas such as process technology.\nFinally, we have created global innovation hubs to orchestrate disruptive innovation platforms. We believe this will create a global network of insights and innovation specialists centered on 2 innovation hubs, North America and International. In concert with these plans and as part of our Focus to Win strategy, today, we announced cost savings that are designed to better align our organization with the environment, improve efficiency and focus on our biggest opportunities.\nWe have identified at least $250 million of annualized run rate savings that we expect to achieve by the end of fiscal 2028, that Bernadette will talk about more in a moment. We believe these actions will lower our cost base and help ensure we remain competitive while reallocating resources on a more targeted basis to invest for growth. As I've discussed, customer and consumer preferences for our products remain high. Though execution in this period of macro uncertainty will be paramount to the future success of the company. We must control what we can control to continue delivering best-in-class returns on our business.\nThis includes streamlining our organization, implementing zero-based budgeting and strategically investing to improve productivity and strengthen our manufacturing network, but we also should not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is that Lamb Weston will be poised to deliver for our customers with an improved cost structure and operations.\nWhen our customers see increased demand in their business, we don't know exactly when that will be, but when it does happen, we have confidence that it will, and we will be well positioned to win when it does.\nI'll now turn it over to Bernadette to review the fourth quarter and fiscal year performance and walk through our outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by thanking our teams for their hard work in fiscal '25 as we navigated a challenging year.\nHalfway through the year, we made important changes to adapt to the evolving environment and put our business on a path back to growth. Our fourth quarter results reflect the progress we made throughout the year to address the dynamic and changing environment. We delivered volume growth in the fourth quarter and for the full year, disciplined cost management and a focus on cash flow with significant working capital improvements and lower capital expenditures.\nLet's begin with our fourth quarter results on Slide 17. Net sales increased 4% compared with the prior year. Volume increased 8%, primarily driven by contract wins across each of our channels and geographic regions and lapping an approximate $22 million negative impact in the prior period from a previously announced voluntary products withdrawal.\nThese gains were partially offset by soft global restaurant traffic trends which were down low single digits in our largest markets of the U.S. and U.K. Despite lower traffic trends, there are some positive trends in the consumption data. In the U.S., French fries attachment rates continue to remain approximately 2 points higher than pre-pandemic levels. The French fry category grew 1% in the quarter and QSR fry serving sizes also increased 1%. Price/mix declined 4% in the quarter compared to the prior year reflecting efforts to support customers on price and trade in an increasingly competitive environment in both our North America and international segments.\nLooking at our segments. North America net sales declined 1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to lower net selling prices. Price mix in our North America segment declined 5% due to pricing actions to support our customers, which was only partially offset by favorable channel and product mix. The favorable mix was attributable to growth in higher margin regional small and retail customers.\nVolume increased 4%, primarily related to regional small and retail customer wins. These volume gains were partially offset by soft restaurant traffic. In the U.S., QSR traffic improved from February's level, but compared with the prior year was down 1% in the quarter and the fiscal year.\nTraffic at QSR chain specializing in hamburgers was down 2% in the quarter and 3% for the year. It's important to note that this is on top of declines in the prior year. Restaurant traffic on a 2-year stack is down mid-single digits with QSR hamburger focused restaurants, down high single digits over the 2-year period.\nFor our International segment, sales grew 15% versus the prior year quarter with little impact from foreign exchange. Despite restaurant traffic being down 3% in the U.K. our largest international market and relatively flat in key international markets. The international segment volume increased 16% driven primarily by recent customer contract wins and to a lesser extent, lapping the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year.\nPrice/mix declined 1%, reflecting pricing actions to support customers in key international markets in response to the continued competitive environment.\nMoving on from sales. As expected, adjusted gross profit declined compared with the prior year quarter, due primarily to first pricing actions to support our customers -- million of higher factory burden absorption. Specifically, fixed costs assigned to our curtailed lines are being temporarily absorbed by lower production levels, which leads to increased cost per pound.\nThird, low single-digit input cost inflation, including the benefit of lower raw potato prices. And finally, while not impacting EBITDA, higher depreciation expense from our recent capacity expansions. These actions were partially offset by increased sales volume and lapping the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year.\nAdjusted SG&A declined $16 million on lower advertising and promotional spend lapping of higher ERP transition expenses in the prior year as well as the benefit of our cost-saving initiatives. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $285 million which is essentially flat or up $2 million versus the prior year.\nLower adjusted SG&A offset lower adjusted gross profit and equity method earnings after adjustments for depreciation and amortization. Turning to segment EBITDA performance on Slide 19. Adjusted EBITDA in our North America segment declined 7% or $19 million versus the prior year quarter to $258 million, primarily related to pricing actions to support our customers and $17 million of incremental fixed factory burden absorption. This was only partially offset by lapping a $19 million charge for the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year and lower SG&A expenses.\nFor our International segment, adjusted EBITDA increased $22 million to $63 million. Higher net sales, lower manufacturing cost per pound, including lapping a $21 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal in the prior year and lower SG&A offset the impact of a 1% decrease in price mix.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flows on Slide 20. We ended the year with approximately $1.24 billion of liquidity, comprised of approximately $1.17 billion available under our revolving credit facility and $71 million of cash and cash equivalents. Our net debt was $4.1 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio was 3.3x on a trailing 12-month basis.\nIn fiscal '25, we generated $86 million of cash from operations. This is up $70 million versus the prior year due primarily to $349 million of favorable changes in working capital, which was primarily attributable to lower inventories, which reduced 8 days and a favorable change in accrued liabilities.\nWe expect to continue to drive inventory improvements as part of our Focus to Win plan. This plan includes approximately $60 million of cash flow from inventory improvement in fiscal '26 and '27 or $120 million in total by the end of fiscal '27.\nTurning to Slide 21. Capital expenditures for fiscal 2025, net of proceeds from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina were $651 million, down $323 million with our expansion projects nearing completion. We ended the year below our initial $750 million target due to continued capital discipline, cost savings initiatives and the timing of projects and cash outlays.\nFor fiscal '26, our capital spending is expected to be approximately $500 million with approximately $400 million in maintenance and modernization and $100 million for environmental projects, which are mostly for wastewater treatment.\nOn Slide 22, you can see that we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. For the year, we returned $489 million. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $100 million of shares and $282 million in the year, leaving us with $358 million available under the plan. We also returned $207 million in cash dividends during the year. We plan to continue to follow a disciplined capital allocation approach anchored around investment in the business, its capabilities and areas we are working to competitively differentiate Lamb Weston to execute our business strategy while maintaining a strong balance sheet and opportunistically returning capital to shareholders.\nLet's turn to our outlook. Starting with the potato crop on Slide 23. We started harvesting and processing the early potato varieties in North America, and initial indications are that this portion of the new crop is slightly above historical averages. At this time, the potato crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest, that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely within historical ranges as growing conditions in these regions have been favorable.\nAs a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a mid-single-digit decrease in the aggregate and contract prices for the 2025 potato crop. Because we ended the year with lower inventories, we expect that we will begin realizing the benefits of lower-cost potatoes harvested out of field in the second quarter of fiscal '26. This is earlier than last year and in line with historical seasonal timing.\nIn Europe, favorable dry and warm growing conditions in the industry's main growing regions of the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Germany are expected to result in an average crop. We currently expect our potato costs in Europe to be flat to slightly lower than the previous year's fixed price contracts. We will provide more details on the crops in both North America and Europe when we report our second quarter results.\nTurning to Slide 24 and our fiscal 2026 outlook. The outlook includes the contribution of a 53rd week with the additional week falling in the fourth quarter. In fiscal '26, we expect our category to continue to be in high demand with customers and consumers prioritizing French fries as a menu and an at-home item. However, our guidance assumes continued pressure on consumers from macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. Our outlook assumes no improvement in global restaurant traffic from fiscal '25 levels, but it does plan for customer momentum that began in the second half of fiscal '25 to continue.\nIt also does not include additional impacts of evolving trade policy, including changes in tariffs and retaliatory countermeasures. With this as a backdrop, we expect revenue for fiscal '26 in the range of $6.35 billion to $6.55 billion, which is a 2% decline to 2% growth on a constant currency basis. The carryover pricing actions we made in fiscal '25 to support our customers will have a negative impact on net sales in the first half of the year.\nBased on the timing of contract renewals, most of the fiscal '26 pricing actions will impact the second half of the year, and they are expected to have a lesser impact than those made in fiscal '25. In total, we expect sales to be stronger in the second half of the fiscal year, which will benefit from the additional week.\nTurning to our adjusted EBITDA outlook on Slide 25. Beginning in fiscal '26, we are implementing changes in our reporting of adjusted SG&A and adjusted EBITDA to fully exclude noncash share-based compensation expense. In fiscal '25, stock-based compensation expense was $40 million. After this call, we will publish a schedule recasting prior periods to reflect this new methodology on our investor website. With this change, we expect adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2026 of $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We expect adjusted gross profit to be down negatively impacted by the carryover pricing and further efforts to support customers with price and trade in fiscal '26.\nLow single-digit inflation, including the benefit of lower raw potato costs, and higher fixed factory burden and start-up costs in our International segment, primarily related to our new plant in Argentina, which is expected to begin producing sellable product in August. Before the benefits of our cost savings program, we expect adjusted SG&A will increase compared with the prior year due to an incremental $40 million headwind related to normalizing incentive compensation expenses after a couple of years of lower-than-planned incentive achievement and approximately $10 million of incremental investments, including, for example, innovation and advertising and promotion expenses to support our long-term strategic plan.\nOur adjusted gross margin and SG&A will benefit from the cost savings program that we announced today. We expect to deliver approximately $200 million of the full savings target by the end of fiscal '27 with about half on a run rate basis fiscal '26. In fiscal '26, we expect approximately 2/3 of the $100 million of savings to be realized in the second half of the year. About 2/3 will benefit adjusted gross profit and 1/3 will benefit adjusted SG&A this year.\nOver the program's life, however, we anticipate approximately 75% of the benefit in gross profit and 25% in SG&A. To deliver the savings, we expect to recognize approximately $70 million to $100 million of cash pretax charges, most of which are expected to be paid in fiscal '26. Keep in mind that these savings are on top of the remaining approximately $25 million of incremental benefits that we expect to deliver under the restructuring plan we announced in fiscal '25.\nAnd finally, adjusted EBITDA will benefit from the contribution of an additional week of sales and earnings. We are targeting a full year effective tax rate of approximately 26% for fiscal '26, excluding the impact of comparability items. This tax rate is forecast to be in the high 20s in the first half of the year and low 20s in the second half of the year, reflecting the expected timing of discrete items most notably in the fourth quarter, we do not expect the recently enacted U.S. federal tax legislation to have a material impact on our fiscal 2016 tax rate.\nIn summary, Lamb Weston is operating from a strong financial foundation, and we believe the steps we announced today will enable us to improve our competitiveness and financial position through cost savings establishing clear strategic priorities and working capital improvements. We believe these expected savings, together with lower levels of capital expenditures and working capital improvements, will help drive improved profitability and cash flow over the long term.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Mike.\n\nMichael Jared Smith\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Bernadette. I'm confident in the direction we are taking in Lamb Weston, and we are making important and significant changes to our business to compete more effectively in today's marketplace. We have organizational alignment to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities in front of us. We will drive performance by focusing on the controllables, but we do so knowing it will provide an even bigger opportunity for us and our customers when restaurant traffic returns to growth, and we will be ready.\nWith that, we're happy to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Earlier today, we issued our earnings press release and posted our slides that we'll use for today's call. You can find both on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release in the appendix to our presentation.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer.\nLet me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Let me start with the leadership change we announced earlier today. As you've likely seen, I will be stepping down as CEO and Mike Smith, our current COO, will become Lamb Weston's next President and CEO beginning January 3, 2025.\nThe Board and I believe now is the right time to transition to allow a new leader to guide Lamb Weston into its next chapter of growth. And I could not be more thrilled to hand over the reins to Mike. His appointment represents the culmination of a thoughtful years-long succession planning process by the Board, and we are confident he is the right leader to guide Lamb Weston forward.\nOver the course of his 17-year career at Lamb Weston, Mike has developed a deep understanding of all critical aspects of our business and operational opportunities and driven growth across multiple areas of the company. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Mike and have witnessed firsthand his value-based leadership style and steadfast focus on people as well as his thorough understanding of the business. I'm confident that with Mike at the helm, Lamb Weston will drive profit and deliver value for our shareholders.\nNow turning to our results. Our second quarter performance was below our expectations and not what we aim to achieve at Lamb Weston. Slide 4 provides a snapshot of the key themes that we'll be discussing with you today. We expect the challenging operating environment will persist in the near term as weak restaurant traffic trends and additional capacity expansions announced by our competitors since our Investor Day last year, add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America.\nIn this new reality, we're evaluating opportunities beyond our initial restructuring plan to adjust our operations including reducing manufacturing and supply chain costs and operating expenses. In addition, we're evaluating opportunities to drive the top line by improving sales execution while also expanding our total addressable market by leveraging proprietary technologies to see nontraditional fry customers.\nAs we discussed on our last quarter's earnings call, we expect to significantly reduce our capital spending next year as we shift away from growth capital to focus on base, modernization and environmental capital. We expect these steps to increase our free cash flow, which would provide more flexibility to step up capital returns to our shareholders. We'll address each of these points during this call.\nLet me now turn it over to Bernadette to discuss details on our second quarter results.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 5, you can see that net sales declined 8% compared with the year ago quarter. Volume declined 6%, primarily driven by declining restaurant traffic in the U.S. and many of our key international markets. Customer share losses, net of gains, and the carryover impact of our decision last year to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA to strategically manage customer and product mix.\nWhile the effects of these 3 factors were largely in line with our expectations, the declines in sales and volume were more than what we anticipated for the quarter as we experienced incremental customer share losses in both business segments due to an increasingly competitive environment.\nPrice/mix declined 2% as compared to the prior year quarter, which was just below our target for the period. Our pricing actions in North America were in line with our expectations. However, pricing in our international markets was more competitive. Channel and product mix was also in line with our expectations but unfavorable versus the prior year quarter, reflecting customer share losses exceeding customer gains.\nFor our North America segment specifically, sales declined 8% versus the prior year quarter. Volume declined 5% and included the carryover impact of smaller and regional customer share losses in food away-from-home channels in the prior year and share losses in certain chain restaurant accounts. The majority of the decline, however, was due to the drop in restaurant traffic in the U.S. According to restaurant industry data providers U.S. restaurant traffic in the second quarter declined about 2% versus the prior year.\nAlthough trends improved modestly versus our fiscal first quarter as QSR did continue to step up promotional activity. Traffic at QSR chain specializing in hamburgers in the second quarter declined about 1.5% versus the year ago period. We continue to be encouraged by the improving trend in traffic and the steady fry attachment rate. But as a reminder, many of these promotional meal deals have consumers trading down from a medium serving size to a small french fries serving size. As a result, while we benefit from improving traffic trends, the effect of the trade down in serving sizes acts as a partial and with some customers a significant headwind to our volumes.\nPrice/mix in North America declined 3%, reflecting the planned investments that we made to retain and attract volume as well as unfavorable channel and product mix.\nFor our International segment, sales declined 6% versus the prior year quarter. Volume declined 6%, driven by several factors. First, restaurant traffic declined or softened sequentially in many of our key international markets. While restaurant traffic in the U.K., our largest market in Europe, was flat, traffic declined in Germany, France and Spain. In Japan, QSR traffic grew versus the prior year but decelerated versus our fiscal first quarter. Traffic growth in China remained soft.\nSecond, we experienced incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment, most notably in the Middle East and certain markets in Asia Pacific.\nAnd third, we continue to realize the carryover effect of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in EMEA. This was the last quarter that will serve as a headwind. Price/mix was flat versus the prior year quarter as incremental pricing actions to compete in key international markets offset the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions in EMEA.\nMoving on from sales. On Slide 6, you can see that adjusted EBITDA fell $95 million versus the prior year quarter to $282 million. The decrease is largely attributable to a $135 million decline in adjusted gross profit. That was due primarily to 4 factors.\nFirst, price/mix declined due to the planned pricing actions to retain customers and attract incremental volume.\nSecond, higher manufacturing cost per pound, which reflects input cost inflation and inefficiencies associated with lower production and low factory and potato utilization rates.\nThird, we incurred incremental production costs related to unplanned facility downtime and additional start-up costs associated with our new capacity expansions.\nAnd finally, while not impacting EBITDA, we incurred $16 million of higher depreciation expense that's largely related to our capacity expansions in China and Idaho that were completed last fiscal year.\nAdjusted SG&A declined $12 million to $165 million. We reduced adjusted SG&A despite an incremental $7 million of noncash amortization related to our new ERP system that went live in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Continued execution of our expense reduction initiatives, including those associated with our restructuring plan, drove most of the improvement with the remainder largely due to lower performance-based compensation and [indiscernible].\nFor North America specifically, adjusted EBITDA declined $55 million to $267 million, driven the combination of unfavorable price/mix, lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing cost per pound and incremental production costs.\nFor our International segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $53 million to $47 million. Buyer manufacturing cost per pound and incremental production costs drove the decline and the increasingly competitive environment in each region affected our ability to use price to fully offset inflation.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow on Slide 7. We ended the second quarter with about $80 million of cash and $1.2 billion available under our revolving credit facility. Our net debt was $4 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 3.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. In the first half of the year, we generated nearly $430 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus the prior year due to lower earnings, which were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the first half of the year, net of proceeds from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, were $486 million as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands during the second quarter and continued construction of our Argentina facility. We expect our capital spending during the second half of the year to significantly decline as we continue to target total annual capital expenditures of $750 million in fiscal 2025.\nDuring the quarter, we returned about $52 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. We did not purchase any shares under our share repurchase authorization during the second quarter.\nI'll now turn it back over to Tom, who will cover the next few slides. Tom?\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. At our Investor Day more than a year ago, we provided our view of the global frozen potato industry, including our estimates of future capacity additions as well as demand growth. Much has changed since then. So we wanted to provide you with our updated view.\nAs shown on Slide 8, prior to COVID, frozen potato demand in the U.S. and our key international markets was growing above historical rates resulting in Lamb Weston and the industry at large operating above full capacity. While COVID effected demand for a relatively short period, we saw evidence of frozen potato demand quickly rebounding to pre-COVID levels and historical growth rates. As a result, we strategically plan to expand capacity, so we would be well positioned to serve our customers and capture our share of growing global demand.\nSo starting in early 2021 and knowing that it typically takes 2 to 3 years to plan, construct and qualify a new facility, we were one of the first processors to announce major capacity expansions and modernization of our existing production lines. This included projects in China, Idaho, the Netherlands and Argentina.\nBy the time of our Investor Day in October 2023, as you can see on the chart, some competitors have also announced capacity expansion projects. Since then, legacy competitors as well as some relatively new market entrants have announced plans to construct more than 3.5 million pounds of additional capacity between 2024 and 2027. This primarily includes expansions in Europe, China and Brazil, but also in relatively new frozen potato processing regions such as India and the Middle East. While competitors' expansion announcements are always expected, we did not foresee the timing and aggregate scale of these additional expansions.\nAs you can see on Slide 9, including these additional announcements, we expect the industry in total may add up to 8.6 million pounds of incremental production capacity over the next 4 calendar years. Given the near-term operating environment, we don't know whether all capacity expansions that have been announced will move forward and be operational by the end of calendar 2028.\nThat said, if all these announced capacity additions are completed and on time and if there are no further capacity reductions, other than our strategic closure of Canal Washington facility, we estimate total industry capacity may be more than 44 billion pounds by the end of 2028. That's an additional 10 billion pounds of capacity being added between 2023 and 2028, which is 4 billion pounds more than what was added in the previous 5 years.\nThis has implications for industry capacity utilization. In 2024, we estimate capacity utilization is around 90% which itself is down from the high 90s during the past couple of years due to the slowdown in global demand and the addition of nearly 3 billion pounds of incremental supply by Lamb Weston and our peers. Over the next few years, we expect capacity utilization may be in the mid- to high 80s.\nAccordingly, and again, assuming all the announced expansion projects are completed or not significantly delayed, we expect the operating environment will remain challenged through the medium term, even if demand returns to historical rates as incremental capacity expansions add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America.\nAs you see on Slide 10, we have again been an early mover to implement actions to combat the challenging environment. Nearly 3 months ago, we announced a Restructuring Plan to address the imbalance and improve our cost structure. This included reducing head count, permanently closing a processing facility and temporarily curtailing production lines and schedules. We remain on track to deliver on the $55 million of cost savings associated with this plan in fiscal 2025 and annualized cost savings of $85 million in fiscal 2026.\nIn addition, as I noted earlier, we're continuing to evaluate and execute opportunities to adjust our supply chain operations and support functions to effectively manage through this challenging environment, protect our profitability and improve free cash flow.\nWe brought on a new Chief Supply Chain Officer about 4 months ago, and we're encouraged to see the opportunity she and the team identified to reduce our manufacturing and supply chain costs. In the back half of the year, we'll have more to say about these initiatives to improve performance and profitability.\nLet me now turn over the call to Bernadette to discuss our updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. While we anticipated a challenging environment for the balance of fiscal 2025 during our last earnings call, our performance so far has fallen short of expectations. As a result, we're reducing our financial targets for the year to reflect our performance in the second quarter as well as the increasingly competitive environment that Tom just described.\nAs you can see on Slide 11, we're reducing our net sales target range to $6.35 billion to $6.45 billion from our previous range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion. Using the midpoint of the new sales range implies a sales decline of 1% versus fiscal 2024. We're also reducing our adjusted EBITDA target range to $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion from our previous estimate of around $1.38 billion.\nLet me walk you through the key changes. On Slide 12, you can see that about 1/4 of the reduction in our annual sales target reflects the shortfall versus expectations during the second quarter. The remainder reflects the combination of factors that affect the second half of the year. In North America, we expect incremental sales volume pressure due to the impact of unexpected loss of a chain restaurant customer, partially offset by the benefit of some new customer wins and a greater than forecasted impact from the downsizing and serving size related to promotional meals at key customers.\nOur forecast for price/mix in North America is down modestly from our previous estimate due to less favorable mix than we previously anticipated. Our forecast specifically for price is essentially unchanged as the pricing environment, while competitive, remains largely in line with our initial expectations.\nIn our International segment, we expect volume to be below our previous forecast, primarily reflecting incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment as well as softer restaurant traffic in key international markets. In addition, we expect incremental pricing pressure in each of our regions, but for different reasons.\nIn Asia Pacific and Latin America, we're experiencing an increasingly competitive environment as demand growth slows and as additional supply from Europe and newer entrants in India, China and the Middle East gained share.\nIn EMEA, we're moderating some of the inflation-driven pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year to counter the initial surge in the market price of potatoes. In short, we expect the 1% decline in total Lamb Weston net sales versus the prior year will be driven by a low to mid-single-digit decline in price/mix, partially offset by a low single-digit increase in volume growth.\nWith respect to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 13, you can see that nearly 1/3 of the $190 million reduction in our annual adjusted EBITDA target reflects the shortfall in our performance in the second quarter versus expectations. Most of the remaining reduction in our EBITDA forecast is due to the impact of a more competitive environment in our key international markets, which is affecting volume and our ability to pass along input cost inflation. It's also due to the reductions in volume and less favorable mix in North America that I described earlier. In addition, relative to our previous forecast, we expect to incur increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization.\nWith respect to SG&A, we're maintaining our current range of $680 million to $690 million, but will likely be towards the top end of the range. As you can see on Slide 14, based on our updated annual financial forecast for the second half of the year, we expect to deliver sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, implying growth of 1% to 4% as compared with the prior year period.\nWe expect higher volume in both international and North America will drive overall sales growth. We forecast that our International segment will contribute the majority of the overall volume increase, primarily reflecting the benefit of incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins across each of our geographic regions net of recent share losses, lapping the impact of canceled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition as well as the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal that affected our results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.\nWe expect North America volume growth to also reflect the benefit of lapping canceled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition, continued progress in regaining share of regional and small customers lost in the prior year and incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins, net of share losses.\nWe expect overall price/mix will be down in the second half of the year. In North America, we're forecasting price/mix will decline as pricing actions more than offset benefits of improved product and channel mix. As I previously noted, our price investments are consistent with our prior expectations. In International, we're forecasting overall price/mix will also decline due to pricing actions in response to competitive dynamics in key international markets.\nMoving to earnings. In the second half, we expect to deliver $600 million to $640 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is in line with what we delivered in the prior period. Overall, we expect to benefit from incremental volume growth in both International and North America will drive EBITDA growth but will be largely offset by planned investments in price in North America incremental price actions in key international markets and the impact of input cost inflation and increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization, which we are actively working to address.\nNow turning to our thoughts on capital expenditures on Slide 15. As I previously noted, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $750 million for fiscal 2025. We spent about $485 million during first half of the year, as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands and continued construction of our Argentina facility. Spending in the second half of the year will focus on maintenance, modernization and the continued construction of our Argentina facility, which is on track to be completed in mid calendar 2025.\nFor 2026, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $550 million. We expect about $400 million will be for base maintenance capital and modernization efforts, which is in line with our annual depreciation and amortization expense. The other $150 million will be for environmental capital projects that largely focus on wastewater treatment at our manufacturing facilities. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect to spend about $500 million in total over the next 5 years to comply with increasingly strict government regulations and permit limitations.\nFor at least a few years beyond 2026, given our expectations for lower industry capacity utilization, we do not expect to direct any significant investments to growth capital. We'll focus our spending on base and modernization capital, which together is generally up to 5% of sales, plus an additional $75 million or so each year for environmental projects. As a result, fiscal 2026 should be a positive inflection point for our free cash flow. Note that the annual amounts that I just described exclude any capital we expect to deploy when we restart the next phase of our ERP implementation.\nTurning to our thoughts on capital return to shareholders on Slide 16. Today, we announced a $250 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. With this increase, we have approximately $560 million remaining under our authorization. As has been our practice, we'll continue to use a disciplined approach to repurchasing shares. But the increased authorization, combined with the increase in expected free cash flows, provides us with the flexibility to opportunistically buy back shares under the program.\nWith respect to dividends, we declared a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share. This is consistent with our history of increasing our dividend each year since becoming a public company more than 8 years ago. Our target dividend payout ratio remains 25% to 35% of earnings per share. While we're above that range today, that's a result of temporarily depressed earnings.\nLet me now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. So let me just summarize today by saying, we expect the operating environment in the near term will remain challenging as additional capacity expansions are announced during a period of ongoing pressure on demand. We are proactively adapting to this dynamic environment by strategically adjusting our footprint, reducing capital expenditures, managing our cost structure and improving cash flow. At the same time, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and steady increases in our dividend while continuing to maintain and modernize our production assets.\nOverall, we remain well positioned with the unique strength and scale that Lamb Weston system provides navigated tough industry-wide operating environment. We're taking actions to adapt our operations to weather these transitory challenges and make lasting improvements to our operations, and we'll continue to leverage our solid fundamentals and balance sheet to continue to deliver value to our shareholders.\nBefore taking questions, I just want to end with saying again that serving as Lamb Weston's President and CEO, has been a privilege and an honor, and I'm proud of what the entire Lamb Weston team has accomplished during the last 8 years. With Mike and his leadership team at the helm, Lamb Weston's future is in great hands. Thank you for joining us this morning.\nNow let me turn it back over to Dexter.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. Before opening up the call for questions, I just want to note that Mike and Bernadette will be on the road with investors in January. We'll provide details for those meetings shortly after the start of the new year.\nWith that, we're now ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of our strategies and priorities for the upcoming year, the current operating environment, and our initial thoughts on this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal '25. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Our financial results for the fourth quarter and for the year are disappointing, reflecting executional challenges both commercially and in our supply chain as well as soft global demand for fries. While Bernadette will cover our fourth quarter results in more detail later, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets due to a combination of targeted investments in price, a decision to voluntarily withdraw our product to ensure we meet our quality standards and, more importantly, those of our customers, higher-than-anticipated market share losses, an unfavorable mix, and softer-than-expected restaurant traffic trends in both the U.S. and many of our key international markets.\nThis level of execution is unacceptable, and I and my leadership team take full responsibility for our operating and financial results. As we outlined in our Investor Day last October, we believe that frozen potatoes is an attractive growing global category and that we have built a solid foundation to serve our customers in this market over the long term. This includes some key actions taken in fiscal 2024 such as: integrating the acquisition of our former European joint venture; starting up state-of-the-art processing facilities in China in October 2023 and American Falls, Idaho in May of 2024; strengthening our product portfolio by introducing innovative technologies to expand our total addressable market; implementing pricing actions that offset multiple years of high input cost inflation; taking a big step in upgrading our IT infrastructure by cutting over key central systems processes in North America to a new ERP system; and continuing to drive supply chain productivity savings across our global production network.\nWe believe we're focused on the right strategies and priorities to get Lamb Weston back on track to drive sales growth, reduce costs, improve profitability, and generate attractive returns over the long term. That said, the operating environment has changed rapidly during fiscal 2024 as global restaurant traffic and frozen potato demand softened. In fact, the downward traffic trends accelerated during the back half of the year and into early fiscal 2025. This has led to an increase in available industry capacity in North America and Europe. We believe this industry supply-demand imbalance will persist through much, if not all, of fiscal 2025.\nAlthough this has no impact on our long-term strategies, we are making some operating adjustments in the near term to support improved execution, competitiveness in our financial results. We are reinvigorating volume growth by matching the right product at the right price to fit customer needs and by also leveraging limited-time offerings and innovation to help our customers drive traffic. We're targeting specific investments in price and trade support to protect share and win new business. We're aggressively looking at opportunities to reduce costs further by driving supply chain productivity and tightly managing operating expenses.\nWe're leveraging recent capacity investments to increase flexibility in managing our manufacturing footprint to balance production and shipments. We're reshaping future investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. And we're simplifying our key processes to make it easier for customers to do business with Lamb Weston. These priorities will change how we expect to drive sales and earnings growth in fiscal 2025.\nSpecifically, our sales growth will be largely volume-driven unlike the price-driven top line that we've delivered in recent years. Overall, we expect the net impact of our inflation-driven pricing actions in the aggregate will have minimal contribution to our net sales as we employ targeted investments in price to support volume growth. As a result, we expect our earnings performance will be driven by a combination of volume growth, improved mix, and cost savings. In recent years, our earnings growth has been largely driven by price and, to a lesser extent, mix.\nOur expectation for volume growth is dependent in part on an improvement in restaurant traffic trends. According to restaurant industry data providers, U.S. restaurant traffic softened over the past year as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of menu price inflation. During our fiscal fourth quarter, overall U.S. restaurant traffic as well as QSR traffic was down about 3% versus the prior year. Traffic at QSR chains specializing in hamburgers, a highly important channel for fry consumption, was down more than 4%. In addition, traffic trends in QSR hamburger weakened sequentially each month of the quarter, with May down nearly 6%.\nHowever, we're encouraged that the QSR chains, including QSR hamburger chains, have increased promotional activities to drive restaurant traffic. Given the recent introduction, we believe these promotions did not affect traffic during our fiscal fourth quarter, and we have not yet received comprehensive data that would indicate a more recent benefit on traffic. But we expect that these promotional efforts will have a positive effect on traffic as they have done so in the past.\nOutside the U.S., overall restaurant traffic trends in our key international markets in the fourth quarter were generally consistent with what we observed in the third quarter. Overall traffic was up in France and Italy, down modestly in Germany and Spain, and down about 2% in the U.K., our largest market in Europe. In Asia, overall restaurant traffic grew in both China and Japan. While global restaurant traffic trends were mixed, fry attachment rates in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and China were largely steady.\nWith our key international markets largely stable and the potential for a tailwind from promotional activity in the U.S., we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary and remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rate as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Nonetheless, we've taken a cautious view of the consumer and have not incorporated any change to current trends in our fiscal 2025 outlook. As a result, we expect our volume to decline during the first half of fiscal 2025.\nTurning now to the upcoming potato crop. We're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties in North America, and initial indications are that this portion of the crop is consistent with historical averages. At this time, the potato crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta, and the Midwest that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable. That said, we have not yet seen what impact, if any, the recent heat wave may have on the crop. As a reminder, in North America, we've agreed to a 3% decrease in aggregate in contract prices for the 2024 potato crop. And we would begin to realize the benefit of these lower potato prices beginning in our fiscal third quarter.\nIn Europe, heavy rainfall in the spring in the industry's main growing region in the Netherlands, Belgium, northern France, and northern Germany delayed the completion of planning by about 7 weeks. As a result, the futures index for European processing potatoes has climbed significantly, reflecting the market's expectation for a below-average crop. Based on our practice of purchasing a higher portion of our raw potatoes using fixed price contracts, we believe our exposure to the higher market price is less than that of our European competitors.\nStill, we expect our potato costs in Europe to increase as prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid- to high single digits. We'll provide more detail on the crops in both North America and Europe when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nSo in summary, we believe we've built a solid foundation to support our customers and drive improvement in our financial performance. We continue to operate and invest in this business for the long term and are making the appropriate adjustments this year to manage through the current challenging environment. We're encouraged by the actions that chain restaurants are taking to improve restaurant traffic as well as the traffic trends in most of our key international markets, but we took a cautious view on the consumer when we developed this year's financial targets.\nAnd finally, at this time, we expect the potato crop in North America will be consistent with historical averages, but that the crop in Europe will likely be below average. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2025 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, our sales and earnings performance fell well short of our targets. Our team members are focused on getting our operations and financial results back on track in fiscal 2025. Before I provide our outlook for the upcoming year, let's begin by reviewing our fourth quarter results.\nSales declined $83 million or 5% to more than $1.61 billion. Volume declined 8% and price/mix increased 3%. As it relates to volume, nearly 5 percentage points of the decline reflects the impact of share losses, as well as our decision to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. The decline is a couple of points more than what we originally anticipated and was driven in part by higher-than-estimated share losses.\nWith respect to the ERP transition, the issues we experienced that affected our third quarter order fill rates were temporary and contained in that quarter. We have healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system. The remaining 3 points of the 8-point volume decline reflected about 1 point loss related to the unexpected voluntary product withdrawal that Tom referenced, and about 2 points related to soft restaurant traffic trends in North America and many of our key international markets, which was a bit more than we had expected.\nPrice/mix increased 3%, reflecting the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late fiscal 2023 as well as pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 across both of our business segments. The increase in price/mix, however, was a few points below our expectations. This was largely due to unfavorable mix versus our forecast as customer demand for value-based products increased as well as targeted investments in price in North America.\nMoving on from sales, our adjusted gross profit declined $72 million to $363 million. About $40 million of that decline was due to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining $32 million was primarily driven by lower volume and an $8 million increase in depreciation expense associated with our capacity expansions in China and Idaho. The carryover benefit of our pricing actions largely offset higher manufacturing costs, which was primarily driven by mid-single-digit input cost inflation.\nOur gross margin in the quarter was about 23%, which was about 400 basis points below our target of 27%. Of the shortfall, about 250 basis points was related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remaining roughly 150 basis points largely reflected the unfavorable mix impact from greater-than-expected share losses of higher-priced, higher-margin customers as well as the investments in price that we made in our North America segment. Adjusted SG&A declined $6 million to $172 million, reflecting lower performance-based compensation expense, which more than offset higher expenses associated with information technology investments, higher advertising and promotion investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA, and $6 million of incremental noncash amortization related to our new ERP system.\nOur SG&A in the quarter was about $20 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter target of approximately $193 million, largely due to lower performance-based compensation expense and other cost savings efforts. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $283 million, which is down $50 million versus the prior year as lower sales and gross profit more than offset the decline in SG&A. That's about $80 million below the midpoint of our fourth quarter EBITDA target of approximately $363 million. About half of that shortfall is due to the voluntary product withdrawal late in the quarter. The other half is due largely to targeted investments in price and trade support in our North America segment, unfavorable mix, and lower-than-expected volume, partially offset by favorable SG&A compared with our forecast.\nMoving to our segments. Compared with the year ago period, sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, declined $47 million or 4% in the quarter. Volume declined 7% with about 5 points related to share losses and about 2% related to soft restaurant traffic in the U.S. Price/mix increased 3%, driven by the carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in late 2023, as well as pricing actions for contracts with large and regional chain restaurant customers taken in fiscal 2024.\nUnfavorable mix due to share losses of higher-margin customers as well as targeted investments in price tempered the increase in price/mix. The North America segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million or 7% to $277 million primarily due to an approximately $19 million charge related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder largely reflects a combination of lower sales volumes, unfavorable mix, and higher cost per pound, more than offsetting the benefit of prior pricing actions.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, declined $36 million or 7%. Volume declined 9% with nearly 5 percentage points from share losses, which are due in part to decisions to exit certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in EMEA earlier in the year. We expect these strategic exits will continue to be a headwind through the first half of fiscal 2025. More than 2 points of the volume decline in the quarter reflects the voluntary product withdrawal, while the remaining roughly 2 points reflected soft restaurant traffic trends in key international markets.\nPrice/mix increased 2%, driven primarily by inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken earlier in fiscal 2024. Our International segment's adjusted EBITDA declined $43 million or 52% to $40 million. About $21 million of that decline related to the voluntary product withdrawal. The remainder of that decline was driven by lower sales volume, higher cost per pound, and higher advertising and promotional investments to support the launch of retail products in EMEA and was partially offset by the benefit of prior pricing actions.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with net debt leverage ratio of 2.7x adjusted EBITDA, and our net debt declined nearly $40 million as compared to the end of our fiscal third quarter to about $3.75 billion. We continue to have ample liquidity, including nearly $1.2 billion available for a new global revolving credit facility. For the year, we generated about $800 million of cash from operations, which is up about $37 million versus the prior year. As we discussed before, driving long-term growth requires making the right, strategic, and forward-looking investments. The resilience of our business and our overall financial strength put us in the ideal position to modernize our assets as well as to invest in critical areas that support customer needs and unlock efficiencies for our people and our business.\nThis allowed us to spend about $990 million in capital expenditures this year or about $255 million more than the prior year, largely reflecting strategic investments, to complete facilities in China and American Falls, Idaho, our ongoing capacity expansion projects in the Netherlands and Argentina, and our new ERP system. Finally, consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we returned $384 million of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the year. This includes $210 million in share repurchases, including $60 million in the fourth quarter and $174 million in dividends. This reflects the strength of our balance sheet and our confidence in our business.\nNow turning to our fiscal 2025 outlook. As Tom discussed, we expect that the operating environment this year will be challenging, and that consumers will continue to be more intentional with the dollars they spend in a pressured economic landscape. We expect that soft restaurant traffic and fry demand may result in higher-than-normal available industry capacity for selected product types and channels in fiscal 2025, and that we will make some targeted investments in price and trade to support volume growth and share. In addition, we're aggressively evaluating opportunities and implementing actions to drive supply chain productivity, balanced production based on lower shipments, and reduced operating expenses.\nSpecifically for the year, we're targeting sales of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion on a constant currency basis. This implies growth of 2% to 5%, which we expect will be driven largely by volume. However, we anticipate that volume will decline during the first half of the year, primarily due to 2 factors: first, we'll continue to experience the impact of recent share losses; and second, despite efforts by quick service and casual dining chains to improve traffic through increased promotional activity, we expect that restaurant traffic will remain soft for at least the first half of the year as the consumer continues to adjust to the cumulative impact of years of menu price inflation as well as other economic headwinds.\nDuring the second half of the year, we expect our volume to increase as we lap the prior year impacts of the ERP transition and voluntary product withdrawal, increasingly benefit from recent customer contract wins in the U.S. and key international markets, and recapture some of the market share we lost in fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2025, we don't expect a meaningful contribution to come from price/mix in the aggregate. In North America, we're targeting price/mix to decline. We expect to drive improvements in mix as the year progresses as we recapture lost share in higher-priced, higher-margin channels. However, due to the soft demand environment, we believe the mix benefits will be more than offset by targeted investments in price and trade support to drive volume growth and share growth across the sales channels.\nIn International, when possible under the terms of the customer contracts, we'll look to drive pricing actions to offset input cost inflation, which we anticipate will be largely driven by a below-average crop in Europe. In addition, we'll begin to gradually leverage our revenue growth management tools to manage our price architectures and improve mix. However, we anticipate that the increase in price/mix may be tempered by targeted investments in price and trade support in certain markets and channels to protect market share and win new business.\nFor earnings, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.38 billion to $1.48 billion. For diluted earnings per share, we're targeting $4.35 to $4.85. This includes an adjusted SG&A target of $740 million to $750 million, which is up $70 million versus the prior year, reflecting returning performance-based compensation expense back to targeted levels, an incremental $24 million of noncash amortization related to our new ERP system, and an incremental $10 million of advertising and promotional investments largely to support our retail brands in both North America and EMEA. Excluding these 3 items, our adjusted SG&A expenses are down due to aggressive cost management. As I previously discussed, we're continuing to evaluate and implement additional cost savings actions.\nWe're targeting total depreciation and amortization expense of $375 million, which is an increase of $75 million. About $50 million of the increase is included in cost of sales and largely associated with the depreciation of the capacity expansions in China, Idaho, and the Netherlands. The remainder of the increase primarily reflects the incremental amortization of our ERP system, which is recorded in SG&A.\nFor interest expense, we're forecasting about $180 million. That's an increase of about $45 million, reflecting higher average debt levels and lower capitalized interest. We're forecasting a full year effective tax rate of approximately 24%, which is similar to last year's rate. Finally, we're targeting cash use for capital expenditures of approximately $850 million as we continue the construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts in the Netherlands and Argentina. We currently expect the expansion in the Netherlands to be completed by the end of calendar 2024, while Argentina is targeted to be operational in mid-calendar 2025.\nIn addition, as Tom mentioned, we're looking at rephasing future capital investments to modernize production capabilities to better match the demand environment. That said, more than 80% of this year's forecasted capital expenditures are committed. Since we anticipate our 2 large capacity expansions will be completed by the end of fiscal 2025, we expect a notable decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2026.\nBecause of the rapid change in the operating environment, our fiscal 2025 growth rates are below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline. As it relates to sales, our fiscal 2025 outlook implies a normalized growth rate of 0% to 3% after adjusting for the estimated impact of the ERP transition in fiscal 2024. That growth rate is at the low end of our long-term growth algorithm of low to mid-single digits. Our adjusted EBITDA target for fiscal 2025 is about $160 million, below our normalized fiscal 2024 baseline of about $1.6 billion.\nBroadly speaking, that decline reflects targeted investments in price and trade support to retain or win new customers, challenges in certain markets and channels to implement sufficient pricing to offset input cost inflation, an estimated carryover impact of unfavorable mix from lost share of higher-priced, higher-margin customers in North America, and an additional estimated $20 million to $30 million loss in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 associated with the voluntary product withdrawal.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Tom, I want to provide some thoughts on the first quarter. While we don't typically provide quarterly guidance, given our recent results, the expected headwinds and the changes in the operating environment, we're providing more detail on our expectations for the quarter. Specifically in the first quarter, we're targeting sales to be down mid- to high single digits, with volume down mid-single digits due to the carryover impact of share losses, soft restaurant traffic, and the voluntary product withdrawal. We believe that the impact of share losses and soft traffic will be the greatest in the first quarter and gradually ease as the year progresses.\nWe expect price/mix may be down low to mid-single digits as the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2024 are more than offset by the impact of unfavorable mix and targeted investments in price and trade support in North America. For earnings, we expect our EBITDA margin to be the lowest of the year due to our typical seasonality and the $20 million to $30 million loss estimated to be associated with the voluntary product withdrawal that I mentioned earlier. We do not expect additional losses related to the product withdrawal beyond the first quarter. We also expect our first quarter margin will be pressured by higher cost per pound, unfavorable mix, and investments in price and trade support. Let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. We expect fiscal 2025 to be a challenging year but remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. Despite the current market softness, we're executing on our priorities that drive our long-term strategy. We're aggressively managing costs and evaluating our manufacturing network requirements as demand trends unfold. Our capacity expansion projects remain on schedule as we continue to modernize our production assets, which when combined with improving our core asset performance, positions us to continue to support our customers and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining our call today and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. .\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release. With me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the ERP transition, the current demand environment and the status of this year's potato crop. Bernadette will then provide details on our third quarter results as well as our updated outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. This was a challenging quarter as we transition certain central systems and functions in North America from a decades-old legacy enterprise resource planning system to SAP. The transition is the first step towards a multiyear global rollout. Among other areas, the scope of this transition affected receiving and processing customer orders, trade pricing and promotion management, managing inventories and warehousing, scheduling, transportation and shipments, invoicing customers and treasury and cash management.\nWhile the transition went well in many areas, it proved more difficult than we expected despite the countless hours we spent planning, testing and preparing for the transition. Specifically, we experienced significant challenges with inventory visibility at distribution centers, which led to shipment delays, canceled orders and ultimately, lower-than-expected volumes in the quarter. In particular, we had more difficulty filling shipments of mixed product loads, which are generally higher margin than shipments of single product loads. This pressured margins in the quarter. we partnered closely with our third-party and company-owned distribution centers to minimize the impact of these challenges. This included co-locating Lamb Weston team members at our distribution centers to resolve data errors and processing issues in real time and adjusting systems and processes for balancing inventory between distribution centers and SAP.\nWe also work closely with our customers to limit the impact on their operations, and I want to thank them for their patience and commitment as we manage through the transition. Importantly, I also want to thank our Lamb Weston team members who worked around the clock to help restore customer shipments and service back to pre-transition levels. As Bernadette will cover in more detail later, we estimate that the ERP transition reduced net sales by about $135 million and volume growth by approximately 8 percentage points in the third quarter. We also estimate that adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by approximately $95 million, with more than half of that due to lower sales and unfulfilled customer orders and the remainder due to incremental costs and expenses directly related to the transition.\nAs with any transition, our teams are still adapting to the new system. I'm pleased that we have contained the effect of the inventory visibility issues to our fiscal third quarter and restored customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. We understand that some customers effected by either delayed or canceled shipments may have temporarily secured supply from alternative sources until they gain confidence in our service levels.\nWith healthy warehouse inventory levels and flows throughout the system, we're actively engaging customers with our direct sales force to earn their trust and their business. Turning now to the demand environment. Overall, global french fry demand remains resilient, but we believe it's currently at or below the historical annual growth rate of about 2% to 4%. According to restaurant industry data providers, restaurant traffic trends in the U.S. have been generally flat to slightly down during the past 6 to 9 months as consumers continue to adjust to the cumulative effect of inflation on menus.\nQSR traffic during the third quarter was flat versus the prior year after growing modestly during the first half of fiscal 2024. Several QSRs have attributed this to less visits by lower-income consumers as their disposable income has been more affected by the overall inflationary environment. Meanwhile, traffic at full-service restaurants has declined each quarter during fiscal 2024. Outside the U.S., restaurant traffic continued to increase versus the prior year in most of our key markets.\nBut growth has also slowed sequentially from our fiscal second quarter. Similar to the U.S., we believe traffic in these markets is also affected by consumers adjusting to the cumulative effect of inflation as well as other macro headwinds. Restaurant traffic growth in our larger markets in Europe in the third quarter was mixed. Traffic was up in France, Germany and Italy but at notably slower rates than during the first half of fiscal 2024.\nTraffic was down in the U.K. and Spain. In Asia, traffic growth in both China and Japan was solid, while in the Middle East, traffic was down. While global restaurant traffic has slowed, the fry attachment rates in North America and in our key international markets have been generally stable. So on the one hand, fries remain as popular as ever with consumers. But on the other hand, consumers are going out to eat less often.\nBecause of these recent trends, we're taking a more cautious view of the consumer. In our previous financial outlook, we expect the restaurant traffic and demand would pick up in the fourth quarter. As Bernadette will cover in more detail, we're now taking a more prudent approach to our expected sales and volume performance in the near term. We currently anticipate volume will decline mid-single digits as opposed to our previous expectation of modest volume growth in the fourth quarter.\nDespite this near-term caution, we believe the pressure on restaurant traffic and demand is temporary, and we remain confident that the global fry category will return to its historical growth rates as consumers continue to adjust to higher menu prices. Turning now to the upcoming potato crop. In North America, we've agreed to a 3% decline in the aggregate and contract prices for the 2024 potato crop and have largely secured the targeted number of acres to be planted across our primary growing regions.\nPlanting is on schedule for the early potato varieties, and we expect planning for the main harvest to be completed by the end of April. Although we expect our potato costs in North America to decline somewhat during the second half of fiscal 2025, assuming an average crop, they will likely be offset by a rise in our other input costs. In Europe, prices governed under fixed price contracts are up mid- to high single digits, and we've contracted for our targeted amount of acres.\nWe'll provide our typical update on the outlook for potato crops in North America and Europe when we issue our fourth quarter earnings in late July. So in summary, we believe the impact of the order fulfillment issues has been contained in the third quarter as service levels have been restored to pre-transition levels. Overall, global fry demand remains resilient, although restaurant traffic trends continue to be challenged as consumers adjust to higher menu prices.\nWe have reduced our fiscal 2024 financial targets to reflect these softer traffic trends and the higher-than-expected financial impact of the ERP transition. And finally, we have largely locked in the pricing and acreage needed for this year's crop in North America and Europe. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette for a more detailed discussion on our third quarter results and updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom noted, we're not happy with the magnitude of the impact to the ERP transition on our customers, our business and our P&L. However, I do want to take a moment and say how proud I am of our Lamb Weston team members who did work tirelessly to remedy the issues we experienced and bring our customer order fulfillment rates back to pre-transition levels within the quarter. .\nI also want to thank our sales team members who stayed close to our customers to limit the impact as much as possible on their businesses. Let's review our third quarter results. Sales increased $205 million or 16% to $1.46 billion. The entire increase was driven by $357 million of incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business. This is the last quarter that we'll receive the incremental benefit from the EMEA consolidation since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023.\nIf we exclude the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $152 million or 12%. We estimate that the majority of the decline or approximately $135 million was due to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 4% as we continued to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and international segments.\nHowever, unfavorable mix related to the type of orders we were able to fill during the ERP transition partially offset the benefit of the pricing actions. In addition, lower freight charges to customers were nearly a 5-point headwind, which was driven by lower volume shipped and the pass-through of lower freight rates when shipping products to customers. Total sales volumes declined 16%, with about 8 points of the decline associated with unfilled customer orders due to the ERP system transition.\nThe other 8 points of the decline was primarily driven by 2 factors: first, more than half reflected softer-than-expected restaurant traffic trends in North America and key international markets. As Tom mentioned, we believe the traffic trends remain challenging as consumers continue to adapt to higher menu prices. In addition, unusually poor weather in January negatively affected traffic in the U.S.\nSecond, the remainder of the volume decline reflected the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is the last quarter in which we will see any meaningful headwind from the 4 notable contracts that we exited last year to strategically manage customer and product mix. Moving on from sales. Adjusted gross profit increased $24 million to $427 million, which was driven by the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions and incremental earnings from the consolidation of the EMEA business.\nThe increase was partially offset by mid-single-digit input cost inflation on a per pound basis and a $20 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes as we considered the softer restaurant traffic trends in North America as well as the higher-than-expected impact on volume from the ERP transition. In addition, we estimate that the ERP transition negatively impacted adjusted gross profit by approximately $88 million. We estimate that approximately $55 million was due to lower volumes and negative mix.\nand that the remaining $33 million was due to about $26 million from reduced fixed cost coverage and inefficiencies arising from planned downtime for the ERP transition in our factories as well as additional freight charges as we sought to reduce the impact of shipment delays on our customers and about $7 million for penalties associated with delayed shipments or the inability to fill customer orders. Adjusted SG&A increased $30 million to $164 million, primarily due to incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA as well as higher expenses associated with the ERP system transition, including noncash amortization.\nThe increase includes approximately $7 million of incremental costs to support the system post go-live, including efforts to restore customer order fulfillment rates to pre-transition levels. A reduction in compensation and benefit accruals tempered the increase in SG&A. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA of $344 million, which is down 2% versus the prior year. Lower income in the Lamb Weston base business, which includes an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition and a $25 million write-off of excess potatoes more than offset incremental earnings from consolidating the EMEA business and the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions.\nSo on an underlying basis, excluding these items, adjusted EBITDA would have been around $465 million, while sales excluding acquisitions and the impact of the ERP transition would have been down 1% to 2%. Moving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico declined $123 million or 12% in the quarter. We estimate that essentially all of that decline was due to unfilled orders and unfavorable mix attributable to the ERP transition.\nPrice/mix was up 5% driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year. Mix was unfavorable as higher margin; lower volume customers, which typically have more complex mixed product orders were harder to fill until the inventory visibility issues related to the ERP transition were resolved.\nIn addition, lower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price/mix by more than 4 percentage points. Volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline, reflecting unfilled customer orders resulting from the ERP transition. The remainder of the decline primarily reflects soft restaurant traffic and retail trends as well as the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA declined 14% to $286 million. The decline was largely driven by an estimated $83 million impact from the ERP transition and $23 million charge for the write-off of excess potatoes, of which about $5 million of the excess potato write-off was incurred at our North American joint venture. The impact of lower volumes and higher cost per pound also contributed to the decline. These factors more than offset the benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America, grew nearly $330 million, of which $357 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined $29 million or 16%. We estimate approximately $12 million of that decline relates to unfilled orders attributable to the ERP transition. Price/mix was up 1%, driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year as well as pricing actions taken this year.\nLower freight charges to customers partially offset the increase in price mix by about 5 percentage points. Sales volume declined 17% with more than half of the decline, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. The remainder of the volume decline reflects unfilled customer orders served by North American exports as a result of the ERP transition.\nInternational segment's adjusted EBITDA increased 88% to $102 billion. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results drove the increase. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound, an estimated $5 million impact from the ERP transition, lower volumes and a $2 million allocated charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes more than offset favorable price mix.\nLet's move to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong. We ended the quarter with a net debt leverage ratio of 2.6x adjusted EBITDA, up from 2.4x at the end of the fiscal second quarter. Our net debt increased about $270 million to $3.8 billion as we drew on our revolver to largely finance increased working capital needs during the ERP system transition as well as increased capital expenditures.\nWe continue to have ample liquidity, including more than $900 million available under our revolving credit facilities. In the first 9 months of the year, we generated more than $480 million of cash from operations, up about $145 million versus the prior year period, primarily due to higher earnings. We spent nearly $830 million in capital expenditures, which is up about $330 million from the prior year period. The increase primarily reflects construction and equipment costs for our new China factory that started up in November as well as costs related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho, Netherlands and Argentina.\nAnd finally, we've returned more than $270 million of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $122 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases. Turning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. We updated our full year sales and earnings targets to reflect the impact of the ERP system transition as well as near-term demand trends. Specifically, we reduced our annual net sales target to $6.54 billion to $6.6 billion from our previous target range of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. The updated range includes $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first 3 quarters of the year.\nOur updated sales target implies sales of $1.69 billion to $1.75 billion in our fiscal fourth quarter, which is flat to up 3% compared with the same period a year ago. We expect price/mix will drive our sales growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting the continued carryover benefit of inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 and actions we've taken in fiscal 2024. We expect lower freight charges to customers will continue to partially offset the increase in price/mix.\nAs Tom noted, we expect volumes in the fourth quarter will decline mid-single digits, which is down from our previous target of positive volume growth. The primary reasons for the change include our expectation that soft restaurant traffic trends in North America will continue longer than we initially anticipated. And that restaurant traffic trends in several of our key international markets have also softened more than expected. We point to softer restaurant traffic trends as the driver affecting our volume performance since our fry attachment rates in North America and our key international markets have generally been stable and that our customer order fulfillment rates that were affected as part of the ERP transition in North America are back to pre-transition levels.\nIn addition, we expect volume in the fourth quarter may be impacted by some customers in North America that were affected by the ERP transition seeking supply at least temporarily from alternative sources. For earnings, we reduced our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.48 billion to $1.51 billion from a previous range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. That's down about $85 million using the midpoints of the 2 ranges. The decrease largely reflects an estimated $95 million impact from the ERP transition, a $25 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes and the impact of softer restaurant traffic trends in North America and our key international markets.\nWe partially offset the decrease by absorbing some of the financial impact of the ERP transition as well as reducing compensation and benefit accruals. Our updated target implies adjusted EBITDA of $350 million to $375 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 9% versus the prior year quarter using the midpoint of the range. We expect higher sales and adjusted gross profit to drive the growth, partially offset by adjusted SG&A of $190 million to $195 million.\nWith respect to adjusted diluted earnings per share, we lowered our full year target to $5.50 to $5.65. We're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We expect capital expenditures of $950 million, which is the upper end of our previous range of $900 million to $950 million. We also expect our annual effective tax rate to be around 23%, which is at the low end of our targeted range of 23% to 24%. Our targets for depreciation and amortization expense of $300 million and interest expense of $140 million are unchanged.\nLet me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. With the impact of the order fulfillment issues behind us, we remain focused on serving our customers as we close out fiscal 2024. While near-term demand trends may be soft, we remain confident in the long-term growth outlook and the health of the category. And by continuing to execute our strategies, we believe that we will remain well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today.\nActual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the potato crop and the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results as well as our updated fiscal 2024 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Happy New Year, and thank you for joining our call today. The entire Lamb Weston team delivered another solid quarter, and I want to thank them for these results and continuing to execute the strategies that we outlined in our Investor Day presentation in October.\nWe strongly believe that our investments to expand capacity organically and through acquisitions, improved manufacturing and system capabilities, penetrate new channels and markets around the world, strengthen product, customer and channel mix, and develop our people have generated good near-term operating momentum and have us well positioned to capture our share of growth and profitability over the long term.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered record sales, reflecting the consolidation of our EMEA business and solid price/mix growth. Sales volumes, excluding acquisitions, declined primarily driven by our decision to exit lower priced and lower margin business. But as we expect the year-over-year trend improved sequentially, adjusted EBITDA growth was also solid behind incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA as well as higher sales and gross profit in the base business. However, the increase was tempered by a $71 million charge to write-off excess for raw potatoes, $65 million of which was recorded in cost of sales and $6 million in equity method investment earnings.\nThe reason and magnitude of this charge is very unusual. So let me give you a little more color on it. In January 2023, we developed an initial sales forecast for the following fiscal year that reflected a gradually strengthening consumer and recovery in global demand. That forecast was developed based on the information available at that time. We used this initial sales forecast to determine the number of contracted acres to grow the raw potatoes needed to deliver that sales forecast.\nPer our agreements with our growers, we're obligated to purchase all the potatoes grown on these contracted acres. However, our initial sales forecast has turned out to be more aggressive than our current estimate, reflecting recent restaurant traffic and demand trends as consumers continue to absorb the cumulative effect of inflation. As a result, we have purchased more potatoes than we need to meet our current sales targets and have taken a charge to write off the estimated excess. Although overall demand growth is slower than we anticipated a year ago, it remains resilient. Fri attachment rates in the U.S. are stable and in line with what we projected in January 2023.\nOutside the U.S., restaurant traffic in most of our key international markets continues to grow, including double-digit growth in China. We remain confident that our volume trends will continue to improve in the back half of fiscal 2024 as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher-margin business. This includes our target for year-over-year volume growth in the fourth quarter.\nIn addition, we expect our volumes will continue to recover in fiscal 2025 and have planned to contract for acres accordingly. While we are disappointed with the write-offs, the underlying fundamentals of the business, our operations in the category remain solid. Our volume trends are improving in line with our expectations. Global demand is resilient as consumers continue to face stiff food away from home inflation.\nOur new greenfield processing facility in China is now operational. Price/mix trends in the U.S. and most of our key international markets remain solid, while input cost inflation is decelerating. We delivered strong adjusted EBITDA growth and gross margin expansion, excluding the potato write-off. And as Bernadette will explain in greater detail, we're reaffirming our fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance range despite absorbing the write-off while raising our EPS estimates.\nOverall, we continue to be pleased with our operating momentum and confident in our ability to deliver our full year financial targets. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette dead for a more detailed discussion on our second quarter results and updated outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and happy New Year, everyone. I also want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for the continued execution of our strategies and for delivering another quarter of strong financial results. For our second quarter, sales increased about $455 million or 36% to more than $1.7 billion. About $375 million or more than 80% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from the acquisition of the EMEA business.\nWe'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA business in the third quarter. And as a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition, net sales grew 6%. Price/mix was up 12% as we continue to benefit from the inflation-driven pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 along with the pricing actions taken this year in both our North America and international segments.\nMix was also favorable as we continued to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. Lower freight charges to customers were about a 1 point headwind. Total sales volumes declined 6%, which was in line with our expectations. The decline was primarily due to the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nVolume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions remain low. While sales volumes declined compared to the prior year period, it is a sequential improvement from the 8% decline that we delivered in our fiscal first quarter. The improving trend largely reflects no further impact of the inventory destocking in Asia and North America that we experienced in the first quarter and the gradual backfilling of the business that we chose to exit.\nMoving on from sales. Gross profit, excluding unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses related to derivatives and items impacting comparability, increased $97 million to nearly $480 million. Our gross profit growth was tempered by a $65 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes. Excluding this charge as well as the mark-to-market and comparability items, gross profit increased to $162 million to more than $540 million. About half of this increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nThe other half of the increase was from incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Input costs increased mid-single digits on a per pound basis, which is a bit lower than the mid- to high single digits that we saw in the first quarter. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America, and continued increases in the cost of ingredients for batter coatings, labor and other key inputs.\nThe inflation was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower cost for edible oils and lower freight costs. SG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $42 million to $177 million. More than 2/3 of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, with the remainder largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure as well as compensation and benefit expenses.\nAll of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 15% to $377 million. Excluding the write-off for excess raw potatoes, adjusted EBITDA increased 36% to $448 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth with the remainder attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico increased 10% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 14%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels as well as some pricing actions taken this year, and favorable mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management and other mix improvement initiatives.\nLower freight revenue partially offset the increase by about 1.5 points.\nVolume in North America declined 4%, reflecting the carryover impact of exiting lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. This is a sequential improvement from the 5% decline in our fiscal first quarter.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA increased 7% to $321 million. The carryover benefit of pricing actions and favorable mix more than offset a $63 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, higher cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nSales in our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America grew about $350 million, of which $376 million were incremental sales from the EMEA acquisition. Excluding the EMEA acquisition, net sales declined 12%. Price/mix was up 10% driven primarily by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year, discrete pricing actions taken this year and favorable mix.\nSales volumes fell 22% primarily reflecting the carryover impact of exiting the lower-margin business during the second half of fiscal 2023. International segment adjusted EBITDA increased 66% to $100 million with incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results driving the increase.\nExcluding the EMEA acquisition, higher cost per pound, along with the impact of lower volumes more than offset the favorable price/mix. The higher cost per pound included an $8 million charge allocated to the International segment for the write-off of excess raw potatoes, which was based on the percentage of finished goods shipments to international markets.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the quarter with our net debt leverage at 2.4x, adjusted EBITDA up from 2.3x at the end of our fiscal first quarter. Our net debt ticked up a couple of hundred million dollars to more than $3.5 billion as we drew on our U.S. revolver to largely finance seasonal working capital needs and increased capital expenditures.\nWe also accelerated some payments to suppliers in advance of our ERP system go live at the beginning of the third quarter. In the first half of the year, we generated $455 million of cash from operations or nearly $170 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures in the first half were about $565 million, which is up about $300 million from the prior year period, primarily due to construction and equipment purchases as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands. As Tom mentioned, we started up our new facility in China a couple of months ago.\nAs we discussed during our Investor Day in October, our first priority is investing in our business, which we are doing organically with our capacity expansions. We also remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. During the first half of the year, we returned more than $230 of cash to our shareholders, comprised of $82 million in dividends and $150 million in share repurchases.\nThis includes $50 million of stock repurchased in the second quarter at an average price of $87.41 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price. In addition, in October, we raised our share repurchase authorization to $500 million. And in December, we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.36 per share.\nTurning now to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We reaffirmed our full year sales and EBITDA targets and raised our EPS estimate despite the charge to write-off excess raw potatoes. Specifically, we reaffirmed our annual net sales target of $6.8 billion to $7 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA acquisition during the first 3 quarters of the year and 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth, excluding our acquisitions.\nFor the year, we continue to target price/mix to be up low double digits, with price/mix in the second half slowing sequentially from the 17% increase that we delivered in the first half as we lap more of last year's price actions. We continue to target our full year volume, excluding acquisitions, to be down mid-single digits compared with the prior year as we maintain our cautious view of the consumer.\nThat said, we expect year-over-year volume trends in each of our segments will continue to improve in the second half of the year as we lap some of the significant low-margin, low-profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last year, and as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business.\nWe expect volume growth to be positive in the fourth quarter. For earnings, we're reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA range to $1.54 to $1.62 billion. We're maintaining our EBITDA range target despite absorbing a $71 million charge for the write-off of excess raw potatoes.\nWe're raising our adjusted diluted EPS estimate to $5.70 to $6.15 from our previous range of $5.50 to $5.95. The increase, which also includes the impact of the raw potato write-off is largely due to 2 items: First, we're reducing our SG&A target by $20 million to a range of $745 million to $755 million as we continue to manage our operating costs. And second, we're reducing our interest expense target by $15 million to $140 million as we expect to capitalize more interest associated with our capacity expansions.\nWe're also updating a couple of other financial targets. We reduced our depreciation and amortization expense by $20 million to $305 million. We also increased our capital expenditures target to $900 million to $950 million, up from our previous estimate of $800 million to $900 million to account for the timing of spending for our capacity expansion project.\nBefore I turn the call back over to Tom, let me give you a quick update on our ERP implementation. At the beginning of our fiscal third quarter, we transitioned some of our central systems in North America that manage supplier payments, inventories, warehousing, customer invoicing and customer shipments to SAP. We're experiencing the usual bumps associated with these highly challenging large-scale projects, but don't expect that the cutover will have a material impact on our full year business or operating results.\nThe estimated financial impact of the systems go live is included in our fiscal 2024 targets, including the impact of pausing production and increasing planned downtime at our processing facilities, followed by a gradual ramp-up of production and reduced shipments due to short-term inventory visibility challenges at our third-party finished goods warehouses in the period immediately following the cutover.\nAs a result of the increased production downtime, our third quarter gross margin, which is typically our strongest, will be pressured by higher manufacturing costs, reflecting reduced fixed cost coverage and other cost inefficiencies. With respect to sales, we expect the inventory visibility challenges that we experienced at the third-party warehouses to affect shipments and temper the sequential improvement in our third quarter volume trends. But as I mentioned earlier, we continue to expect positive year-over-year volume growth in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nI want to thank our customers in our warehousing and logistics service partners for working with us to manage through the transition. And most importantly, I want to thank our Lamb Weston team members that have been working tirelessly on this project, including throughout the holiday season. We will provide a further update on the transition of the central systems and processes as well as the general time line for implementing the new ERP system throughout our manufacturing network during our third quarter earnings call in April.\nIn summary, we delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth as we continue to execute our strategies, manage our portfolio mix and manage costs. We continue to expect volume trends to improve in the second half of the year while remaining cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer.\nAnd finally, we updated our earnings estimate for the year. including reaffirming our annual EBITDA range despite absorbing a write-off for excess raw potatoes and raising our annual EPS estimates to reflect lower SG&A and interest expense.\nLet me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we feel good about the overall health of the global category and the drivers for demand growth. We also feel good about our operating momentum and are confident in our ability to deliver our updated financial targets for the year. And finally, we believe that our focus on executing our strategies will continue to have us well positioned to drive sustainable profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP of Investor Relations and Strategy. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results as well as our updated outlook for fiscal 2024. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered a strong start to the year as we continue to execute on our strategies to drive sustainable, profitable growth. Our integration of our EMEA operations is progressing well. Our capacity expansion in China is now up and running, and our other expansion and modernization efforts around the globe remain on track. Our supply chain teams continue to drive productivity savings, and our commercial teams remain focused on serving our customers and driving innovation across all channels.\nWhile our volume was down versus the prior year, it was in line with our expectations and was primarily driven by our decisions to exit lower priced, lower-margin business. We should see our year-over-year volume trends improve as the year progresses as we begin to lap and backfill exited volumes with higher-margin business. Overall, we feel good about the health of the category, our first quarter financial results and our operating momentum and have raised our sales and earnings targets for the year.\nLet me now turn to the current operating environment. The global frozen potato category continues to be solid with overall demand and supply balanced. Fry attachment rates, which is a rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets across our key markets, have remained largely steady and above pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic in our key markets was generally solid.\nIn the U.S., overall restaurant traffic was flat versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth offset further traffic declines in full-service restaurant channels. We believe that this is the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years, favoring QSR traffic and tempering full service and casual dining traffic.\nWhile overall traffic growth did slow sequentially from about 1% in our fiscal fourth quarter as quick service restaurant traffic growth cooled. Much of that weakness was in June, and we're encouraged that both QSR and full-service restaurant traffic trends improved as the quarter progressed. In Europe, restaurant traffic grew in many of our key markets. In the U.K., traffic was up mid-single digits, with growth in both QSR and full-service restaurants.\nGrowth was also solid in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. In Asia, China restaurant traffic growth was very strong, but off depressed levels as the country rebounded from severe COVID-related restrictions. Traffic in Japan was solid in both QSR and full-service restaurants. We suspect that restaurant traffic trends will be volatile in the near term as high interest rates, high inflation and uncertainty continues to affect consumers.\nThat said, frozen potato demand has proven resilient during the most challenging economic times, and we continue to be confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category. Now with respect to costs. We continue to expect input cost inflation in the mid- to high single digits, largely driven by higher contract prices for potatoes, including a 20% increase in North America and a 35% to 40% increase in Europe. Much of our inflation-driven pricing across our channels has either already been announced or included in price escalators within existing contracts.\nCustomer contracts representing about 20% of our North American business are in the process of being finalized, and we feel good in the aggregate about the likely pricing and terms. Over the long term, we continue to expect pricing actions and supply chain productivity improvements will be the primary levers to offset inflation. We'll also continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix to benefit sales growth and profitability.\nNow with respect to the upcoming potato crop. We are harvesting and processing the crops in our growing regions in both North America and Europe. And we believe the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest are in line with pre-pandemic historical averages. In Europe, we believe that the crop will also be in line with historical averages as a result of improved growing conditions. We'll provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performed out of stores when we report our second quarter results in early January.\nSo in summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter and continue to have good operating momentum. The overall category remains healthy with demand and supply largely balanced. And finally, at this time, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America or in Europe will be in line with pre-pandemic averages. Let me now turn the call over to Bernadette.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start off by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for the strong start to the year. Our performance speaks for itself, and it's a testament to the passion and dedication of our entire Lamb Weston team. We recognize that we're operating in a challenging macro environment, but the strong first quarter performance has allowed us to raise our fiscal 2024 financial targets.\nLet's start with reviewing our first quarter results. Compared with the prior year, sales increased $540 million or 48% to about $1.7 billion. About $375 million or 70% of the increase was attributable to the incremental sales from acquisitions with most coming from our EMEA business. We lapped the Argentina acquisition this quarter, but we'll continue to receive the incremental benefit from the consolidation of the EMEA operations in the second and third quarters.\nAs a reminder, since we began to consolidate EMEA sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline. Excluding the incremental sales from our acquisitions, net sales grew 15%. Price/mix was up 23% as we benefited from the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 in both our North America and International segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation.\nMix was also favorable as we continue to strategically manage our product and customer portfolio. In addition, we estimate the price/mix in the quarter benefited by a couple of percentage points from lower-than-expected trade spending associated with pricing actions that we began implementing in the last month of fiscal 2023. This may be largely timing related, and as a result, could be a slight headwind as the year progresses. The trade spend benefit in the quarter, however, was mostly offset by a roughly 2-point headwind related to lower freight charges passed on to customers as transportation costs have come down from the prior year period.\nAs a reminder, our goal is to match freight charge to our customers with our transportation costs so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time. In line with expectations, overall sales volumes declined 8%. The decline was primarily due to our decisions to exit volume related primarily to 4 of our lower priced and lower margin contracts as part of our revenue growth management initiatives and to a lesser extent, continued inventory destocking by certain customers in international markets and in select U.S. retail channels also impacted volume.\nWe believe the effect of these destocking actions is largely behind us and should have little impact, if any, on our results going forward. It's important to note that volume elasticities or the amount of volume lost in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low. We expect our year-over-year volume trends to improve as the year progresses as we lap the volume we exited and backfill volume with higher-margin business.\nMoving on from sales. Gross profit in the quarter, excluding comparability items, increased $213 million to $490 million. Nearly 3/4 of the increase was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nThe remaining roughly 1/4 of the increase was attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. Including the dilutive impact of the EMEA acquisition, our gross margin percentage, excluding comparability items, increased 480 basis points to 29.4%. While first quarter margins have historically been our lowest margin quarter, we estimate that the timing of trade spending that I mentioned earlier accounted for approximately 200 basis points of the increase, which would put our normalized first quarter gross margin, including acquisitions, approaching 28%.\nInput costs continue to increase mid- to high single digits on a per pound basis. The increases were largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America. Higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy and ingredients for batter coatings. The increase was partially offset by supply chain productivity savings, lower cost for edible oils and lower freight costs.\nSG&A, excluding comparability items, increased $45 million to $160 million. More than half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA. The remainder was largely driven by higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure and to a lesser extent, higher compensation and benefit expenses and higher advertising and promotion expenses. All of this led to adjusted EBITDA increasing 76% to $413 million. Higher sales and gross profit in the base business drove most of the growth, with the remainder attributable to incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA.\nMoving to our segments. This is the first quarter that we operated in our 2 new reporting segments, North America and international. Beginning with our North America segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, sales were up 19% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 24%, which was driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions that took effect in fiscal 2023 across each of our primary sales channels, the timing of trade spending and favorable mix as we benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives.\nLower freight revenue partially offset the increase. Volume in North America declined 5%. This primarily reflects our decisions to exit volume related primarily to 2 lower-priced and lower-margin contracts that largely began to impact our sales in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2023. To a lesser extent, inventory destocking by certain customers and retail channels also pressured volumes. We don't anticipate further effects from the retail destocking after the first quarter.\nNorth America segment adjusted EBITDA increased $148 million to $379 million as the carryover benefit of pricing actions, the timing of trade spending and favorable mix more than offset higher cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes. Moving to our International segment, which includes sales to customers in all channels outside of North America. Sales grew $360 million or 212% and included $375 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Excluding these acquisitions, net sales declined 9%.\nWhile price/mix was up 18%, driven by the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as favorable mix, lower volume and freight revenue offset the increase. As expected, volume, excluding acquisitions, declined 27%. The decrease primarily reflects our decisions to exit 2 very low price, low margin accounts that largely began to impact our international sales volumes in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2023.\nTo a lesser extent, continued inventory destocking also impacted volumes in the quarter. But as I mentioned earlier, we believe the effect of destocking is largely over. Despite a 27% decline in our International segment's volume, segment adjusted EBITDA increased $57 million to $90 million. Incremental earnings from the consolidation of EMEA's financial results as well as favorable price/mix drove most of the increase, more than offsetting the impact of higher cost per pound and lower volumes in our legacy Lamb Weston business.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with more than $160 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion U.S. revolver. Our net debt was about $3.3 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 2.3x. We generated about $335 million of cash from operations or about $140 million more than the prior year quarter, largely due to the higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $305 million, which is up about $180 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to construction costs, as we continue to expand processing capacity in China, Idaho, Argentina and The Netherlands.\nDuring the quarter, we returned more than $140 million of cash to our shareholders, including $41 million in dividends. Most of the cash return was from repurchasing $100 million of shares. That's more than double what we repurchased in all of 2023 as we acted opportunistically based on our stock price performance during our August open trading window. While our share buyback program is targeted to offset annual equity compensation dilution, we will continue to be opportunistic based on other capital allocation needs and the potential for generated solid returns based on our stock's trading value.\nTurning to our updated fiscal 2024 outlook. Based on our strong first quarter performance, we raised our financial targets for the year. While we continue to expect macro operating conditions to remain challenging, the overall current demand and pricing environment remains solid. In addition, as Tom mentioned, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions in North America and Europe will be consistent with pre-pandemic historical averages. And we're generally pleased with how the discussions to renew remaining contracts are progressing in aggregate.\nSpecifically, we continue to expect strong net sales gains for the year and have increased our annual net sales target to $6.8 billion to $7 billion, which is up from our previous target of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of incremental sales attributable to EMEA during the first 3 quarters of the year, which is up $100 million from our previous estimate. This represents a 6.5% to 8.5% net sales growth, excluding acquisitions.\nFor the year, we're targeting price/mix to be up low double digits, which means that we expect price/mix will slow sequentially from the 23% increase that we delivered in the first quarter as we begin to lap some of our price actions that we began implementing in the second quarter of last year. While the overall potato category continues to be solid due to the timing of contract openers, we're targeting our full year volume, excluding acquisitions, to be down mid-single digits compared with the prior year. And we expect year-over-year volume trends will continue to improve as the year progresses as we lap some of the significant low margin, low product profit volume that we chose to exit in the second half of last yea rand as we gradually backfill the exited lower-margin business with more profitable business.\nFor earnings, we raised our adjusted EBITDA target by about $90 million to $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion. Using the midpoint of this updated range implies growth of about 26% or about $330 million versus the prior year. We left our target for SG&A unchanged at $765 million to $775 million. While our first quarter run rate suggests a lower target, we continue to anticipate spending will build as the year progresses.\nWe reduced our interest expense target by $10 million to $155 million as we expect to partially offset cash interest with more capitalized interest associated with our capacity expansion. Our other financial targets remain the same, including depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $325 million and capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million.\nIn summary, we're executing our strategies to deliver strong top and bottom line growth by improving our customer and product portfolio mix and offsetting input cost inflation through pricing actions and driving productivity savings across our supply chain. Volume elasticities in response to inflation-based pricing actions have been generally low, and we expect volume trends to improve as the year progresses.\nWhile we remain cautious about the effect of inflation on the consumer, we feel good about the start of the year and the health of the category, which gives us the confidence to raise our full year sales and earnings targets. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. We delivered a strong quarter and our operating momentum has us well positioned to deliver another year of solid sales and earnings growth. In addition, we're confident in the health of the global category and remain committed to investing in our business to drive sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nAnd finally, as you may know, we will be hosting an Investor Day on Wednesday, October 11 at the New York Stock Exchange. During the presentation, we'll discuss our view of the industry, our strategies for growth and our long-term financial targets and capital allocation policies. If you haven't already, please register if you plan on attending in-person as space is limited. Otherwise, you can view our presentation via our webcast, which you will be able to access through our website. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call.

Tom will provide some highlights from the past year as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results as well as our outlook for fiscal 2024.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong financial results in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. I want to start by thanking the entire Lamb Weston team for driving these results and their incredible commitment to supporting our customers. I'm proud of the work we did and continue to do to grow our business and build momentum as we enter a new year.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2023, we delivered record sales of nearly $5.4 billion and drove strong profit growth in each of our core business segments through a combination of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity. We acquired the remaining interest in our European joint venture, which added 1,500 new colleagues, 6 processing facilities and nearly 2 billion pounds of capacity. The business integration is well underway, and we believe this strategic transaction strengthens our capabilities to serve customers as a unified global Lamb Weston.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina, and we broke ground on a 250 million-pound capacity expansion, which will improve our ability to serve the growing South American market. We also made progress on major capital expansion projects in China, Idaho and the Netherlands, all of which are on track to be completed within the next 18 months. We opened an innovation center in Bergen op Zoom in The Netherlands, wherein close partnership with our innovation center in Richland, Washington, will develop and test new product and processing ideas for customers in Europe and around the world.\nWe launched new groundbreaking products with proprietary technologies that address customer and consumer needs in nontraditional frozen potato channels, such as pizza outlets, expanding our total addressable market. We further stabilized our supply chain by targeting staffing levels and managing through a second consecutive challenging crop cycle, all while executing productivity initiatives and upgrading capabilities at our processing facilities.\nWe continue to strengthen our operational infrastructure by completing the design work for the next phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll begin implementing this new system across a portion of our supply chain in North America later this year. And finally, we returned more than $190 million to shareholders, including increasing our dividend for the sixth straight year, and continuing to execute against our share repurchase plan.\nI'm especially proud that we delivered this performance in a highly challenging operating environment, and I'm excited to see what our Lamb Weston team can deliver in fiscal 2024 and beyond.\nLet me now turn to the current operating environment. The overall global frozen potato category remains healthy. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, was largely steady throughout fiscal 2023 and remain well above pre-pandemic levels. Servings in Europe and our other key international markets also held up well. However, the cumulative effect of inflation and other macro pressures on the consumer over the past few years have continued to temper traffic in certain restaurant channels.\nIn the quarter, total restaurant traffic in the U.S. grew versus the prior year quarter as QSR traffic growth more than offset declines in casual dining and full-service restaurants. However, total traffic growth decelerated sequentially each month during the fourth quarter as QSR traffic growth slowed and as traffic declines at casual dining and full-service restaurants softened further. Overall, restaurant traffic picked up in June behind strength in QSRs. However, traffic at casual dining and full service remain soft.\nWe expect that near-term demand may be somewhat choppy because of the variabilities of restaurant traffic trends and continued macro pressures on the consumer, which makes forecasting global demand for frozen potato is very difficult. As a result, we incorporated a cautious view of demand and volume when developing our fiscal 2024 financial targets. Despite this added volatility, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the global category and we'll continue to invest behind the capabilities to support that growth across our key markets.\nWith respect to costs and pricing, while we expect input cost inflation to moderate relative to the double-digit rates that we experienced in each of the last 2 fiscal years, we believe it will continue to have a meaningful impact on our cost structure. We expect most of our input cost inflation will be driven by higher contract prices for potatoes. In North America, we've agreed to a 20% increase for this crop -- this year's crop, while in Europe, we have agreed to an increase of 35% to 40%.\nWe believe the overall environment for inflation-driven pricing actions remains generally favorable. However, it's important to note that any price actions that we may take this year will likely be more modest than what we implemented in fiscal 2023. Given that, first, our pricing actions last year were intended to catch up to the effect of multiple years of high inflation. And second, we expect total input cost inflation to grow at a lower rate.\nAlthough we expect pricing actions will continue to be the primary lever to offset inflation over the long term, we'll continue to drive improvements in product and customer mix resulting from our revenue growth management initiatives as well as supply chain productivity to benefit sales growth and profitability.\nWith respect to the upcoming potato crop, we're harvesting and processing the early potato varieties, and initial indications are that this portion of the crop, which represents about 10% of our potato needs in North America this year, is broadly consistent with historical averages. At this time, the crops in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest, that will be harvested in the fall appear to be largely in line with historical averages, as growing conditions in these regions have been generally favorable.\nIn Europe, a wet and cold spring impacted planning, which may delay the timing of the harvest in some of our growing regions. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nBefore Bernadette shares details on our fourth quarter financial performance and fiscal 2024 outlook, I'd like to update you on a change we're making to our reportable segments. Effective at the start of fiscal 2024, in connection with our recent acquisition and to align with our expanded global footprint, we began managing our business in 2 reportable segments: North America and International.\nThe North America segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, including our large multinational chain customers. The International segment includes products sold in Restaurant, Foodservice and Retail channels outside of North America. These 2 segments as well as our global supply chain will report to Mike Smith, our Chief Operating Officer. Mike's role is focused on execution and is designed to help us drive growth and unlock efficiencies by providing a truly end-to-end view of our global business.\nI'll continue to maintain responsibility for driving our long-term strategies and priorities, including allocating capital and resources to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our stakeholders. We'll begin to provide our financial results under the new reportable segments with our first quarter results.\nSo in summary, we delivered a record year of sales and earnings growth, and continue to build operating momentum across each of our core segments. While near-term demand may be difficult to predict, the category remains healthy, and we remain confident about its long-term growth prospects. And finally, at this time, the potato crop in North America is largely in line with historical averages, while late planning may delay the harvest in Europe.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for finishing the year strong and setting us up well for fiscal 2024. Let's begin with our fourth quarter results.\nSales were up more than $540 million versus the prior year quarter or 47% to a quarterly record of just under $1.7 billion. That's at the high end of our targeted range for the quarter. About $380 million of the increase was attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA and Argentina operations. The EMEA amount is above the high end of the targeted $300 million to $325 million range for the quarter, reflecting a strong benefit from pricing actions.\nExcluding incremental sales from these acquisitions, net sales grew 14%. Price/mix was up 24% as we continued to benefit from pricing actions taken in fiscal 2023 across each of our business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. As expected, price/mix in the quarter decelerated sequentially from the 30% or more increase that we delivered in our second and third quarters as we largely lapped all the pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022.\nIn addition, we received no year-over-year benefits from freight rates charged to customers as we reduced these rates further to match the decline in our transportation costs. While we expect lower customer freight rates will soon become a year-over-year headwind for price/mix, -- our goal is to match these to our transportation costs so that their effect on our profits is neutral over time.\nOur overall sales volumes in the quarter declined 10% due to 4 factors. The first and primary driver was our continued effort to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business across our Domestic and International portfolio. Second, demand was tempered despite softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the U.S. This had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and drove much of the decline in that segment's volume in the quarter.\nThird, certain customers in international markets began to rightsize inventories after carrying unusually high levels of inventory to derisk their supply chains during the pandemic. And fourth, certain large retail customers temporarily lowered prices to rightsize inventories of private label products, delaying shipments of products that we produced on their behalf. In addition, we realized some acceptable levels of branded product volume elasticity in response to the inflation-driven pricing actions that we implemented over the past year.\nMoving on from sales. Our gross profit in the quarter, excluding comparability items, increased more than $170 million to nearly $425 million. About 40% of the increase was attributable to the incremental earnings from consolidating EMEA. The remainder was driven by the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity in our legacy Lamb Weston business, which more than offset higher input and manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nGross margin was up more than 300 basis points to 25.1% despite absorbing the dilutive impact on margin of the EMEA acquisition. Input costs increased high single digits on a per pound basis, easing somewhat from the double-digit inflation rate earlier in the year. The increase in cost per pound were again largely driven by a 20% increase in the contracted price for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open market potatoes due to poor yields from the 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of labor, energy, edible oils and ingredients for batter coatings.\nOur higher per pound cost also reflected reduced fixed cost coverage due to lower throughput, as we did take some extended downtime for planned maintenance in some of our production facilities; and increased write-downs of inventories, primarily consisting of bulk and obsolete finished goods. Our SG&A expenses, excluding comparability items, increased $65 million to $183 million.\nAbout half of the increase was from incremental SG&A with the consolidation of EMEA, while the other half was primarily driven by 3 factors: first, higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance; second, an $8 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses as we restore support behind our branded products in our Retail segment to historical levels; and third, higher expenses related to improving our IT and ERP infrastructure.\nAdjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, increased $117 million or 59% to $318 million, with higher sales and gross profit driving the growth.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 85% in the quarter and included the $380 million of incremental sales from the EMEA and Argentina acquisitions. Net sales, excluding the acquisitions, grew 17%. Price/mix was up 28%, which is largely comparable to the increases in the previous 2 quarters. The increase in price/mix reflects the carryover benefit of the domestic and international pricing actions that took effect in our fiscal second and third quarters.\nVolume declined 11%, and primarily reflecting the impact of exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business in international and domestic markets, and the inventory destocking by certain customers and international markets that I mentioned earlier. Global's product contribution margin, excluding comparability items, increased about $145 million. More than half of the increase was from the cumulative benefit of pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity, more than offsetting higher cost per pound and lower volumes. Incremental earnings from EMEA, which was above our target for the quarter, drove the remainder of the increase.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 4%, a notable deceleration versus the 17% that we delivered through the first 3 quarters of the year. Price/mix was up a healthy 13%, but lower than the 26% that we posted through the first 3 quarters, as we fully lapped our pricing actions taken in fiscal 2022 and realized no tailwind from transportation rates. As expected, the price increase that we began to implement in May only had a modest impact in the quarter, so we'll see more benefit come through in early fiscal 2024.\nSales volumes were down 9%, which is consistent with the prior 3 quarters. We attribute most of the decline to the impact of softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic, although we also continue to realize the impact of exiting some lower-priced and lower-margin business. Foodservice's product contribution margin fell about $3 million. Lower volumes drove the decline as higher price mix more than offset the impact of higher cost per pound.\nSales in our Retail segment increased 25%. Price/mix increased 35%, driven by pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios that we began to implement in February to counter input cost inflation. Trade support during the quarter remained below historical levels given category demand. Volume fell 10%, largely reflecting the challenges that I described earlier for private label products. Retail's product contribution margin increased more than $40 million, and its margin percentage expanded 140 basis points to nearly 38%, as the cumulative benefit from pricing and mix improvement actions over the past couple of fiscal years more than offset higher cost per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We continue to maintain a solid balance sheet with ample liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $305 million of cash and no borrowings under our $1 billion U.S. revolver. Our net debt was nearly $3.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. Using EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, which only includes a single quarter of EMEA's earnings, our leverage ratio is 2.6x.\nWe remain focused on creating value for our shareholders. Our capital allocation priorities remain the same, and we continue to prioritize investing in our business to drive long-term growth as well as returning capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In fiscal '23, we generated more than $760 million of cash from operations or $340 million above last year, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures were about $735 million, which is up $430 million from the prior year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity. For the year, we returned more than $190 million of cash to shareholders, including $146 million in dividends and $45 million in share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to our fiscal 2024 outlook. We're taking a prudent approach to our financial targets for the year. Overall, we anticipate that the operating environment will continue to be challenging, with inflation and other macro factors affecting our cost structure, restaurant traffic and consumer demand. In addition, we expect our capacity to produce coated fries, specialty cuts and chopped in form varieties, such as [ pumps ] and hash browns, will remain constrained until our new production facilities in China and Idaho become available late in fiscal 2024.\nFor the year, we are targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion. This includes $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the EMEA transaction during the first 3 quarters of the year. And net sales growth, excluding acquisitions, of 6.5% to 8.5%, which is above our long-term sales growth algorithm of low to mid-single digits. Note that since we began to consolidate EMEA's sales beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, those results are included in our last year's sales baseline when calculating our sales growth.\nWe expect sales growth, excluding acquisitions, to be largely driven by pricing actions, including both the carryover impact of actions taken in fiscal 2023 as well as any actions that we may take this year to counter input cost inflation. We also expect to deliver favorable customer and product mix as we continue to benefit from our revenue growth management initiatives.\nAs Tom noted, while we expect a solid contribution from price, we do not expect pricing actions to be at the same level as fiscal 2023. Outside of those customer contracts in our Global segment that have yet to be fully priced, we expect any future pricing actions will be largely in line with the more modest rate of input cost inflation than what we've experienced in the past 2 fiscal years. In addition, transportation rates that we charge to customers will likely serve as a price headwind as we continue to adjust rates to reflect lower freight costs.\nIn fiscal 2024, we expect volume, excluding acquisitions, will continue to be pressured by our ongoing efforts to strategically manage product mix by exiting certain lower-priced and lower-margin business. This strategy has proven to be beneficial to earnings, and we continue to see opportunities across our domestic and international channels. In addition, we're taking a cautious approach to consumer demand for 2 primary reasons.\nFirst, while QSR traffic has held up relatively well, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic trends have softened in the U.S. over the past few months. Second, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult due to conflicting data about the health of the consumer in the U.S., Europe and our key markets as a consequence of inflation, especially for food away from home, the expiration of temporary government assistance and other consumer support programs put in place during the pandemic, employment trends and other macroeconomic headwinds.\nDespite these near-term factors, we remain confident in the health and long-term growth prospects of the Global category, and we remain committed to investing in our people, production capacity and operations to support that growth.\nFor earnings in fiscal 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $1.45 billion to $1.525 billion, assuming potato crops in our primary growing regions are in line with historical averages. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of more than 20% or about $260 million versus the prior year. Looking at it another way, it's up $200 million more than our annualized second half of fiscal 2023 run rate of $1.325 billion.\nIn addition to incremental earnings from the Lamb Weston EMEA acquisition, we expect our earnings growth will be largely driven by higher sales and gross profit as we benefit from pricing actions, mix improvement and supply chain productivity.\nWe're projecting that the increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A of $765 million to $775 million, which is up about $200 million. In addition to inflation, the increase largely reflects incremental expenses attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations, increased investments to upgrade our information systems and ERP infrastructure, noncash amortization of intangible assets associated with the EMEA acquisition, as well as ERP investments we expect to place in service during the year, and higher compensation and benefit costs due to increased headcount to support our growing business.\nIn addition to our operating targets, we expect equity earnings, which includes our Lamb Weston RDO joint venture in Minnesota, to be $30 million to $35 million. We expect capital expenditures of $800 million to $900 million as we continue construction of our previously announced capacity expansion efforts, as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades.\nSo to summarize our fiscal 2024 outlook, we're targeting sales of $6.7 billion to $6.9 billion, including $1 billion to $1.1 billion of incremental sales attributable to the consolidation of our EMEA operations. We expect our sales growth, excluding acquisitions, will be largely driven by price/mix, with volume pressure due to our ongoing efforts to strategically manage customer and product mix and a cautious view of demand. And finally, we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of nearly $1.5 billion using the midpoint of our guidance, which is an increase of 20%, and largely driven by sales and gross profit growth.\nLastly, as Tom mentioned, effective the beginning of fiscal 2024, we began managing our operations as 2 business segments, North America and International. In the coming weeks, we'll provide recast financial information for fiscal years 2021, '22 and 2023 that is consistent with our new reporting segment structure, including quarterly results for the last 2 years.\nAnd with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are super proud of the team's strong performance in fiscal 2023 and believe that we're well positioned to execute our strategies to deliver our financial targets for fiscal 2024. We also remain committed to investing in our business to support customers around the world and drive people, new production capacity and operations to support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment while Bernadette will provide details on our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered strong results in our fiscal third quarter as we continue to build good operating momentum. Specifically, sales grew 31%, while gross margin expanded in each of our core business segments. This, in turn, drove strong EBITDA and earnings per share growth.\nI want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for their dedication and focus on serving our customers so that together, we delivered another great quarter and positioned us for a strong finish to the year. This thank you is also to our more than 1,500 colleagues in Europe who are now officially members of the global Lamb Weston team after we recently completed the purchase of the remaining interest in Lamb Weston/Meijer. Lamb Weston Europe, Middle East and Africa, or Lamb Weston EMEA, adds 6 factories and about 2 billion pounds of production capacity to our global manufacturing footprint. It strengthens our ability to serve customers in key markets around the world, and it enhances a world-class management operating and commercial team with deep knowledge of the frozen potato industry. We've kicked off the process to integrate Lamb Weston EMEA's operations and are excited to see what we can deliver together both now and over the long term.\nBefore turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. While the macro environment remains highly challenging, overall French fry demand remains healthy. Total restaurant traffic improved versus the prior year quarter when traffic was negatively affected by the Omicron variant. QSR has essentially accounted for the entire growth in traffic, including strong growth across burger and chicken restaurant chains, which are significant contributors to driving fry demand.\nIn contrast, traffic at casual dining and full-service restaurants fell versus the prior year. This has a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment and contributed in part to a decline in that segment's volume. The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets remain solid.\nAs we previously noted, we're encouraged by how the category is currently performing in away-from-home channels, but continue to expect restaurant traffic and demand trends will be volatile through fiscal 2023 and into fiscal 2024 as consumers continue to deal with a challenging macro environment. Demand for fries in food and home channels remain solid. Shipments by our retail segment grew in the third quarter led by strong performance in products sold under licensed restaurant brands. We expect demand in this channel will remain solid into fiscal 2024.\nWith overall category demand holding up relatively well and as industry supply expected to be constrained for at least the next couple of years, we believe the environment for pricing actions to counter input cost inflation may remain generally favorable. In addition, we've been building our revenue growth management and execution capabilities. We made good progress, as shown by our ability to offset input cost inflation to drive the recovery in our gross margins over the past year in each of our core business segments. Nonetheless, we're continuing to work on maximizing revenue and margin by further evaluating markets and sales channels by using a broader set of variables and leveraging data-backed insights on our customers and consumers.\nPricing in the quarter in our Global segment was in line with our expectation as we continue to incorporate new pricing structures for customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. Despite lapping some of the pricing actions we took in fiscal 2022, price/mix in both the Foodservice and retail segments in the quarter was better than we anticipated as we continued efforts to rationalize pricing structures and strategically improve customer and product mix across the respective portfolios.\nDuring the remainder of fiscal 2023, in our Global segment, we don't expect any additional notable pricing actions to take effect. In Foodservice, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in price/mix will decelerate as we continue to lap more of the fiscal 2022 pricing and mix improvement actions. And in Retail, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in price/mix will also decelerate as we continue to lap last year's pricing actions, although this will be tempered by a recent price increase that took effect towards the end of the third quarter.\nWith respect to the potato crop in North America, we believe we have secured enough open-market potatoes to meet our production forecast until the early potato varieties are harvested in July. We purchased open potatoes from growers in the Columbia Basin and Idaho, but also secured supply from as far away as the East Coast. This adds up to our potato costs through the first half of fiscal 2024.\nWith respect to the upcoming potato crop, as previously discussed, we've agreed to a nearly 20% increase in the contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia Basin and have locked in the targeted contracted acres to be planted in that region. We're in the process of securing most of the acres in our other growing regions in North America and expect to have this process completed shortly with contract prices largely in line with the 20% increase in the basin.\nIn Europe, we have secured the acres in our key growing regions and expect to complete the contracting process shortly. Like North America, contract prices are up significantly to reflect input cost inflation for growers.\nSo in summary, we delivered another strong quarter of sales and earnings growth, which has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the year and continue to build good operating momentum across each of our core segments. We're excited about more than 1,500 new Lamb Weston EMEA colleagues that have joined the global team and believe that leveraging EMEA's capabilities will help us better serve customers around the world.\nAnd finally, category demand remains healthy, and we believe that industry supply should remain constrained for at least the next couple of years.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated financial fiscal 2023 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nVP & Controller, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to also thank the Lamb Weston team for delivering another quarter of strong results and continuing to build good operating momentum across the company. This momentum has enabled us to raise our financial targets for the remainder of the year. I also want to add a warm welcome to the Lamb Weston EMEA team.\nLet's begin with our third quarter results. Sales in the third quarter were up 31% to $1.25 billion. Price/mix was up 31% as we continued to benefit from pricing actions across each of our core business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022 as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year.\nOur overall sales volumes were flat. While we increased shipments to our large QSR chain customers and to retail customers in North America, which generally reflects demand and restaurant traffic trends that Tom described earlier, our growth in volume was offset by a couple of factors. First, we continued efforts to strategically improve our product and customer mix by exiting certain lower priced, lower margin business. Second, and to a lesser extent, softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic also affected volumes in the quarter, which is largely reflected in our Foodservice shipments.\nIt's worth noting that in the quarter, we also continued to make progress in stabilizing our supply chain with better availability of production team members and key ingredients as well as improved production forecasting. As a result, the impact on production in the quarter was relatively modest, which helped drive improvements in our customer fill rates versus our first and second quarters. This improvement is more apparent in our Retail and Foodservice segments as we have largely maintained high fill rates in our global segment since the start of the pandemic.\nThat said, we expect changes in product mix and consumer demand will continue to pressure our near-term production and therefore, shipments of high-demand products, including retail fries, premium fries and batter coated products. We expect this volume pressure and our ability to meet growing consumer demand will continue until our capacity investments in China, Idaho, Argentina and the Netherlands become available over the next couple of years.\nGross profit in the quarter increased $177 million to nearly $400 million as a result of our sales growth and gross margins expanding 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 31.7%. Our strong gross margin performance reflects the cumulative benefit of executing pricing actions in each of our business segments to counter input and manufacturing cost inflation as well as leveraging efforts to improve customer and product mix and supply chain productivity. On the cost side in the quarter, we again realized a double-digit increase in input and manufacturing cost per pound. This was largely driven by about a 20% increase in contracted prices for potatoes in North America, significantly higher prices for open-market potato purchases -- due to poor yields from the calendar year 2022 crop and continued increases in the cost of edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and energy.\nIn contrast, our transportation costs fell in the quarter as industry rates for rail, trucking and ocean freight services continued their steady decline over the past couple of quarters. We are continuing to reduce our freight charges to customers to match the decline in costs, which will steadily reduce the tailwind from transport prices in our sales line. However, the impact on our gross profit over time, will be largely neutral.\nMoving on from gross profit. Our SG&A, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $49 million to $136 million, primarily reflecting higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance as well as actions to maintain competitive pay levels across our organization. We also had higher expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system and a $6 million increase in advertising and promotion expenses, largely behind support of our branded products in our Retail segment.\nEquity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $12 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Favorable price/mix, largely reflecting pricing actions in Europe drove the increase.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 33% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 33%, reflecting the revenue growth management initiatives and pricing actions to counter inflation that Tom described earlier. Global's volume was flat, solid growth of shipments to large QSR chain customers in North America was offset by the impact of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in international and domestic markets as we actively manage our customer mix. Global's product contribution margin increased to $168 million from a relatively weak prior year quarter, which at the time, reflected significant input and manufacturing cost increases and only a modest benefit from product pricing actions. Global segment's product contribution margin percentage in the quarter was 25.8%, which is back to its seasonal prepandemic level and was also a bit better than expected as we realize more benefits from pulling forward pricing actions for some customers than we originally anticipated.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 22%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 as well as the actions taken in fiscal 2023 to counter inflation. Sales volumes were down about 3%, primarily reflecting exiting of some lower priced, lower margin business to manage our customer and product mix as well as softer traffic in casual dining and full-service restaurants. Foodservices product contribution margin increased to $143 million or up 34% as the cumulative benefit from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nOur Retail segment delivered another strong quarter with sales up 50%. Price/mix increased 44%, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolio to counter inflation. This was aided in part by limited trade support given the strong category demand and constrained supply environment. Volume in this segment was up 6% behind better customer fill rates for our branded products. Private label volume was also up as we lapped the incremental losses of certain lower-priced and lower-margin products over the past couple of years. Retail's product contribution margin increased to $83 million, and its margin percentage topped 38% as the cumulative benefit from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing cost per pound. We're very pleased with how our Retail team has strengthened our market share, profitability and portfolio mix over the past couple of years, and we remain confident in our ability to remain the overall category leader.\nMoving to our liquidity position and our cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $675 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our cash balance was inflated as we did take on a new $450 million term loan at the end of January to fund most of the cash consideration for the EMEA transaction, which closed a couple of days into our fiscal fourth quarter. Our net debt was more than $2.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, resulting in a 2.3x leverage ratio on a trailing 12-month basis. After accounting for the EMEA transaction, the estimated net debt at the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter would be about $3.3 billion, resulting in a 2.6x leverage ratio using our updated fiscal 2023 earnings target and an annualized contribution from our EMEA operations.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain the same. We continue to prioritize investing in the business to drive long-term growth as well as delivering dividend growth for our shareholders and share repurchases to offset management dilution. In the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated about $335 million of cash from operations. That's about $160 million more than the first 3 quarters of last year. This is largely due to the higher earnings, partially offset by increased working capital. Capital expenditures were nearly $500 million, which is up about $270 million from the first 3 quarters of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina. In the first 3 quarters, we returned nearly $146 million of cash to shareholders including $106 million in dividends and about $41 million in share repurchases.\nNow let's turn to our 2023 outlook. Our updated targets include the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA beginning in our fiscal fourth quarter. For the year, we've increased our sales target to $5.25 billion to $5.35 billion, up from our previous target of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion. About $300 million to $325 million of the increase reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. The additional $100 million to $150 million increase reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter, and our expected continued momentum in the fourth quarter.\nExcluding the contribution from EMEA, we expect our net sales growth in the fourth quarter to be driven by price/mix as volumes will continue to be affected by certain -- exiting certain lower priced and lower margin volume business to strategically manage customer and product mix, and the potential for a slowdown in restaurant traffic and consumer demand. For earnings, we're targeting adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.35 to $4.50, that's up from our previous target of $3.75 to $4.\nAnd adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.18 billion to $1.21 billion, up from our previous estimate of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion. Of the $110 million to $130 million increase in our adjusted EBITDA target, we estimate that EMEA will contribute an incremental $10 million to $15 million of that amount. That implies then that EMEA's total EBITDA contribution of $20 million to $30 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the normalized full year pre-pandemic EBITDA of about EUR 100 million. The additional $100 million to $115 million increase in our full year EBITDA target reflects our strong results in our fiscal third quarter, and our expected strong sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter.\nIncluding the consolidation of EMEA, we're targeting a full year gross margin of 27% to 27.5%, implying a fourth quarter gross margin of 23% to 24.5%. Excluding EMEA, we've raised our full year gross margin target to 28% to 28.5%, up from our previous target of 27% to 28%. This implies a fourth quarter gross margin target, excluding EMEA of 25% to 27%. While this would be a healthy gross margin expansion versus the prior year quarter, it also implies a notable step down from our fiscal third quarter gross margin of 31.7%. We believe this estimate is prudent, reflecting typical seasonal patterns in our cost structure, significantly higher cost open market potatoes, continued inflation for key inputs and the impact of volume declines as a result of inflationary pressures on consumers.\nWith respect to SG&A, we expect expenses, excluding items impacting comparability of $550 million to $570 million. That's up from our previous target of $525 million to $550 million. The increase largely reflects the consolidation of Lamb Weston EMEA. In addition, we increased our estimate for capital expenditures to between $700 million to $725 million, up from our previous estimate of $475 million to $525 million. This increase reflects accelerated spending behind capital expansion investments as well as capital spending associated with the consolidation of EMEA. We also made adjustments to other financial targets, which you can find in our earnings release.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident-Commercial Foods, ConAgra Foods, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying we are executing in this challenging operating environment and are confident in our increased financial targets for the year. We also continue to feel good about growth trends in the category and believe that the investments we're making in our people, new production capacity and infrastructure will have us well positioned to support sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

Todays' conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current operating environment while Bernadette will provide details on our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning. Happy New Year and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our financial performance in the second quarter as we continue to drive strong sales and earnings growth across each of our core segments. Our results reflect the successful execution of our strategies to counter the significant input cost inflation over the past couple of years through a combination of pricing actions, improving business and product mix, and adapting our manufacturing and supply chain to global challenges.\nSpecifically, we delivered sales of nearly $1.3 billion, a record high quarter, healthy gross margins in each of our core business segments and strong earnings, EBITDA and earnings per share growth. Because of our first half results and confidence in our business momentum, we've increased our sales, gross margin and earnings targets for fiscal 2023.\nI'm proud of our performance in the first half of the year and how the entire Lamb Weston team continues to focus on serving our customers and driving sustainable, profitable growth. Before turning the call over to Bernadette, let me first provide some quick updates on the current operating environment. First, overall French fry demand in the U.S. remained solid, although the total restaurant traffic remains below pre-pandemic levels. It's up versus the prior year quarter, and trends are up sequentially off the lows we saw in the summer as gasoline prices spiked.\nDemand and traffic trends in the quarter varied by channel as consumers reacted to broad-based inflation and the threat of a recession. QSR traffic was up versus the prior year, and trends improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter as consumers adjusted to less expensive dining options. As expected, casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic in the quarter was down versus the prior year, although trends also improved sequentially versus our fiscal first quarter.\nThis year-over-year decline in casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic had a more pronounced effect on our Foodservice segment, which has a greater exposure to these sales channels and contributed in part to a decline in the segment's volume. The fry-attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other Foodservice outlets, remained above pre-pandemic levels. The attachment rate in QSRs actually increased versus the prior year quarter which helped stabilize fry demand.\nOverall, we feel good about how the category and away-from-home channels is performing in this difficult macro environment but expect restaurant traffic demand trends will continue to be volatile through fiscal 2023. In contrast, retail fry demand remained solid in the quarter. It's been strong since the start of the pandemic as consumers pull back spending on dining out. Demand for our retail products sold under licensed restaurant brands, in particular, remained strong over the past year as consumers look to have the restaurant-style fries they love while at home.\nWhile fry demand across all our channels is holding up well, we continue to struggle to meet that demand due to the impact of supply-chain disruptions on run rate and throughput in our production facilities. Over the past year, these disruptions have been largely related to the impact of shortages in certain commodities, such as starches and edible oils as well as factory worker shortages and availability.\nThe availability of key commodities has slowly improved over the past couple of quarters as we broaden our supplier base and qualified substitute ingredients when possible. Yet it remains a concern, and we expect it will continue to affect our production volumes at least through the remainder of fiscal 2023. The availability of production team members has also steadily improved over the past couple of quarters, such that we're back to having staffing levels in most of our processing facilities at desired levels.\nHowever, run rate and throughput constraints will continue until our newly hired colleagues gain experience to optimize production. We've also experienced production constraints after adjusting operating procedures to reflect changes in product mix and consumer demand, including higher demand for retail fries, premium fries and batter-coated products. These products generally carry favorable margins. For example, to produce batter-coated fries, which is a high-growth and high-margin segment of the category, we typically run our lines at slower speeds, and we're producing uncoated straight cut fries. This results in reduced throughput. We also require more frequent and longer downtimes to clean and [sanitizing] lines between production runs when batter is used, which affects our run rates and line availability.\nTogether, this results in fewer finished pounds produced relative to making uncoated fries, which ultimately leads to pressure on our customer order fill rates. In short, we expect the impacts of ongoing commodity shortages, the onboarding of recently hired production team members and adjustments to optimize business mix to continue to pressure volume performance, and our ability to meet customer demand through the remainder of fiscal 2023 and until our capacity investments in China, Idaho and Argentina become available over the next couple of years.\nWith respect to pricing, we continue to drive pricing actions across our portfolio to counter input cost inflation. The environment remains generally favorable as a result of the solid category demand that I just described, coupled with constrained industry supply. Our Global segment led the way in the quarter with strong pricing through a combination of inflation-driven price escalators, new pricing structures for customer contract renewals, working with certain customers to accelerate pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years and improvements in customer mix.\nWe feel good about how Global's contract renewal negotiations played out this past year and expect this segment to continue to deliver strong price/mix growth as more of these updated pricing structures take effect in the second half. We also expect to drive solid price growth in both, the Foodservice and Retail segments in the second half of the year. Although the growth rate should decelerate as we begin to lap some of the pricing actions, we took in fiscal 2022. With respect to the potato crop, we've been processing potatoes from this year's harvest for the past few months and continue to assess the overall quality of the potatoes in our key growing regions, including shape, color, level of defects and solid content as consistent with historical averages.\nYields, however, are below historical averages and below the preliminary assessment that we provided during our earnings call in October. To fill our production needs, we have secured additional potatoes in the Columbia Basin and Idaho and are sourcing potatoes from other regions in North America, including the East Coast. This will add to our potato costs for the remainder of fiscal 2023, and we have included the estimated impact in our updated financial targets for the year.\nWith respect to next year's potato crop, we've agreed to nearly a 20% increase in contract prices for potatoes grown in the Columbia Basin and have secured the targeted number of acres to be planted. Our discussions with growers in Idaho and Alberta on price and acreage are ongoing. Now with respect to our acquisition of our partner's interest in Lamb Weston/Meijer, we expect the transaction will close during our fiscal fourth quarter after completing the regulatory review process. I'm excited about welcoming 1,500 value team members and beginning to capture strategic, commercial and operational benefits from the transaction, including, first, strengthening our global manufacturing footprint by leveraging Europe's low-cost infrastructure to serve key markets around the world as well as adopting best-in-class manufacturing practices to increase efficiency, improve quality and reduce costs.\nSecond, enhancing our customer-centric operating model by offering a single voice to our global customers and seamlessly supporting multinational customers with a truly global supply chain. Third, improving our position to further capitalize on growth opportunities in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. And fourth, pursuing our global growth strategies without the operating restrictions associated with the joint venture. So in summary, we drove strong sales and earnings growth in the second quarter and in the first half by executing on our strategies to price the counter inflation, improve mix, generate productivity savings and drive value for our customers.\nThe category is healthy with solid overall demand behind strength in QSR traffic and constrained industry supply. The quality of the recently harvested potato crop in the Pacific Northwest is good, and the impact from the shortfall in yields is manageable. And finally, we're confident about the strategic, operational and commercial benefits at the Lamb Weston/Meijer transaction has to offer. And we look forward to the transaction closing later this year.\nNow let me turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Bernadette?\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our financial performance and operating momentum through the first half of the year, which has provided us with a strong foundation to raise our annual sales and earnings targets. Let me review our second quarter results before discussing our updated outlook.\nSales in the second quarter grew 27% to nearly $1.28 billion. That's a record for us. A 30% increase in price mix drove our sales growth as we continued to benefit from product and great pricing actions across each of our business segments. The increase reflects the carryover impact of product pricing actions that we initiated in fiscal 2022 as well as pricing actions that we began implementing during this fiscal year. The increase also reflects benefits from efforts to improve our portfolio mix. Sales volumes declined 3% as we continued to experience the supply-chain constraints and related shortfalls in order fulfillment that Tom described.\nThis primarily affected volumes and service levels in our Foodservice and Retail segments. To a lesser extent, volumes in the quarter were also impacted by softer casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic as well as the timing of replacing losses of some low-margin business in our Foodservice and Retail segments.\nGross profit in the quarter increased $176 million to $382 million, as a result of our sales growth and strong gross margin performance. Our margin expanded 950 basis points versus the prior year quarter and about 550 basis points sequentially to nearly 30%. Broadly speaking, pricing actions in each of our business segments, efforts to improve customer and product mix, and value created from our productivity programs have caught up to the cumulative effect of input and transportation cost inflation over the past couple of years.\nInput cost inflation, however, continues to be challenging. Once again, it was the primary driver of a double-digit increase in our manufacturing and distribution cost per pound in the quarter, largely due to higher prices for edible oils, ingredients for batter coatings, labor and transportation. Potato costs were also up as a consequence of the historically poor crop that was harvested last fall.\nWhile this is the last quarter that we will realize the financial impact from the 2021 crop, we expect our potato costs to continue to increase in the second half of this year as a result of higher contract prices and the need for significant open market purchases due to poor yields from the 2022 crop. We also continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with shortages of key ingredients and spare parts, onboarding newly hired production team members and other industry-wide supply-chain challenges.\nWhile the impacts from these constraints have been slowly easing, we expect they will continue to be a headwind through the remainder of the year. Moving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A, excluding items impacting comparability, increased $45 million to $136 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses due to improved operating performance and higher expenses relating to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing and building a new ERP system.\nEquity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures increased $16 million, excluding items impacting comparability and mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. Higher pricing, especially in Europe, drove the increase. Demand continued to hold up relatively well despite the impact of significant consumer inflation and volatile energy costs.\nThis sets Lamb Weston/Meijer up to deliver solid results in the second half of the year. Moving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 34% in the quarter behind a 31% increase in price/mix. As Tom noted earlier, most of the increase was driven by price escalators and updated pricing structures. With the increase in price/mix, Global's product contribution margin more than doubled to $171 million in the quarter.\nIn addition, Global's product contribution margin percentage approached pre-pandemic levels, which is a key milestone for our overall performance. While we were always confident that we would restore Global's margins, we knew it would take longer than in other segments due to the structure and terms of the channels' customer contracts. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%, driven by a 25% increase in price/mix as we continue to realize the carryover benefit of pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 as well as actions taken earlier this year to counter inflation.\nSales volumes decreased 11%, primarily reflecting production constraints and to a lesser extent, softer traffic in casual dining and full-service restaurants. In addition, because of these production constraints, we've had to make some tough choices on customer service, which has resulted in the loss of some lower-margin business. Foodservice's product contribution margin increased 25% as the benefits from pricing actions more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nSales in our Retail segment increased 34% behind a 43% increase in price/mix, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios. Volume fell 9%, largely as a result of production constraints. It also reflects the incremental losses of certain lower-margin private label products. Through a combination of the team's strong execution of pricing and mix management, Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $66 million.\nIts production contribution margin percentage is now in line with our away-from-home channels. Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our balance sheet remains solid with strong liquidity and a low leverage ratio. We ended the quarter with about $420 million of cash and $1 billion undrawn revolver. Our net debt was about $2.3 billion, resulting in a 2.4x leverage ratio. That's down from 3.1x at the end of fiscal 2022, reflecting our earnings recovery.\nIn the first half of the year, we generated about $290 million of cash from operations or about $80 million more than the first half of last year, largely due to the higher earnings. Capital expenditures were about $270 million, which is up about $120 million from the first half of last year. This increase is largely related to construction costs as we continue to expand processing capacity in Idaho, China and Argentina.\nAs a reminder, our annual maintenance capital expenditures have typically been about $120 million to $130 million as we generally target about 3% to 4% of sales. In the first half of the year, we returned nearly $100 million of cash to shareholders, including more than $70 million in dividends and $28 million in share repurchases.\nAs you may have seen a few weeks ago, our Board of Directors approved a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend, reflecting the successful execution of our strategy to drive strong financial results and cash flow and our confidence in our ability to deliver sustainable, profitable growth over the long term.\nSo now let's turn to the updated fiscal 2023 outlook. Please note that our updated targets do not reflect the financial consolidation of Lamb Weston/Meijer as that transaction has not yet closed. We believe the transaction will be completed during our fiscal fourth quarter. So for the year, we've increased our sales target to $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion, which implies a growth rate of 17% to 19.5%. That's up from our previous target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion.\nWe expect that higher price/mix will be the primary driver of sales growth in the second half of the year. Forecasting volumes in the second half remains difficult as we anticipate shipments will continue to be affected by supply-chain constraints through fiscal 2023 and because of volatility surrounding a potential slowdown in restaurant traffic and demand as consumers face inflation and a weaker macroeconomic environment.\nFor earnings, we're targeting adjusted net income of $540 million to $580 million. That's up from our previous target of $360 million to $410 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.75 to $4, up from our previous target of $2.45 to $2.85. And finally, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures of $1.05 billion to $1.1 billion, up from our previous estimate of $840 million to $910 million. We continue to expect the increase in our earnings will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion.\nWe're targeting gross margins during the second half of the year to be between 27% and 28%, which is in line with the more than 27% that we delivered in the first half and up from the 23% that we posted during the back half of fiscal 2022. We expect the seasonal, sequential quarterly cadence for gross margins will be less pronounced than in previous years. Specifically, we do not foresee much of the typical seasonal step-up in gross margin from Q2 to Q3 or much of the typical step down from Q3 to Q4 for a few reasons.\nFirst, beginning in the third quarter, we expect our raw potato costs to increase to reflect the approximately 20% increase in the contracted price of the recently harvested potato crop. In addition, we expect higher potato costs as a result of significant high-cost open market purchases. Second, we expect continued significant inflation for other key inputs during the second half of the year, especially for edible oils and ingredients for batter coatings.\nThird, we expect a more muted step-up in global pricing from Q2 to Q3 due to the acceleration of pricing actions for contracts up for renewal in the coming years. And finally, we expect the year-over-year price increases in our Foodservice and Retail segments will decelerate as we begin to lap actions taken in fiscal 2022.\nWith respect to SG&A, we expect expenses, excluding items impacting comparability of $525 million to $550 million. That's up from our previous target, largely due to higher compensation and benefit expenses, including increased incentive compensation expense due to improved operating performance as well as expenses for outside services, including support of our IT and ERP upgrades. Our [estimates] of other financial targets, including interest expense, capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expenses and our effective tax rate are unchanged. And with that, let me now turn it back over to Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me sum it up by saying, we're confident in our strategies and business momentum. And as a result, we've significantly increased our financial targets for the year. And we're also confident about the health and prospects of the category. And we believe that our capacity expansion and infrastructure investments will have us well positioned to support sustainable, profitable growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nOnce again, I want to thank the entire Lamb Weston team for our success this quarter and their ongoing commitment to meet the needs of our customers. Thank you for joining our call today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide an overview of the current environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our first quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with our performance in the quarter. We drove strong sales growth, expanded our gross margin and nearly doubled adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures. Our results reflect our continued focus on implementing pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation, driving productivity and cost saving initiatives, increasing service levels for our customers in each of our sales channels and supporting our people and talent.\nWe built good operating momentum over the past few quarters by focusing on these near-term objectives, and we are confident in our ability to deliver the upper end of our sales and earning target ranges for the year.\nI'm especially proud that the Lamb Weston team has continued to generate solid results in a very difficult macroeconomic environment. We expect this environment to remain challenging, at least through fiscal 2023, as inflation, a growing threat of recession and industry-wide supply chain disruptions continue to pressure demand for fries as well as our cost structure.\nIt's no surprise that inflationary trends for food, energy and housing have affected restaurant traffic in the U.S. over the past 6 months. We saw similar restaurant traffic trends during the Great Recession as consumer discretionary income came under pressure. While traffic at quick service restaurants has held up relatively well, it has come at the expense of casual dining and full-service restaurants as consumers increasingly choose less expensive options when dining away from home.\nIn the past month or so, we've seen casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic tick up from summer lows, but traffic remains below levels achieved just prior to the war in Ukraine. Unlike traffic trends, fry demand continues to be solid when dining out. The fry attachment rate, which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food-service outlets remains above pre pandemic levels. Fry demand in retail channels has also benefited as restaurant traffic slows.\nOverall, we expect volatility in restaurant traffic and demand trends will continue through fiscal 2023. But history has shown that this category is resilient during economic downturns. Although we may see some category weakness in the near term, we remain confident in the long-term growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets.\nIn addition, as category growth returns to historical rates, we should be well positioned to capture at least our share of growth with our investments in new processing capacity in Idaho and China as well as our newly announced expansion in Argentina.\nWith respect to pricing, our overall price/mix growth accelerated for the fourth consecutive quarter. In our Foodservice and Retail segments, we continue to realize a carryover benefit of multiple product pricing actions that we have taken over the past 15 months and expect the benefit of these actions will continue to gradually build through the first half of fiscal 2023.\nIn our Global segment, we made good progress in increasing price/mix through price escalators included in multiyear contracts while also securing some price adjustments outside of these agreements. In addition, we've nearly completed negotiating contract renewals that represent about 1/3 of our Global segment volume. Overall, we feel good about how the discussions played out, and we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023.\nFinally, with respect to this year's potato crop. Our preliminary view is the potato crop in our growing regions in the aggregate will be around the lower end of historical average range. Specifically, the overall quality of the crop, including shape, color, level of defects and solid content is good and consistent with historical averages. Yields, however, are below average. The unusually hot weather during August affected the growth of the potatoes and resulted in a greater-than-average proportion of potatoes failing to bulk up to the desired size.\nIn response, we've already begun to secure the additional potatoes needed to meet our production forecast and expect to purchase most of this from growers in the Columbia Basin in Idaho. That's in contrast to last year when we purchased potatoes at significant premiums to contracted prices and transported them from as far away as the East Coast.\nAs you may recall, our financial targets for the year were predicated in part on an average potato crop, and we believe this crop is broadly consistent with our expectations. While the low average yields will result in additional open market purchases at higher-than-contracted prices, we do not expect this to affect our ability to deliver our financial targets.\nTo be clear, we view this crop as significantly better than last year's, which was poor both in terms of yield and quality due to the prolonged extreme summer heat in the Pacific Northwest. We'll provide our final assessment of the crop, including how it performs out of storage when we report our second quarter results in early January.\nSo in summary, we generated strong sales and earnings growth in the first quarter by executing pricing actions in each of our business segments and driving productivity savings. We expect restaurant traffic and fry demand will be volatile in the near term as consumers continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. And on a preliminary basis, we believe the potato crops in our growing regions are at the lower end of historical average range and that any effect on our operations or financial performance will be manageable.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our first quarter results and our progress towards our fiscal 2023 financial commitments.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom said, we're pleased with our performance in the quarter, and we are confident in our ability to deliver at the high end of our financial target ranges for the year. In the quarter, our sales grew 14% to more than $1.1 billion. Price/mix was up 19% as we continued to benefit from product and freight pricing actions that we announced last fiscal year and as we began to execute new pricing actions during the fiscal -- for the first quarter.\nOur sales volumes were down 5%, primarily reflecting the softer restaurant traffic trends in U.S. casual dining and full-service outlets that Tom described earlier as well as the timing of shipments to large chain restaurant customers. In Retail, while branded product volumes were up, overall Retail segment volumes were down with the ongoing effect of losing certain low-margin private label business. Sales volumes in Foodservice and Retail also continued to be affected by our inability to fully serve customer demand as a result of constrained production at our facilities.\nGross profit increased $122 million to $273 million in the quarter. Gross margin expanded nearly 900 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 230 basis points sequentially to more than 24%. Pricing actions and productivity savings drove these improvements, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes. Cost per pound increased high single digits, with inflation again accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings, labor and transportation were the primary drivers.\nPotato costs were also up as a result of the [poor] crop that was harvested last fall. We'll continue to realize the financial impact of this crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we sell the final finished goods produced from the crop. And finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts and ingredient shortages and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Benefits from our portfolio simplification and other cost mitigation efforts, however, offset some of these higher costs.\nMoving on from cost of sales, our SG&A increased $25 million to $116 million, largely due to higher compensation and benefits expense and expenses related to improving our IT infrastructure, including designing a new ERP system. Equity method earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe and the U.S. increased nearly $170 million. More than $140 million of the increase was related to the change in unrealized gains from mark-to-market adjustments related to changes in natural gas and electricity derivatives as commodity markets in Europe have experienced significant volatility.\nAnother $15 million of the increase relates to a gain recognized in connection with us acquiring an additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. Excluding these comparability items, as well as other mark-to-market adjustments not associated with natural gas and electricity derivatives, equity earnings increased $13 million. This largely reflects improved results in our joint venture in Europe.\nIn addition, in September, our European joint venture withdrew from its joint venture in Russia after receiving all regulatory approvals. In the prior year quarter, earnings from the Russia joint venture were not material. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, nearly doubled to $228 million, while adjusted diluted earnings per share more than tripled to $0.75 per share. Strong sales growth and gross margin expansion primarily drove the increases.\nMoving on to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 12% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 14%, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and higher prices charged for freight. Mix was also positive.\nOverall segment volumes declined 2% as North American volumes fell, primarily due to the timing of shipments to large QSR chain customers, including the effect of lapping a notable limited-time product offering in the prior year quarter. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, nearly doubled to $84 million. Favorable price/mix more than offset the impacts of higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.\nSales in our Foodservice segment grew 14%. Price/mix increased 26% as we continued to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced throughout fiscal 2022 and earlier in the quarter to counter inflation. Sales volumes decreased 12% as casual dining and full-service restaurant traffic softened. While traffic trends progressively softened each month since the war in Ukraine began at the end of February, it began to tick upward in August.\nSales volumes were also affected by the timing of incremental losses of certain low-margin noncommercial business as well as our inability to fully serve demand as a result of constrained production. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose more than 40% to $138 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound and the impact of lower volumes.\nIn our Retail segment, sales increased 28%. Price/mix was up 32%, reflecting pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios as well as favorable mix with the sale of more branded products. Volume was down 4%, reflecting incremental losses of certain lower-margin private label products. We'll be lapping the last of that -- lost private label business in the second quarter. Sales volumes were also tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to the constrained production. Retail's product contribution margin more than tripled to $49 million behind pricing actions and favorable mix. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $485 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. While our net debt remained relatively flat at about $2.25 billion, our leverage ratio fell to 2.7x from 3.1x at the end of the fiscal 2022 as earnings grew. We generated more than $190 million of cash from operations, which is up about $30 million versus the prior year quarter, largely due to higher earnings.\nCapital expenditures were about $120 million. That's up about $40 million as we continue to construct new french fry lines in Idaho and China. In addition, we paid about $42 million to acquire the additional 40% interest in our joint venture in Argentina. We now own 90% of that joint venture. We returned $64 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have about $240 million of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program.\nTurning to our fiscal 2023 outlook. Our financial targets for the year remain unchanged as we continue to build our operating momentum. While the macro environment remains volatile, we're on track to deliver at the high end of our sales target of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion with price driving the growth. We'll continue to realize the carryover benefit of product pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. And in our Global segment, we expect to see the benefit of pricing actions, including pricing structures for contract renewals billed as the year progresses.\nForecasting volume continues to remain more difficult due to the near-term volatility in restaurant traffic and demand. As we saw in the first quarter, we believe that consumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times will continue to affect overall demand as well as our sales channel and product mix, with QSRs and retail outlets benefiting at the expense of casual dining and full-service restaurants. In addition, we expect our sales volumes will be affected by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face disruptions and availability of key product inputs and spare parts.\nAdditionally, while labor and access to shipping containers have improved, we continue to see the impact of shortages. We're on track to deliver at the high end of the range of our earnings target, including adjusted net income of $360 million to $410 million, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.85, and adjusted EBITDA including unconsolidated joint ventures of $840 million to $910 million. These targets exclude the items impacting comparability that I described earlier.\nWe expect our earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. We continue to expect gross margins during the second half of fiscal '23 that approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26%, and we feel good about the 4 key factors underlying this target. First, as Tom noted, we believe the potato crops in our primary growing regions will be at the lower end of the historical average range, and that any effect on our operations and financial performance will be manageable.\nSecond, we're pleased with the continued progress in implementing pricing actions to counter cost inflation. Third, we're making steady progress in adding production workers in order to ease labor pressures in our factories. And finally, the availability of domestic rail and trucking assets as well as access to shipping containers continues to improve. While a broad rail strike has likely been averted, we continue to closely monitor the status of discussions with the West Coast Stock Workers Union and the impact of potential work slowdown or stoppage may have on our exports.\nWe continue to target SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which reflects higher compensation and benefits expenses to attract and retain talent, higher spending for our new ERP system and other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher advertising and promotion expenses as we look to return support back to historical levels and overall inflation for third-party services. We continue to expect equity earnings of $25 million to $30 million, excluding items impacting comparability but also expect increased volatility, given the likelihood of a poor crop in Europe as well as possible limitations on natural gas usage that may affect our production.\nIn addition, we believe that the severe inflation outlook for Europe will likely translate into more pressure on restaurant traffic and demand. Our estimates for our other financial targets are unchanged, including: capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, excluding acquisitions; interest expense of approximately $115 million; depreciation and amortization expense of about $210 million; and an effective tax rate, excluding items impacting comparability, of about 24%. Now here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we are managing well through this challenging environment and continue to build good operating momentum. We're well positioned to deliver at the upper end of our financial target ranges for the year, and we're making the necessary investments in our production capacity and operating infrastructure to support long-term growth and create value for our shareholders. Thank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available website lambweston.com. Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties.\nPlease refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some key highlights for fiscal 2022 as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook. With that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, and I want to thank all my Lamb Weston colleagues for navigating through this difficult and volatile environment these past 2 years. We've worked together as a focused team to weather pandemic, supply chain, and macroeconomic headwinds while continuing to support our customers, improve our operations and execute on our long-term strategic objectives.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2022, we delivered a record year of $4.1 billion in sales, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and volume growth as restaurant traffic and demand for fries continued to recover from the depths of the pandemic. We implemented pricing actions across each of our sales channels to mitigate some of the highest input and transportation cost inflation that we've experienced in 40 years.\nThis helped to drive year-over-year gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, and we expect to realize a carryover benefit of these pricing actions in fiscal 2023. We simplified our portfolio by eliminating SKUs, [drove] productivity savings and work with our customers to secure product specification changes to offset much of the cost and operational impact of a historically poor potato crop. We also made tough, but necessary decisions around customers, sales channels, production and service levels and adopted tools and practices to better manage our customer and product portfolio.\nIn our production facilities, we continue to leverage our Lamb Weston operating culture and changed our ways of working, including how we manage crewing schedules. This helped to better attract and retain employees, and we're making progress in getting our facilities fully staffed.\nWe started up a new chopped and formed production line in Idaho and broke ground on our capacity expansion and modernization projects in Idaho and China. While our plant in China remains on track to be operational by mid fiscal 2024, we pushed back the completion of our new fry line in Idaho at least a few months to mid fiscal 2024 as a result of some equipment delays.\nWe completed the design work for the second phase of our new enterprise resource planning system. We'll build and test the new system in fiscal 2023 and implement it in fiscal 2024 in a phased approach. We issued our third environmental, social and governance report, which has been prepared in accordance with leading industry standards such as the global reporting initiative. This report includes our progress towards specific ESG goals for 2030.\nWe refinanced more than $1.7 billion of senior notes, which extended our debt maturities and reduced our weighted average interest rate. And finally, we increased our dividend for the fifth straight year and stepped up share repurchases to boost capital return to shareholders. In our joint ventures, Lamb-Weston/Meijer announced its intention to withdraw from its joint venture in Russia in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the devastating humanitarian crisis, the war has created.\nIn July, we increased our interest in our joint venture in Argentina from 50% to 90% and will now consolidate its sales and earnings in our results. In short, we've been managing through a turbulent market to build good operating and financial momentum by controlling what we can control while continuing to best to support long-term growth.\nThat said, we expect the environment, going forward, will remain very challenging with inflation continuing to pose the biggest threat to our cost structure and fry demand. Although the cost of some inputs, such as edible oils, energy and transportation, have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years. Labor availability continues to be an issue while other key inputs, such as ingredients for fry coatings, remain costly and in short supply. As a result, we expect input, transportation and labor costs will be a significant headwind through fiscal 2023.\nRising food, energy and housing prices have also affected restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. in the past few months. While traffic at quick service restaurants, which account for more than 80% of fry servings, has held up fairly well. Traffic at casual dining and other full-service restaurants have softened recently as consumer scale back dining out occasions or shifted to QSRs.\nDespite pressure on overall restaurant traffic, the demand for fries remain solid as the fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is a rate in which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, remains above pre-pandemic levels.\nGoing forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand in the U.S. will be choppy and less predictable in the near term as consumers face significant cost inflation.\nFry demand in retail channels, however, should continue to benefit if demand in out-of-home channels is pressured. Outside the U.S. Consumer demand trends in Europe have been similar to what we have experienced in the U.S. as a result of inflationary pressures, which will also likely lead to a more unpredictable operating environment in fiscal 2023.\nOutside of China, demand in Asia has been relatively stable. The recovery in demand in China has been uneven as the government there maintains a Zero-COVID policy. In addition, our shipments to Asia continued to be constrained by the limited availability of shipping containers, although that availability did improve somewhat in the fourth quarter.\nThe bottom line is that we're forecasting cost and demand in this near-term inflationary and volatile macroeconomic environment will be difficult and require us to remain flexible in managing our supply chain and commercial operations. Despite these short-term challenges, we're confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and in our key international markets.\nWith respect to pricing, our price/mix growth accelerated for the third consecutive quarter as we continue to execute on our product and freight pricing actions. In early July, we began implementing our fourth round of pricing in the past 12 months in our Foodservice and Retail segments. We expect to see the benefit of these pricing actions as well as the one that we took in April to gradually build as we progress through the first half of fiscal 2023.\nIn our Global segment, it's clear that in the back half of fiscal 2022, we benefited from price escalators included in multi-year agreements and had some success in securing price increases outside of these contractual escalators. However, it's equally clear that we have yet to fully offset inflation and other costs given the more rigid structures and terms of customer agreements in this segment, resulting in a 110 basis point decline in product contribution margin percentage in the fourth quarter.\nAs you may recall, most of our chain restaurant contracts in our Global segment are multi-year agreements, and we're in the process of negotiating renewals representing about 1/3 of our global segment volume this year. We're being aggressive in discussions with customers to secure price increases to offset inflationary pressures, so that we can gradually restore profitability towards pre-pandemic levels. We're also seeking to modify other key terms to reduce the chances of, again, facing a significant pricing lag to recover rising costs.\nFor those agreements up for renewal this year, we'll generally begin to see the results of these new pricing structures during the second half of fiscal 2023. However, it may take up to a couple of years before we can fully recover costs across our global segment customer portfolio. For those multi-year contracts that were renewed over the past couple of years, we'll continue to realize the price escalators embedded in those agreements.\nWith respect to this year's upcoming potato crop, we expect the crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta in the Midwest to be largely in line with historical averages. While cooler than average weather in the spring and early summer slowed the crops progression, it is largely caught up to historical average with warmer temperatures and sunny days in recent weeks. We'll provide more detail on the crop when we report our first quarter results in early October, in line with our past practice.\nAs we've previously discussed, we've agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound, reflecting our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long term. We'll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023, as we begin to process the early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer.\nSo in summary, we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022, including record-high sales in the fourth quarter and for the year. We continue to successfully execute pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts as we look to offset input cost inflation and the impact of a historically poor crop. We remain confident in the resiliency and the long-term prospects of the category, although near-term demand will likely be choppy and difficult to predict. And at this time, this year's crop is on track to be in line with historical averages.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our fourth quarter results and our fiscal 2023 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by echoing Tom's comments and thanking our employees for their hard work and continued dedication to drive our solid operating and financial performance during these challenging times.\nWe delivered fourth quarter sales growth of 14% or a record $1.15 billion with all of the growth coming from price/mix as we continued to execute our previously announced pricing actions in each of our core business segments to offset cost inflation. Sales volumes declined 1%, primarily reflecting lower export volumes due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks.\nTotal North American volume grew this quarter behind strong sales to large chain restaurant customers. While consumer demand in our Foodservice and Retail channels also grew, our sales volumes to those customers fell as we were unable to fully serve this demand as a result of lower production run rates and throughput at our production facilities.\nFor the year, sales increased 12% to nearly $4.1 billion, a record high with price/mix up 9% and volume up 3%. Gross profit in the quarter increased $56 million and gross margin expanded 230 basis points versus the prior year quarter to 22%. Product and freight price increases drove the improvement, more than offsetting the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis and lower sales volumes.\nCost per pound increased double digits for the fourth straight quarter with inflation accounting for essentially all of the increase. Higher prices for inputs, such as edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging were the primary drivers. Labor costs were also notably up, reflecting broad competition for production team members.\nTransportation rates also rose sharply versus the prior year. Transport costs increased as we continue to rely on an unfavorable mix of higher-cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers. And as Tom mentioned, while the cost of some inputs and transportation have come off their highs in recent weeks, they remain elevated relative to the past few years and will continue to pose a headwind through fiscal 2023.\nWe also continue to incur higher potato costs as a consequence of the poor crop that was harvested last fall. We will continue to realize the financial impact of this poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nAnd finally, we continue to incur higher costs and operational inefficiencies associated with labor, spare parts and ingredient shortages, and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. Increased downtimes associated with scheduled maintenance also reduced production run rates, lowering our fixed cost recovery. Partially offsetting these higher costs per pound were benefits from our portfolio simplification, cost mitigation and other productivity efforts.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $19 million in the quarter, largely due to higher incentive compensation expense and a $3.5 million contribution to our charitable foundation. Equity method earnings from our unconsolidated joint ventures in Europe, the U.S. and Argentina, declined $57 million. This included a $63 million noncash charge associated with the European joint venture's intent to withdraw from its joint venture that operates a production facility in Russia as a result of the war in Ukraine.\nExcluding the impact of this charge as well as mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts, equity earnings increased $2 million versus the prior year. So putting it all together, adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, increased 21% while adjusted diluted EPS rose 48%. Higher sales and gross margin expansion drove the increases.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 10% in the quarter. Price/mix drove the entire increase, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals, inflation-driven price escalators and higher prices charged for freight. Overall segment volume was flat. We drove solid growth in shipments to large QSR and casual dining chains in North America.\nHowever, this growth was offset by a more than 10% decline in international shipments, reflecting limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. While still down versus the prior year, international shipments improved sequentially versus a decline of 20% in the third quarter as more shipping containers were made available.\nGlobal's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotion expenses, declined 1% to $56 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix. Sales in our Foodservice segment grew 21%. Price/mix increased 24% as we continue to drive product and freight pricing actions that we announced earlier in the year to mitigate cost inflation.\nSales volumes decreased 3% as labor and commodity shortages as well as scheduled maintenance downtimes impacted run rates and throughput at our production facilities, creating the inability to fully serve customer demand. We did see sales volumes slow each successive month during the quarter as restaurant traffic, especially in casual dining, softened as consumers responded to accelerating inflation.\nFoodservices product contribution margin rose 47% to $142 million as favorable price more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our Retail segment, sales increased 20%. Price was up 22%, reflecting product and freight pricing actions across our branded and private label portfolios as well as favorable mix.\nVolume fell 2%, reflecting incremental losses of certain lower margin private label products. This was partially offset by higher shipments of branded products, although this growth was tempered by our inability to fully serve customer demand due to lower production run rate. Retail's product contribution margin nearly doubled to $42 million behind pricing actions, favorable mix with the sales of more branded products and a $3 million decline in A&P expenses. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing and distribution costs per pound.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with $525 million of cash and a $1 billion undrawn revolver. We had net debt of about $2.2 billion, which corresponds to a 3.1x leverage ratio. For the year, we generated about $420 million of cash from operations, which is down about $135 million versus the prior year, largely due to higher working capital.\nCapital expenditures for the year were about $305 million. That's up about $145 million as we completed the chopped and formed line in Idaho and began construction of our capacity expansion in China. For the year, we returned nearly $290 million of cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and have just under $275 million of authorization (inaudible) program.\nNow turning to our updated fiscal 2023 outlook. As Tom noted, we anticipate the overall operating environment to continue to be challenging, with inflation continuing to affect our cost structure as well as consumer demand. Accordingly, we're taking a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 outlook. We're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, which implies a growth rate of 15% to 17%.\nWe expect that price will be the primary driver of sales growth as we continue to implement our previously announced pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments and secure price increases in contracts up for renewal with customers in our Global segment.\nWith respect to volume, forecasting demand has become increasingly difficult. Overall, we expect U.S. demand to remain solid, but will also likely be affected by significant inflation that consumers are facing. In the event of an economic recession, we expect demand for french fries will be resilient, although with little to no growth. That's consistent with what we experienced during the great recession from 2008 to 2010.\nConsumer behavior during inflationary or recessionary times may also have an effect on sales channel and product mix. QSRs and retail outlets may benefit, but this may be at the expense of casual dining establishments. We've already seen some indications of this in the past few months. In addition, we expect our volume growth will be limited by near-term production and throughput constraints as we continue to face labor shortages, disruptions in the availability of key product inputs and spare parts and limited access to shipping containers for exports.\nFor earnings, we expect net income of $360 million to $410 million. Diluted EPS of $2.45 to $2.85, and adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million. Using the midpoint of this EBITDA range implies growth of about 20% or about $150 million versus the prior year.\nWe expect the earnings increase will be driven primarily by sales growth and gross margin expansion. Favorable price/mix and productivity savings should more than offset input, manufacturing and transportation inflation as well as the cost inefficiencies and potato crop challenges that pressured our results last year.\nDuring the first half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin to improve versus the first half of fiscal '22, but will continue to be pressured as compared to our normalized seasonal rates. This reflects the implementation of our pricing actions, lagging inflation as well as the impact of higher raw potato costs on a per pound basis due to the poor crop that we harvested last fall.\nWe also expect our gross margins will be pressured by ongoing industry-wide labor and logistics challenges. During the second half of fiscal '23, we expect our gross margin will approach our normalized annual rate of 25% to 26%, assuming four key factors.\nFirst, an average fall 2022 potato crop. As Tom noted, at this time, we believe the crop in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin and Idaho will be consistent with historical averages. Second, the continued successful implementation of our pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation. As our recent results have shown, we've been able to successfully increase price across our portfolio.\nThird, the continued easing of labor pressures that have affected our production run rates and throughput. While factory labor availability remains challenging, we feel good about the actions that we've put in place to attract and retain production workers.\nAnd finally, the continued easing of logistics pressures that have constrained our shipments, especially our exports. The availability of domestic rail and trucking assets has improved in the past few months, along with access to shipping containers. However, we're closely monitoring the recent expiration of the West Coast dock workers union contract and what impact, if any, may have on our exports.\nWe're projecting the strong increase in sales and gross profit will be partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. We're targeting total SG&A expenses of $475 million to $500 million, which is about $100 million higher than fiscal 2022, using the midpoint of that range. The increase largely reflects higher compensation and benefit costs as we adjust our compensation packages to reflect a very competitive environment to attract and retain talent.\nAdditional headcount, recruiting, training, travel and meeting expenses as we look to fill open positions to support growth over the long term and continue to emerge from pandemic-related restrictions. Higher spending to build and test our new ERP system, in addition to other IT infrastructure upgrades, higher A&P expenses, predominantly in support of our retail segment and finally, overall inflation for third-party services.\nWe expect equity earnings to be $25 million to $30 million, which is up from about $16 million in fiscal 2022 after excluding the $27 million of mark-to-market commodity and currency contract gains as well as the impairment charge and about $10 million of earnings from the Russia joint venture.\nIn addition to our operating targets, we expect total interest expense of around $115 million, an effective tax rate of approximately 24%. Total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $210 million and capital expenditures of $475 million to $525 million, which includes about $285 million for the construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China as well as capital associated with our new ERP system and other IT upgrades.\nFinally, as Tom noted, we recently acquired a controlling interest in our joint venture in Argentina for $42 million and will now consolidate their results. We do not expect the joint venture to have a material contribution to either sales or earnings growth this year.\nSo looking at our fiscal 2023 outlook at a high level. We're targeting sales of $4.7 billion to $4.8 billion, largely driven by price/mix, and we're targeting adjusted EBITDA, including unconsolidated joint ventures, of $840 million to $910 million, largely driven by strong sales growth as well as gross margins that approach a normalized annual run rate of 25% to 26% during the second half of the fiscal year. Now, here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me quickly sum up by saying we delivered solid results in fiscal 2022 by focusing on what we can control and have built good operating momentum as we enter a new year. We've taken a prudent approach to our fiscal 2023 targets as we expect the operating and demand environment to remain highly challenging, and we're confident in the long-term prospects of the category and remain committed to executing on our strategies, and investing in our global network to support growth and create value for our shareholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and now we're ready to take your questions."

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. First of all, I want to thank all my colleagues for their continued dedication and perseverance to keep Lamb Weston as an industry leader and a strong business partner. Our solid financial results in the third quarter are a direct result of how well our manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams have remained focused on improving our operations and serving our customers during a challenging macro environment, which includes the impact of an exceptionally poor potato crop. We continue to be encouraged by strong french fry demand and feel good about our continued progress. Specifically, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and drove sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion, and we did this despite the impact of Omicron variant, slowing restaurant traffic and disrupting our production and distribution operations more than we expected.\nWe benefited from our previously announced pricing actions to mitigate the significant cost inflation across our supply chain. We've also been driving improvements in our manufacturing operations as we focus on what's in our control. This includes mitigating some of the effects of the poor potato crop with product specification changes and portfolio optimization work that we've discussed previously. Factory labor remains challenging as we remain below preferred staffing levels, but we're making steady progress in a highly difficult labor market. We're addressing the labor gap by focusing on retention and new ways of attracting talent. We'll continue to push hard on our staffing initiatives and are encouraged by the improvements we're seeing. However, it will take time to get all of our factory staff where they continue to be.\nLike others, we're managing through freight challenges, including both cost increases and shipping delays. The freight challenges are impacting our top line as it limits our ability to service full demand. This is caused by a lack of containers for international and domestic shipments and truck driver shortages. This, combined with higher fuel cost, has also increased our cost to liver products. We're continuing to navigate through these and other operating challenges and remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our capacity expansion investments in Idaho and China also remain on track, and will have us well positioned to support increasing customer demand over the long term.\nLet me provide some brief updates on the operating environment before turning the call over to Bernadette. Let's start with demand. In the U.S., overall (inaudible), restaurant traffic in our third quarter remained solid. Although it weakened temporarily as the Omicron variant spread quickly. Omicron's impact peaked in January and affected consumer traffic at both quick service and full-service restaurants. In addition, some restaurants closed temporarily or reduced operating hours due to staff shortages, which further impacted demand. Restaurant traffic, however, has rebounded to pre-Omicron levels. The fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic and remains above prepandemic levels. Going forward, we expect restaurant traffic and consumer demand for fries in the U.S. to remain strong. Although it may be more volatile in the near term as consumers face significant cost inflation, in contrast, fry demand in retail channels may continue to benefit if demand in out-of-home channels is affected.\nOutside the U.S., demand in Asia and Oceania remained stable. However, we have not been able to meet that demand due to the limited availability of shipping containers for export. While we expect overall demand in these regions to return to pre-pandemic levels, widespread COVID-related government restrictions in key markets such as China may lead to demand volatility in the near term.\nDemand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb-Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been fairly stable, although it was temporarily affected by the spread of Omicron during the quarter. As in the U.S., we expect demand in Europe may be volatile in the upcoming months as cost inflation and COVID variants temper restaurant traffic. So overall, we expect that demand in the near term will be choppy. We remain confident in the long-term resiliency and growth prospects of the category in the U.S. and our key international markets. With respect to pricing, our price/mix growth accelerated sequentially in the third quarter as we continued to execute on our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments to offset inflation, and as we began to implement pricing actions in our Global segment. Going forward, if we see further inflation, we're prepared to take additional pricing actions as well as drive opportunities to improve product and customer mix.\nTo that end, last week, we began implementing a note round of pricing actions in our Retail segment and Retail segments, and we expect to see the benefits of these actions gradually build over the next 6 months. In our Global segment, contracts representing about 1/3 of the segment's volume are up for regional this year. We've begun discussions with those customers and expect to have most of the contract terms agreed by early fall.\nWith respect to this year's upcoming potato crop, we've agreed to a 20% increase in the contracted price per pound in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, Alberta and the Midwest. This increase reflects our approach for annual price changes that reflect the cost to grow, plus an appropriate return for our growers such that they are viable over the long term. We'll begin to see the impact of these higher contracted potato prices during the second quarter of fiscal 2023 as we began to process the early potato varieties that are harvested in mid-summer.\nIn addition, over the past few months, we partnered with our growers to contract for acres that represent nearly all of our projected needs associated with this year's crop. The number of acres contracted assumes an average crop year. Planning of this year's potato crop started in March and typically concludes by the end of April, and we'll provide our usual crop updates during future quarterly earnings calls as the growing season progresses.\nFinally, our hearts go out to all the people affected by Russia invasion of Ukraine. Our exposure to Russia is indirect as it runs through our 50% ownership in Lamb-Weston/Meijer. Last month, the Russia JV began winding down production of Lamb Weston-branded products and paused construction of its previously announced capacity expansion. We continue to monitor the situation and any decisions regarding that operation will be made in conjunction with our partner in Europe.\nSo in summary, we feel good about our progress in the quarter, especially given the highly challenging operating environment, and we remain on track to deliver our financial commitments for the year. Our pricing actions and cost mitigation efforts enabled us to drive sequential and year-over-year gross margin expansion. We've agreed on contract price and acres to be planted for this year's potato crop, and we remain confident in the resiliency and long-term growth prospects of the category, although demand may be volatile in the near term.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our third quarter results and our updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by echoing Tom's comments thanking our employees. We appreciate your hard work and dedication. As Tom discussed, we feel good about the benefits from our pricing actions and cost savings efforts to offset much of the significant cost inflation that we've been experiencing. And I'm confident in our ability to continue to manage through this volatile business environment.\nSpecifically, in the quarter, our sales increased 7% to $955 million. Price/mix was up 12% as we continued to execute our previously announced product and freight pricing actions in each of our business segments to offset input, manufacturing and transportation cost inflation. Most of the increase in the quarter reflects these pricing actions, while mix was also favorable. Sales volumes declined 5% as we were unable to fully serve market demand due to logistics constraints, especially for our international shipments as well as lower production run rates and throughput at our factories, resulting from labor shortages. Increased shipments in our Foodservice segment and to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that are served by our global segment, partially offset the volume decline.\nHowever, while volume increased in these channels, it was tempered by the Omicron variant's negative effect on restaurant traffic, on the availability of labor to keep restaurants open and on our production facilities and supply chain. Gross profit in the quarter increased $24 million. Product and freight price increases, along with favorable mix more than offset the impact of higher costs on a per pound basis, and lower sales volumes. We expanded gross margin by 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter and 270 basis points sequentially to more than 23%.\nLooking at our costs, double-digit inflation drove the increase in cost per pound for the third straight quarter and accounted essentially for all of the increase in the quarter. There were 4 key areas that drove the increase in cost. First, commodities played the biggest role, led by edible oils, ingredients for batter and other coatings and packaging. Labor costs also increased due to competition for factory workers. Second, transportation rates continue to climb due to the persistent disruption in global logistics networks. We also continue to use an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail to meet service obligations for certain customers. Third, we began to see higher potato costs resulting from the poor crop that was harvested last fall in our primary growing regions. The increase in potato costs reflects the impact of purchasing potatoes in the open market at a significant premium to contracted prices. Higher transportation costs for shipping potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America to our plants in the Pacific Northwest, lower potato utilization rates and running production lines at lower speeds to accommodate low-quality potatoes.\nThe increase in our potato costs, decrease in potato utilization rates and how the crop is performing in storage are all in line with the expectations that we shared with you last quarter, and we believe we've secured enough potatoes to deliver our volume forecast until we begin to harvest the early potato varieties in July. As a reminder, we will continue to realize the financial impact of this year's poor potato crop through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe final key area that drove the increase in costs are operational inefficiencies, explained by labor shortages, Omicron related absenteeism, especially in January and into early February, and other industry-wide supply chain challenges. This resulted in lower production run rates and throughput in our factories, leading to fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. As I'll discuss later, we'll continue to see the impact of these costs in the fourth quarter. The effect of lower potato utilization and production run rates in the third quarter was largely offset by a range of cost mitigation efforts, including eliminating underperforming SKUs, changes to product specifications and increased productivity savings from our [win is one] and other cost-saving initiatives.\nSo in short, we're managing well through this highly inflationary and poor potato crop environment. We feel good about how we are controlling those things that we can control, which led to the year-over-year and sequential gross margin expansion.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A declined $9 million in the quarter, largely due to lower consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those projects ended, the overall compensation and benefits expense and a $2 million decline in advertising and promotion expenses. The decline in SG&A was partially offset by higher information technology infrastructure costs, including cost to design the next release of a new enterprise resource planning system. Equity method earnings in the quarter were $30 million and included a $20 million unrealized gain related to mark-to-market adjustments associated with currency and commodity hedging contracts. The large mark-to-market gain in the quarter primarily relates to changes in the value of natural gas derivatives at Lamb-Weston/Meijer as commodity markets there have experienced significant volatility.\nExcluding the impact of these mark-to-market adjustments, equity earnings increased $1 million versus the prior quarter. Favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes were largely offset by input inflation and higher manufacturing and distribution costs in both Europe and the U.S.\nMoving to our segments. Sales in our Global segment were up 2% in the quarter. Price/mix increased 8%, reflecting domestic and international pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators. It also reflects higher prices charged for freight. Volume fell 6%. International shipments, which have historically accounted for about 40% of the segment's total volume, were down nearly 20% versus the prior year quarter due to limited shipping container availability and disruptions to ocean freight networks. Sales volumes to North American large QSR and casual dining restaurant customers increased, but at a slower rate than previous quarters due to the Omicron's negative impact on consumer traffic. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less advertising and promotional expenses, declined 8% to $73 million.\nHigher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound as well as the impact of lower sales volumes more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix.\nMoving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 34%, with price/mix up 22% and volume up 12%. As expected, the rate of increase in Foodservice price mix accelerated sequentially to 22% in the third quarter from 8% in the second quarter as the benefits of the product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year to mitigate inflation continued to build. In addition, the increase reflects favorable product and customer mix.\nThe ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants, as well as from noncommercial customers drove a 12% increase in sales volumes. While our shipments to restaurants have essentially returned to prepandemic levels, our shipments to noncommercial channels have not yet fully rebounded. As with our sales to large chain restaurants in our Global segment, the Foodservice segment's volume growth was tempered by Omicron's negative impact on restaurant traffic and labor availability in those restaurants. In addition, manufacturing labor shortages and the effect of Omicron-related absenteeism, limited our ability to fully serve demand due to lower production run rates and throughput in our factories.\nFoodservice's product contribution margin rose 52% to $107 million, with favorable price, volume and mix more than offsetting higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound. In our Retail segment, sales declined 12%, with volume down 24% and price/mix up 12%. The volume decline reflected 2 factors: First, more than half of the decline was due to incremental losses of certain lower-margin, private-label products; and second, despite solid category growth branded product volumes were down as labor and supply chain disruption limited our ability to service demand. The increase in price/mix was driven by product and freight pricing actions across our portfolio to offset inflation as well as favorable mix.\nRetail's product contribution margin declined 5% to $32 million. Lower sales volumes and higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound drove the decline, which was partially offset by favorable price/mix and a $2 million decrease in A&P expenses.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. We ended the quarter with nearly $430 million in cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. Through the first 3 quarters of the year, we generated about $175 million of cash from operations. That's down about $200 million versus the first 3 quarters of the prior year, due primarily to higher working capital and lower earnings. Year-to-date, we've spent more than $225 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our capacity expansions in Idaho and China. We've also returned nearly $230 million of cash to our shareholders, including $103 million in dividends and $126 million in share repurchases. After repurchasing $50 million of shares in the third quarter, we have just under $300 million remaining under our buyback authorization.\nNow let's turn to our updated fiscal 2022 outlook. We expect our full year sales growth to be above our long-term target of low- to mid-single digits. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be driven by price/mix as we continue to execute our previously announced product and transportation pricing actions to offset input and transportation cost inflation. However, we expect sales volumes will continue to be pressured as export volumes remain constrained due to limited shipping container availability, supply chain volatility and labor shortages challenge run rates and throughput at our factories, and as restaurant traffic and consumer demand may slow due to inflation and the persistent effect of COVID variants in the U.S. and key international markets.\nIn addition, please note that we'll be lapping a high volume comparison in the prior year.\nWith respect to earnings for the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 19% to 20%. This update puts us at the high end of the 18% to 20% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We're comfortable to be at the higher end of that range. Because of our confidence in the pace and execution of product and freight price increases that we're currently implementing in the market, we have more clarity on the net impact in margin from this year's poor potato crop, and we're making steady progress in stabilizing our supply chain operations and driving savings behind our cost mitigation initiatives.\nBased on our updated full year estimate, we expect our gross margin in the fourth quarter to be 19% to 21%. That's down sequentially from the 23% we delivered in the third quarter and reflects, in part, our usual gross margin seasonality. It also includes the impact of significantly higher costs held in finished goods inventory that were produced during the third quarter. These costs were driven by incremental costs and inefficiencies associated with very high levels of Omicron-related factory worker absenteeism in January and February that resulted in broad-based production disruptions. Since we typically hold 50 to 60 days of finished goods inventory, we'll realize these costs during our fiscal fourth quarter as that inventory is sold.\n[Below] gross margin, we expect our SG&A expenses in the fourth quarter to step up to $105 million to $110 million as we continue to invest in the design and build of our new ERP system. We expect equity earnings, excluding the impact of any mark-to-market adjustments, will remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs in both Europe and the U.S.\nFor the year, we continue to expect interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the senior notes that we redeemed in the second quarter, total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and an effective tax rate of approximately 22%. We've reduced our estimate for capital expenditures to $325 million from our previous target of $450 million to reflect the timing of expenditures related to our capacity expansion projects in Idaho and China.\nSo in sum, in the third quarter, we delivered solid sales growth and expanded our gross margins behind our pricing actions and our cost mitigation efforts. For the year, we're targeting the upper end of our previous gross margin range due to our confidence in our pricing execution to offset inflation. The more clarity that we now have on our potato costs and the steady progress that we're making in stabilizing labor in our supply chain. Now here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying I am proud of how our Lamb Weston manufacturing, supply chain and commercial teams are continuing to take the right operating steps to manage through this challenging business environment. We're on track to deliver on our targets for the year, and we remain committed to investing to support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term. Thank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, VP, Investor Relations of Lamb Weston. Please go ahead.\n\nDexter P. Congbalay\n\nVP of IR, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Lamb Weston's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. This morning, we issued our earnings press release, which is available on our website, lambweston.com.\nPlease note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.\nSome of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our earnings release.\nWith me today are Tom Werner, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Tom will provide some comments on our performance as well as an overview of the current operating environment. Bernadette will then provide details on our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\nWith that, let me now turn the call over to Tom.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Dexter. Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. We're pleased with the improvement in our manufacturing and supply chain operations as well as the progress in our financial performance in the quarter, and I'm proud of how Lamb Weston team has been able to navigate through this difficult macro environment. We generated strong sales, and solid demand across our food away-from-home channels drove volume growth, and the initial benefits of our recent pricing actions began to offset inflationary pressures. In addition, our efforts to stabilize our manufacturing operations are on track, including increasing staffing in our processing plants to improve production run rates and throughput.\nTogether, our sales and operating momentum drove sequential gross margin improvement in the quarter and have us well positioned to better manage the upcoming cost pressures from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop in the Pacific Northwest. While our operations and financial results are not yet where we want them to be, we're on track to deliver our financial targets for the year, and our investments in capacity and productivity will get us well positioned to deliver higher margins and sustainable growth over the long term.\nBefore Bernadette gets into some of the specifics of our second quarter results and outlook, let's briefly review the current operating environment, starting with demand.\nIn the U.S., overall fry demand and restaurant traffic in the quarter remained solid, especially at quick service restaurants where demand has continued to be strong and above pre-pandemic levels. Traffic at full-service restaurants during the quarter was also solid but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Restaurant traffic, though, has softened recently as the spread of COVID variants have tempered consumer demand for on-premise dining and as restaurants closed temporarily due to staff shortages. While we expect that COVID wave will continue to temper demand for on-premise dining in the near term, we do not anticipate that it will have a meaningful effect on traffic or demand at QSRs. Demand at noncommercial outlets also improved during the quarter but continued to be below pre-pandemic levels. As with on-premise dining, we expect the spread of COVID variants will affect near-term demand.\nThe fry attachment rate in the U.S., which is the rate at which consumers order fries when visiting a restaurant or other food service outlets, continue to be above pre-pandemic levels. This served to support our out-of-home fry demand in the quarter. The increase in the fry attachment rate has been fairly consistent since the beginning of the pandemic, and we do not see that changing in the near term. Fry demand in U.S. retail channels in the quarter was up mid-teens from pre-pandemic levels, and we anticipate it will remain strong in the near term as the pandemic continues to affect demand in out-of-home channels.\nNow outside the U.S. Demand in Asia and Oceania has been solid, although the lack of shipping containers and disruptions to ocean freight networks continues to hinder our ability to fully serve our customers in these markets. Demand in Europe, which is served by our Lamb Weston/Meijer joint venture, has also been solid, although consumer reaction and the effect of recently imposed government lockdowns may reverse some of the recovery in restaurant traffic and fry demand in the near term.\nSo overall, we're encouraged by the resiliency of demand and the long-term trends for the category but expect that there will be some near-term softness with another COVID wave in the U.S. and our key international markets.\nWith respect to pricing, we're making good progress in implementing recent pricing actions to manage input cost inflation. In the second quarter, we began to see the initial benefits of the price increases that took effect in the summer in our Foodservice and Retail segments as well as in some of our international businesses. We expect the benefit of these prices will continue to build as the year progresses. In December, we began implementing another round of pricing actions in our Foodservice and Retail segments. While these actions did not affect our second quarter results, we'll see a gradual benefit from them over the next 6 months.\nIn our Global segment, we saw some benefit of pricing actions in the second quarter but expect to see a greater impact during the back half of the year. This reflects price increases related to contract renewals as well as the benefit of price escalators for most of the global contracts that are not up for renewal this year. We expect these price increases across our business segments will, in aggregate, mitigate much but not all of our cost inflation pressures. We will continue to assess the pace and scope of further cost inflation, and we may take further price actions as the year progresses.\nWith respect to costs, input cost inflation remains the primary driver to the increase in our cost per pound in the quarter. Commodity and transportation costs were each up double digits, and we expect that trend will continue through fiscal 2022, especially as our raw potato costs significantly increased in the second half of the year. Outside of cost inflation, we're making good progress to stabilize our supply chain in order to improve cost, production run rates and throughput.\nWe've taken actions to simplify our manufacturing processes and drive savings through a series of productivity initiatives, eliminating underperforming SKUs and increasing potato utilization rates. Importantly, after making changes to how we staff production crews, compensation and other incentives, we steadily reduced our staffing shortfall. We're working to continue this positive trend but realize it's difficult in a very challenging labor environment. The pending implementation of government-mandated COVID testing and vaccine regulations may also slow our progress and that of our suppliers in attracting and retaining workers in the near term.\nNow turning to the crop. The yields and quality of the potato crops in our primary growing regions in the Columbia Basin, Idaho, and Alberta are well below average due to the extreme heat over the summer. Similar to prior years, we had contracted with farmers to purchase potatoes to meet our production needs, assuming an average crop year. But because of the extreme heat, the contracted acres yielded fewer potatoes, and the quality is also poor. As a result, we're purchasing our remaining potato needs in the open market to meet our production forecast. We were able to reduce the number of potatoes we'd otherwise have been required to purchase in the open market by successfully partnering with our customers to secure changes product specifications.\nGiven that raw potato supply is tight and that fry demand has largely recovered, we've been purchasing open potatoes at a premium to contracted potato prices. When possible, we've been securing them from our nearby growing regions, but we have also transported potatoes from the Midwest and Eastern North America which results in increased transportation costs. We included an estimate of these additional costs in our updated earnings outlook. We'll begin to see more of the financial impact of this year's poor crop, including the high cost of open market potatoes in our third quarter results.\nSo in summary, we feel good about our financial and operating progress in the quarter. The overall demand environment is solid but may soften in the near term due to another COVID wave, and we're pulling the right pricing and operating levers to manage through this challenging environment.\nLet me now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the details of our second quarter results and updated fiscal 2022 outlook.\n\nBernadette M. Madarieta\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and good morning, everyone. As Tom discussed, we're pleased with our progress in the quarter. We generated strong sales and solid demand across our restaurant and foodservice channels in North America, drove volume growth, and we implemented pricing actions. We believe our pricing and cost-mitigation actions have us positioned to navigate through this difficult operating environment and to support sustainable profitable growth over the long term.\nSpecifically, in the quarter, sales increased 12% to a little over $1 billion. This is only the fourth time in Lamb Weston's history that we topped $1 billion of sales in a quarter. Sales volumes were up 6%. Volume growth was driven by our Foodservice segment, which reflects the continued year-over-year recovery in on-premise dining and by strong shipments to our large chain restaurant customers in North America that is served by our Global segment. Sales volumes of branded products in our Retail segment were also up in the quarter, but the segment's overall volume declined due primarily to lower shipments of private label products.\nWhile our overall volume growth in the quarter was strong, it was tempered by industry-wide upstream and downstream supply chain constraints, including delays in the availability of spare parts, edible oils and other key materials to our factories as well labor shortages, which impacted production run rates and throughput at our processing plant.\nIn our Global segment, volume growth was also tempered by the limited availability of shipping containers and disruptions at ports and in ocean freight networks. We expect these production and logistics challenges as well as the near-term impact of COVID variants to limit our volume growth through at least the end of fiscal 2022.\nPrice/mix was up 6% as we realized benefits from our previously announced pricing actions in each of our 4 segments. As a reminder, we began implementing product pricing actions in the first quarter as the primary lever to offset inflationary cost pressures, and it generally takes a couple of quarters before these actions are fully realized in the marketplace. We've also taken actions to more frequently change the freight rates that we charge to customers, so they better reflect market rates. Historically, we only adjusted these rates once or twice a year. Most of the increase in price/mix in the quarter reflects these product and freight pricing actions with favorable mix providing only a modest benefit.\nGross profit in the quarter declined $18 million as the benefit of increased sales was more than offset by higher manufacturing and transportation costs on a per-pound basis. Double-digit inflation for commodities and transportation costs accounted for almost 90% of the increase in cost per pound. Of the 2, commodities played a bigger role and were again led by edible oils, including canola oil, which nearly doubled versus the prior year quarter; ingredients, such as wheat and starches used to make batter; and other coatings and containerboard and plastic film for packaging.\nFreight costs rose, especially for ocean freight and trucking, as global logistics networks continued to struggle. Our costs also increased due to an unfavorable mix of higher cost trucking versus rail in order to meet service obligations for certain customers.\nAs Tom mentioned, we also incurred higher cost per pound versus the prior year due to incremental costs and inefficiencies driven by lower production run rates and throughput at our factories which resulted in fewer pounds to cover fixed overhead. Lost production days and unplanned downtimes were primarily due to labor shortages across our manufacturing network, including COVID-related absenteeism.\nWhile the cost drivers in the first 2 quarters of the year have been largely consistent, in the second quarter, we began to realize the initial benefits of the pricing and cost-mitigation actions that we discussed during our last earnings call. As a result of these efforts, gross margin increased sequentially versus the first quarter by 500 basis points to more than 20%. While pricing actions provided the larger lift to the sequential improvement to gross margins, our production run rates and throughput improved sequentially, primarily due to our efforts to stabilize factory labor. While still lower than average, labor retention rates improved modestly versus the first quarter, and the number of new applicants has been steady. With more stability, we, in turn, drove more factory throughput.\nFinally, our actions to optimize our portfolio are also providing benefit. We've eliminated underperforming SKUs to simplify our portfolio and increase throughput in our factories. We've also successfully partnered with our large customers to secure changes to product specifications to mitigate a portion of the operating impact of the poor quality of this year's potato crop.\nIn short, while our run rate and cost structure are not yet where we want them to be, we look forward to building on the notable sequential progress that we made in quarter and believe that we've positioned ourselves to manage through this challenging near-term increased cost and poor potato crop environment.\nMoving on from cost of sales. Our SG&A increased $7 million in the quarter, largely due to a couple of factors. First, it reflects higher labor and benefit costs and higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volumes. Second, it includes a $2.5 million increase in advertising and promotional expenses as we stepped up support for our retail products. While these expenses are up compared with the prior year, they are still below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe increase in SG&A was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses associated with improving our commercial and supply chain operations as those consulting projects ended as well fewer expenses in the current quarter related to the design of a new enterprise resource planning system. We had approximately $2 million of ERP-related expenses in the quarter, which consisted primarily of consulting expenses. That's down from about $5 million of similar-type expenses in the prior year quarter. We're resuming our efforts in the second half of fiscal 2022 to design the next phase of our new ERP system.\nDiluted earnings per share in the quarter was $0.22, down $0.44. About $0.28 of the decline was related to costs associated with the redemption and write-off of previously unamortized debt issuance costs related to the senior notes that were originally issued in connection with our spin-off from ConAgra in November 2016. We identified these costs as items impacting comparability in our non-GAAP results. Excluding the impact of these items, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.50, which is down $0.16 due to lower income from operations and equity method earnings.\nMoving to our segments. Sales for our Global segment were up 9% in the quarter. Price/mix was up 5%, reflecting a balance of higher prices charged for freight, pricing actions associated with customer contract renewals and inflation-driven price escalators. Volume was up 4%. Higher shipments to large chain restaurant customers in North America drove the volume increase, while logistics constraints temper our international shipments. Overall, the Global segment's total shipments continued to trend above pre-pandemic levels. Global's product contribution margin, which is gross profit less A&P expenses, declined 13% to $81 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound more than offset the benefit of favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes.\nMoving to our Foodservice segment. Sales increased 30% with volume, up 22%; and price/mix, up 8%. The ongoing recovery in demand from small and regional restaurant chains and independently owned restaurants as well as from noncommercial customers drove the increase in sales volumes. The initial benefits of product and freight pricing actions that we began implementing earlier this fiscal year as well favorable mix drove the increase in price/mix. Foodservice's product contribution margin rose 19% to $104 million as favorable price/mix and higher sales volumes more than offset higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound.\nMoving to our Retail segment. Sales increased 1%. Price/mix increased 5%, reflecting the initial benefits of pricing actions in our branded portfolio, higher prices charged for freight and improved mix. Sales volume declined 4% as an increase in branded product volume was more than offset by lower shipments of private label products, resulting from incremental losses of certain low-margin business. Retail shipments in the quarter were also tempered by the industry-wide supply chain constraints and production disruptions that I discussed earlier. Retail's product contribution margin declined 29% to $21 million. Higher manufacturing and distribution cost per pound, a $2 million increase in A&P expenses and lower sales volumes drove the decline.\nMoving to our liquidity position and cash flow. Our liquidity position remained strong. We ended the first half of fiscal 2022 with almost $625 million of cash and $1 billion of availability on our undrawn revolver. In the first half, we generated more than $205 million of cash from operations. That's down about $110 million versus the first half of the prior year due primarily to lower earnings.\nDuring the first half of the year, we spent nearly $150 million in capital expenditures as we continued construction of our chopped and formed expansion in American Falls, Idaho, and our new processing lines in American Falls in China. We continue to put significant effort into managing certain material equipment and labor availability issues to keep our capital projects on track.\nIn the first half of the year, we returned $145 million to shareholders, including nearly $70 million in dividends and $76 million of share repurchases. This includes $50 million of share repurchases in the second quarter alone. Last month, we announced a 4% increase in our quarterly dividend rate, which equates to approximately $144 million annually and a $250 million increase to our current share repurchase plan, reflecting our confidence in the long-term potential of our business. As a result, we have about $344 million authorized for share repurchases under the updated plan.\nAs I referenced earlier, during the quarter, we redeemed and issued nearly $1.7 billion of senior notes. In doing so, our average debt maturity increased from 4 years to more than 7 years, and we reduced our annual interest expense by approximately $8.5 million.\nWe remain committed to our capital allocation priorities: first, to reinvest in our business, both organically and with M&A; and then to return free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.\nNow turning to our updated outlook. We continue to expect our full year sales growth in fiscal 2022 to be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits. In the third quarter, we anticipate price/mix will be up sequentially versus the 6% increase that we delivered in the second quarter as the benefit of previously announced product pricing actions in each of our core segments continues to build. We expect volume growth in the third quarter will decelerate sequentially versus the 6% we delivered in second quarter as a result of the near-term impact of COVID variants on restaurant traffic and demand, the macro industry supply chain constraints and labor challenges that will continue to affect production run rates and throughput in our factories and global logistics disruptions and container shortages that affect both domestic and export shipments. We expect further deceleration in the fourth quarter as we begin to lap some of the higher-volume comparisons from the prior year.\nWith respect to earnings, we continue to expect net income and adjusted EBITDA, including joint ventures, will be pressured through fiscal 2022, reflecting significantly higher potato costs in the second half of the year, resulting from the poor crop; double-digit inflation for key production inputs and freight; and higher SG&A expenses.\nFor the full year, we expect our gross margin will be 600 to 700 basis points below our pre-pandemic margin rate of 25% to 26%, implying a target range of 18% to 20%. That's a change from the 17% to 21% range that we provided in our previous outlook. We narrowed the range for a number of reasons. First, we're confident about the pace and execution of the product and freight price increases that we are implementing in the market. Second, we expect to build upon the incremental progress that we made in the second quarter to stabilize our supply chain operations and drive savings behind our cost-mitigation initiatives. However, we expect that the improvement in our run rate, throughput and costs will continue to be gradual, reflecting the broader macro challenges facing the labor market that will likely persist through fiscal 2022. And third, we have greater clarity on the net cost impact from this year's exceptionally poor potato crop. As a reminder, we'll begin to realize the full financial impact of this year's poor potato crop in the third quarter and will continue to realize its effect through most of the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nBelow gross margin, we expect our SG&A expenses to step up $100 million to $110 million in the third and fourth quarters as we begin to design the second phase of our new ERP project. Equity earnings will likely remain pressured due to input cost inflation and higher manufacturing costs, both in Europe and the U.S.\nWe expect our interest expense to be approximately $110 million, excluding the $53 million of costs associated with the redemption of the senior notes in the second quarter. We previously estimated interest expense to be approximately $115 million.\nOur estimates for total depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $190 million and effective tax rate of approximately 22% and capital expenditures of approximately $450 million remains unchanged.\nSo in sum, we're seeing the benefit of our pricing actions which drove the sequential improvement in our top line and gross margin in the quarter. Along with our pricing actions, we're on track with our other cost-mitigation initiatives, positioning us to manage through the impact of the very poor crop. And finally, for fiscal 2022, we continue to expect net sales growth will be above our long-term target of low to mid-single digits, and we have enough clarity in our sales and cost outlook to narrow our previous target gross margin rate.\nNow here's Tom for some closing comments.\n\nThomas P. Werner\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bernadette. Let me just quickly reiterate our thoughts on the quarter by saying we are pleased with our progress in the quarter, and we're taking the right steps on pricing actions and in our supply chain operations to navigate through this difficult operating environment. We are on track to deliver on our targets for the year, and we believe we're on a path to get back to pre-pandemic profit levels after we get past the impact of the poor crop in the first half of fiscal 2023 and remain committed to investing support growth and create value for our stakeholders over the long term.\nThank you for joining us today, and we're now ready to take your questions."

Joining me today are Mike Smith, our President and CEO, and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer. Let me now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nThank you, Debbie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our global teams are embracing and executing our Focus to Win strategy, strengthening customer partnerships, and driving cost savings. I want to thank the team for their ongoing dedication and solid execution. As I reflect on the first half of the fiscal year, we are building momentum in the business and addressing areas of opportunity. Business turnarounds are not linear, but we are pleased with the progress we are making. Specifically, we are seeing top-line strength as we focus on customer relationships, which has led to share gains. Volume growth was up 8% in Q2 and 7% for H1 of the year. To keep up with customer demand and ensure we maintain high customer fill rates, we are reopening previously curtailed capacity in North America.\n\nNorth America, the largest segment of our business, is in a solid position. As we partner with customers and deliver on consumer insights, the team is leaning into Lamb Weston's history of quality, innovation, and value, which has resulted in several new item launches. Our cost savings plan is well on its way, and we expect to deliver our target for the year. But equally as important, we are building a culture of continuous improvement within the organization that will unlock future opportunity and strengthen us competitively. And we are reducing volatility with customer contracting and raw procurement strategies. That being said, it remains a dynamic macroeconomic and competitive environment, especially across international. But in this changing market, we have clear and accountable plans to control the controllables, as we work to deliver long-term profitable growth for Lamb Weston and improve returns for our shareholders.\n\nFinally, we are managing our capital efficiently. We are delivering strong free cash flow, and our capital spending is down. In addition, we repurchased $40 million of shares during Q2. And finally, in line with our long-standing commitment to returning cash to shareholders and in keeping with our annual dividend increase since becoming a public company, the board approved a 3% increase to the quarterly dividend. Five months after unveiling our Focus to Win plan, we are making solid progress. We are winning with customers as we focus on the principles that made Lamb Weston the industry gold standard: category-leading innovation, exceptional products, and customer-centric partnerships. There is meaningful opportunity ahead of us. Strengthening customer partnerships is the cornerstone of our strategy and where we have spent much of our time the last several months. We continue to drive momentum, retention, and wins.\n\nI, along with our teams, are meeting with our global customers during what remains a dynamic consumer environment globally. Our goal is to drive true partnership in service, joint business planning, menu innovation, and importantly, how we can grow together. We have line of sight to volume growth for the balance of the year. We ended the second quarter with more than 90% of our open contracted volume negotiations concluded, including all material contracts. By the end of calendar 2025, we will have completed negotiations on the vast majority of our large chain contracts, supporting our customers with price and trade. We have gained share, including with new and growing customers. Bernadette will speak in more detail about restaurant traffic trends, but our customer success has allowed us to increase volume this year despite soft traffic.\n\nTo maintain our high service levels and customer fill rate standards, we restarted North American lines that were previously curtailed. This production began late in second quarter and includes additional production lines to what we discussed during our first quarter call. With the capacity being introduced into our market and our network, capacity utilization rates in our North America facilities are returning to more optimal levels versus the very high utilization rates we recently experienced. We are benefiting from our global footprint. While North America accounts for approximately 90% or more of our profitability, the international markets are estimated to represent 75% of the global industry volume growth through 2030. This is an attractive opportunity that we are well positioned to capitalize on.\n\nOur global manufacturing footprint and supply chain network enable us to partner with existing and new customers around the world, capturing volume in fast-growing markets such as Asia and Latin America. Our global footprint enables us to partner with the largest customers around the world, tap into faster-growing markets, and leverage global manufacturing supply chain to diversify supply and risk. In the near term, and as we discussed during our first quarter call, the international environment remains competitive. In Europe, a strong potato crop has coincided with softer restaurant traffic and lower export demand due to localization of recently added production in other regional markets. Our European business is also more open and less contracted, which contributes to pricing pressure. While there has been some recent consolidation in the market, it is too early to assess its impact.\n\nIn Latin America, where there are few established players, we're building a strong foundation for long-term growth. Our new facility in Argentina is already producing and qualifying product for key customers. The region's market is growing quickly, and as we scale, we expect to capture meaningful share and strengthen our position as a preferred supplier. We are actively working to rebalance supply and demand within our network, better leveraging underutilized assets and ensuring we have the right assets globally in the right places to serve customers in our priority markets and channels. Shifting to our achieving executional excellence, our cost savings initiatives are on track. As part of these efforts, we are building a truly global supply chain with the customer at the center of everything we do.\n\nManufacturing and the centers of excellence are working as one, delivering improvements in run rates, safety, and becoming better aligned on how we measure ourselves and how our customers measure us. In addition, we are investing in tools that will help improve our demand and supply planning as we optimize our supply chain. Innovation is another core pillar of our Focus to Win strategy. Internationally, we have launched our new Snap Fries, which is our crispy fast fry, an innovation that allows for crispy and fast oven preparation. Our testing of this product is ongoing, and we've had early success expanding with airline customers. This innovative product opens additional market opportunities to sell hot, crispy, and delicious fries where we couldn't in the past.\n\nFinally, a quick update on the crop, which is consistent with the update we provided with first quarter earnings and demonstrates the focus we have on planning our North America raw needs. We've completed the harvest, and we are processing from storage across our growing regions in both North America and Europe. Overall, yields were above average, and quality was average in both North America and Europe. I will now turn the call over to Bernadette to review the quarter and our outlook.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'm starting on slide 11. Second quarter net sales increased 1%, including a $24 million benefit from foreign currency translation. On a constant currency basis, net sales were essentially flat versus last year. Volume rose 8%, driven by customer wins, share gains, and strong retention, especially in North America and Asia. This growth came despite softer restaurant traffic, which speaks to the strength of our customer partnerships and execution. In the US, QSR traffic was flat over the trailing three-month period of August, September, and October. Within that, QSR chicken grew, while QSR burger traffic was down 3%, improving slightly in October. French fry volume in North America food service was up slightly over the same three-month period, reflecting continued demand resilience. Internationally, restaurant traffic in most markets declined, including the UK, our largest international market, which was down about 3%.\n\nEven so, our teams delivered growth in this environment, which is a testament to their focus and execution. Price mix declined 8% at a constant currency, primarily due to the carryover and current year impact of price and trade to support customers, as well as mix shifts towards lower margin sales. To summarize, we delivered strong growth and held net sales essentially flat in a tough traffic environment, positioning us well as we move into the second half. Looking at our segments, North America net sales were essentially flat compared with the prior year. Volume increased 8%, supported by recent customer contract wins and share gains. Price mix declined 8%, reflecting the carryover and current year impact of price and trade to support our customers and unfavorable mix. In our international segment, net sales increased 4%, including a favorable foreign currency impact of $23 million.\n\nAt constant currency rates, net sales declined 1%. Volume grew 7%, while price mix at constant currency declined 8%, primarily due to pricing actions in key international markets to support customers and unfavorable mix. Asia, including China, once again led our volume growth in the quarter, and volume also grew with multinational chain customers. In Europe, a strong crop and soft restaurant traffic has pressured pricing as incremental industry capacity in local regional markets has reduced exports. We have taken steps to support our customers with price and trade and expect these actions will continue through fiscal 2026. At the same time, we're actively working to rebalance supply and demand, ensuring we have the right assets in the right places to serve our customers in our priority markets. In Latin America, we continue to ramp up production at our new facility in Argentina.\n\nAs we mentioned last quarter, it will take time to reach target utilization levels as we qualify lines and bring on new customers. During this ramp-up, fixed costs will be spread over lower production volumes, resulting in higher cost per pound for the remainder of the year. While reaching optimal production will take time, we see this as a significant opportunity to drive volume growth and margin expansion over the coming years. Let's now turn to profitability, where we continue to see the benefits of our cost savings initiatives and disciplined execution, even as we navigate mix and pricing headwinds. On Slide 12, as expected, Adjusted EBITDA declined $9 million compared to last year to $286 million. Adjusted gross profit was in line with expectations, down $16 million, year over year, primarily due to unfavorable price mix.\n\nThis was partially offset by higher sales volume, benefits from our cost savings initiatives, and lower total manufacturing cost per pound. Our cost saving efforts are not only reducing costs, but also improving processes and efficiencies across our operations, positioning us well for the future. Input costs outside of raw potato prices increased in the quarter, driven by tariffs, labor, fuel, power, water, and transportation rates. While agreements in principle for palm oil tariff exemptions from Indonesia and Malaysia are in place, they have not yet been finalized, so we continue to forecast these expenses. Adjusted SG&A expenses declined $8 million versus the prior year quarter, reflecting benefits from our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by compensation and benefit accruals.\n\nAdjusted equity method investment earnings was $3 million, a decline of $8 million as a result of lower production volume and an unfavorable mix of sales at our joint venture in Minnesota. Overall, while we faced headwinds from price mix and input cost inflation outside of potatoes, we delivered solid volume growth and meaningful cost savings. Turning to segment EBITDA performance on slide 13, adjusted EBITDA in our North America segment increased 7%, or $19 million versus the prior year quarter, to $288 million. This growth reflects strong execution, including higher sales volume and lower manufacturing cost per pound, driven by raw potato deflation and benefits from our cost savings initiatives. These improvements were partially offset by price and trade to support our customers. In our international segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $21 million to $27 million.\n\nThis reflects price and trade to support our customers, as well as higher manufacturing cost per pound. These costs include startup expenses associated with ramping up our new Latin America production facility in Argentina, an increased factory burden, and other costs in Latin America and Europe as we work to rebalance supply and demand and manage inventories. Importantly, these costs were partially offset by the benefit of our cost savings initiatives and higher sales volumes. Moving to liquidity and cash flows on slide 14, our liquidity and cash position remained strong. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.43 billion of liquidity, including approximately $1.35 billion available under our revolving credit facility and $83 million of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nOur net debt was $3.6 billion, and our adjusted EBITDA to net debt leverage ratio was 3.1x on a trailing 12-month basis, consistent with our commitment to maintaining a solid balance sheet. In H1 fiscal 2026, we generated $530 million of cash from operations. That's up $101 million versus last year, driven by favorable working capital changes, primarily lower inventories in North America and higher earnings. Free cash flow was strong at $375 million. Capital expenditures were $156 million in H1, down $331 million from last year as we completed major growth investments and facility expansions. Looking ahead, we expect fiscal 2026 capital expenditures to come in below the $500 million target, reflecting disciplined investment and a continued focus on sustaining performance. Turning to slide 15, we remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders.\n\nDuring the first half of the year, we returned over $150 million, including $103 million in cash dividends and $50 million of stock repurchases. This includes approximately $40 million in stock repurchased in Q2. We have $308 million remaining under our current repurchase authorization, and year to date, we've repurchased sufficient shares to offset the expected equity plan dilution. In addition, today, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.38 per share. Our capital allocation priorities remain clear. We're investing in the business and its capabilities, focusing on areas that differentiate Lamb Weston and support the execution of our strategy. At the same time, we aim to maintain a strong balance sheet and opportunistically return capital to shareholders with dividends and share repurchases. Let's now turn to the outlook on slide 16.\n\nWe are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 outlook, which includes the contribution of a 53rd week in the fourth quarter. For the balance of the year, we expect continued volume growth and strong sales momentum, and we are on track towards delivering the high end of our sales guidance range. North America remains solid, with second-half volumes expected to grow at or above first-half rates, supported by strong demand and a vast majority of our contract negotiations being complete. International volumes in the second half are expected to be flat year over year as we lap prior year customer wins. As anticipated, price mix will remain unfavorable at constant currency in the second half, but to a lesser extent than the first half.\n\nIn North America, year-over-year price declines are expected to ease compared to what we saw in the first half, while the shift towards lower-margin restaurant customers and private label retail customers is likely to persist. In our international markets, we anticipate continued headwinds from softer restaurant traffic, added capacity, and a strong COP. On margins, we expect adjusted gross margin in the second half to be flat to down versus the first half's 20.4%, reflecting price mix dynamics and higher manufacturing costs internationally, including ramp-up costs in Argentina and underutilization in Europe as we work to rebalance supply and demand. Adjusted SG&A is expected to continue to benefit from cost savings initiatives, though in the second half, we anticipate incremental investments in innovation, advertising, and promotions to support our long-term strategic plan, as well as an extra week of expenses in the fourth quarter.\n\nOur full-year tax rate is projected at 28% to 29%, with second-half rates in the low 20s. To summarize, given the price mix dynamics and higher manufacturing costs in our international segment, we believe maintaining our Adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion is the most prudent approach. We currently expect to finish closer to the midpoint. We remain confident in delivering strong results for the year, supported by strong volume performance and progress under our cost savings initiatives. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to Mike. Thank you, Bernadette. In closing, we are driving and expect to continue driving volume growth, share gains, and customer momentum. Our customers are turning to Lamb Weston for the quality, innovation, and value for which we are known. Our team is embracing and executing our Focus to Win strategy, including delivering our cost savings program targets.\n\nWe are optimizing our global supply chain, restarting curtailed production in North America, and working to rebalance supply and demand globally. We are generating strong free cash flow and are increasing our quarterly dividend 3%. We are focused on executing our strategy and delivering good results for the year. With that, Bernadette and I are happy to take your questions. Thank you. If you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. If you're joining us today using a speakerphone, please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment. Again, that is star one if you would like to signal with questions. The first question comes from Tom Palmer with JPMorgan. Good morning, and thanks for the question. Bernadette. Morning, Tom. You made a comment in the prepared remarks about rebalancing supply and demand.\n\nIt sounded like a temporary pullback in production is anticipated in Europe. In the US, last year, there was a plant closure and lines curtailed. I'm just wondering, should we start thinking about similar actions in Europe coming into play, so something more substantial than maybe reducing shifts, or are there other actions that can be taken to kind of aid this rebalance? Thanks. Hey, Tom, I'll take the first part of that and then let Bernadette comment further. As we said, we've restarted some of those curtailed lines that we have previously curtailed in North America, driven by the strong volume. We have also communicated to our employees that we are curtailing a single line in our European market as well. So we are looking across our global supply chain and making sure that we're taking the right approaches to balance that supply and demand globally. Okay.\n\nThanks for that. And then just as we think about understanding the commentary, I guess, in Europe on some of the pressures, but I did want to maybe focus on North America a bit. As we think about some of the, I guess, volume drivers in the back half and some of the less investment in price relative to the first half, should we start to see in Q3, for instance, more of a seasonal uptick in North America, or are there items maybe there to consider? Yes. So thanks, Tom. As it relates to North America, a big piece that we need to consider is that it's not only price, but a large component of this is mix.\n\nIn North America, we are seeing a higher proportion of our business with multinational chain customers, as well as we are seeing in our retail channel a shift from branded to more private label. So that is what we would expect to continue in the back half of the year, which will affect gross margins as we move forward and is also contributing to what we shared in our prepared remarks of the 20.4% or relatively flat gross margins in the back half of the year relative to the first half. Understood. Thank you. And the next question will come from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Hey, good morning, Mike and Bernadette. Thanks for the question. Mike, I maybe wanted to actually pick up on the international side. I believe in your prepared remarks, you kind of walked through the dynamics in Europe and Latin America.\n\nI didn't hear, and maybe I missed, but I didn't hear any commentary on Asia in particular, some of the Asia export markets. I think there's been a fair amount of trade press just around local competitors in the region, not only getting more competitive in home markets, but in some of your export markets throughout Asia. So I would just love to have an update from you there on kind of what you're seeing real-time and whether or not that competition has intensified since we spoke like three months ago. Yeah. Thanks, Peter. Let me speak to a few of those markets that you suggested. As Bernadette talked about some of the mixed shifts in our international markets, some of that is driven by strength that we are seeing in China as well as APAC.\n\nWhen you look at Europe, there's been a really strong crop, and it's resulted in lower cost raw. And that's on the backdrop of more depressed kind of traffic in those markets. When you look around the globe, there has been some added capacity in some of those developing markets, like you said, and that is putting more pressure on exports out of Europe into some of those markets, which has challenged the price there a little bit. But overall, we believe in the future of the international market. We believe that as we support our customers in those markets, we'll continue to drive growth. Argentina and Latin America is another strong area that has high growth rates, and we believe that having that asset down in that market will set us up for future success. Okay. Thanks, Mike, for that.\n\nBernadette, I mean, I think the flat to down commentary on the second half gross margin, does that hold for both quarters as well? If I look back at Lamb Weston, the history of Lamb Weston as a public company, like third quarter gross margins have been down versus the second quarter like twice, and it was during COVID, so I don't even know if we count that. So just want to understand if that comment is very much a second-half comment or if it also applies to the third quarter. Thanks very much. Yeah. Thanks, Peter. The comment that I made in my prepared remarks was definitely for the second half of the year, and then that being primarily driven by mix shifts and pricing headwinds as well as the ramp-up that we have in Argentina.\n\nSo while the normal seasonality is still underlying the business, in the second half, we're going to see some moderation on those typical seasonal trends, particularly flattening the third quarter seasonal increase in gross margins, and then we would expect the fourth quarter to step down from there. Got it. Okay. Thanks very much. And the next question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel. Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Bernadette, the outlook calls for moderating price mix drag in the second half in North America. A couple of follow-up questions there. In terms of pricing on this year's contracts, is that landing in line with the performance relative to last year? And if I go back to the initial guidance, price mix was expected to moderate to kind of a low single-digit headwind in North America.\n\nIs that still the right way to think about it, or has the mix impact caused that moderation to maybe lessen a bit? Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Matt. So first, I just want to start off with the strong momentum that we've had in the first half of the year, and North America being our most profitable segment is strong. We expected price mix to be down more in the first half of the year than the second, and we still expect that trend. And as you mentioned, it's just very important to note that the combination of both price and mix is what's affecting our North America segment. And that mixed impact has been more pronounced recently with the growth in more chain business as well as that mixed shift from branded products to private label. Thanks, Bernadette.\n\nAnd so when we think about that mixed headwind, is that a drag on performance through really this time next year, just given how the balance of the business has been performing? We'll need to continue to monitor that. Certainly, as it relates to our chain customers, that would continue. We'll continue to monitor whether the trend from branded to private label persists, but we would expect that to persist throughout the balance of this year. Thank you. I'll pass it on. And our next question will come from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Hey, thanks. I wanted to dig into the decision to reopen more of your capacity in North America. The wording was a little confusing in the prepared remarks. You said you did it because facilities are returning to more optimal levels versus the very high utilization rates recently experienced.\n\nSo are you saying that utilization rates got too high in first quarter? You need to reopen more of your production lines in order to get them lower? And is there any kind of negative impact to your profitability as a result of that or not? And then secondly, how long do you think this will persist? Is this a permanent decision or not? Yeah, Rob, appreciate the question. We've been focused on driving customer partnerships over the last several months. When you think about where we spend our time, it's around the customer and around driving out costs. And because of that, you are seeing the results of that hard work. Volume up 8% in the quarter. As you said, yeah, utilization rates in our North American facilities were in the low 90s as we grew that volume over the first half of the year.\n\nThey got to a level where we needed to open up this additional capacity to ensure that we continue to meet our customers' expectations regarding fill rates. The plants are running really well. As you have those lines start to run more frequently, you start to see better run rates, better OEEs, better potato utilization, which is all positive. So we don't expect a drag from a cost basis from turning those lines back on. Yeah, Rob, and if I could just add, the second comment or question that you had was related to the impact on margins. And in the first half, if you think about the results, we had higher fixed factory burden driven by North America in Q1. And then as we've restarted those lines in North America, we've seen that lessen, but more in international in Q2.\n\nIn the back half of the year, we would expect there to be a net positive from a factory burden perspective led by North America as that absorption improves with restarting those lines, but international is going to remain a headwind with Latin America and Europe continuing to carry incremental costs. Got it. And in terms of keeping these lines open, it's for the foreseeable future? It's not a temporary measure. Yeah. As we said in the prepared remarks, I think as I look at the full year, North America is in a solid position, and we're seeing more predictability. And so we plan on having these lines open as we continue to demonstrate our strength with our customers and the volume here in the North American market. Great. All right. Thank you. Thanks, Rob. And the next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Good morning, everyone.\n\nCan we ask how you're managing to improve execution through increased discipline, more accountability, and metrics? I know you talked about how when capacity utilization was very high in the last few years, it was very hard to get your arms around all of that. Obviously, you've taken a little bit of a pause on capacity utilization. It's now ramping up again. But what can you manage and monitor now that you maybe couldn't do a couple of years ago, and how is that helping your ability to execute and keep everything flowing smoothly? Thank you, and I'll pass it on. Yeah, I appreciate it, Alexia. There's a few things that are going on. One, as we've started our Focus to Win work and really focused on the executional excellence part in our cost savings program, we've put clear accountabilities in place across our supply chain.\n\nWe are now measuring ourselves and certain KPIs in a number of different areas, and really focused on delivering those at the plant level. We've had AlixPartners, who participated in some of the work with us, have helped us put together the right scorecarding and the right tracking in place, and we look at that on a regular basis. We're also investing in additional support in our demand and supply planning to make sure that we execute on a better basis or a more accurate basis moving forward, that reduces or adds, I should say, better predictability in the business moving forward. Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. The next question will come from Max Gumport with BNP. Hey, great. Thanks for the question. Halfway through the year, half of the year left.\n\nI'm curious what scenarios you're seeing that could still push you to the lower half of your Adjusted EBITDA guidelines, and ask differently, what prevents you today from raising the low end of the range? Thanks very much. Yeah. Max, as I think about it, we're working really hard to deliver the commitments and the expectations that we've made. I think as you look at our overall business, we've delivered strong volume momentum. We've made meaningful changes to how we operate, both in our cost structure, but also in our operations overall, which we've talked about. I think restarting those curtailed lines in North America is a great sign, and that volume that we're seeing come through. So we're really proud of the accomplishments that we've made in such a short amount of time. That said, turnarounds are not linear.\n\nLike I said in the prepared remarks, we're navigating an ongoing competitive environment. We're seeing continued soft traffic. There's continued macroeconomic headwinds like everyone's facing. But I'll tell you, as I look at it for the full year, I think North America is in a really solid position, and we're seeing more predictability, as I said earlier. When I think about those international markets, they remain a bit more dynamic. We got to manage through that the right way. And you've heard us say this already. There was a good crop in Europe, which has led to lower costs in that market. There remains soft demand around traffic in those markets. And then as capacity has been built in some of those regions around the globe, there's less exports from Europe, which is creating some of the pressure in that market.\n\nThat's really where we're seeing the challenge in the future. Yeah. And Max, just to confirm, in the prepared remarks, we did say that we're expecting to be near the midpoint of that EBITDA range. And again, the factors being price mix headwinds as well as startup and ramp-up costs in Argentina, along with additional fixed factory burden from underutilization of the manufacturing capacity in Europe as we work to rebalance supply and demand. Great. And to follow up, I think obviously the shares are down meaningfully today. I think part of what's being reflected there is investor concern around if Lamb Weston is not able to raise the low end of the guidance today on EBITDA, what does that mean for 2027? Right, at lower half of the range is more likely than the remainder of 2026, then what does that imply for 2027?\n\nDoes it imply further EBITDA declines next year as well? Is there any commentary you can offer to push back against that, just given how the shares are performing right now? Thanks very much. Yeah. Here's what I'd say. Listen, we're working hard to deliver on our commitments and expectations, and I think we're taking prudence in our guidance to make sure that we deliver going forward. I'd say we're still early in the innings in our Focus to Win plan. We just rolled it out five months ago, and the traffic environment remains a bit challenged, but we believe in our strategy. We've had some great improvements around our business, especially in costs and also building those customer partnerships. A key element of improving our margin over the long term is going to be unlocking additional cost savings. We're well on our way this year.\n\nWe believe we have the right plan in place to continue to do that in the future, but we'll provide more details on what we think those margin targets will be once we're a little bit further along in our Focus to Win process. Yeah. And just to add, as Mike has said in the prepared remarks, North America is our most profitable segment, and it's in a solid position. There are some price mix headwinds in the back half of the year, and there are some incremental costs related to ramp-up but underutilization, and we've already provided an example of actions that we are taking to manage those costs. So for now, we expect to be closer to the midpoint, but very important to keep in mind that our most profitable segment, the North America segment, is very strong right now, and international, we're working through those dynamics.\n\nThanks very much. As a reminder, if you would like to signal with questions, please press star one on your touchtone telephone. Again, that is star one. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Scott Marks with Jefferies. Hey, good morning. Thanks so much for taking our questions. Wanted to ask a little bit about the price mix dynamic in North America. Specifically, you highlighted the mix impact of that headwind. As it relates to the other side of it, kind of the trade support component, wondering maybe how you're thinking about that in terms of where your support is right now for customers and whether or not you believe there's some incremental support warranted going forward, or are you comfortable with where levels are right now? Thanks. Yeah. I appreciate the question. Listen, we're really focused on driving those customer partnerships and driving the volume.\n\nYou saw that in the first half of the year. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, about 90% of those large chain contracts have been settled. We'll have the rest of our contracts get settled here over the next couple of weeks, and we feel good about where things are at. As we've gone through that RFP and contracting time period, there have been some customers where we have needed to defend some of the pricing to make sure that we succeed with those customers long term and keep those customers. And those are customers who are driving growth and having success in the marketplace. But as you said, I mean, the thing that I want to make sure is clear is that not all of this is price related. There is a mixed component of which Bernadette talked about.\n\nAnd a piece of that is mixed between customers within the restaurants, also mixed with some of those faster-growing QSRs, and also some mix in our retail side of the business as we're seeing a shift from branded to private label. But the predictability of our North America business is much better than it has been in the past. And just to make sure that in the prepared remarks, you did catch that we do expect in the second half for the price mix headwinds to moderate slightly as we lap the fiscal '25 pricing actions. So that's important to keep in mind as we look to the back half of the year. Understood. Thanks for the answer there.\n\nSecond question for me, maybe on prior calls. I think you had noted a significant amount of capacity in international markets or plans for international capacity that had been paused previously, but it sounds like today you're talking about there has been actually some added capacity. So wondering if you can just help us kind of square the two in terms of what happened with those projects that were previously paused. Thanks. Yeah. Listen, the pace of newly announced capacity has definitely slowed. I think what we've been speaking to is some of the capacity has been added over the course of the last year or so in some of those developing markets. But we believe that the industry is going to be rational over time. I probably am starting to sound a little bit like a broken record.\n\nAnd we'll continue to manage our supply chain footprint as we have in the past. We believe that when traffic returns, we're going to be well-positioned to benefit from that growth. But again, we have heard and continue to hear of postponements or delays or even cancellations in this market and believe that the environment will be rational. Understood. Thanks so much and happy holidays. Happy holidays. Thanks. And the next question will come from Mark Torrente with Wells Fargo Securities. Hey, good morning. Thank you for the questions. First, you called out visibility to volume growth in the back half with North America at or above the front half. Just want to get a sense of how much of that is driven by the 53rd week and how the underlying momentum is against tougher laps, and I guess what that could look like entering fiscal '27. Yeah.\n\nSo as it relates to our volume outlook, what we're expecting to see in the second half is that it will be relatively consistent other than the 53rd week. Again, that is based on the pace of increase in volumes that we've had with some of our chain customers in the first half of the year. As it relates to international, we expect it to be flat in the second half of the year compared with the prior year as we continue to navigate those dynamic markets. Yeah. And I've already shared a little bit about where, at the right time, we'll come back and talk about where we believe margin will be in the future, but we believe that our Focus to Win plan has us on track and to deliver growth.\n\nConsumption, if you look at it, is expected to be between 2% and 4% over the next, call it, five years or so. You're going to see that higher in emerging markets and lower in some of the more established markets. But I think as we've demonstrated in the first half of the year, we're implementing a strategy that positions us to gain share and really lean into some of those premium segments of the market. So we're really confident in our ability to grow volume with our customers even in a challenged environment or challenged traffic environment that we're seeing today. Okay. And then, yeah, on the traffic front, continues to be soft. Are you seeing anything in November, December that suggests any improvement or deterioration, and what are your expectations for trends over, say, the next 12 months? Yeah.\n\nI think we just saw the November data that was shared in prepared remarks, so nothing different from that. Great. Thank you. And the next question will come from Carla Casella with JPMorgan. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just wondering if you could give us a little more color in terms of where you think overall industry capacity for frozen spuds and if it varies dramatically by country or region. Yeah. I shared a little bit of that earlier. Like I said, we believe that the market's going to be rational over time. I probably sound like a broken record. I've said that in several calls over the last couple of quarters, but we have heard of delays and postponements. We have seen some capacity built in some of those developing markets, which is having an impact on exports out of Europe, especially given the low cost of raw.\n\nBut again, there's been some consolidation in the market, and we'll continue to see how that potentially impacts the future, but we believe that this industry is going to be rational and has been. We'll manage through it the right way as we are and as you've seen in the first half of the year. Okay. Great. I'm sorry to ask. I missed part of the early part, but thank you so much for going over that again. No problem. And the next question will come from William Reuter with Bank of America. Hi. Good morning. You've made some comments today about focusing on execution, working with your partners. It sounds like in some instances, maybe you're paying penalties or having to accept pricing that is lower than would be fair based upon your prior missteps, maybe some of the ERP challenges.\n\nI guess, do you believe that this is the case, and do you believe that over time, as you continue to have high fill rates, that you may be able to demand greater pricing from those customers? Yeah. I don't think that's the case at all. As we shared, we feel really good about where our North America business is at. In the current macroeconomic environment and with slower traffic or softer traffic, we're winning in the marketplace when it comes to volume. So our customers are turning to Lamb Weston because of that history of innovation, quality, consistency, and delivering on our service, and we're proving that. We spent a lot of time focused on our customers, and when you have the right focus, you see results. And that's what you're seeing in the marketplace right now and believe we'll continue to do that into the future.\n\nAs Bernadette mentioned, yes, price mix was down in our North America business, but it's important to keep in mind that a large sizable portion of that is from mix, which is driven by some of those shifts from branded to private label, and retail, as well as some shifts between QSR customers, or restaurant customers in the current traffic environment. Yeah. And to be clear, all pricing has been based on competitive market conditions. Got it. That makes sense. And then with the stock down, you're still below your 3.5x leverage target. How is this going to inform decisions on capital allocation and potential acceleration of share repurchases? Yeah. So our capital allocation priorities remain consistent with what I shared in my prepared remarks. We're focused on spending capital where we need to spend to deliver our strategy and our business.\n\nWe will always, as we have in the recent past, look at opportunistic share repurchases. Nothing will change there, but we're focused on delivering our capital allocation strategy, which includes investing in the business and returning cash to shareholders. Great. Happy holidays. Thanks. Happy holidays. Thanks. Happy holidays, everyone. Thank you. That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to Debbie Hancock. Thank you, Justin, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. The replay of the call will be available on our website later this afternoon. Have a great rest of your day and a happy holiday season. Thank you. Thank you. That does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation and have an excellent day."

Participating on the call today are John Gibson Gibson and Bob Schrader. [Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Bob Schrader, Paychex Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you for joining us to discuss Paychex First Quarter Fiscal 2026 results. This morning, we released our financial results for the quarter ended August 31, 2025. You can access our earnings release and presentation on our Investor Relations website. We plan to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC within the next couple of days. This conference call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Investor Relations portal.\nToday's call includes forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Gibson, Paychex President and CEO.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. I will start by sharing our first quarter business highlights, and then Bob will come back and discuss our financial results and outlook. And then, of course, we'll open it up for your questions.\nWe are off to a strong start in fiscal year '26, delivering robust 17% revenue growth and solid adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 5% in the first quarter. This performance reflects continued progress integrating Paycor and sustained demand for our HCM solutions amid a resilient small business environment. We remain pleased with the progress of the Paycor integration, we are on track to achieve targeted Paycor revenue synergies and exceed our initial cost synergy expectations.\nOur fiscal year '26 cost synergy target remained approximately $90 million. We are pursuing additional synergies beyond this target while retaining our flexibility to reinvest those gains for additional growth and innovation investments. Bringing the 2 companies together provides us a broader set of technology solutions and service models and retain business.\n[Audio Gap]\nBuilding on the momentum from Paycor, another quarter stone of our growth strategy is our long-standing relationships with channel partners, brokers, CPAs and banks are important referral sources for new business for us and have been for decades. The Partner Plus program for brokers continues to be received well with broker enrollment nearly doubling since our last earnings call in June. We believe this momentum provides a strong foundation to retain and expand this vital referral channel.\nThe program centers on helping brokers maximize client impact, grow their book of business and deliver exceptional service and advisory support. We remain confident our partner program is the best in the industry and we recently launched new marketing campaigns to further expand awareness and growth.\nBuilding on our long-standing partnership with the CPA community, we launched our new CPA Partner Pro portal in the quarter. We recently introduced another powerful Paychex Flex solution supporting small and midsized businesses and their CPAs. Bill Pay powered by Bill is our new financial management solution designed to simplify payments for SMBs. Bill Pay integrates payroll, HR and accounts payable into a seamless experience providing small business owners real-time financial clarity to make smarter and faster decisions.\nAdditionally, Bill Pay will enhance CPA's ability to support their clients by integrating critical payment and HR functions to deliver even more valuable insights. We plan to expand Bill Pay to include accounts receivable and roll that out in our additional platforms in the future.\nContinuing our track record of innovation, Paychex lead the digital and AI-driven transformation of the human capital management. We deliver pragmatic AI solutions that drive measurable value for our clients and our business. I'm excited to share several recent advancements that demonstrate how we are harnessing AI internally and externally to enhance client experiences, boost operational efficiency and we believe position Paychex for sustained growth. We recently expanded AI Insights, our generative AI assistant for workforce questions to serve our PEO clients in addition to our HCM clients. This AI-powered tool provides instant natural language insights on pay, equity, turnover, hiring trends and labor costs. Through an intuitive chat interface, users can query complex HR metrics drill down in the detailed analytics and follow-up questions to uncover deep insights and predictive trends. In June, we launched our degenerative AI-powered HR guidance tool developed using HR insights drawn from our nearly 40 million client interactions each year. This internal AI-enabled tool empowers our HR experts to deliver efficient, effective responses to client queries and provide enhanced client support. In addition, we have deployed AI tools across our organization, empowering our teams to focus on higher-value work while enhancing quality, efficiency and innovation.\nFor example, AI is augmenting our software engineering group by automating tasks, improving code quality and allowing us to accelerate our development. We are also piloting a genic AI solutions this quarter to transform some of our higher-volume inbound client task across multiple channels. These AI agents autonomously manage routine client interaction, enhancing operational efficiency and elevating the client experience, all while freeing up our service providers to focus on high-value advisory and support to our customers.\nOur PEO business continues to also perform well with another strong quarter of strong demand and retention performance, leading to mid-single-digit worksite employee growth. We remain bullish on PO due to our scale, capabilities and the growth opportunities we see. The PEO model empowers small businesses to offer benefits comparable to Fortune 500 companies, addressing one of the top challenges of attracting and retaining talent.\nTurning to the macro environment. small businesses remain resilient. Our small business employment watch shows stable employment and moderating wage inflation and has over the past year with no signs of recession. Since our last call, we've seen great clarity on key issues such as tariffs, taxes and inflation. With the tax bill in place and Fed rate cuts done, we believe this will support renewed business confidence. This clarity should encourage business owners, particularly those previously adopting a wait-and-see approach to make more informed strategic decisions, potentially boosting investment and hiring.\nLastly, I'm proud of the hard work demonstrated by our employees. Despite an ever-evolving external environment and the integration of our largest acquisition in the company's history, the team has remained focused on our clients and our purpose. Their dedication and efforts have been recognized once again this time by Newsweek, which named Paychex one of the America's greatest companies and most admired workplaces. Our people and our culture remain a key differentiator underscoring the vital role our employees play in driving our sustained success.\nI will now turn it over to Bob to provide an update on our financial results and outlook. Bob?\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, John. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter financial results and then share an update on our outlook for fiscal 2026.\nLet me begin by sharing our first quarter results. Total revenue increased 17% over the prior year to $1.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 21% to $1.2 billion primarily due to the addition of Paycor as well as higher revenue per client, driven by price realization and increased product penetration. Paycor contributed approximately 17% to Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 3% to $329 million, primarily driven by solid growth in the number of average PEO worksite employees. Outside of the at-risk plan headwinds, PEO continues to perform well. Interest on funds held for clients increased 27% to $48 million due to the inclusion of the Paycor balances. Total expenses increased 29% to $998 million, primarily driven by the Paycor acquisition.\nOperating income margins for the quarter were 35.2% and adjusted operating income margins were 40.7%. Diluted earnings per share decreased 10% to $1.06 per share our adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter increased 5% to $1.22. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.7 billion and total borrowings of approximately $5 billion as of August 31, 2025.\nCash flow from operations was [ $718 ] million for the first quarter, primarily driven by net income. We returned $549 million to shareholders during the quarter in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases. Our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 40%.\nLet me now turn to our updated guidance for the year, which assumes the current macro environment. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 outlook with the exception of our earnings expectation, which we are raising. Total revenue is still expected to grow between 16.5% and 18.5% and as we previously noted, we would expect revenue synergies to contribute 30 to 50 basis points of growth in fiscal 2026.\nManagement Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 20% to 22%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 8%. And as previously noted, we expect revenue to accelerate in the back half of the year as we anniversary the at-risk revenue growth headwinds we experienced last fiscal year.\nInterest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 43%. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. And as I mentioned, we are now raising our earnings expectations with adjusted diluted earnings per share now expected to grow between 9% and 11%, up from 8.5% to 10.5% that we shared with you last quarter.\nI'll provide you a little bit of color for the second quarter. We would anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 18% in Q2 with an adjusted operating margin of approximately 41%. And of course, this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. And with that, we will now open up the call for your questions."

This morning, we released our financial results for the quarter ended May 31, 2025. You can access our earnings release and presentation on our Investor Relations website.

I will start the call today by sharing key business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, and then Bob will discuss our financial results and outlook. We will then, of course, open it up for your questions. Given that the Paycor acquisition has closed and we have completed key integration activities to bring the 2 companies together we are now operating as 1 paycheck and not 2 different companies.\nOur comments today will reflect that fact. HX demonstrated solid performance this year against our strategic objectives, underscoring our unique ability to effectively navigate dynamic market conditions while continuing to enhance our customer experience and market position and also maintain our industry-leading operating margins. We delivered 10% revenue growth in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued execution across the business and the addition of Paycor.\nFor full fiscal year 2025, we achieved 6% revenue growth and 6% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We also delivered 60 basis points of adjusted operating income margin expansion in the face of significant ERTC headwinds. Our client retention rates increased year-over-year, underscoring the compelling value we provide as a trusted partner in our clients' growth and success. We grew the number of clients we serve to approximately 800,000 and increased the number of HR outsourcing worksite employees to 2.5 million this year.\nWe have made significant progress on the Paycor acquisition surpassing our expectations and setting a strong foundation for future success. Based upon our early progress on the integration and our increased understanding of the opportunities we have gained since closing. We are raising our cost synergy expectations to approximately $90 million in fiscal year '26. The actions we have already taken give us high confidence in achieving the synergies. In addition, we have identified a list of additional synergy opportunities that we are actively pursuing.\nWe also believe that there are additional opportunities to invest for future growth. and we will strategically accelerate those investments as the year progresses. We previously outlined to you the business unit structure, leadership continuity and retention of key pay core talent to mitigate integration risk. Customers are continuing to utilize their existing platform, minimizing the disruption to our client base.\nOur retention remains strong and the reception to the combined offerings has exceeded our expectations in their early days. I'll share some of the recent integration accomplishments and focus areas for fiscal year '26. During the quarter, we defined how our HCM platforms will generally serve our market segments moving forward. Paychex Flex will focus on companies with up to 99 employees, and the Paycor platform will target the upmarket enterprise segment above 100 employees.\nSurePayroll will continue to serve the small business do-it-yourself marketplace. This approach provides the market with the most comprehensive, flexible and innovative HCM solutions for organizations of all sizes and needs. We also completed a comprehensive territory assessment and reassignment review across the sales teams that aligns to these market segments.\nWe have expanded and optimized our sales coverage nationwide in the fourth quarter. Sales representatives who transition territories received comprehensive training on the complete suite of HCM solutions they can now offer. We are encouraged by how sales hiring, retention and tenure developments are trending going into the fiscal year.\nWhile all of these changes did create some internal disruption and took many of our sales resources out of the field for a portion of the fourth quarter, we believe now is the time to make these changes to best position us to win in the marketplace. With newly trained sales reps on our broad set of capabilities and solutions, realigned territories and a fully staffed sales team, we believe we are well positioned entering the new fiscal year. While we have made significant strides in integrating the teams, optimizing our go-to-market approach and capturing cost synergies, we're most enthusiastic about the opportunities for revenue synergies.\nWhile we expect to realize revenue synergies over the next several years, I'm pleased we have already secured our first Paycor customers on our ASO MPO and are seeing promising growth in our pipeline. Notably, the PO cell was referred by a Paycor broker, and this was even before we officially launched the product into the client base. We continue to believe the biggest opportunity is the cross-sell of Paychex retirement ASO and PEO solutions into the Paycor base of more than 50,000 clients.\nWe also believe there are opportunities to take core capabilities into the Paychex client base in the years ahead. We are pleased at how quickly our teams were able to complete the bulk of the backing integrations required to cross-sell into Paycor's base and realize these revenue synergies. We also remain excited about Paycor's embedded solution, which enables seamless integration of our payroll and HR technology stack into our partners' platforms. With thousands of potential partners, we are early in executing against this revenue opportunity and are actively scaling and investing in it.\nWe believe the synergies between the companies, coupled with our mutual focus on innovation and customer-centric solutions position us to continue to deliver strong returns and drive long-term shareholder return. A core component of our go-to-market strategy involves cultivating long-standing relationships with channel partners such as brokers, CPAs and banks just to name a few. More than half of our new business originates from channel partner referrals.\nFollowing the acquisitions, we introduced the Paychex Partner Program to brokers to foster relationships and drive mutual growth. Together, we now have a broader suite of solutions to offer brokers, which can supplement their offerings to clients and the Partners Program provides a structured framework designed to safeguard mutual clients from competing products.\nTo date, over 1,000 brokers are enrolled in a program and we are hearing positive feedback, which we believe indicates a strong foundation for retaining and expanding this important referral channel. The share of Paycor field bookings referred by brokers increased this past fiscal year. We are also actively gathering feedback from brokers, CPAs and banks to enhance our loyalty programs. designed to ensure we maintain the strongest partner program in the HCM industry. We also recently launched Paychex Partner Pro platform, a new portal designed to provide accountants quick access to critical data reporting and insights for their clients using Paychex Flex.\nThis innovative platform transforms how CPAs manage their portfolios by providing a centralized hub for accessing client payrolls and HR data resolving issues and identifying missing information. This is empowering them to really operate with greater efficiency and proactively serve their clients. Our PEO business continues to also perform well, achieving solid worksite employee growth this quarter. Similar to what we shared with you last quarter, while the PEO business remains strong and participant levels in our health plans across the country continue to increase, enrollment in our Florida at-risk medical plan did decrease year-over-year. We also continue to see a trend among employees opting for lower cost health plans to offset the rising health care costs.\nWhile these factors continue to pose a pass-through revenue headwind they do not impact our earnings or our PEO value proposition. One of the benefits of the PEO model is that it empowers small businesses to truly punch above their weight and offer benefits comparable to those of Fortune 500 companies. This enables them to attract and retain top talent in today's still very competitive labor market. We remain bullish on the PEO space given our scale and capability in this segment and just how greenfield the opportunity remains, both inside and outside of our client base. Now turning to the macro environment. We are observing a mix of both optimism and uncertainty within the market and our client base. Many businesses are frozen as they wait for more clarity about a number of macro issues such as tariffs, inflation and taxes.\nThe hard data continues to indicate that small businesses remain fundamentally healthy despite the headlines. Our small business employment watch revealed stable employment levels with moderation in hourly wage inflation in the recent months. Our data does not currently show any signs of recession. We also see our interactions in the market that the uncertainty is prompting businesses to exercise caution when making decisions and being cautious about how much they are spending on products and services. We have also seen an increase in bankruptcies and financial distress in the micro end of the market and in our client base in the fourth quarter.\nMany businesses, I think, on the edge of failure may have decided not to fight that new headwinds they see in front of them. We also saw losses due to increases in business combinations and mergers increase more than typical. Both are signs of businesses making strategic decisions based upon their view of the current and future environment. We will continue to monitor the hard data and trends in the market and take the appropriate steps to position Paychex to win in any market conditions.\nWe will also continue to take the actions needed to protect our long-standing track record of financial strength even in challenging times. I am proud of what the entire team at Paychex and Paycor have accomplished together. I would like to thank our dedicated employees for their hard work and contribution in achieving these many successes. They have accomplished a lot in a very short period of time. There has been a lot of change internally and externally to navigate and they have shown their dedication and real resiliency to deliver for our clients and for paycheck, and I'm internally grateful for that. We are truly better and stronger together as 1 paycheck and we believe we are better positioned than ever before to deliver on the future of HCM and health businesses succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to provide an update on our financial results and our outlook. Bob?\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, John. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results, and then I'll share our outlook for fiscal '26.\nStarting with Q4. Total revenue for the quarter increased 10% to $1.4 billion. Excluding Paycor, total revenue increased 3%. Management Solutions revenue increased 12% to $1 billion for the quarter driven primarily by the addition of Paycor as well as higher revenue per client from price realization and product penetration.\nExcluding Paycor, Management Solutions increased 3% in the quarter. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 4% to $340 million for the quarter, driven primarily by solid growth in the number of average PEO worksite employees. Outside of the at-risk plan headwinds that John discussed, PEO continues to perform well. Interest on funds held for clients increased 18% to [ $45 ] million for the quarter, primarily driven by the inclusion of Paycor balances.\nExcluding Paycor, interest on funds held for clients increased 3%. Total expenses for the quarter, excluding the acquisition of Paycorp and the prior year cost optimization initiatives increased 1%. Operating income margins for the quarter were 30.2% and adjusted operating income margins for the quarter were 40.4%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points driven by increased productivity and cost discipline offset by the Paycor acquisition. Excluding Paycor, adjusted operating income margins expanded by approximately 110 basis points. Diluted earnings per share decreased 22% to $0.82 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $1.19 in the fourth quarter.\nNow let me turn to our results for the full year fiscal 2025. Total revenue grew 6% to $5.6 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 5% to $4.1 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 6% to $1.3 billion, and interest on funds held for clients increased 10% to $162 million. Total expenses for the year, excluding the acquisition of Paycorp increased 1%. Operating margins were 39.6%, and that's on a GAAP basis.\nAdjusted operating margins were 42.5% and as the best operators in the business, we are constantly seeking ways to enhance operational efficiency. In fiscal year 2025, we expanded adjusted operating income margins by approximately 250 basis points, excluding the impact of Paycor and the ERTC headwinds. Diluted earnings per share decreased 2% to $4.58 a share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6% to $4.98 a share. We continue to exceed the Rule of 50, demonstrating our ability to achieve consistent revenue growth with industry-leading profitability.\nNow let me turn to our -- an overview of our financial position. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.7 billion and total borrowings now of approximately $5 billion as of May 31, 2025. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion for the fiscal year, primarily driven by net income. We returned over $1.5 billion to shareholders during the fiscal year in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases, and our annual return on equity remains robust at 42%.\nAs we look ahead to our fiscal 2026 outlook, we assume the current fluid macro environment will persist, we believe we are better positioned than ever before to win in the digital and AI-driven era of human capital management. Our solutions are mission-critical, and we have ample opportunity to continue driving sustainable growth and enhance operational efficiency.\nTotal revenue for fiscal '26 is expected to grow in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%. We expect the recent Paycor acquisition to contribute approximately 12 to 13 points of that growth. As previously mentioned, we expect revenue synergies to build over the next several years. And in fiscal '26, we expect revenue synergies to contribute 30 to 50 basis points of that growth that I just gave you.\nManagement Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 20% to 22%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 8% and we would expect revenue to accelerate in the back half of the year for PEO and insurance as we begin to anniversary the at-risk revenue growth headwinds we experienced in the back half of this fiscal year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $190 million to $200 million, which includes the benefit of approximately $1.1 billion of client fund balances from Paycor. These funds are now being managed by the Paychex team and are part of the Paychex portfolio. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 43% and our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share for next year is expected to grow in the range of 8.5% to 10.5%.\nLet me turn to the first quarter. We would anticipate total revenue growth in the first quarter to be between 16% and 17% and adjusted operating income margin to be between 40% and 41%. And of course, all that is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We will now open the call for questions."

Participating on the call today are John Gibson and Bob Schrader.\n[Operator Instructions]\nAs a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree to these terms, please disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Schrader, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you for joining us for our review of Paychex's third quarter 2025 financial results. Joining me today is John Gibson, our Chief Executive Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the quarter ended February 28, 2025. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next couple of days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nToday's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A description of these items along with a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our earnings release. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, John Gibson.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, Bob. I'll start the call today with an update on our business highlights for the third quarter. Then I'll turn it back over to Bob for the financial update. And then, of course, we'll open it up for your questions. This is an exciting quarter for Paychex. As we enter the digitally an AI-driven era of human capital management, we believe the combination of our positive underlying momentum and the pending acquisition of Paycorp position us well for continued success.\nTotal revenue growth was 5% in the third quarter, excluding the impact of the discontinued ERTC program, revenue growth was 6%, driven by the strength of our industry-leading HCM solutions. Diluted earnings per share increased 4% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 8% during the quarter. Our investments in automation and technology are boosting efficiency across the company, resulting in a strong 180 basis point increase in adjusted operating margins compared to the prior year. During the third quarter, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Paycor, a leading provider of HCM, payroll and talent software. The waiting period under HSR expired on February 21. After other customary closing conditions are met, we look forward to welcoming Paycor to the Paychex family in the coming weeks.\nOur companies are highly complementary, and our dedicated employees share a common set of values, most importantly, a strong customer orientation and a relentless focus on providing innovative solutions to real-world challenges. Our expected nearly 800,000 customers combined will benefit from having access to the most comprehensive HCM portfolio from the most trusted provider of technology and expertise in the industry. We believe the acquisition of Paycor will strengthen our competitive position upmarket while giving us the ability to offer Paychex robust set of HR and employee solutions to Paycor's approximately 50,000 customers and their 2.7 million employees. We are optimistic about what we can achieve together by leveraging the best of both of our current and future offerings.\nWe are working diligently towards a closing of the Paycor acquisition in the coming weeks, and we have already made several important decisions related to the integration. We are planning to operate Paycor as a stand-alone business unit. Adam Ante, Paycor's current CFO, will be joining Paychex as Senior Vice President of Baycorp and Ryan Bergstrom Picor's current Chief Product Officer, is also joining Paychex to become the new Chief Product Officer of Paychex. We are excited to welcome both Adam and Ryan to the Paychex executive team. Paycor and Paychex customers will remain on the platforms they're currently using and continue to receive support through their existing service team relationships. They will shortly gain access to the most comprehensive, flexible and innovative set of HCM technology and advisory solutions in the industry.\nWith our SurePayroll, Paychex, Flex Paychex HR advisory solutions and now Paycor capabilities, we have solutions to meet the diverse needs of businesses of all sizes. We are making great progress on the acquisition and on integration planning. The work we have done since announcing the transaction has increased our confidence in achieving the cost synergies and we now expect synergies over the $80 million that we shared with you in January. Given this, we now expect the acquisition to be accretive to our adjusted earnings per share next fiscal year. The third quarter was successful as we continue to improve our customer experience and value proposition. Client redemption has improved over last year's solid performance and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remain near record levels. Client losses are down across all employee size segments.\nOur revenue retention improved over last year and remain above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. Our strong retention rates attest to our compelling value proposition which was validated by a recent Wall Street Journal ranking of the best managed companies, in which Paychex achieved the second highest increase in customer satisfaction out of all 250 companies on the list. Similar to what we shared with you last quarter, while the PO business remains strong and participant levels in our health plans across the country continue to increase, enrollment in our specialty Florida at-risk medical plan decreased year-over-year. We also continue to see more employees opting for lower cost health plans to offset rising health care costs. These factors continue to present a pass-through revenue headwind but have no impact to our earnings or the value proposition of the PEO model.\nWe also continue to drive innovation in the quarter, and I'm proud to announce that we were just named one of Fortune's most innovative companies for the third consecutive year. This is truly a validation of our strategy to become the digitally driven HR leader. As an example of how we are driving innovation in AI, we recently built a Gen AI-powered HR co-pilot tool that covers the HR questions most frequently asked by our clients. The tool was developed from our proprietary data sourced from the hundreds of thousands of conversations our HR professionals have with our clients every year. The HR CoPilot tool, will enable our HR professionals to leverage the collective knowledge base we have built over the years to drive both efficient and effective answers to our clients' concerns. The testing phase for this new tool is nearly complete, and we are on track to launch it at the start of our next fiscal year.\nWe are committed to helping our clients leverage the power of new technologies and specifically AI. Another example of our innovation and employee solutions is Paychex perks, an award-winning digital marketplace that offers our clients employees access to affordable benefit and discounted products and services from third-party providers. Perks is available at no cost to the employer, and payments are processed automatically through payroll deduction. Since we launched this product in September over 180,000 client employees have purchased at least one product offered in the marketplace. While I'm extremely proud of all the innovation and all the hard and great work of our employees and what they do each and every day to make Paychex successful. I'm even more proud of how they do it by living our company's values and finding ways at the same time to impact the communities in which we serve and live.\nI am pleased to report that Paychex was recently named one of the world's most ethical companies for the 17th time by Ethisphere, 1 of only 3 companies in the world to achieve this distinction. Congratulations to the team. Turning to the macro environment. The pace of U.S. job growth has moderated from the robust levels observed coming out of the pandemic but has been relatively stable during the past year and in line with historical averages. Our customer employment levels were a little softer than expected in the third quarter and likely impacted by weather-related challenges and devastating fires in California, as well as lower bonus checks than last year and our expectations. Year-to-date, our checks per client have been flat compared to the prior year, suggesting relatively stable U.S. labor market conditions. And as I look back on it, we have accomplished a lot in the third quarter, both in terms of day-to-day execution and driving our strategy forward, including our preparations to add Paycor to the Paychex [indiscernible] companies in the coming weeks.\nAs I said earlier, this is an exciting quarter for Paychex. We exit the third quarter of this fiscal year better positioned than ever in the company's history to deliver on our purpose, and that is to help businesses of all sizes succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the quarter.\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I will start with a summary of our third quarter financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal 2025 outlook. Total revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $1.5 billion. This includes the headwind from the expiration of ERTC program that we have called out for the past several quarters. Excluding this headwind, total revenue grew 6% and as you guys can all imagine, I'm very happy to say that we have now anniversaried the end of RTC, and this will be the last call that I will have to talk about the quarterly impact of RTC.\nManagement Solutions revenue increased 5% to $1.1 billion, this was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and client worksite employees for HR solutions as well as higher revenue per client resulting from price realization, and product penetration partially offset by the lower ERTC revenues. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $365 million, driven primarily by growth in the number of average worksite employees and an increase in PEO insurance revenues. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 2% to $43 million, primarily due to lower average interest rates. Total expenses, excluding onetime costs related to the pending Paycor acquisition, increased 1% to $801 million, continued investments in product, technology and data and AI were offset by productivity and efficiency gains realized from these investments.\nOperating income grew 6% to $692 million with an operating margin of 45.8%. As a reminder, operating income was also impacted by the expiration of the ERTC program. Adjusted operating margins for the quarter were 46.9%. As John mentioned, this represents an increase of approximately 180 basis points due to increased productivity and cost discipline. Diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.43 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.49 in the third quarter. I will now quickly touch on the results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 4% to $4.1 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 3% to $3 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $1 billion, and interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $117 million. Total expenses year-to-date grew 3% to $2.4 billion. Operating margins expanded approximately 40 basis points to 42.9%, and our adjusted operating margins year-to-date increased approximately 80 basis points to 43.3%.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 4% to $3.76 a share adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 5% to $3.79 a share. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.7 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million as of February 28, 2025. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the first 3 quarters of the year, driven by net income and reflects changes in working capital influenced by timing. We returned a total of $1.2 billion to shareholders during the first 3 quarters in the form of cash dividends and share repurchases, and our 12-month rolling return on equity remained robust at 45%. I will now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025. This outlook assumes a continuation of the current macro environment and exclude the anticipated impact from our pending acquisition of Paycor, which is expected to close in the coming weeks.\nOur current outlook is as follows: Total revenue is still expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5%. We do now expect that it will be at the low end of the range, primarily due to the continued headwinds from our pass-through insurance revenues and as a reminder, this range includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of the ERTC program last year. Management Solutions is still expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 6% to 6.5% due to the factors that we referenced earlier, we previously had guided to the lower end of the range of 7% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $145 million to $155 million. Adjusted other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and adjusted operating income margin is now expected to be approximately 43%. We had previously guided to the high end of the range of 42% to 43%.\nOur effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. As John mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on the acquisition, which has increased our conviction on the near-term expense synergies. And given this, we would now expect the acquisition to be accretive to our adjusted diluted earnings per share next fiscal year. With the anticipated closing in the coming weeks, we would also like to provide an update on the expected financial impact to this fiscal year. Including Paycor, we expect revenue growth of 10% to 12% in the fourth quarter and the impact from the acquisition to adjusted EPS would be neutral. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we will update you again on the fourth quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I will now turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. Madison, we will now open the call to questions."

Joining me today is John Gibson, our Chief Executive Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on the SEC's website as well as on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next couple of days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nToday's call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risks.

I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the second quarter and then I'll turn it back to Bob for a financial update and then, of course, we'll open it up for your questions. We delivered solid results in the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal year. Excluding the impact of the expiration of the ERTC program, revenue growth was 7% in the second quarter as we continue to deliver a comprehensive suite of HCM solutions that help businesses solve real problems. Diluted earnings per share growth was 6% as we continually find ways to operate the company more efficiently while also enhancing the value proposition that we offer our customers.\nThe demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains healthy, as we head into the key selling season. A challenging labor market and rising health care and benefits costs are forcing many small businesses to reevaluate their HR strategies and technology needs and they can rely on Paychex to help them succeed. Our sales activities and pipelines are strong, most notably in our PO and middle market HCM businesses. Where we have invested, as you know, to take advantage of the growth opportunities we see in these attractive markets and where we believe our breadth of solutions provide us with a competitive advantage. We're fully staffed across our sales and service teams for this critical time of year.\nWe are also investing in advertising to drive improved awareness and adoption of our expanded product offerings. Our PO business continues to perform exceptionally well driven by our robust value proposition as evidenced by solid worksite employee growth due to strong sales performance, record levels of retention and higher overall insurance enrollment. While the underlying business is strong and our attachment and participation levels in our health plans across the country increased mid-single digits. Enrollment in our Florida at-risk medical plan was flat year-over-year. We also saw more employees opting for lower cost health plans in light of rising health care costs. These factors create a headwind to our pass-through revenue, but had no impact to our earnings or the strength of our PO value proposition.\nOur revenue retention improved during the past year and remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to remain disciplined on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. Client retention has improved since last year, and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remain near record levels. Client losses are down over the past year, with improvements across all our employee size segments. Our continued strong retention in a highly competitive marketplace speaks to the hard work and execution of our service teams and the strength of our value proposition. The pace of U.S. job growth has moderated over the past year, and overall, customer employment levels have remained consistent with our expectations.\nSmall and midsize businesses remain resilient and are generally optimistic as we head into a new year with hiring intentions in November rebounding to the highest level since last November. We continue to make investment in our product suite to help our customers solve their biggest problems. In October, we announced the Paychex Recruiting CoPilot, a digitally AI-powered solution designed to help clients proactively find in a challenging labor market. Although it's still early, we are seeing momentum building for the product as we head into the busiest time of year for [indiscernible]. According to a recent NFIB survey, 55% of small businesses reported hiring or trying to hire in November, and 48% reported few or no qualified applicants for the acquisitions that they're trying to fill. This is something we're actively trying to address.\nWe recently expanded our HR analytics offering to provide our customers with deeper and more meaningful insights. With the addition of the Premium Plus offering that we announced last month, businesses of all sizes now have access to real current market data for compensation benchmarks to enable them to more effectively recruit, manage talent and develop growth strategies. Premium Plus also had a Generative AI assistant and a chat interface. We're pleased to report strong early adoption of our HR analytics solution, which we are planning to launch broadly to our PEO clients this month.\nThrough AI insights, we are using generative AI to provide our customers with access to robust data and meaningful insights through simple, easy-to-use interactions. Since launching the product in September, we've seen a significant increase in customer engagement. Over 80% of the early adopters have actively engaged with the platform, and we've seen AI-focused usage increased significantly in the past 3 months. As a reminder, Paychex had used AI technology for many years and we believe Gen AI offers a new set of opportunities for value creation, especially when paired with a large and high-quality data set. Paychex captures 14 billion data elements last year and we pay one in 12 private sector workers in the U.S., giving us one of the largest workforce data sets in the industry.\nOur vast and growing data set provides us with the ability to deliver actionable insights to customers and strengthens our competitive moat. Our clients can now leverage Paychex Flex Perks to compete for scarce talent more effectively. Perks is an award-winning digital marketplace that offers our clients and employees access to affordable benefits and discounted products and services from third-party providers. Perks is available at no cost to employers and payments are processed automatically through payroll deductions. Since we launched the product in September over 100,000 client employees have purchased at least one product offered in the marketplace.\nThe value proposition of our new product innovation is resonating with our customers and also with industry experts. The Paychex Flex Perks was awarded the Top HR Product of the Year Award by HR executive and also recently received a Binan-Hall excellence in HR Technology silver award. Paychex was also recently named a leader in payroll services by Nelson Hall for the eighth consecutive year. We were evaluated and placed in the Leader quadrant for our ability to deliver immediate client benefit and meet future client requirements.\nTo sum it up, we remain focused on our North Star and that simply is helping small and midsized businesses succeed. By offering the most comprehensive suite of HCM solutions, best-in-class advisory support and actionable insights going from our large proprietary data based upon our long history of helping businesses.\nI will now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the second quarter. Bob?\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Thanks, John, and good morning. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter financial results and then provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2025. Total revenue for the quarter increased 5% to $1.3 billion. This includes the headwind from the expiration of the ERTC program of approximately 200 basis points, which is consistent with the expectation we shared with you last quarter. Excluding this headwind, as John mentioned, total revenue grew 7% in the quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 3% to $963 million. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions as well as client employees for HR solutions and higher product penetration partially offset by lower ERTC revenues.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 7% to $318 million, driven primarily by higher average worksite employees and an increase in PEO insurance revenues. Interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $36 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates and invested balances. Total expenses increased 4% to $779 million. This is due to higher PEO generate costs related to growth in our average work sell employees and PEO insurance revenues as well as continued investments in product innovation, debt in AI and our go-to-market initiatives. Operating income grew 6% to $538 million with operating margin of 40.9% which was up year-over-year approximately 60 basis points. And as a reminder, operating income is also impacted by the expiration of the ERTC program.\nExcluding that impact, operating margins would have expanded 180 basis points in the quarter compared to the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 6% to $1.14 in the second quarter. Now let me quickly touch on the results for the first 6 months of the year. Total revenue grew 4% to $2.6 billion, which includes approximately 200 basis points of headwinds from ERTC as well as having one fewer processing days in the first quarter. Excluding these headwinds, total revenue grew 7% in the first half of the fiscal year. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $637 million and interest on funds held for clients increased 15% to $74 million.\nTotal expense growth for the first 6 months of the year was 3% to $1.6 billion, and operating margins expanded approximately 20 basis points to 41.2%. And again, this is despite the ERTC headwind that we had in the first half of the year. Diluted earnings per share increased 4% to $2.32 and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 3% to $2.30 a share. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million as of November 30, 2024. Cash flow from operations was $841 million for the first half of the year, driven by net income and reflects changes in working capital, influenced by the timing of our quarter end.\nThrough the first 6 months of the year, we returned a total of $810 million to our shareholders, through cash dividends and share repurchases, and our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 46%.\nI'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year. This outlook assumes the continuation of the current macro environment. And I assume most of you have seen in the press release, we are not making any changes to the guidance. I will, however, provide color on the guidance ranges for 2 of the line items. Total revenue is still expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5% and as a reminder, this includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of RTC. Management Solutions is still expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9% due to some of the factors that John discussed earlier as it relates to our MPP enrollment in the state of Florida, we would now expect growth to be at the lower end of that range.\nInterest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $155 million and other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%. However, we would now expect that to be at the higher end of the range. And our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and earnings -- adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%.\nTurning to the third quarter. We would anticipate total revenue growth to be in the range of 4.5% to 5%. This includes approximately 150 basis points of headwinds from the expiration of the ERTC program. This will be the last quarter of headwind as it relates to RTC. So I'm looking very much forward to anniversary-ing that as we get to the end of Q3. We would also expect our operating margin to be between 46% and 47%. I think as most of you know, Q3 is our largest operating margin quarter. That's due to the fact that that's when we have -- we benefit from our annual form filings. And of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change and we'll update you again on the third quarter call. I'd also refer you to our Investor Relations website for more information in our investor slides.\nAnd with that, I will turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We will now open the call to questions."

With us today are John Gibson and Bob Schrader. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time.\nToday's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve some risks. In addition, the company will periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please refer to the press release for further information.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Gibson, Paychex President and CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us for our review of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 fiscal results. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nI'll start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob will review our financial results for fiscal year '24 and outlook for fiscal year 2025. We'll then open it up for your questions.\nAs we close out the fiscal year, I am pleased to report that Paychex delivered solid financial results, reflecting our ability to navigate changing market conditions by providing both innovative HR technology and advisory solutions that continue to deliver value for our clients and their employees. And as the best operators in the business, we are continually finding ways to run our business more efficiently.\nFor fiscal 2024, we achieved 5% growth in total revenue and 11% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees and the investments we have made in our technology and advisory solutions.\nRevenue retention remains near record levels, and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention continued to improve and hit new record levels. We believe our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition is resonating in a competitive marketplace.\nOur client retention for fiscal year 2024 was in line with last year and pre-pandemic levels with our business losses back to pre-pandemic levels, but stable. We continue to see demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions. Our activity and pipelines remain strong, and in fact, increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but close rates were softer than historical norms and our expectations.\nSales results in some market segments faced headwinds in the quarter. In SMB, we made some adjustments to our go-to-market strategy and in our digital technology stack in the micro segment, which impacted our read and sales volumes. We believe the onetime issues, which we have addressed.\nIn the mid-market, we have seen some of the same pressures our competitors have mentioned with delays in decisions making and increased focus on cost. Our HR outsourcing, both ASO and PEO and our retirement business continue to perform well, and we believe the value proposition for those solutions remains strong. Breadth of our solutions, both technology and complete outsourcing advisory solutions, along with the market segments we serve provides us with the ability to pivot our sales and marketing investments as market conditions change to maximize the opportunity.\nSmall and midsized businesses continue to face a challenging operating environment due to complex regulations, a historic tight labor market and persistent inflationary pressures. Our small business employment watch has shown stabilization in job growth and continued downward pressure in hourly wages in the recent months. In fact, our May index poses the biggest 1 month into this year. We also saw improvements in hiring within our client base with both better client and worksite employee growth in the quarter after a few quarters of declines.\nAs we mentioned last quarter, our data and with clients reveal they are having a tough time finding qualified candidates. As an innovative leader in our industry, we took this as an opportunity to find a way to help these businesses by launching a new program starting in our PO called the Employer of Choice Playbook. This program combines our digital HR Technology analytics with our dedicated HR professionals to work directly with our clients to find, attract, hire and retain qualified employees. It starts with our digital recruiting and hiring technology, which provides most seamless integrations with the top job lines and automates the hiring process for the employer and provide a better candidate experience.\nOur PEO clients are to attract top talent by offering a Fortune 500 suite of employee wellness benefits as well. To help them retain employees, our HR professionals act with our clients to leverage our HR data analytics and we are identify at-risk employees, determine the times of turnover and implement strategies to engage and develop their people.\nWe are to offer a comprehensive solution to help our clients solve one of their biggest problems, hiring and retaining talented employees. We are planning more innovations in this area for all our market segments in the coming fiscal year.\nOur PEO business continue to gain momentum with excellent performance in fiscal year 2024. We finished the year with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued this back towards the PO offering, both inside and outside our client base. This mix shift has a long-term positive impact on lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefit.\nOur Retirement Services business is another strong contributor in the fourth quarter with double-digit revenue growth. As the industry leader in plan recordkeeping in the U.S. with approximately $52 billion in assets under management, and over 120,000 clients, we are dedicated to helping small and midsized business sellers offer an affordable retirement solution for their employees.\nAccording to our own data, less than half of U.S. employers currently offer a retirement plan. We are committed to providing affordable solutions to the companies that will help them offer their employees the opportunity for a secure retirement. Legislation like the SECURE Act and SECURE Act 2.0, the introduction of pooled employer plans and state made mandates are helping to address the growing retirement process in the U.S., but there is still more to be -- We are committed to educating business owners and industry professionals on available programs, potential tax benefits and the cost-effective plans available to them and their employees by Paychex.\nAs you know, AI has been a hot topic in our industry and is something we have focused on for many years. Our AI initiatives and investments have been centered around enhancing our customer and identifying clients that are at risk, optimizing our pricing and discounting strategies and driving higher sales productivity through improved marketing and targeting efforts. Additionally, we are focused on harnessing the power of our asset data to drive more value for our customers and continue to drive greater operational efficiencies across the company.\nWe continue to gain recognition for the strength of our technology. For the fifth consecutive year, Paychex Flex, the company's cloud-based SaaS solution, earned an HR Tech award for best small business focused solution in the Core HR and workforce category from White House Research and Advisory. For the tenth time, Paychex was among the best important excellence in health and which affirms our long-standing commitment to our own employees.\nPaychex was also recently recognized by Forbes as one of the America's best importers for diversity. These recognitions and the many products and serve awards that we have received in the last year and over the decades break testament to the strength of our business model, our culture, and our commitment to invest in our business to deliver long-term value for our customers, investors.\nThis post-pandemic era, Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and size businesses navigate the challenges they face in an ever-evolving world. And we believe our value proposition to these businesses remains compelling based on the breadth and quality of the solutions we can provide. We remain committed to our purpose to help businesses succeed, while making a positive impact on our clients, employees, communities and shareholders.\nI'll now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financials results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob?\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nYes. Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our quarter and full year financial results in fiscal '25 outlook. Total revenue increased 5% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service, and this impacted revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points in the quarter.\nManagement Solutions revenue increased 3% to $930 million. This was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients served across our HCM solutions and increased product penetration, partially offset by lower ERTC revenue. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 9% to $327 million. This was primarily driven by higher average worksite employee and an increase in our PEO insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the fourth quarter.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 54% to $38 million. This was primarily due to higher average interest rates and invested balances and lower realized losses on investment sales related to some repositioning of the portfolio that happened in the prior year period.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we did recognize a onetime charge of $39 million related to cost optimization initiatives. These initiatives include a reduction of our underutilized real estate, a reprioritization of our technology investments towards AI and headcount optimization. These measures, along with strong expense management during the year, will allow us to reallocate resources, invest in our strategic priorities as well as continue to deliver operating margin expansion for fiscal '25 despite the aspiration of the ERTC program.\nIncluding these charges, total expenses increased 5% to $813 million. Excluding these charges, total expenses were relatively flat for the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period.\nOperating income increased 6% to $482 million with an operating margin of 37.2%. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the onetime costs recognized in the fourth quarter grew 15% to $521 million with an adjusted operating margin of 40.2%. This represents a 330 bps of margin expansion over the prior year period.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 8%, $1.05 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.12 in the fourth quarter.\nNow I will quickly summarize our full year results. Revenue grew 5% to $5.3 billion and lower contribution from our ERTC service, and that impacted growth about 100 basis on a full year basis. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $3.9 billion. Insurance Solutions increased 8% to $1.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 47% to $146 million. Total expenses grew 4% to $3.1 billion. Excluding the onetime costs I discussed earlier, expense growth was approximately 3% for the year. Operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion, and adjusted operating income increased 9% to $2.2 billion with a margin of 41.9% and that's an expansion of 130 basis points over the prior year period.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 9% to $4.67 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $4.72 per share. Our financial position remains strong at the end of the year with restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $1.9 billion, and that's up 11% from the prior year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital.\nWe returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the year, that included $0.3 billion of dividends and $169 million of share buybacks, and our 12-month line return on equity remains robust at 47%.\nI will now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year 2025. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which has some level of uncertainty. Our current outlook is as follows: Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5%. If you take the midpoint of this range, that is consistent with the preliminary thinking we provided last quarter. And as a reminder, this includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of ERTC.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. And the breakdown of some of the components, Management Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Those last 2 metrics, both are impacted by short-term interest rates. We can talk more in the Q&A. But it is our expectation that the Fed begins to lower short-term interest rates as we get into the back half of the year.\nOperating income margin is expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%. This is also consistent with our preliminary expectations around margin expansion, and our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%.\nTurning to the quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 2%. The first quarter growth rate is impacted by 2 headwinds. The first is the ERTC headwind that you're all familiar with. The second one is one less processing day in the quarter versus the prior year, and it's one of our largest revenue days. Combined, these 2 items represent a headwind of more than 400 basis points to revenue growth. We would also expect an operating margin in the range of 40% to 41% in the quarter.\nOf course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change, we'll update you again on the first quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Bob. We will now open the call to questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone, for joining our discussion today on the Paychex Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schafer -- Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day.\nThis teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nI'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update. And then, of course, we'll be happy to take your questions.\nWe delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first 9 months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our Employee Retention Tax Credit or ERTC Service as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter.\nWhile our new client volumes remained solid and in line and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations, several factors, including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates, all combined to create a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter.\nWith the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post-pandemic era at Paychex. And I will tell you, I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients. And based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we saved over 300,000 small business jobs.\nWhile these pandemic programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose, and that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic 4 years ago.\nWe are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven recurring revenue growth formula still holds true in this post-pandemic and digitally-driven era for the company. Focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy.\nWe are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted adviser to small and midsized business owners.\nDespite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share and expanded operating margins due to our long-standing tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continued to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth.\nOur culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well.\nThe macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small and midsized businesses. A tight job market for qualified workers, reduced access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation. But, however, a relatively stable macro environment.\nThe softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now. Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes.\nThe demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust, and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continued to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels. And both revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention remained at record levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients.\nOur sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact. The fundamentals of Paychex are sound.\nI'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first 9 months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits.\nAI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients. Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences and their growing needs.\nLast month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics and AI-driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhance customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets.\nI want to thank to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values. Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do, and more importantly, in my opinion, how we do it. We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors.\nI'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities, and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic area.\nWe exit this period in Paychex's history more focused than determined to be the digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve.\nI'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter.\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve some risks.\nIn addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nI'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics.\nI'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook, and as promised to many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25.\nTotal revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that has impacted the growth by about 300 basis points.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates.\nTotal expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter.\nOperating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out, we were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter.\nAnd I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates, it's pretty much all margin.\nBoth diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38.\nI'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million.\nTotal expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion.\nAnd our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period.\nDiluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively.\nI'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter.\nCash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital.\nAnd we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases.\nAnd our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%.\nI'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty. We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation.\nI just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's past the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31 and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4.\nAnd so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year.\nManagement Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million.\nTotal revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%.\nOther income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million.\nOur guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%.\nAnd adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%.\nNow let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter.\nWe are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year. We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25.\nOn a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25 and that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you.\nAnd then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25.\nWe are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and that I'll be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to John Gibson.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, Chelsea. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast on the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nI'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then, of course, we'll take your questions.\nWe had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits.\nThe demand for our HR technology advisory solutions remains strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and midsized business environment. The tight labor market and rising health care and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies. And they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times.\nAs we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway. All are going well and in line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year.\nIn the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go, both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. Client retention has improved over last year, and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels.\nI'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls. It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value on our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits.\nWe previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges, including: one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway, and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year. I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success in the past year so far.\nThe macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and midsized businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year.\nSMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty. While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in any economic environment.\nI know that AI and related technology advancements remain a hot topic in our industry. As I've noted in past calls, AI at Paychex is nothing new. We have over hundreds of -- and growing models, AI models that are actively working in our business today designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets.\nThe exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient, and to our clients. We are actively investing in gen AI and exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed.\nCurrently, recently, we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports and AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers. This enhances our current reporting and analytics available in Paychex Flex and will perfectly complement our industry-leading HR advisory services. The partnership provides core HR and compensation analytics and compensation in salary benchmarking, an AI-driven model with benchmarks against 750 million market data points. This offering, in addition to our AI-driven retention insight solution that we launched over a year ago, is just the beginning of how we will leverage AI to help businesses succeed.\nPartnerships with Visier, like our recruiting and onboarding partnership with Indeed, is another example of how Paychex is bringing together the power of partnerships, our large data assets and integration to improve the customer experience and deliver real value and business outcomes for our clients.\nWe are also pleased that for the seventh consecutive year, we have been positioned in the leader quadrant as part of the NelsonHall 2023 Vendor Evaluation report for payroll service providers. This provides further evidence of our leadership position based on our robust technology and customer support. We're also very proud to be recognized in the [ Sapient Insights ] Group Voice of the Customer Top 5 Vendor Survey for 2023 and 2024, receiving top 5 ratings in 6 categories spanning payroll, HR, time and attendance, learning and performance.\nAnd really, what I'm most proud of is that the Sapient report is actually based on actual voices of our customers and customers from across the competitors, which demonstrates our leadership position across the industry. As we head into selling season in calendar year-end, I'm confident in our global Paychex team and that they will constantly deliver and consistently deliver for our clients. We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and midsized businesses that deliver industry-leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob?\n\nRobert Lewis Schrader\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Johnny, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events that involve some level of risk. I'll refer you to our customer disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website.\nI will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million. That was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization and increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million. That was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase and volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million. That was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology.\nOperating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 40.2%. That's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior year period. And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share.\nI will now quickly touch on the results for the first 6 months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million.\nOur total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for the first 6 months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively.\nI'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion, and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November.\nCash flow for operations for the first 6 months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there are some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection date that's driving higher operating cash flows. That's why you see the 40% level. That will moderate as we move through the year.\nWe returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first 6 months. That includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remained strong at 47%.\nI'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges, and certainly, we can provide some more detail when we get to the Q&A.\nThe outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which has some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy. So our current outlook is as follows: Management Solutions is unchanged, with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients has not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%.\nOperating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%, although we now anticipate that we'll probably be towards the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11%, just based on what we're seeing, we expect that to be a bit stronger, and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%.\nNow I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6% and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%. As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be right in the middle of those 2 ranges.\nAnd I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past, that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last 2.5 years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year.\nOf course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions. Chelsea?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Gibson.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Shelby. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex First Quarter Fiscal Year '24 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nI will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then we'll open up for your questions. But before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who [ is ] his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023, though he will remain as a senior adviser at least through the end of the calendar year.\nEfrain has been a valued member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company and we significantly expanded our HR solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic adviser and a catalyst for this transformation.\nEfrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellect, your wisdom, your integrity the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we're all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees, and our shareholders are better off because you were here so thank you.\nJoining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past 9 years, including over the last 1.5 years since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being colead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives.\nBob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an [ innov ] leader who will continue to guide the company going forward. I want to congratulate Bob and Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years as we continue our track record of delivering strong financial results, and continuing to position Paychex as a leader, an innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results.\nNow moving on to the first quarter results, [ Seeking ] of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points year-over-year while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex.\nThe demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales revenue growth. We saw positive trends in client revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients.\nWe are starting to see improvements in some of our KPO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to headwinds we faced in 2023 and are beginning to gain traction.\nEmployment levels within our client base have remained stable. Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy continues to show their resiliency. Our small business employment watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained but modest rates. Also the trend in wages has shown some cooling and wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicates a continued stable macro environment for small and midsized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro environment.\nSmall businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service employee retention tax credit service. I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide this service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds.\nWe continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects and we continue to file amended returns with the IRS on their behalf. We anticipate that ERTC revenue will be a slight tailwind for the first half of the fiscal year and then turn to a headwind in the back half as the program ends.\nWe are seeing greater adoption of HR software as businesses look to digitize their HR efforts to support the complexities of managing today's workforce in a more efficient manner. We also continue to see strong demand for our HR advisory solutions as businesses deal with the continued challenges of being an employer in today's challenging employment world.\nPaychex is uniquely positioned to offer a continuum of HR products, technology and services from do-it-yourself payroll all the way to full service POHR outsourcing. All of these products deliver a strong return on investment for our clients.\nFor the 13th year in a row, we were named the leading retirement record keeper by a number of plans by plan sponsor magazine. Our leadership position in retirement makes us an excellent resource for small businesses, and we continue to educate and execute on this opportunity. There has certainly been a lot of excitement about AI and related technology advancement around the monetization of large data sets.\nAt Paychex, as we've talked on prior calls, this isn't anything new or it's not a fact. We have been using our [ visual ] intelligence to transform our business for over a decade. We have over 200 AI models that are actively working in our business today designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. Our award-winning retention insight tool uses AI-based predictive analytics to provide HR leaders with early insights into potential employee retention issues.\nOur Flex intelligence engine is an embedded AI chat capability within our Flex platform that allows the customer to get quick answers to over 900 of the most common questions and access over 1,200 instructional resources. Companies like paycheck with large amounts of data will clearly be the winner with AI. And we will continue to harness the power of AI and leverage our extensive data to drive internal efficiencies and provide actionable insights and solutions to our clients.\nThis quarter, we continue to be recognized for our innovation, service and the positive impact we are having on our customers, our industry and the world. For the third time, Paychex has been recognized by TrustRadius with a 2023 Tech Cares award for the company's corporate social responsibility programs and our community impact. We also received an award from selling [ Power ] for our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce and from Forbes as one of the best employers for women in 2023.\nOn the product and service side, Nelson Hall once again identified Paychex as a leader in its 2023 next-generation HCM technology market report. We also learned a silver Brandon Hall Group 2023 HR Excellence Award for breadth and depth of training that we provide our HR advisers to keep them up to speed on the ever-changing complexities of the employer-employee relationship. Paychex was also named the 2023 Constellation Research on our short list for Best payroll for North American small and midsized businesses.\nThe depth and breadth of our product suite provides American businesses the freedom to succeed with the technology and advice that they desperately need to remain competitive in a very complicated world. I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we're off to such a good start this fiscal year.\nI'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob?\n\nRobert L. Schrader\n\nVice President of Finance & Investors Relations\n\nYes. Thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements. Obviously, those involve risks, and we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release, in our investor presentation that will be posted later today.\nI'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results, and then I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, and he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees product penetration, price realization in HR ancillary services, we continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR Solutions retirement and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees.\nAs John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity and medical plan participation and attachment. Those were obviously headwinds last year, and we're definitely seeing some positive signs as we moved through the first quarter here.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business. Operating income increased 8% to $536 million with an operating margin of 41.7%. That's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior year period and diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share.\nI'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year.\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time.\nAs you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash and earnings, [ our ] balanced for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter was driven by net income and changes in working capital.\nThere was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as a percentage would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter. As you know, our earnings quality, which some of you have pointed out is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&P500.\nIn the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under nonrecourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients.\nThis acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges, as John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses, and we think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have, I'm very excited to have it. The acquisition at this stage is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year.\nWe paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar superb amazing 47%. Now let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows.\nYou saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million and before I get the question, are we anticipated a range? Are we anticipating a range of additional increases? No. We're poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it. To the extent that the Fed does something now, we'll have a conversation later in the year, maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to cause. But at this point, that's where we anticipate being.\nTotal revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. Effective income tax expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is where from our previous guide of 9% to 10%.\nThis full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions which have some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost, I would say, at least 6 quarters where we keep saying hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook. I think John summarized it very well. At this point, things look pretty stable. So we're feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half.\nProject in the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after first when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that will navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic.\nOf course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call. So let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure.\nFirst half 2024, total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7% operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then in the second half, at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7% operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional inclination.\nBefore handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together, and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think will do an even better job than I have.\nOne of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride. I got a call in someone -- or I got a note and someone said, Efrain you're making me old because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex. So I think that's unfortunately true. We're all getting a little bit older.\nBut one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I say that even though I've disagreed with some of you over the years, and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may. I can't argue with some of the things that you write.\nSo -- and in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do.\nAnd with that, let me turn it back to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nWell, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things: One, we have a lot of people here. And last time, Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly around compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So if we could just follow the Efrain rule, in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answer any of your questions.\nBut I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex and really the amazing success stories and the impact that we're having on the world. We recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page, both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report. And very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our annual meeting in the coming weeks. And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we're having on our customers, how big an impact we're having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired the most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out.\nSo with that, advertisement of our investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stephanie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July.\nThis teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'll start with the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year April. After, we'll review our financial results for fiscal '23 and our outlook for '24. We'll then open it up for your questions.\nWe finished fiscal year '23 with solid financial results and momentum heading into fiscal year 2024. Total revenue grew 9% for the full year, and we hit a major milestone for the company with over $5 billion in total revenue. I was personally reflecting on this last night. When I joined the company, we were just over $2 billion. It took us 6 years to go from $2 billion to $3 billion, 3 years to go to 3 to 4, and it took us 3 years to go to 4 to 5, but I remind everybody that was during a global pandemic. So certainly, very proud of those results.\nIn addition to the revenue growth at 9%, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $4.27 and operating margins finished at 41% as we continue to benefit from our continued investments in technology, our focus on driving digitalization in all aspects of our business, and our long-standing tradition of operating excellence.\nThese results are due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees. I'm very proud of what we've achieved this fiscal year our industry-leading technology and advisory solutions have made a positive impact on our clients and their employees. And in return, they continue to reward us with additional business and a continued loyalty.\nMomentum in sales has continued with solid growth in new annualized revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. HR Solutions and retirement were areas of particular strength with double-digit growth. We are well positioned in terms of our staffing levels and breast tenure heading into the new year.\nRevenue retention finished the year near record levels as we continue to focus on retaining and increasing our share of wallet with our high-value customer segments. Client retention was impacted by higher losses due to out of business concentrated mainly in newly formed businesses in the last 2 years and financial distress in the lower revenue small clients.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions with worksite employee growth over 10% year-over-year. Over the year, we achieved record level of worksite and lead retention due to our strong and unique value proposition of our leading HR technology and advisory capabilities.\nBusinesses of all sizes continue to navigate the challenges of a very complicated regulatory environment, a competitive labor market and now tightening credit. Demand for our solutions remained strong due to the depth and breadth of our integrated offerings, including HR technology designed to deliver efficiency for both the employer and the employee, our comprehensive HR outsourcing, which leverages the strength of our technology and the experience of a trained HR professional and our outstanding compliance organization and the need for businesses to offer quality benefits, including retirement to compete for talent.\nOur retirement solutions are benefiting from the growing expectations of a retirement plan as a core benefit offering for small and midsized businesses. Recent passage of the Secure Act 2.0 legislation and various state mandates requiring employers to provide retirement services to their employees are making 401(k)s a key benefit for small and midsized businesses. With more state mandates expected to take effect in the future, we expect a strong market for retirement to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are well positioned as a leader to take advantage of this opportunity.\nThe SMB credit environment has continued to fuel demand for our employee retention tax credit service. Our full-service ERTC offerings has helped tens of thousands of businesses obtain tax credits and getting access to funds they need to keep their businesses running and growing. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects. Industry recognition continues to reinforce the competitive strength of our technology solutions.\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Paychex Flex earned an HR Tech Award for best small and midsized business focused solution in the core HR category. Our consistency in winning these awards and being played repeatedly in the leadership quadrant of respected technology analyst rankings speaks to our market leadership in HR technology.\nI'm not only very proud of these results and the performance of the team, but I'm also equally proud of how we achieved these results. We have been consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired, most ethical and most innovative company. In addition, we have been ranked as 1 of the best places to work for people in sales for women, for diversity, and for our outstanding training and investment in our employees development.\nThese awards are a testament to how our employees not only get the job done, but do it the right way. and we are constantly looking for new ways we can make ourselves and our communities better. As we move into fiscal year '24, we will continue our focus on developing leading customer experiences that combine our technology our advisory capabilities and our partnerships to deliver superior value to our customers.\nPaychex is uniquely positioned to help small and midsized businesses navigate the challenges they face in a complex and ever-changing and evolving world. We remain committed to our purpose, and that is to help businesses succeed. And we'll continually strive to have a positive impact on our clients, our employees our communities and our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal year '24. Efrain?\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John, and good morning to all of you. I hope you're indoors on this smoking Thursday. I thought we're past it, but not quite. I'd literally remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures that we make. Let me start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results. talk about full year results and then finish with the revenue of our fiscal 2024 outlook.\nJust before I start, I also want to add that joining us in the room today this morning, Bob Schrader, VP of Finance and IR. Many of you have met Bob.\nOkay. For the fourth quarter, you saw total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue was up 7%, a little bit over $900 million driven by additional product penetration into our ancillary services, which currently is mostly ERTC and also price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products.\nDemand for our ERTC service remains strong, as John mentioned, and it contributed approximately 1% to 2% to total revenue growth for the full year. Demand for this service along with our internal execution have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will become a moderate headwind next year, especially in the back half of the year where it will become more of a headwind.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $300 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was tempered a bit by lower medical plan sales and participant volumes along with continued preference for ASO in this environment. We expect these trends will start to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2024, though it won't be evident necessarily in Q1, and I'll talk about that in a little bit.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 69% to $25 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates, partially offset by realized losses taken in Q4 as we reposition the portfolio heading into the back half of this year.\nTotal expenses increased 3% to $776 million expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general cost to support growth in the business. Operating income increased 15% to $453 million, with an operating margin of just under 37%, a 240 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.97, and per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to again $0.97 per share.\nLet me quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue increased 9% to $5 billion and total service revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion. As you are all aware, we raised guidance a number of times during the year. Management Solutions increased 8% to $3.7 billion. PEO and Insurance increased 6% to $1.2 billion. Total expenses were up 7% to $3 million. Operating income increased 10% and with a margin of 40.6%, John mentioned this earlier, as a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year. The leverage in the model as pretty evident.\nOther income net increased by over $30 million due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances within the corporate investment portfolio. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% and to $4.30 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% to $4.27 per share.\nOur financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion and total margins of approximately $808 million as of May 2023. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 13% from the prior year. Driven by higher net income and changes in working capital, free cash flow generated for the year was $1.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year.\nAnd while it's easy to gloss over those numbers. I think it's really important that when we work to note that when we report numbers, the quality of our earnings and our quality of our cash is very, very strong, as noted by some of you. Not only do we deliver on the top line, but we delivered in a quality way for them on the bottom line, and we intend to continue to do that.\nWe paid out a total of $1.2 billion of dividends during fiscal 2023 or 70% of our net income. Our 12-month rolling return on equity with a stellar 48% with an arrow pointing up.\nNow let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 2024. Our current outlook, as you saw, is as follows. Management Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. We widened that a bit just to accommodate the fact that sometimes attachment on insurance can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as we saw last year.\nInterest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. And our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to grow in the range of 9% to 10%.\nThis outlook assumes current macroeconomic environment, which, as you know, has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes in the economy. We have better visibility in the first half fiscal 2024 as each quarter progresses. We have a little better visibility into the remaining quarters in the year. For the first half of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be approximately 6%. That's the first half and the first quarter. We anticipate operating margins for the first quarter to be approximately 41%. That'll help do a little bit on your modeling. And we expect PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to be below the low end of the range for the first quarter, then it will be solidly in the range. That's our expectation at this point.\nBefore you ask me the question, I'll answer the first quarter was actually the strongest quarter of the year on PEO last year. And as a consequence, the compare will be a little bit tougher, and we expect the business to build as we go through the year. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, and they can change. We'll update you again on the first quarter call.\nThere's a number of questions because, of course, the time when we give the annual guidance. So if I could just ask for your forbearance on something, which is to say, ask a question and limit yourself to one follow-up. Now I will say I understand some of those questions will be compound questions. But if it's a 5-part compound question, then it violates the rule. But just so we can get through the call without going excessively long. With all of that, I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And I'll turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nOkay. And now with all the conditions and restrictions that Efrain has laid out for you, we'll now open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] Please note today's call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Todd. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Third Quarter Fiscal Year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day.\nThis teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up for any of your questions.\nAs you saw in our press release, we delivered solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of 8% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees, we completed a successful selling and calendar year-end season with strong sales volumes and revenue retention for the quarter.\nWe continue to see a stable macro environment and demand for our solutions. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating in the market. Small and midsized businesses continue to show remarkable resilience as seen in our [ job ] index in the last 2 months as they contain was a constantly changing labor market, inflation, increasing regulations and rising interest rates.\nBefore we get into the third quarter results, I want to take a minute to address the recent volatility in the U.S. banking market as a result of 2 highly publicized bank closings. We have no cash, restricted cash and investments deposited within Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, and we've met all client fund obligations related to employee payment services and remittances to applicable tax or regulatory agencies.\nWe continue to monitor this situation and believe that our existing client funds held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are more than sufficient to meet all client fund obligations. We remain ready as we were when the crisis was unfolding to help businesses and their employees whose payroll processing or direct deposits may have been impacted by these bank closures.\nPaychex has a long-standing track record for being a stable place for customers, employees and investors during all types of macroeconomic situations and crisis, and we demonstrated that once again. The selling season was positive in terms of both revenue and volumes in a very highly competitive environment. In particular, demand has remained strong for our HR outsourcing solutions though as we've reported in prior quarters, we continue to see a trend of client shifting preferences for our ASO model over the PEO model. In the third quarter, we saw revenue retention remaining near record levels and normalization of uncontrollable losses at the very low end of the market.\nThe focus and investment we continue to put in our high-value clients is making the difference in the customer experience. In addition, the advisory assistance we provide our clients is critical in these challenging times. Our retention for our HR outsourcing businesses, both ASO and PEO stand at an all-time record high year-to-date. PEO and Insurance Solutions continues to show lower health insurance attachment and enrollment inside those clients that are attaching. This is specifically impacting our PEO in the Florida market and the softer rates for workers' compensation insurance continue to impact the property and casualty part of our insurance agency.\nWe expect these trends to continue early into the next fiscal year and normalize as the year progresses. Paychex is uniquely positioned with a continuum of solutions designed to help businesses in any macro environment. We help them recruit and train employees gain access to capital and provide valuable benefit packages such as insurance and retirement. Through our innovative technology, compliance and HR expertise, we are here to help businesses drive efficiency within their HR processes, which therefore frees up valuable time for them to focus on growing the business.\nCompeting for and retaining employees remains a challenge for today's workforce. And I want to commend Congress and the President for signing the recent SECURE Act 2.0, which will introduce a range of new opportunities for businesses looking to introduce a retirement benefit and make their employee value proposition more competitive.\nWe have begun to launch campaigns to educate the market on the SECURE Act 2 and continue to position Paychex as the industry leader in retirement plans that we are. We are working on strategies to leverage our strength in this market and capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead.\nAs higher interest rates and disruptions in the banking system have both impacted the cost and access of capital for many small and midsized businesses, we have fully embraced this challenge to help them out by proactively assisting our clients and prospects with obtaining financial assistance available to them through nontraditional financial partnerships and through government programs such as PPP and the ERTC program. We continue to see strong demand for our full-service ERTC solution.\nMany of the businesses we've helped are leveraging their new financial flexibility to reinvest in new solutions, such as a retirement plan, or one of our integrated HCM technologies. Recently, our ERTC service was recognized with a Stevie Award for helping businesses obtain critical financial support.\nIn uncertain times, people look for stable, trusted advisers to help them succeed. I am proud that we have recently been recognized as one of the most admired, one of the most ethical and one of the most innovative companies by several prominent and respected brands. We remain one of Fortune's most Admired Companies in 2023 and for the 15th time, we were named among one of the most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere. This is a select group of companies that show exceptional commitment to ethical operations, compliance performance and governance and risk practices, including strong commitments to ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nAnd today, we are announcing that we have been named to Fortune's list of America's most innovative companies for 2023 due to the innovation we've shown in our products, processes and culture. These awards are the result of the dedication of our 16,000-plus employees who daily are supporting our clients and helping them succeed and doing business the right way every day.\nVery proud of the team, and I'm very proud of Paychex. There's no question that we are a well-managed and stable market leader that people can depend on. We have a long-standing track record of being there for our customers when they need us most, and we continue to be well positioned to help them through the HR challenges they are facing and whatever comes their way in the future.\nNow I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the third quarter.\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP & CFO\n\nThanks, John. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you the customary things I remind you that during these conversations, we're going to talk about forward-looking statements. Items like EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, please refer to our press release for more information on these topics. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and finish up with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook.\nTotal revenue for the quarter, as you saw, grew 8% to $1.4 billion. Total service revenue increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Obviously, we're benefiting from increase in interest rates. Management Solutions revenue increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by additional product attachment, HR ancillary services. It's largely what we've discussed previously, our ERTC product and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products.\nDemand for our ERTC service remains strong and contributed approximately 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Demand for this product along with our internal execution, have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind, and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will eventually become -- will eventually moderate and become a headwind as we progress through next year -- next fiscal year.\nBeyond Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $321 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was impacted by factors previously discussed, including lower medical plan sales and participant volumes, along with the mix shift to ASO as John called out. We expect these trends to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2020, meaning a little bit more of a balance between PEO and ASO.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased significantly to $35 million in the quarter, primarily due, as you know, to higher average interest rates. Total expenses were up 8% to $769 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates in general course to support growth in our business. Op income increased 9% to $612 million, with an operating margin of 44.3%, a slight expansion over the prior year period.\nOur effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a higher volume of stock-based comp -- and stock-based comp payments and the recognition of a tax credit related to our development of client-facing software that generated the difference in rates.\nNet income increased 9% to $467 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter to $1.29 per share. Let me quickly summarize the results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year. Performance has been strong. Total service revenue increased 8% to $3.7 billion, and total revenue was up 9% to $3.8 billion. Management Solutions up 9% to $2.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions up 6% to $877 million.\nOp income increased 9% with a margin of 41.8%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $1.2 billion and $3.31 per share. Our financial position remained strong as you can see, with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion. Total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of February 28, 2023. Cash flow from operations, again, solid for the first 9 months was at $1.3 billion and with an increase from priority driven by higher net income and changes in working capital.\nWe've had our quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $854 million during the 9 months of fiscal 2023 year, 12-month rolling return on equity was the stellar superb for 47%.\nNow let me turn to our guidance. For the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our results for the first 9 months in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter, updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue now expected to grow slightly above 8%. We previously guided to a range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions outlook is unchanged at growth in the range of 5% to 7%, although we anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. We expect Q4 PEO and Insurance Solutions growth to be below 5% due to the factors that we've talked about through much of the year.\nInterest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%. Other income and expense net is now expected to be income of $10 million to $15 million, obviously due to higher interest rates. Remember, we met interest income there with our expense on the debt. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 12% to 14%. So we tightened the range, obviously, 1 quarter left.\nGuidance for margins and effective tax rates are unchanged, but we do anticipate being on the higher end of the range for operating margin and the lower end of the range for effective tax rate. We currently are in the middle of our annual budget process and are working on expectations for next fiscal year. As you know, this is challenging for a number of different reasons, not the least of which are expected outcomes in terms of interest rates and also macroeconomic environment. We'll provide final guidance for fiscal 2024 during fiscal 2023's fourth quarter earnings call in June.\nHowever, let me share some of our preliminary thought process around fiscal 2024. On a preliminary basis, we believe that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a decent approximation for total revenue growth for 2024. This should result somewhere in the range of 6% to 7%. And again, we got more to do there, but just giving you what our thought process is at the moment. And it's heavily dependent on what we think will happen with interest rates during the year. And at this point, our assumptions are conservative.\nManagement Solutions is expected to be lower as a result of moderating ERTC revenues. We called that out last year didn't happen. It actually went the other way. We do think it's going to happen next year. And then PEO and Insurance revenue growth is expected to trend higher as we progress through the year with moderation in some of the headwinds we have experienced this year primarily around insurance attachment and also, as we called out mix shift to ASO. We remain committed to improving margins and we anticipate that operating margin will expand at this stage in the range of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal 2024.\nOf course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which can change, especially if there are significant changes to the macro environment, which at this stage, we are not seeing. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And now let me turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Efrain. With stats now being complete, Todd will open up the call for any questions people have."

(Operator Instructions). Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, [Todd]. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days.\nWe'll start the call with an update on the business for the second quarter and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up to your questions.\nWe delivered solid financial results for the second quarter with total revenue of 7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9%. Demand for our comprehensive solution suite remains strong, and we are well positioned to help our clients succeed. Our unique combination of leading HR technology, HR expertise and the wide breadth of solutions we have to address the many needs in the marketplace, continue to help small and midsized businesses navigate this very dynamic and challenging environment.\nWe continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and our internal leading indicators. The latest findings from our Paychex | IHS Small Business Employment Watch revealed moderating growth in jobs and steady growth in wages. Our clients continue to be challenged by the continuing impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures and the challenges of this labor market. However, small and midsized businesses continue to show their resilience.\nOur revenue retention remained solid as we focus on retaining clients and driving increased value and penetration of our HR outsourcing, HCM software and retirement solutions. Our overall HR outsourcing business continues to perform well with strong growth in worksite employees and record revenue retention. We achieved a major milestone this quarter. We now serve over 2 million worksite employees across our ASO and PEO business, clearly establishing us as an HR leader.\nOur industry-leading HR advisory services sets us apart and our certified HR professionals are truly a unique asset as they are advising our clients on HR issues as well as leveraging our HR technology and the analytics from our vast SMB data set to help our clients achieve greater operational efficiency, increase employee engagement and reduce turnover.\nWhile demand for our technology and HR outsourcing solutions remain strong, we continue to see shifts in what offerings clients find are the best fit for their current situation. Both early and during the pandemic, we saw lower demand for adding employer health benefits. We continue to see this trend and also high demand for our ASO solutions, driven by businesses seeking immediate assistance with HR issues and filing for tax credits, but delaying decisions on adding or changing their insurance offering to their employees.\nIn addition, the lower medical plan sales and participant volumes in our health and benefits area of our insurance agency that we discussed last quarter continued in the second quarter, and we saw some similar trends in our Florida at-risk insurance program in the PEO, impacting revenue growth in that area of the business. Awareness and demand of our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service, which helps clients maximize eligible tax credits continues to grow. To date, we've helped more than 50,000 clients secure billions in ERTC.\nA recent survey actually showed just 63% of business -- that 63% of business owners didn't even know that they were eligible for these credits. We continue to educate existing clients of the benefits as well as leverage this service to attract new clients. We continue to invest and enhance our product suite and customer experiences.\nIn November, we released our enhancements to Paychex Flex, focused on further streamlining the recruiting, onboarding, time and attendance, and benefits administration experiences. Through our HR technology, 3 out of 4 Paychex clients surveyed have shortened the time required from recruiting, screening, tracking and onboarding new employees. Those clients reported an average time savings of 26%, indicating that the typical 2-month recruiting cycle has now been reduced to just 6.\nI'm very excited about our Retention Insights offering, which continues to deliver strong results for our clients at a time when businesses remain committed to retaining their existing staff. This feature uses predictive analytics, coupled with our vast data sets to provide insights on potential employee flight risk. Clients leveraging the retention insights offering are showing a 15% reduction in turnover when compared against their industry peers. We're very pleased we received the Bronze Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award for Best Advance in HR Predictive Analytics Technology for this solution. This is the 10th consecutive year they've recognized us.\nDuring the quarter, we also were recognized with the IDC 2022 SaaS Customer Service Satisfaction Award for core HR. We are honored to have received this award as another confirmation of the power of our HR technology and the quality of our advisory services. These awards continue to validate that Paychex is a technology leader and that our focus on HR is delivering real impact for our clients and our employees.\nAt this time, we're heading into our critical year-end season. We are fully staffed in both sales and service, and we have good momentum. I want to thank all the employees in advance for all their hard work and dedication in making this the best year-end ever.\nNow I'll turn it over to Efrain, who will take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. You know the customary comments, take a look on our press release if you have any questions on that.\nLet me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 8% to $895 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, largely ERTC and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions.\nI will note that revenue from our ERTC service benefited second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1%. We anticipated ERTC revenue would moderate in fiscal 2023, but strong demand and execution have led to better-than-expected results. While ERTC was a tailwind to Management Solutions growth for the first half, it will become a moderate headwind in the second half.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 4% to $273 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and revenue per client. The rate of growth was tempered by the impact of factors John previously discussed, including lower medical plan attachment and participant volumes along with the mix shift to ASO. And I would just note on PEO and Insurance Solutions, Insurance Solutions was significantly below the growth rate of PEO.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 54% for the quarter to $22 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 7% to $718 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support the growth of our business.\nOperating income increased 7% to $472 million with an operating margin of 39.7%, in line with the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period.\nNet income increased 8% to $360 million and diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.99 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% from the quarter to $359 million and $0.99 per share, respectively.\nQuick summary of year-to-date financial results. Total service revenue and total revenue both increased 9% to $2.4 billion. Management Solutions increased 10% to $1.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 6% to $556 million. Op income increased 10% with a margin of 40.4% with modest expansion year-over-year and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $731 million and $2.02 per share.\nLet's look at our financial position. It's strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.3 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of November 30, 2022. Cash flow from operations increased and was $686 million for the first half of fiscal 2023, and this was driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $569 million during the first half of 2023, our 12-month rolling return on equity was an absolutely stellar 46%.\nNow I'll turn to the guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first half results, obviously, in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance in many areas, but moderated the range for PEO and Insurance Solutions based on factors previously discussed.\nUpdated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%; PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%; interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million; total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%; and other income expense net, and I'd just remind you that the net of our debt service plus earnings on our corporate portfolios, that number is now expected to be income of $5 million to $10 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%.\nGuidance for margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we do anticipate meaning towards the upper end of the range on operating margin and the lower end of the range on effective tax rate.\nTurning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate that total revenue growth will be approximately 6% and that operating margin in the third quarter will be in the range of 43% to 44%.\nOf course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which could change if there are changes in the macro environment. We will update you again on the third quarter call, and I will refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information.\nI'll now turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Efrain. [Todd], we will now open the call for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please note this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gretchen, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal '23 earnings release. Joining me today are John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer.\nI do want to start out by saying that all of us are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Ian that is approaching Florida at this time. Certainly, our employees, our clients and everyone else in those areas, we hope are safe.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And this teleconference is, of course, being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available for approximately 90 days.\nWe'll start today's call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will then review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and then we'll open it up for your questions.\nI will start out by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call as -- in my role as CEO of Paychex. On August 24, we announced I'm retiring as CEO effective October 14. That's after our 2022 -- fiscal 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. However, I will remain in my role as Chairman of the Board.\nJohn Gibson, on the call today, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO. John has been a member of the executive leadership team since 2013 and has been instrumental in the success of Paychex during his tenure. We have executed on a long-term succession plan, and I'm confident that John is the right person to lead Paychex into its next phase of growth. Really many best days ahead of us.\nI want to thank all of you also, you directly, for your interest in coverage of Paychex, some of you for more than 2 decades and for your good questions and feedback over my 12 years as Chief Executive Officer. I also want to publicly thank Efrain. Everyone knows he's one of the best CFOs in the business, and we've done over 40 quarterly calls together. And more than any -- more than a CFO, Efrain has really been a leader on our executive team and who provides not only great counsel, but is known for his intelligence, his integrity and also music trivia. You can try that out on some time.\nFiscal 2023 is off to a great start with a double-digit growth in both revenue and earnings compared to the same quarter last year. We have a record level of first quarter sales with strong trends continuing in the mid-market, retirement and HR outsourcing in particular. We have had continued success in the selling of our suite of innovative products from HCM technology to HR solutions that help businesses become more efficient and address complex HR issues in a challenging time for many businesses.\nWe continue to regularly monitor our key leading indicators for signs of changes to the macroeconomic trends. And while we have seen some moderation in key issues, we have not yet seen any significant changes. As an example, the latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch showed that workers of U.S. small businesses continue to benefit from higher wages.\nNew jobs continue to grow but at a more moderated pace, and job growth at U.S. small businesses remains resilient even in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Employment levels at our existing clients have continued to increase as they're finding more people to fill those positions, consistent with these findings of our HR -- of our Small Business Index.\nI will now turn the call over to John, and he will provide you with some highlights surrounding our technology and product suite and results. John?\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you, Marty, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you. Based upon our recently released Pulse of HR survey, it's obvious that businesses of all sizes continue to be challenged with attracting and retaining talent, improving their operational efficiency and working to increase their financial flexibility. Our continued investments in innovative HR technology, combined with our unmatched HR expertise, truly and uniquely positions us to help small businesses and mid-sized businesses navigate a very dynamic and challenging environment.\nEarlier this month, we attended the annual HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, where once again, Paychex demonstrated the latest of our innovations. We showcased significant enhancements to the Paychex Flex recruiting and applicant tracking experience, which is designed to digitally deliver candidates to clients faster and allow them to leverage mobile technology to recruit, screen and then onboard candidates in a unified and simple-to-use experience. Already, our digital onboarding experience was utilized by over 1.7 million new hires in the last year alone.\nWe also introduced our latest innovation, Paychex Voice Assist. And really, this is a natural extension of the expansive and ever-growing and utilized self-service capabilities that we have at Paychex. And coupled with our award-winning Paychex Pre-Check offering, which allows employees to further participate in the payroll process by reviewing their gross to net payroll calculations prior to payroll processing, Paychex Voice Assist now enables HR and payroll administrators and small business owners to manage their payroll and HR tasks while on the go through any Google Assistant-capable device. This provides a hands-free experience that includes voice recognition and verification security.\nI'm proud that Paychex is the first HCM solutions provider to offer voice-activated capabilities such as these. Our technology offerings continue to garner national recognition. Paychex is proud to be recognized for the sixth, I repeat, the sixth, consecutive year by NelsonHall, a global analyst and research firm, and it positioned us as a leader in its 2002 (sic) [2022] NEAT report for service providers.\nPaychex Flex was recognized for its comprehensive technology as one of the most advanced HR platforms that brings the power of benchmarking, data analytics as well as digital service enablement to drive operational efficiency and improve the employee experience. I also want to mention that we have once again, for the 12th consecutive year, been recognized as the nation's largest 401(k) recordkeeper by total number of plans by PLANSPONSOR magazine. We were also recognized by them as an industry leader in the number of new plans that we added in 2021.\nIt's obvious that our retirement business continues to be an area of strength for us as many business owners and their employees are focused on financial wellness as a key benefit and issue. In addition, our Pooled Employer Plan offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace with approximately 4,000 new plans onboarded during the first quarter alone.\nWe continue to see strong demand for our Employee Retention Tax Credit service. This helps clients maximize their eligible tax credits and thus, provide them more financial flexibility. To date, we have helped over 45,000 clients secure over $8.6 billion, that's $8.6 billion, in combined ERTC and paid leave tax credits. We continue to have the opportunity to educate more of our existing clients on the benefit of this service as well as leverage the service to attract new clients.\nWe have started off the fiscal year '23 strong. And while there is uncertainty in the macro environment, our solutions and business model have in the past and continue today to prove their resilience. We help our clients to succeed under any macroeconomic conditions. We continue to focus our product road map on the needs of our clients and anticipate releasing further enhancements this fiscal year designed to continue to provide them a positive digital user experience and help them utilize HR technology to simplify their processes.\nNow before I turn the call over to Efrain, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you, and yes, Marty, you're going to continue to hear this over and over again over the next couple of weeks. But I want to say thank you to Marty for his tireless dedication and strong leadership of the company over the years. And for me, personally, for his mentorship and his friendship for the nearly decade that he and I have been working together.\nUnder Marty's tenure as CEO, Paychex has more than doubled its revenue and transformed into a leading HCM technology solutions company. Today, Paychex is a tech company, and it's a tech company because of Marty's vision and his leadership. Marty, it's been a pleasure to work alongside you, the leadership team and the nearly 17,000 now employees of Paychex, and I look forward to continuing our relationship in our new roles.\nAs I've said many times and to many people, we're the same great company. It's the same great leadership team. It's the same great employees. We're just each playing a little different roles as we move forward. I know that our collective focus on our purpose, which is to help small and mid-sized businesses succeed, will continue to drive us in the future as it has in the past.\nI'll now turn the call over to Efrain to discuss our first quarter financials.\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and, therefore, involve risks. Refer to the customary disclosures.\nLet me start by providing key points for the quarter and finish with a review of fiscal 2023 outlook. As Marty and John already mentioned, Q1 was strong. Our financial results for the first quarter included service revenue and total revenue that increased 11% to $1.2 billion.\nManagement Solutions revenue increased 12% to $906 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration; HR ancillary services, largely our ERTC product; and price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions.\nI'll note that the revenue from our ERTC service benefited our first quarter revenue by about 1% to 2%. While we had anticipated ERTC revenue would continue in fiscal 2023, strong execution both in sales and service allowed us to realize some of the revenue a bit earlier in the year. While ERTC was a tailwind to growth for the first quarter, its benefit will decline as the year progresses. For the full year, the impact will be marginal to growth.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $283 million driven by growth in average worksite employees and PEO health insurance revenue. The rate of growth was tempered by a lower rate of health insurance enrollment in both the PEO and the insurance agency, together with continued softness in workers' compensation rates. So that really is a little bit more focused that the insurance agency has more of an impact on the revenue there.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 24% for the quarter to $18 million primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 11% to $711 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general cost to support growth in our business. In addition, PEO direct costs increased due to higher medical plan enrollments compared to the same period last year.\nOp income increased 12% to $496 million with an operating margin of 41.1%, an expansion of 20 basis points over the prior year, a bit above where we anticipated it being in the first quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. Both periods reflect discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp payments. However, the prior year also reflected an increase in state taxes.\nNet income and diluted earnings per share both increased 14% to $379 million and $1.05 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 15%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% for the quarter to $372 million and $1.03 per share, respectively.\nOur financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, and our borrowings are at approximately $800 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $364 million during the first quarter, a small decrease from the prior driven by fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income. And we paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $285 million in the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 46%.\nNow I'll turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first quarter results and our view of the evolving macroeconomic landscape. One thing I want to emphasize as I walk through the guidance. We don't provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. What we try to do is give you a sense of where we anticipate the quarters will fall. So I'd ask that you keep that in mind.\nThe majority of our guidance remains unchanged from that provided in June with the exception of an increase in our expected growth for adjusted earnings per share. Let me provide some color in certain areas as follows.\nManagement Solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, but now we anticipate it to be towards the upper end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is still expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, but we now anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million, but is now again anticipated to be towards the upper end of the range.\nTotal revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%, but again, based on what I just said, is anticipated to be towards the upper end of that range. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 11% to 12%, increase from the previous guidance of 9% to 10%. I just want everyone to remember, I'm talking about adjusted diluted earnings per share.\nSo turning to the second quarter. Our current thoughts are that we anticipate revenue growth will be approximately 7%, and we expect operating margins to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which could change if there are significant changes to the macro environment. We will update you again on the second quarter call, and I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information.\nI'd also like to take a moment to thank you -- say thank you to Marty for his years of service to the company. It's been an incredible pleasure working alongside you, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I can say that for all of the shareholders on the call, there was never a moment, never a conversation where putting the interest of shareholders didn't come first. And so I know that, that will continue under John's leadership. So -- the other thing I'd like to say is that the company that we're reporting on today simply would not be where it is today without Marty's efforts.\nAnd one other thing that I want to add, too. For the investors on the call, we filed a supplemental proxy statement this week relating to our say-on-pay proposal. We'd ask that investors who want a position in Paychex take a look, read that closely. I'm always available. The management team is always available for any calls that you'd like to schedule to discuss that.\nSo with that, let me turn it back over to Marty.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, John and Efrain. Thank you very much for the comments and for your updates. And also, of course, we wouldn't be here where we are today at the company without our over 16,000 employees, who have worked so tirelessly for our clients and for our shareholders.\nWe'll now open it up for your questions and comments. Gretchen, please open it up, please."

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please begin.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today are: Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer.\nThis morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended May 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations website and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on the website for about 90 days.\nWe will start today's call with an update on business highlights for fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and we will then open it up for your questions or comments.\nWe are very pleased to close on our fiscal year with yet another strong quarter. Our successful fiscal 2022 results reflect strong execution across the company. This includes our sales teams highlighting our value proposition, our service teams in retaining clients, our cross-functional partnership to get new products in front of clients quickly and a solid success in HR outsourcing and in the mid-market.\nOur adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 24% reflects both strong revenue growth and margin expansion to an operating margin of approximately 40% for fiscal 2022. Our focus on cost control, lower discretionary spend and operating efficiencies has allowed us to both invest in our business and expand operating margins.\nMacroeconomic trends have been positive this year, but with inflation at a 40-year high, there are concerns for potential of a recession in the near future. We continue to monitor key leading indicators for any signs of a change in the macroeconomic environment, but have not seen any signs of deterioration at this time.\nTypically, the first signs of a macroeconomic recession would be a decline in employment levels at existing clients and uptick in non-processing clients or a slowdown in sales activities. These indicators continue to trend in a positive direction.\nThe latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch reflected a 12-month consecutive -- a 12th consecutive month of increasing hourly earnings gains, though we did notice slowing a bit of the pace of job growth in May. However, this is more reflective of being near full employment and the difficulty of finding employees.\nJob growth at U.S. small businesses remained strong in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures.\nEarlier this year, John Gibson was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been leading our service operation since 2013 and we're glad to introduce you to him on this call and have him participate. I will now turn it over to John, who will give us an update on our sales and service performance. John?\n\nJohn B. Gibson\n\nPresident & COO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Marty. I'm happy to be joining all of you today on this call. and provide an update on our performance, both for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year '22. We finished the year with over 730,000 total payroll clients with growth driven by both strong sales and retention. In addition, we now service approximately 2 million work-site employees to our ASO and PEO offerings, with 18% growth in the fiscal year.\nWe had a record level of new sales revenue for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Our sales teams truly executed across the board from digital sales in the low end and continuing momentum in the mid-market and very particularly strong demand in HR outsourcing and retirement. This reflects the strength of our value proposition and was aided by the improved sales productivity by our continued investments in demand generation and sales tools.\nOur service teams have worked tirelessly to both support our clients and our sales growth throughout the year. We are very pleased with our revenue retention, which was comparable to our pre-pandemic record of last year. We have continued to make strong progress in hiring, and we actually accelerated some hiring into the fourth quarter to ensure we are fully staffed and ready to execute our goals in fiscal year '23.\nWe believe that by partnering with our clients and remaining agile and flexible in how we meet those needs, we will provide them the ability to focus on running their business and increase their success in navigating today's very complex business environment. Their ability to rely on Paychex to make the complex simple will result in their continued success and will, of course, then lead to continued elevated retention that benefits everyone.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Marty.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We continue to help our clients deal with the issues they consider most pressing. We were recently recognized for doing just that by receiving the HR Tech Award from Lighthouse Research and Advisory for the best SMB-focused solution in the core HR workforce category for the third consecutive year.\nWhat stood out about Paychex Flex was our ability to rapidly respond to changing conditions, delivering a product that is consistently up to date on the latest requirements. We have been able to help clients navigate challenges, including recruiting and retaining talent during the great resignation, gaining access to government stimulus programs like the employee retention tax credit, enhancing benefit offerings and transitioning to a digitally-enabled distributed work environment.\nOur strong and resilient product suite of HR, payroll, insurance, retirement and PEO have been strategically designed to help businesses maximize every opportunity presented to them. We continue to see expanded utilization of our recruiting and applicant tracking solutions designed to help businesses find talent in a low unemployment environment.\nOur deep integration with Indeed is helping our clients gain access to a strong set of candidates. Over 70% of the client employees hired through our Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module were sourced from Indeed, the world's largest job posting site.\nOur retirement solutions are also experiencing record demand due to state mandates and the need for differentiated benefit offerings to retain top talent. The introduction of our Pooled Employer Plan further differentiates our solution set. We now help over 104,000 businesses and over 1.3 million client employees save for a dignified environment retirement with industry-leading mobile technology, which allows employees to enjoy enrolling their retirement in just 4 clicks.\nHR has historically been tasked with helping businesses stay compliant and manage their talent. With Paychex HR, we deliver on these goals while also helping businesses operate more efficiently. Paychex HR helps businesses replace paper with modern, easy-to-use digital processes through our cloud-enabled Flex mobile technology.\nGiven current challenges with hiring and the rising costs brought on by inflation, we address head on the need for businesses to operate more efficiently. Over 1.7 million client employees were onboarded through a completely digital experience during fiscal '22.\nMaximum gains and efficiency are obtained when the leading technology we bring to payroll HR and time collection and scheduling are brought together. Paychex Pre-Check debut in January and the early adopters of Pre-Check have benefited from the proactive approach of letting their employees preview and approve their checks prior to processing. Prospects have been excited about the time savings and problem avoidance that comes with Pre-Check.\nWe also continue to innovate in the PEO space, Paychex PEO offers a continuum benefits that is unique to our clients from traditional health dental and vision funded by the client to comprehensive employee volunteer packages, including options for employees to purchase anything from critical illness policies to pet insurance to new and emerging benefit offerings like student loan subsidies, robust benefit offerings designed for part-time employees, telemedicine and mental health counseling.\nOur Paychex PEO provides a differentiated approach to benefits designed to help our clients attract and retain top talent.\nManaging cash flow is also a top priority for businesses as they are struggling to address the impact of supply chain issues and rising inflation. We continue to find ways for customers to access government stimulus including helping our clients gain access to over $8 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. This builds on the momentum of our $65 billion of PPP loan program initiative in 2020. Our award-winning PPP forgiveness tool has been instrumental in helping our clients transition 96% of those loans to full loan forgiveness.\nAt Paychex, we know our employees are critical to who we are and what we do, and I believe that our focus on employees and their well-being has helped us manage through the competitive labor market. We are identified as one of the America's best employers for diversity by Forbes Magazine and were recognized by business group on health for offering one of the nation's top health and well-being programs with the Best Employers: Excellence in Health and Well-being award.\nAs fiscal '22 came to a close, I'm very proud of the excellent results we had for the year and excited about our continued growth. I want to thank our 16,000 employees who are key to our success and have done a tremendous job in this ever-changing environment.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal 2023. Efrain?\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marty, and good morning to all of you. It's great to join you at the end of one of the most successful years in the company's history despite the success what you have from us and will always have is a team that's grounded and we'll continue to work to deliver shareholder returns that lead the market.\nI'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking investment statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information. They're pretty modest adjustments.\nI'll start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, quickly hit on full year results and then provide some guidance for fiscal '23. For the fourth quarter of fiscal '22, as you saw, about service revenue and total revenue increased 11% to $1.1 billion. Management Solutions had another strong quarter, increasing to 12% to $845 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in our payroll client base. The higher revenue per client reflects product attachment across our HCM suite, higher employment levels within our base, pricing, revenue from ancillary services, including our ERTC service.\nERTC revenue reached approximately 1% of total service revenue. That's for the year. While we do not anticipate this revenue stream to continue at that level, there still remains a significant opportunity both inside and outside our base.\nPEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 10% to $284 million, driven primarily by higher average work-site employees in health insurance revenue. Interest on funds held for clients increased just 2% for the quarter to $15 million due primarily to growth in average investment balances. Note that while recent rate hikes did not have a significant impact on the fiscal quarter, they will provide a tailwind for next year.\nTotal expenses increased 11% to $750 million. The growth in expenses resulted primarily from higher compensation costs due to increased headcount to support our growing client base wage rates and performance-based compensation. In addition, we continue to invest in our products, technology and marketing.\nAnd I just want to call out the margin in the quarter. We made very deliberate choices in the fourth quarter to invest back in our client base and in our -- among our employees. That's why all of the flow-through did not go down to the bottom line, and that was a deliberate choice that we think leads to the future sustainability of the business. And we think we're positioned very well as a result of those choices.\nOperating income increased 11% to $394 million with an operating margin of 34.4% and adjusted operating margin was flat for the reasons I just said. And we anticipated some hiring and marketing spend and pull back into Q4.\nNet income increased 13% for the quarter to $296 million and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.82 per share despite all of that investment. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 13% for the quarter to $295 million and $0.81 per share, respectively. As I said, the adjustments were relatively modest.\nFull year fiscal '22, let me touch on that quickly. You saw total service revenue and total revenues both increased 14% to $4.6 billion. Expenses, including onetime costs incurred during the prior year, increased 8%. Operating income and adjusted operating income increased 26% and 23% respectively, the $1.8 billion, adjusted operating margin was 39.9%, an expansion of 310 basis points over the prior year. And I just called that out.\nYou will search high and low to find some companies that are at that level. We've delivered that. We delivered that while investing in the company because we think that we're not playing a game for the next quarter or the next year. We're playing a game for the long haul. That's what you do when you're that kind of company.\nDiluted earnings per share increased 27% to $3.84 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 24% to $3.77 per share. I'm really proud of our financial position. We delivered all of that and our financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion. Total borrowings were $806 million as of May 31. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion during the fiscal year. We translate earnings into cash. That's what we do. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. So earnings and cash flow were really strong this year.\nGiven the strong performance and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.79 per share. And as many of you know, we have one of the leading dividend in certainly in our sector and industry. And during fiscal '22, we paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends, and we also repurchased 1.2 million shares of Paychex common stock for $145 million. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a superb 45%.\nNow let's talk about '23. I'm going to turn to the upcoming fiscal year. And our current guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, interest on funds held for clients expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million. And let me just call out that this reflects increases in line with what we understand the Fed is saying through the end of this calendar year.\nWhat does that mean specifically? It means that we think that interest rates by the end of calendar year 2022 will be approximately 3.25%, give or take, and we are assuming that in our plans at this stage. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 40% to 41%. Not only did we deliver a 300 basis point increase, we are committing to additional leverage as we go into next year despite having made a lot of investments in the business as we've gone along.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be another stellar 44%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Just so you all remember, that is a combination of both interest expense less the income on the portfolio. That's why it's $5 million to $10 million. We expect that we will see income from the portfolio to offset some of the interest expense.\nOur effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share at this point we expect to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which, as all of you know, has some uncertainty. We, like you, week-to-week, struggle to understand sometimes what are the signals that are coming out of the federal government.\nI want to reiterate something that Marty said. The indicators in our business are strong as we exit the year. So that's not a concern certainly in the first half of the year in as much as we see it right now. Second half, we will see. So where is inflation going to be? We don't know that. What is the Fed exactly going to do? We think we have some indicators. We will see what they end up doing.\nWe obviously, given all of those comments have better visibility into the first half of fiscal '23 than the second half. So here's what we think about the first half. In the first half of the year, at this stage, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% with an operating margin of approximately 39%. That's what we think will happen in the first half.\nAnd then for the first quarter, getting a little closer, we currently are anticipating total revenue growth will be in the range of 9% to 10%, with adjusted operating margin in the range of 39% to 40%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change, and we'll update you again on the first quarter call.\nLet me refer you to the investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I will turn the call back to Marty.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Efrain. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions or comments."

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Executive Officer of Paychex.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Katie, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today, of course, is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opens financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, this teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days.\nI will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the third quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 -- fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions or comments.\nOur strong results for the first half of the year continued in the third quarter as both management solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues increased by double-digit percentages year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%. We continue to see positive trends in our key indicators and strong momentum across all our lines of business, driven by a combination of solid internal execution in a market-leading suite of innovative solutions uniquely designed to address today's HR challenges. This momentum carried through calendar year-end and selling season, resulting in record sales performance and near-record level retention. Our value proposition continues to resonate in the market, particularly in this challenging environment.\nAnd our sales results were broad-based with double-digit growth in new annualized revenue across all lines of business HR outsourcing, retirement, payroll and insurance. We continue to improve our traction in the mid-market space, which has benefited from the investments we've made in our technology and product suite. Our client retention continues to surpass our expectations and remains near our record levels of the prior year, well ahead of the prepandemic levels. Our revenue retention remains at record levels for the year as we continue to bring in even more focus on our higher-value clients. Demand for our comprehensive set of solutions, including our integrated Paychex Flex human capital management technology our comprehensive ASO and PEO HR offerings remains high.\nBusinesses of all sizes are facing continued pressure from supply chain and labor shortages, the rising cost of doing business and ongoing challenges with COVID-19. As staffing challenges persist, businesses are looking for integrated technology to deliver increased productivity, operating efficiencies and access to experienced HR professionals to help them navigate a complex regulatory environment and complicated distributed workforce dynamics. We continue to invest in our product set to differentiate us in the market and deliver solutions designed to meet the growing challenges of running a business.\nOur most recent product launch introduced a series of enhancements designed to support both an on-site and distributed workforce, including an enhanced iris scanning time clock, which delivers a hands-free punch experience with industry best security, including both the iris and facial scanning. A new secured document management solution, which allows clients to safely and confidentially store documents like employee vaccination status within the Flex platform, and a compensation summary, which allows clients to provide employees a full view of their compensation to promote retention, and enhancements to our financial wellness offering to help client employees more effectively budget, manage debt and safer retirement.\nEach of these enhancements builds on our award-winning Paychex Flex technology. Several industry awards provide the latest validation of the benefits of our innovative technology. We were recently recognized with 2 awards for our Paycheck pre-check solution, the 2022 BIG Innovation Award presented by the Business Intelligence Group and a 2022 Stevie Award for innovation in customer service. Paychex precheck combines payroll, HR, time and attendance and employee self-service into a complete system of check imbalances ensuring that work hours are never missed, pay rates are properly applied paid time off is not overlooked and that pay is always calculated correctly.\nWe have seen a strong response in terms of both client adoption and client results with Paychex precheck. Our focus on helping clients maximize available government stimulus was recognized by accounting today as we were awarded with a top new product award for our employee retention tax credit service. We recently surpassed billion in total credit process for our clients. I'm very proud of the agility demonstrated by our IT and service teams to proactively assist our clients with these government subsidies to help them sustain and enhance our clients' financial position. Our mobile and self-service technology solutions deliver efficiency for our clients and their employees, and we have seen significant increases in flex sessions both through the desktop and mobile devices with an increasingly -- an increasing proportion of the sessions, of course, done by the mobile app. Contributing to this growth is traction we are gaining with wearable devices. The use of the Apple Watch has increased mobile usage for our time and attendance solution. Obviously, this provides another safer method for employees to punch in and out and avoid exposure to COVID and other illnesses.\nI am particularly proud of 2 awards that Paychex has been recently been honored with -- for the -- our commitment to business integrity through our best-in-class ethics, compliance and government practices. For the fourth time, Ethisphere named us one of the world's most ethical companies. We are also on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. These awards acknowledge our ethical business practices, our values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership. We believe doing business the right way leads to greater success. Ethisphere agrees, noting that their 2022 FX index, a collection of publicly traded companies recognized as recipients of this year's world's most ethical companies designation outperformed the comparable index of large-cap companies by almost 25% over the past 5 years. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who live our Paychex values each and every day.\nIn summary, we are very proud of our performance during the third quarter and year-to-date, and I thank our employees for their tiles dedication during our busiest time of the year. Our set of innovative technology and service solutions provides industry-leading value to our clients and leaves us well positioned for a strong finish for fiscal 2022 and and continued growth into fiscal 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?\n\nEfrain Rivera\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Treasurer, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThanks, Marty. Good morning. Thanks for being on the call. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures.\nLet me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll follow up with greater detail in certain areas. I'll finish with a review of fiscal '22 outlook and some very, very very preliminary thoughts on fiscal 2023. Our third quarter results reflect strong internal execution, as Marty mentioned, and continued improvement in key indicators, service revenue and total revenue increased 15% to $1.3 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 13% to $960 million driven by higher client bases across our HCM suite, check volumes, revenues per check -- revenue per client, payroll funding and outsourced service for temporary staffing clients and ancillary HR services resulting from ERTC, which Marty just mentioned. Although the revenue associated with ERTC is substantially nonrecurring, ERT has afforded Paychex the opportunity to continue to deepen its relationship with clients, increased revenue with clients and showcase its industry-leading suite of solutions for small- and medium-sized businesses. A significant opportunity remains both inside and outside our base.\nAnd one thing I'd like to point out here is -- there are a number of HCM platforms in the market. You all know that. But they're only a select few partners. In order for you to be able to access the opportunities that arise from having an HCM suite with bundled ancillary services, you have to be a partner, not simply a platform provider. There's only a few of those in the market. Our results demonstrate the power of being one, and we are one of the leading ones. So our results are not surprising to us. Our clients want to know the difference between a Meet and a PEP. They want to know what the implication of the ERTC is for their business. and they want to know what the implications of legislation like the Secure Act is how it's going to impact their business.\nWe know that. We're experts and we're the partner that our clients look to for solutions to those issues. Our results demonstrate that this quarter. Now client base growth in the quarter resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 21% to $302 million. Our PEO business benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million as the impact of lower average interest rates was partially offset by an increase of 13% in average investment balances. And obviously, this is one of the things that's going to change as we go through both the remainder of the year and into the next year. We haven't seen the impact of rising rates yet, we will.\nTotal expenses increased 11% to $713 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs, headcount to support our growing client base and continued investment in our product technology, sales and marketing. Op income increased 20% to $563 million with an operating margin of 44.1%, and an expansion of almost 200 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 22.3% compared to 24.2% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to both to stock-based compensation benefits -- or payments, I'm sorry. In addition, the current quarter includes tax benefits related to prior year research and development expenses incurred in the production of customer-facing software. So we had an adjustment there, and that's part of our lower tax rate. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 23% for the quarter to $431 million and $1.19 per share, respectively, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to $419 million and $1.15 per share, respectively.\nI'll quickly highlight our results for the 9-month period ending February 28. Both revenue and earnings have grown by double digits for each of the past 3 quarters. Total service revenue and total revenue growth of 15% each to $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Expenses, excluding onetime costs incurred during the prior year, increased 7%. So we've gotten very good leverage. Operating income and adjusted operating income were $1.4 billion, increases of 31% and 27%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $3.02 per share adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $2.95 a share.\nLet me walk through the highlights of our financial position. As you all can see, it's very strong. cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments now total of $1.4 billion and our total borrowings of approximately $806 million is where it stood at February 28, 2022. Cash flow from operations was robust in the quarter. It was at $1.2 billion, an increase of 34% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated for the 9 months was $1 billion, up 36% over last year. The increases were driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.06 a share for a total of $75 million. during the first 9 months, our 12-month rolling return on equity was 44%. Those are strong numbers.\nNow I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter despite some disruption from Omron -- we've taken that into account -- we've taken into account the fact that third quarter results exceeded expectations, but have tempered our outlook given the changing macroeconomic environment, and we provided the following updated fiscal '22 guidance as you saw, Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. And PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. Previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 12%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. we won't see the impact yet significantly of Fed raises.\nTotal revenue is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 40% up from previous guidance of 39% to 40%, and -- adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%, up from previous guidance of approximately 44%. And Other expense net is expected to be approximately $15 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. We previously guided in the range of 24% to 25%. And -- adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 22.5% to 23%. We previously guided to growth in the range of $18 million to $20 million. This guidance reflects our intention to continue to invest in our businesses to help drive future growth. And I would just comment that in the fourth quarter, we intend to take some additional actions with respect to investment in the business. So that will temper the margin a little bit as we head into '23.\nNow comments on '23. We're currently in the process of preparing our annual plan. We'll provide guidance, final guidance for fiscal 2023 during our fiscal 20,224th quarter in June. But I want to provide a preliminary thought process around fiscal '23 as we enter the planning cycle. On a preliminary basis, we believe the total revenue growth will be in the upper single digits. At this stage, I'd call that somewhere around 7% and I would caution that there's a lot of work to be done to digest completely where the Fed is going to end up and how we position the portfolio. So there's still some moving pieces there. The other thing we would say right now -- with respect to operating margins, we expect an improvement of about 50 basis points. You know that typically, that's what we're aiming for. We've had very, very significant operating margin improvement, but we're still committed to leveraging the business. So that's where we're at right now.\nI want to call out 1 thing that's important. Other expense net is going to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million next year due to the absence of equity gains that we got this year. So we have a portfolio that we invest in and equity gains during the year. Those will not be in next year, at least we don't -- can't plan on them or anticipate they will be there. And then the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Of course, -- all of this is very preliminary. It's subject to revision, and it's based on assumptions that could change given the uncertain macro environment, especially as we gain additional insight into what the Fed actually will do. We'll update you again on the fourth quarter call. So with all of that, I'll turn it back over to Marty.\n\nMartin Mucci\n\nChairman & CEO, Paychex, Inc.\n\nThank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions. Katie?"

Again, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your continued patience. Your meeting will begin shortly. Again, if you do need any assistance today, please press star zero, and a member of our team will be happy to help you.\nPlease stand by. Your meeting is about to begin. Good morning and welcome to Paychex's second quarter fiscal 2026 earnings call. Participating on the call today are John Gibson and Bob Schrader. Following the speaker's prepared remarks, there will be a question and answer period. If you would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, please press star two on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. I would now like to turn the call over to Bob Schrader, Paychex's Chief Financial Officer.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThank you for joining us to discuss Paychex's second quarter fiscal 2026 results. Our earnings release and presentation are available on our investor relations website. We plan to file our Form 10-Q with the SEC within a couple of business days. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our investor relations portal. Today's call includes forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some risk. We encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for additional information on factors that could cause actual results to differ from our current expectations. We will also reference non-GAAP financial measures. A description of these items, along with the reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures, can be found in our earnings release. I would now like to turn the call over to John Gibson, our President and CEO.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nThanks, Bob. I'll start with the second quarter business highlights, and then Bob will cover financial results and our outlook. Afterwards, of course, we'll open it up for your questions. We delivered solid second quarter results, with revenue up 18% year over year, and adjusted operating income grew 21% over the prior year, driven by higher productivity as we continue to demonstrate our longstanding capability to be the best operators and begin to drive AI into our operational systems and overall DNA as a company. We are proud of the significant progress we've made in advancing our strategic priorities, including the Paycor acquisition and integration, and our data and AI initiatives. We continue to make progress on the Paycor integration. As best operators, we continue to identify additional expense opportunities and now expect approximately $100 million in cost synergies for fiscal year 2026.\nWe also remain on track to achieve the revenue synergies targets we set for this fiscal year. We continue to strengthen broker relationships through our Partner Plus program and refresh value proposition centered on delivering greater value to our partners as we continue to expand and fully integrate the Paychex enterprise team with Paycor. Cross-sales efforts continue to gain traction, including broker-referred PEO deals and with larger clients than initially anticipated. We continue to make steady progress executing our go-to-market technology and cultural integration initiatives that are critical in an acquisition of this size, scale, and complexity. Our PEO business continues to perform well, achieving market-leading mid-single-digit worksite employee growth driven by strong demand and near-record retention. Our PEO solution empowers small businesses to offer competitive benefit packages on par with Fortune 500 companies, supporting their efforts to attract and retain talent in a tight labor market.\nOctober enrollment for our at-risk Florida MPP plan came in largely as expected, and early indications for January enrollment give us confidence in finishing the year with solid revenue growth in the PEO. Regarding the labor market, our clients' workforce levels remain relatively stable, with flat same-store employment growth this quarter. Our Small Business Employment Watch index, while down from last year, has remained relatively stable throughout 2025, and our other indicators show no signs of a recession at this time. Small businesses continue to face challenges sourcing qualified talent in competitive labor markets, areas where we believe our solutions are uniquely positioned to add value. They are also looking for ways to manage cost. We remain confident in our value proposition, and demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continues to be in line with our expectations.\nWe are halfway through the year and pleased with the progress we've made today. As we look at where we are today in the middle of our busy selling season, we have seen some trends that impact a few key metrics. Bob will provide more color about how we are thinking about those in the context of the balance of the year. Given the increased focus on AI, this morning we published a presentation outlining why we believe Paychex is well positioned to succeed in this AI era, why we see ourselves as less exposed to AI employment risk, and how we are capitalizing on AI-driven opportunities. I encourage you to review it, but I'll share a few highlights. Starting with AI-related employee risk, we believe our portfolio is less exposed due to our client base and our business model.\nOver 70% of our clients' employees work in blue- and gray-collar industries that are harder to displace, and the majority work at smaller businesses where staff often wear multiple hats, and AI investment tends to be lower. If AI disrupts large firms disproportionately, talent may shift to smaller businesses benefiting our clients. Meanwhile, our clients continue to face talent shortages, and AI can help improve efficiencies to address those gaps. From a business model perspective, our revenue model has a significant fixed base fee component and has for years, providing downside protection against employment fluctuations. We also differentiate from tech-only providers by combining advanced technology with HR experts who provide strategic guidance and nuanced advice, which is difficult for our competitors in AI to replicate. In terms of our differentiation, AI success hinges on data quality and data scale.\nWith one of the largest proprietary data sets in the industry, we believe we have a powerful competitive advantage to drive superior AI performance. In December, we proudly announced our patent-pending AI-powered Knowledge Mesh system, which transforms unstructured data such as phone calls and emails into a connected searchable network. This innovation unlocks deep insights and enables smarter workforce management, positioning us at the forefront of AI-driven solutions. Paychex has a strong track record of delivering pragmatic AI solutions focused on measurable outcomes such as time saved and friction removed from everyday processes. We are accelerating AI innovations that enhance efficiency and improve client outcomes while fueling our growth. We recently launched our GenAI-powered employment law and compliance platform that helps clients and Paychex HR experts efficiently navigate thousands of constantly changing federal, state, and local laws, generating compliant documents, and it stays current with the regulations.\nSince its deployment, we have seen strong adoption and frequent utilization by our HR experts. This advancement is key to our strategy to have the leading expert-embedded technology platforms for businesses of all sizes, and we will be integrating across our three platforms: SurePayroll, Paychex Flex, and Paycor. We are proud that both Paychex Flex and Paycor platforms were recognized as leaders in NelsonHall's 2025 HCM Technology and GenAI evaluation. This distinction highlights our strength in delivering intelligent HCM solutions that enhance client outcomes, streamline HR processes, and support our partners. We are excited to share that our first agentic AI pilots were a success this quarter. They autonomously handled thousands of payroll calls and emails with nearly 100% accuracy, decreasing payroll processing time and enabling our service teams to focus on higher-value strategic advisory support.\nWe are continuing to invest in these capabilities and are actively exploring additional applications across the business. In sales, we are leveraging a new GenAI platform to drive revenue growth and improve efficiency by equipping our sales teams with instant answers, tailored scripts, objection handling, and prospecting insights. These AI-driven advancements reinforce our commitment to being the digitally driven HR leader by reinventing the HCM experience as AI-first. By leveraging our unique blend of innovative HCM technology, our unrivaled data, and the deep HR expertise, we believe Paychex is well positioned to capitalize on the evolving AI landscape to drive growth, expand margins, and strengthen our leadership in HCM. I will now turn the call over to Bob to discuss our financial performance and outlook.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThank you, John. I'll begin with an overview of our second quarter financial results, followed by an update on our fiscal 2026 outlook. Total revenue increased 18% over the prior year to $1.6 billion. Management Solutions revenue grew 21% to $1.2 billion, with Paycor contributing approximately 17 percentage points to the growth. Growth was primarily driven by product penetration and price realization, but was moderated primarily by softer-than-expected revenue per client. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $337 million, driven primarily by continued solid growth in the number of average PEO worksite employees, as well as an increase in PEO Insurance revenues. Our PEO continues to perform well, but our insurance agency remained a headwind in the quarter due to continued weakness in workers' compensation rates and lower health and benefit volumes.\nInterest on funds held for clients increased 51% to $54 million, reflecting the addition of Paycor balances and higher realized gains due to some strategic repositioning in our long-term investment portfolio. Total expenses increased 27% to $986 million, primarily driven by the Paycor acquisition. Excluding Paycor, we estimate expenses grew low single digits. Operating income margins were 36.7%, and adjusted operating income margins increased by approximately 80 basis points year over year to 41.7% in the quarter, driven by increased productivity and continued cost discipline. Diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.10 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $1.26 per share. Our financial position remained strong, with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion, and total borrowings of approximately $5 billion as of the end of the quarter.\nOperating cash flows for the quarter were $445 million, largely driven by net income, and during the quarter, we returned $514 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends and share buybacks, and our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 40%. I'll now turn to our guidance for fiscal 2026. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which has some uncertainty. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2026 outlook with the exception of raising our earnings expectations. However, given some of the trends that we've discussed earlier, we would now expect to come in towards the low end of the ranges for Management Solutions, PEO, Insurance, and total revenue.\nInterest on funds held for clients is now expected to be at the high end of the range of the $190 to 200 million range that we previously provided, and we are also raising our earnings expectations with adjusted diluted earnings per share now expected to grow between 10 and 11%, and that is up from the 9 to 11% we shared last quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately 24%. All other guidance metrics remain unchanged. Let me turn to the third quarter just to provide you some color with where we would expect to come out in the third quarter. We anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 18%, with an adjusted operating margin between 47 and 48%. Just as a reminder, Q3 is one of our larger quarters.\nWe have both, from a revenue and operating margin standpoint, driven by the higher margin year-end fees that get recognized during the quarter. I'll now turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nThank you, Bob. We will now open the call for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your keypad. To leave the queue at any time, press star two. Once again, that is star one to ask a question. Thank you. Our first question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\n\nMark Marcon\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Nice to see the earnings strength. The stock's down 3.5% right now, and you've got so many positive things to talk about, but I wanted to address initially the underlying reason, which seems to be around Paycor. When we go through the math in terms of the contribution from Paycor, it looks like even if we adjust in the form filings from December, that the growth wasn't significant. So I was wondering, that seems like it's optics, and there's obviously integration challenges, but can you just initially address this, what you're seeing with regards to Paycor? Then I'd like to follow up. Thank you.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nSure, Mark. This is Bob. Happy holidays. I'll address the first question. First of all, I think as we've talked about in the past, we're trying to give our best estimates of what the contribution to Paycor is. I think we've talked about how we've integrated the business. I think when you do that math, we're giving round numbers, approximately 17%. I think to give a point-specific number would imply a level of specificity that just isn't there given how we've integrated the businesses. But I think when you do that math, and whether it's 17%, a little bit north of that, a little bit south of that, as you know, you've already done kind of looking at last year. If you look at their quarter last year, that ended in December, and December is when they have a lot of their year-end processing fees.\nSo you have to adjust, and I know you're trying to adjust for that. I'm not sure that I have your math in front of me, but our best estimate on a pro forma basis—now you're asking us to explain how it grew versus last year when we didn't own the asset. Our best estimate during the quarter is that it grew between 8% and 9%, and it was certainly in line, too, I would say, slightly better than what we saw in Q1.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nYeah. And Mark, I would just say this is John. When we look at it against how we're measuring it, we continue to progress well against the opportunities we identified to drive value. We're achieving the revenue synergies that we laid out for this fiscal year for the first half. And quite frankly, we're beating the cost synergies. As you recall, our original target was $80 million, and we've now committed to $100 million, and we have more opportunities we're pursuing. Client and revenue retention in that client base continues to exceed plan and is at their historical levels. Activity in bookings continued to accelerate through the first half of the fiscal year. As you can imagine, when we announced the deal in January, a lot of uncertainty. As you can imagine, bookings kind of dropped at that point in time.\nWe finally owned the asset in April, and we've seen steady progress. Actually, we see broker bookings in the quarter. We're back to pre-acquisition quarters again after dropping for the announcement. So we feel good about where we are at this point in time. As Bob said, we've integrated the businesses. We're upselling our products and services. Some of that revenue goes to other places. We're moving clients, of course, across platforms where potentially the client's not in the best platform position, both in terms of moving Flex clients into Paycor, moving Paycor clients into Flex. And so there's a lot of movement going on. It's extremely difficult to get with precision because we're not looking at the business as Paycor as a standalone business. It is now our enterprise, 100-plus market segment. I hope that helps.\n\nMark Marcon\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nThat does. And just as a follow-up, just two quick ones. Quick commentary just with regards to, I know we're halfway through the selling season, but what are you seeing so far? And then secondly, just on the cost side, you're clearly doing a great job. And I'm particularly excited about what you're talking about with regards to the agentic pilots that have handled things with 100% accuracy. What does that make you, how does that make you feel with regards to the longer-term cost synergies that you could end up getting from some of these efforts? Thank you. And happy holidays.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nThank you, Mark. Let me segment. Let's start kind of maybe with demand. I mean, I think we feel good about our competitive position and staffing going into now, as you know, in the lower end of the market. We're not even into the selling season yet. Q2 was in line with our expectations, and past Q2s. I'd say demand for our solution remains consistent with historical levels. Really no surprises there. Our activity is actually up pretty significantly. What I would tell you is what I see is I see a lot of shoppers out there. Again, we know that people are very cost-conscious right now. And I would say prospects and clients are looking for value and managing their cost very carefully. And that's what we see in the market.\nFeel good about where we are in terms of where we are at this point in the selling season and feel good about our setup going into the remaining of the selling season. Look, on the cost side, look, we take great pride as a company in our DNA of being the best operators. I think we have been working with, I don't know whatever AI was called before it was AI. We've been doing that. That's built in. Certainly, the revolution that's occurring and the speed of the advancement as we're getting our hands on these tools. We've now deployed AI to every one of our 19,000 employees. And we have a process by which we're encouraging them to build their own AI models to help them each and every day. So I think we're just scratching the surface of what the potential is.\nWhat I would tell you is, at least strategically for us, we're going to continue to balance what we've always done, which is we're going to continue to grow the business, invest in growth and innovation, the top line of the business. As we do that, we're going to continue to look for ways to expand margins proportionally to that. And then we're going to invest. And we're going to continue to invest in our back office. One of the great opportunities that I see for us with AI and some of the things that we're doing with our patent-pending Knowledge Mesh is we're really putting our service providers in a position now where they can be true advisors.\nI think what we've learned in our advisory side of the business is when we have an advisory relationship with the client, lifetime value goes up, retention goes up, and our ability to upsell goes up. So I think you'll see that as we display some of the transactional work, we're going to do a lot. We're going to invest a lot in really repositioning our people to be more proactive and be proactive advisors for our clients and look for ways that we can use our data assets and information we have to provide higher value to our clients. And we think if we do that, we're going to improve the lifetime value of the customers. And I think we're going to create a competitive moat that's going to be very challenging for others to have.\nI encourage all of our competitors to add 1,000 HR professionals to their business model next week, so.\n\nMark Marcon\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Baird\n\nGreat. Thanks a lot and happy holidays.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nThanks, Mark.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThanks, Mark. Happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Happy holidays. Let's start on the fiscal 2026 growth guidance here. So just wanted to dig in on your comment there, Bob, on the greater comfort at the low end of the range now. I know you noted penetration and price realization have been driving growth so far, but I guess softer than expected revenue per client. So could you just talk about that a bit more?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I mean, it's really across the board, and it isn't in any one specific business. I mean, obviously, when we look at those two items that you highlighted, price realization and product penetration drive revenue growth and revenue per client growth, and that has been strong. It just was a bit softer than what we assumed in the plan. I'd probably call out a few areas. We are seeing a little bit smaller deal sizes, and John can comment on that. We've seen a little bit less attachment upfront at the point of sale. Obviously, those things impact revenue per client. And then I would tell you on our HR outsourcing solution, which is one of our highest value solutions, volumes have been in line or better than our expectations, but it has been at a little bit softer rate than we assumed when we put together our plan.\nAs we sit here halfway through the year, I would say the year has largely played out in line with our expectations, both from an execution standpoint. Certainly, the macro has held up. PEO has been strong, actually probably has performed a little bit better through the first half of the year. But we've seen some of these trends in revenue per client. We're assuming that will continue in the balance of the year. We still have the important selling season in front of us. And so we thought it made sense to kind of steer more towards the low end of the range. I think when you look at consensus, that's where most people are. I think we had gotten some feedback that people thought we had too much risk in the back half.\nThose are the things that kind of caused us to guide more towards the low end, Brian.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nYeah. Brian, I'd just add from a demand and market perspective. I think Bob said it, but our average revenue per customer is up year over year, and it's consistent with what we've historically delivered. I think our certain view was, given all the additional products and services and additional modules, I think we're now up to close to 100 different additional products and services that we could sell. I thought we were well positioned. What I would tell you is I think prospects and clients are looking for value, and they're managing their costs very closely. So when I look at sending a rep into the field and they have three bundles: good, better, best to sell, and we're making some predictions about historically how people have picked those various bundles. What I would say is I think people are being careful in what they're adding.\nSo we were generally adding two modules additional. Our three modules, maybe we're adding two today. The good thing is we're getting the clients. Now we got to go back, and as we've had a track record of doing, is going back into our base and upselling them as times go forward. So that's just what we see in the market right now. Like I said, a lot of activity. The proposal activity and the meeting activities are solid. I just think there's a lot of shoppers out there. That's what I would say.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Understood. Thank you for that detail. My follow-up is on Paycor. So the 8% to 9% that you mentioned earlier, is that adjusted to remove out the December Form 10-Q filings? Just any context around that, please.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYes. Absolutely. Again, as I mentioned, Brian, it's an estimate at best, but I assume that most of you guys would go back to their Q2 and look at what the recurring revenue is. My team did that, and we're like, \"Well, that doesn't make sense.\" And then we realized that, hey, December, we didn't own the asset last year, but we realized that they had all their form filing in December. And so when we adjust that and compare apples to apples and adjust it to our fiscal quarter, and you do that math, that's where you get to the 8% to 9% pro forma growth.\n\nBryan Bergin\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nOkay. Thank you. Happy holidays.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYep. Happy holidays.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nBye.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Bryan Keane with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nHi, guys. Just to follow up on Paycor, is it still a low double-digit grower, or should we be modeling more in this 8% to 9% growth territory for this fiscal year?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I think we generally said, Brian, we expected to be double digits. I would tell you the revenue per client comments that we made related to maybe being a bit softer than our expectations. It was interesting. It was really across the board to every line of our business. We saw that. And same thing with Paycor. I do think we saw some similar trends with maybe not as much attachment upfront than what we assumed, as well as maybe a little bit lower average deal size. So, hey, we'll see where it plays out as we get through the balance of the year, but I would still expect it to be, if not low double digits, high single-digit grower as we move forward.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nYeah. Got it.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nAgain, Brian, again, just probably for everybody, because this is where I continually want to make sure everybody understands how we're managing the business. I understand why you're asking the question, why you're asking it. Bob and the team are trying to model two different companies at the same time. We've integrated the business, and we have integrated businesses, and we're going into the 50,000 Paycor clients, and we're beginning to upsell them. Remember, we upsell something, ASO or insurance or whatever we upsell. That revenue is going to show up somewhere else in the P&L. We're also, they had a lot of customers in the lower end of the market. Those clients may have been better off on our Flex platform in terms of what they were looking for.\nOr, we had clients in the upper end that were on Flex platform that were in our P&L that we're moving over to Paycor because that's a better technology fit for them. So, you've got all this geography moving that's going on. So, it's very difficult, I think, for us to, as we continue to get into the cross-sell movements, that we get into the customer success movements that we're doing, that, again, we just really got to begin to look at Paycor as our enterprise segment for Paychex going forward. We're going to continue to try to do everything we can to guide you guys and give you the information as best we can. But I wanted to at least give Bob and his team some air coverage and some of the challenges that we're creating for them because we're saying we're going to go do this.\nIt's the right thing to do for the customer, and it's the right thing to do for the shareholders too.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nNo, that's helpful. And then just to follow up on managed services. So the smaller deal sizes, the less attachment, and the softer rates in HR, are those all macro-driven, or is anything fundamental happening there, competition causing some of that softness?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. There's nothing competitive that I'm seeing. It's all macro. But what's interesting is when you go across, remember, we've got market segments set up. So we've got various market segments based upon client size. And so we start there. Then we got multiple bundles for each of those segments that each of the sales forces go. What's interesting, you go to retirement, and we go out in the retirement market, and typically we see an average client size of X. And lo and behold, the average size is lower. Okay. Now we go over into our under 10 segment. Go out there. We're selling the volume. We have an average number of client size. We also have a regular distribution of our three packages they can sell. And lo and behold, in that market, average size is lower.\nWe're seeing more clients pick the lower-end bundle. They're still buying, but they're buying the lower bundle. They're not buying as many of the middle bundle. Then you go to the mid segment, and you see some of these similar trends that are going across each of the segments, and you just begin to realize that there is a macro. What I think you're seeing is what I said, which is I think there's a lot of people shopping, and I think a lot of businesses are trying to manage their costs. It's not that they don't want to have the bell and whistle, but at the end of the day, they may only be able to afford the bell. And what we got to do is just continue to try to see if we can sell them the whistle down the road.\n\nBryan Keane\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nOkay. Very helpful. Happy holidays.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nJohn Gibson\n\nPresident and CEO, Paychex\n\nSame to you, Brian.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nHey, thanks so much. I'm just curious, given the smaller deal size commentary you just shared there, any consideration or thought to changing your pricing and packaging of bundles? Maybe there's an opportunity here to sell more at a more value or at a lower price. Curious if this is a new normal, how you might adjust is really what I'm trying to get at here.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. Well, Tien-Tsin, I would say between SurePayroll, Paychex Flex, and Paycor, and the various bundles and options that we have, I think we have everything we need in our arsenal to position the client. I would say there's more work, and we're still working through this from a go-to-market strategy. We don't have reps selling across all the platforms like probably we will someday, but that'll take time to do. But my point is I think we have everything that we need. I actually view that our pricing is an advantage to us, particularly some of the commentary that I hear out there. We have a lot of fixed fee components to our pricing model. We think that's advantaged in given the employment situation. So we feel good about where our pricing is.\nWe do have initiative and effort underway across the three platforms to look at that strategically, but that's something that's going to take time both for us to model and for us to execute. But we feel right now that between the three platforms and the various bundles and offerings that we have, that we have something pretty much for everyone. And so I feel good about where we are.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. No, it does seem like opportunity, which is why I thought I'd ask the question. Thank you for that. Just my follow-up just on PEO that did come in better. Similar question. Is the insurance rate a bigger selling point here? I'm just trying to understand if you're reading it that way and there's an opportunity to lean harder on the PEO front given this macro situation that we're in. Perhaps prospects are valuing the insurance offering more in this push towards value. Your thoughts?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nWell, I feel like the PEO is performing extremely well on all aspects of it: demand, retention, really across the board. Like I said, the numbers would be even more impressive for the PEO and Insurance market if we didn't have the insurance agency dragging us down. We're making some changes there to improve that performance. But we've never been a cheap insurance value proposition, and nor do we intend to be. I will tell you that a lot of clients are shopping. Healthcare inflation is a real issue. It probably feeds some of the macro comments I just said in terms of if you're a business and you're facing high healthcare costs, now you got to come up and figure that out.\nWhat we did see in our enrollment is we've not seen clients dropping healthcare at the rate we saw last year, which is a positive thus far. So that's pretty much through and done. We kind of know that. But that puts a lot of pressure when you're getting 10% to 15% increases. So I think we're doing very well externally. I do think that when you look out in the PEO market, there's a lot of very high rate increases going out there. We may be a beneficiary from some of that coming into the market. But again, cheap benefits is not our value proposition. Never has been, never will.\n\nTien-Tsin Huang\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYep. No, thanks so much for the details.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nAndrew Nicholas\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to talk a bit about the upsell motion to PEO specifically. Kind of a two-parter here. One on just overall Paycor client receptivity to PEO. And then also kind of in this environment, and you just spoke to some of the unique dynamics with healthcare inflation. Is the percentage of worksite employees going into the PEO business from your kind of HRMS segment evolved at all? Is there a bigger percentage coming from existing clients than previously, or has that remained relatively steady in this environment? Thank you.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. And it's remained consistent, and the PEO is one of our stronger outside-the-base organizations. So it's probably 50/50, I would imagine, somewhere around there. Maybe sometimes it tilts a little more outside-the-base. Sometimes it tilts a little more inside-based. But it's not an inside-the-base play. Your question on the Paycor side, we've actually been very pleased with the receptivity of the PEO. Remember, our PEO did partner with brokers, insurance brokers already. So that was the one area of our business where we already had a broker relationship program. Insurance brokers tend to use the PEO as one of the alternatives that they position to their clients where it makes sense. And we've actually been very pleased with the early progress. And what we've been most pleased with is the size.\nBeen very surprised at the size of deals that we've been able to both get on our ASO, HR outsourcing, but also on the PEO side. So we are working jointly within the Paycor client base, working with our customer success leaders as well as with our brokers to make sure that they know that we have this option, and it's a great option for them to consider if their client is facing a rate that maybe we can do better at in the PEO, so.\n\nAndrew Nicholas\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you. And then switching gears, really appreciate the AI investor presentation that you put out, including some of the examples of wins and benefits. Is there any way to quantify, or maybe it's not in the numbers yet, but kind of the impact on cost efficiency? It sounds like you're doing things using Agentic AI to streamline payroll without people. Is that something that is already impacting headcount? You'd expect to impact headcount in the future, or is it more having those same individuals do more with their current hourly availability or capacity?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. Look, I think that we have been using predecessors of AI and early models of AI for decades. Since I've been with the company, it's been a big part of what we're doing. You don't get to our margins. You compare our margins to other players unless you're using every tool in your arsenal to be able to drive margins. Now, what we're going to do with that margin, because I think this is important, our point of view is what's going to continue to differentiate us is we're going to have experts and advisors embedded into our technology, and we're going to more proactively engage our customers in the small and mid end with our people. And so when we're using these tools, we're making our people more productive, and then we're driving more advisory conversations and relationship-building conversations with our customers. That's our goal.\nNow, over time, do I think we can grow our business without adding as much headcount as we historically have? Absolutely. I think that's well within, and we've done that for the last decade. If you go back, if you looked at the number of service people we had when we had 400,000 clients versus what we now have with 800,000 clients, I think you would say that we've done that very effectively, and I think that's a model that we will continue to work on.\n\nAndrew Nicholas\n\nEquity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThank you very much.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you so much. A couple of follow-up questions for me. First, on the incremental realized gains on the investment portfolio from Paycor, are those gains included in the guide moving forward, and were they contemplated when you put together your forecast for the second quarter?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I mean, it's definitely in the full year guide because it already happened in Q2, and it was contemplated. Maybe I'll just provide a little more color on it, James. I mean, this was part of our integration plan taking over the client funds portfolio at Paycor. They were largely invested short, and just given our liquidity and financial strength, our main priority when we took it over was understanding the cash flow needs of it, but really wanted to allocate that long to lock in those balances before interest rates went down. And so that was part of what we did in Q1, and that was our main priority. And when we looked at, they did have a long-term portion, but their long-term portion, I would say, skewed more on the front end of the curve.\nAnd so when we put the two portfolios together, and I started looking at the treasury team, started looking at the duration of our long-term portfolio, it was getting well below what we typically target. Typically, we're around three years on average duration, and we were getting closer to two. So this was an opportunity that was identified early on. We didn't get to execute it on it in Q1. We knew we were going to execute on it in Q2. Now, I had some sense of what the impact was going to be. Didn't know exactly what it was going to be. It was probably a little bit higher than what I thought it was going to be. As you know, interest rates move every day. But this was certainly part of the plan, and I think a big win now that we've taken over the balances.\nI would tell you, we now have a more balanced laddering of the securities across the curve when we look at our long-term portfolio.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. And then I want to just check in on kind of some of the go-to-market changes you've made. You've talked about territory resets and broker program launches. What are you seeing there, and how are you feeling about your ability to deliver efficacy, and when do you expect to see the full benefit in bookings momentum? Thanks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah, James, I'll handle that one. As you know, we did a lot of that disruptive work right after the acquisition was announced. We talked about that in prior pieces. We tried to move very quickly. We reestablished a lot of new teams, new territories, reset that. So a lot of that was done right after the acquisition was in April, May timeframe going into the fiscal year. As you can imagine, that was disruptive. And so what we've been focused on is really continuing to just drive execution there, continuing to support the team. So look, we feel good about where we are. That hard lifting is kind of behind us. We've kind of got the model set up. We've got the go-to-market message. We have the Partner Plus program out there for the brokers. Everybody knows what their list is. Everybody knows what they should be doing.\nEverybody knows what they're selling. We're continuing to see activity in bookings accelerate through the first half of the year. So again, these things take time. This is very complex, as you can imagine, particularly when you do this much go-to-market disruption. But I'm very pleased that, like I said, every quarter since we've done this, we've seen improvements. The broker network on the Paycor side is still contributing 50% of the bookings, and we continue to see that up. We actually saw in Q2 we got back to booking numbers from brokers that were similar to what it was before the acquisition was announced. So I'm pleased with the progress, and I feel very good about where we are from a staffing perspective going into the remainder of the selling season.\n\nJames Faucette\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThanks, James.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nSamad Samana\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first, Bob, just on the question about the guidance and nudging toward the low end, you mentioned in that comment that, I guess, you got feedback from investors that maybe there was risk in the back half guidance, and that's partly what drove the recalibration. I guess I just want to understand, is it the underlying variables in the model that made you think the lower end is better for us to be at because of what you're seeing in the business, or is it more about de-risking the numbers because we all thought it might be tough to hit? Just maybe help us understand the mechanics, the variables, and what the adjustments were to bring that lower end, which implies that back half reduction down.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYep. And maybe I misspoke, Samad, there. I mean, certainly, that did not factor into what we did with the guide. I think we felt like the guide, when we came out with it in Q1 and last quarter, we felt comfortable with it. I was just making the point that, in addition, we'd heard that you guys thought we were too aggressive in the back half, but that's not really what drove the guide down. Again, I would tell you through the first half of the year, it's largely played out from an execution and certainly from a macro standpoint where we expected. It's the couple of things that we highlighted on the Management Solutions side. It is strong revenue per client, just a little bit softer than what we had in our plan, and we talked about some of those reasons.\nAnd then on the PEO side, the PEO has exceeded our expectations through the first six months of the year. We had another quarter of double-digit demand. We had near-record levels of retention. We continue to see strong worksite employee growth. And when you look at the PEO and insurance category, and this is what I was telling everyone was going to happen because you start getting easier comparisons as you move into the back half of the year, and we anniversary those enrollments that we have where we had the headwind last year. Sequentially, PEO and insurance went from 3% in Q1 to 6%. And that's despite some of the challenges that we continue to see on the agency. John mentioned we're working on that, but the agency has been a headwind. We continue to see some challenges with workers comp rates and lower health and benefit volumes.\nThe PEO grew high single digits in the quarter. So it's really the combination of what we're seeing on the agency side, on the PEO and insurance business, and then the revenue per client comments that we made on management solutions. That's really what's steering us to the lower end of the ranges. I was just also commenting that you guys were already kind of there from a consensus standpoint and had shared that feedback that you thought we were too aggressive, but that certainly didn't play into our thinking. Although I do appreciate your feedback, Samad.\n\nSamad Samana\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nAppreciate that. Thank you for that, color. Then maybe just one follow-up. I know it's been covered about what you're seeing in terms of maybe new bookings and average revenue per customer there. In terms of pricing inside the install base on renewals, are you seeing any either? Is it kind of a similar consistent pricing environment where traditional price increases are going through? Are you moderating price increases on renewal, maybe discounting? Just help us understand what's going on inside the existing book of business, both in maybe Management solutions and PEO.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nNo, we continue to drive the value proposition and value in the customer base, and we continue to get the realization that we expected in our plan, which I would also say is higher than what we were getting prior to the pandemic. We've added a lot of product to that. So we've added some things to the bundle to support our clients in understanding why the price is the price, but we've added additional product capabilities, and we've been able to sustain that in the payroll business, so.\n\nSamad Samana\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Have happy holidays, guys. Thank you again.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThanks. Same to you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\n\n[Company Representative] (RBC Capital Markets)\n\nCompany Representative, RBC Capital Markets\n\nHey, good morning, guys. This is Will Chiem for Ashish Sabadra. Appreciate you guys taking our question. Maybe just on the AI presentation report. On slide 15, as you guys are thinking about the go-to-market strategy and the monetization there, do these AI products lend themselves to more pricing power than some of the non-AI products, improving kind of revenue per client? Or, given the current environment where there's some churn or cost, is it helping offset some of that with the productivity improvement that you're able to show to clients? And just in general, from a timing perspective, do you see any uplift from these products as they start hitting more clients or there's more traction gain from an adoption perspective? Thanks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex",
    "content2": "It's a broad question. I would say that AI is going to help us in multiple ways improve the value proposition for clients in terms of our ability to do more for them, probably at less cost, the ability for us to provide them more insights. When I look at what we're planning to do across each one of the three platforms over the course of the next year in terms of redoing the customer experience and making it more AI-forward, I think our clients are going to love that. I think that's going to help us not only keep our existing clients, but I think it's going to allow us to attract new clients as well. The productization of AI, I think, is still to be determined.\nAnd I think there are areas where we will add that into the bundles as a way to enhance and support the price increases that we've just talked about and driving additional value. And then I think there are other components of AI that will have such value to the customer that I think the customer will be willing to pay for that. Think of our Retention Insights where our clients that are using that, our Compensation Insights that we're providing. Again, where else can you get if you're a small, medium-sized business owner information to tell you whether or not you're paying your chef the right amount or the wrong amount? And we have over 250 million data points relative to that. Those are compensation surveys. Every large company in America can buy them. Small business owners have never had access to that kind of information.\nThat's something we think is valuable. We think they'll pay more for. So again, I think AI is going to be very interesting as we try to productize it. We're going to try to improve the customer experience. We're going to try to add more value to our products and differentiate ourselves because very few players are going to have the depth of insights and information from our data that we can provide inside the technology. And then at the end, I think there's going to be additional products and services that we're going to be able to charge incremental for because they're going to provide more value or simply things that have never been available to small, medium-sized businesses. And that's one of the great things I think Paychex has done historically is we democratize these things that are only for big businesses, right? That's our 401(k) business.\nWhen you look at our insurance business, it's in the low end of the customer segment where not a lot of people don't want to go, or they don't know how to go and do it profitably. We're going to continue to look for ways that we can drive AI into our products for all of our customers, so.\n\n[Company Representative] (RBC Capital Markets)\n\nCompany Representative, RBC Capital Markets\n\nAwesome. Thank you, guys. Happy holidays.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Kartik Mehta with North Coast Research. Your line is open.\n\nKartik Mehta\n\nExecutive Managing Director and Director of Research, Northcoast Research\n\nHey, good morning, John and Bob. Hey, John, you've talked about customers being a little bit more price conscious, especially around where the economy is. But then you also said you feel good about getting the price realization that you had originally anticipated. I'm wondering, just trying to make sense of those comments, if customers are being more cost conscious, will they not push back on pricing, or are you doing something different to make sure that doesn't happen?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nWell, I think you got to separate the world, right? I think once you're a customer of ours, we're going to do everything we can to make sure that you love us and that we're providing additional value and support to you to the point where you're saying, \"Yeah, this was worth what I had.\" And quite frankly, then you've got the whole prospect area. What I would tell you is we go out into the market, what we see, people are shopping. They want a lot of things. They're not willing to pay. They're not willing to pay or they're only going to pay a certain amount for what they're going to do. And what we're seeing is they're picking the lower bundles or they're not attaching as many things. It's not that we're not getting attachment. Let's be very clear. We're getting the attachment.\nWe're just not getting the attachment at the rate that we had put in the plan, which is what we assumed. I don't know if that answers your question or not.\n\nKartik Mehta\n\nExecutive Managing Director and Director of Research, Northcoast Research\n\nNo, that helps. That helps. Hey, Bob, just a question for you on your buyback. It seems like the buyback was higher this quarter than you've done in the past. In the past, the strategy has been, \"Let's do enough to offset dilution.\" But it seems like this time it was a little bit more. I'm wondering, is that a change in strategy, a one-quarter event, or is this something you can continue doing?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I mean, yeah, good question, Kartik. Yeah. I mean, we had an existing authorization out there. We had capacity on it. And as you mentioned, I think our philosophy hasn't necessarily changed. We typically try to maintain a flat share count and buy back shares. The offset dilution, that being said, I think if you go back six months ago when we kind of closed out last year and provided our outlook for this year, I think as we sit here today, I don't think John and I believe that our future growth opportunities are any less today than they were six months ago. And six months ago, the stock was in the 150s. And so, hey, we're going to continue to focus on the fundamentals. I think I know we're going to continue to manage the business to try to continue to be a high-quality compounder.\nAnd my hope is over time that comes back into favor. And opportunistically, I looked at where the value was and pulled forward some future purchases. And so really no change in philosophy, just more opportunistic, Kartik.\n\nKartik Mehta\n\nExecutive Managing Director and Director of Research, Northcoast Research\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Bob. I appreciate it. I hope you and John have a great holiday.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nHey, good luck on Sunday. Go build.\n\nKartik Mehta\n\nExecutive Managing Director and Director of Research, Northcoast Research\n\nWe'll talk about that later.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll move next to Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\n\nScott Wurtzel\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions here. Bob, just had a question on the sort of Q3 guide and calling for a total revenue growth of 18%. I kind of do some back-of-the-envelope math and assume some degree of acceleration on the PEO side of the business as you lap the MPP headwinds. It implies not really too much change on the MS side. I'm just trying to kind of square that with some of the timing around Paycor form filing revenue that may show up in fiscal Q3. So any color you can give on the different moving parts there would be super helpful.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I mean, again, I don't want to get into the habit of giving quarterly guidance. We try to give you color. And obviously, I try to set myself up so I can at least be in line with the numbers. So we expect the business, as you mentioned, you're going to see acceleration like we did this quarter with the PEO in insurance. We're going to anniversary the annual enrollment in January and some of the headwinds from last year. And we're going to continue to make progress on Paycor, the integration, the synergy realization where we've had success. That revenue is going to start flowing into the back half of the year. So I'm sitting here in the middle of the year. We still have selling season. There's probably an element of conservatism in there, but we would expect the business to continue to accelerate.\n\nScott Wurtzel\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just on the AI side, I know you guys mentioned having sort of an AI-powered sales engine. Just wondering how much that's deployed across your sales force and any noticeable productivity gains that you're seeing off of that. Thanks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYes, got it. I would say that we launched it, maybe it's been 60 days ago, into a pilot group. And actually, it went rogue on us is what happened was we were going to do a pilot, and then people started hearing about it and started demanding it. So it's early on. We're certainly using it during selling season. It's a pretty powerful tool. And we're pretty much fully deployed at this point in time within the Paychex sales force. We're still doing some additional integration work on the Paycor side inside their go-to-market systems. But the sales teams are loving it at this point in time.\n\nScott Wurtzel\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Wolfe Research\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks. So I'm wondering just in the management solution segment if you expect the organic growth rate to improve off the current 4% levels just as we move into the second half. And then just any thoughts on a realistic organic growth rate for the MS business once you lap Paycor?\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nYeah. I mean, we definitely expect it to get better in the back half of the year. Jason, I mean, I don't want to give a longer-term growth until we get through this year with the integration. And obviously, synergy realization plays into that. But we expect some modest acceleration to the organic growth rate in management solutions, probably moving closer towards the 5% range over time. But definitely, there is some acceleration there in the back half of the year.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nUnderstood. Understood. And then I wanted to just ask a follow-up on PEO. I know we've talked about it already a lot on the call, but you're at 4.5% year to date, and you'll need to do, I guess, 7.5% in the second half to get to the lower end of the 6% to 8% range that you're pointing us to. And obviously, we know the lapping of the comps, etc. But maybe if you can just talk through any other factors driving the acceleration and just some commentary on your visibility to kind of get three points of acceleration from first half to second half. Thanks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nIt's a good question. I would start with pointing to the three points of acceleration that happened this quarter relative to last quarter. And again, some of that is I know there's been some confusion around it and concern. And a lot of it, there's strong execution there for sure. As I mentioned, we had double-digit demand and really strong retention again this quarter. But some of it is just the easier compared, Jason, as you move into the back half of the year. So we just anniversaried in October the annual enrollment. Last year, there were some headwinds from that. That's probably only 25% of the MPP enrollment is in October. The rest of it is in January. So you're going to have another lapping or anniversarying of the enrollment and the headwind from last year. So the comps are just going to get better.\nSo it's a combination of the comps getting better, and we continue to see strong execution in the business. As I mentioned, I mean, that 6% number was weighted down from some of the challenges that we see in the agency. The PEO grew high single digits in the quarter. So we feel really good about where we are with the PEO and as we move into the back half of the year.\n\nJason Kupferberg\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nOkay. Understood. Enjoy the holidays. Thanks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nHappy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I will now turn the meeting back to the presenters for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nBob Schrader\n\nSVP and CFO, Paychex\n\nThank you, Chloe. So listen, appreciate everybody being with us here Friday before the holiday. So just to summarize, we delivered a solid double-digit revenue and adjusted operating income growth this quarter. Very proud of the team and all the hard work that's went in. This has been a challenging year for both the Paychex team and the Paycor team. Coming together, working together, as you can imagine, going through integrations like this are always challenging from an emotional side, a cultural side, and a people side. You have to make some tough decisions. Everyone has to deal with change. And I've just been so proud of the team, not only the Paychex team, but the Paycor's team. As you know, we've had great employee retention there, and we've brought on some great talent into the organization. And there's no question to me that we're better together.\nAnd I think as we continue to come together as an organization around a One Paychex strategy that we're executing, I really think there's tons of opportunity. And that's why Bob said before, this combination added $10 billion of total addressable market. And so we like the runway in front of us. We like the team we have, and we're committed to executing as we go into 2026. So we're very proud of the significant progress we've made, our latest AI advancements, very proud of the innovation that's being driven across all the platforms. I really think it's going to further differentiate us and position Paychex for growth, margin expansion, which we're known for, and really leadership in the human capital management industry as we enter this new AI era that we're all entering. So thank you for your continued support and interest in Paychex.\nI hope everyone has a happy Hanukkah and a happy holidays.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This brings us to the end of today's meeting. We appreciate your time and participation. You may now disconnect."

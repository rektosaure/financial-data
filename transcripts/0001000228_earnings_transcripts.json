As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Strategic Finance Project Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the 2025 third quarter. With me on today's call are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that's forward-looking. Risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements, and the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and included in the Risk Factors section of those filings. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based on the company's internal analysis and estimates. Today's remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in Exhibit B of today's press release and can be found in the Financials and Filings section of our Investor Relations website under the Supplemental Information heading, and in our quarterly earnings presentation also posted on our website. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 4, 2025. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Lastly, during today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to a single question so that we can accommodate questions from as many of you as possible. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, Graham. Thank you for joining us. We are pleased with our financial results for the third quarter with sales growth accelerating in each of our reportable segments, including solid market share gains in our distribution businesses as we are once again focused on driving growth. Now that the cyber incident is fully behind us. The strong sales performance was a key driver of the underlying improvement in our operating income, our successful execution of the BOLD+1 strategy, including the financial performance of our investments in high-growth, high-margin businesses also sets the foundation for strong future growth.\nWith the continued input from KKR, we have made good progress on advancing the value creation initiatives we announced last year -- last quarter actually. Based on our first phase of work, we believe we have the opportunity to deliver over $200 million of improvements to operating income over the next few years. We have begun executing on these multiyear projects with key areas of focus that include centralization of support services, indirect procurement, automating and simplifying processes and accelerating sales of corporate brand products. These initiatives support a return to our long-term goal of high single-digit low double-digit earnings growth. In addition, our Board has approved an amendment to the strategic partnership agreement, giving KKR the right to increase its stock ownership up to 19.9% through the purchases in the open market.\nNext, let me touch on a few key highlights from the quarter that advance our BOLD+1 strategy. We remain on track to achieve our goal of over 50% of non-GAAP operating income coming from high-growth, high-margin businesses by the end of 2027, which is the current [prestigic] planning cycle. And that's -- in addition, we expect more than 10% coming from our corporate brands. So that's in total, about 60% of our non-GAAP operating income coming from these high-growth, high-margin businesses and corporate brands. While we have continued to strategically invest in our business, we have focused recent capital deployment on accelerating the repurchase of the company's shares. Our Board recently approved a $750 million increase in this program, and our current expectation is to continue to execute buybacks at a similar pace to the past quarter.\nBuilding on the momentum from our successful launch of our new henryschein.com global e-commerce platform in the U.K. and Ireland. We are rolling out a phased launch in North America. We expect to start the European rollout in 2026. Turning now to a review of our business units. I'll start with the global distribution and value-add services group.\nHere, we delivered solid sales growth in the third quarter across our global distribution group in both merchandise and equipment sales. In general, patient traffic remains steady throughout the quarter. Notably, sales growth accelerated in the U.S. merchandise area, which reflects strong corporate brand sales growth as well as the positive impact of targeted promotional programs we initiated during the second quarter, resulting in a continued increase in our market share in the United States.\nIf we turn now to the U.S. dental equipment sales, which increased in the low single digits with digital equipment delivering double-digit growth. We continue to experience a lower average sale price in digital equipment, but this was offset by strong volume growth. Traditional equipment sales declined slightly However, support de novos, we believe this is a result of the timing of installations. We introduced a new online financing program, which we believe contributed to the good growth in the U.S. equipment arena. Our order intake at DS World was good this year, and we expect this to help our equipment results in the fourth quarter. We expect to maintain overall U.S. equipment growth in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to the U.S. medical business, sales grew in the mid-single digits for the quarter. The growth reflects strong demand for medical products and for pharmaceuticals and particularly in the dialysis business, along with continued strong performance in Home Solutions. This was partially offset by lower demand for respiratory diagnostic products and a decline in influenza vaccine sales. Our international merchandise sales stable increasing in the low single digit in constant currencies. We look at the international equipment sales, yes, we had strong growth. Value-added services sales grew modestly with sales growth driven by consulting services, which includes our eAssist revenue cycle management business.\nNow let's turn to the Global Specialty Products Group. As a reminder, this group includes implants and biomaterials as well as endodontic orthodontics and orthopedic products. The third quarter sales reflected continued strength in implants and biomaterials as well as endodontics. We were particularly pleased with our implant performance which built on last quarter's solid trends. Sales growth was in the mid-single digits in constant currency, and we believe we continue to gain market share across most implant markets the particular ones where we have our stream. So where we service the market -- where we service the market, we have resources on the ground, we believe we're doing quite well in those implant markets. Sales growth was led by our value segment -- both SIN and biotech dental implant systems performed exceptionally well, each posting double-digit gains.\nThis was complemented by steady low single-digit growth in our premium brand by Horizons Camlog, demonstrating the strength of our broad portfolio of offerings. In the U.S. implant and biomaterial sales grew in the low single digits against a challenging prior year comparison. This growth, of course, reflects increased traction from our rollout of our BioHorizons Stepin propone implant and ongoing growth we achieved in the smart shape Helabuttons. We expect growth in these products to continue. The [indiscernible] Pro clinical product now represents approximately 1/3 of our U.S. implant sales, and it's important to understand that our customer feedback on this product offering is very, very positive.\nInternational implant sales increased high single digits once again driven by strong double-digit growth across the DACH region and Latin America, reflecting strong patient demand and execution by our regional team, which continues to be very good. Our andontic business delivered mid-single-digit growth for the quarter, benefiting from expanded sales reach through our U.S. distribution team. Orthodontics while still a small component of our specialty products has stabilized, and we remain focused on improving the profitability of the orthodontic business. And finally, our orthopedic specialty business posted solid double-digit sales growth.\nSo looking ahead, we are encouraged by the momentum across our specialty business. Now on the Global Technology Group side, here, we continue to accelerate our growth during the third quarter. driven by strong growth in the adoption of our core practice management solutions business, particularly our cloud-based platforms, including Centrix Sesen and Penta, as well as strong growth in our revenue cycle management solutions, including eClaims electronic billing and patient messaging. As a result, we are seeing growth in annual recurring SaaS subscription revenues as well as in transactional services. Practice Management software sales growth was again in the high mid-double digits this quarter, driven by a 20% year-over-year increase in the number of cloud-based customers, primarily from new Henry Schein One accounts.\nThe cloud-based strategy for us is doing very, very well. We now have over 10,500 Dentrix [indiscernible] subscribers. Revenue growth also benefited from recently launched revenue cycle management solutions now being adopted by practitioners as they seek to drive revenue and improve operating efficiencies. There are also some exciting new developments in AI in our technology group. Yesterday, we announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services to integrate its generative AI technology with [indiscernible] and Dentale. Among the benefits are a real-time duction system that uses AI to capture and summarize patient interaction, voice-activated charting, scheduling and communication tools to further personalize the patient experience and predictive business intelligence that automates claims validation and facilitates dynamic pricing tools.\nWe believe this will be a significant addition to the Henry Schein One uprate. And we expect these will help our customers drive incremental revenue and greater productivity in their practices. Let me now comment on the announcement we made earlier this year that I will be retiring as CEO at the end of the year while continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board. As we discussed on our last conference call, the Board started a formal search process supported by a nationally recognized executive search firm considering internal and external candidates and remains on track to announce my successor by the end of the year. Of course, I remain committed to ensuring a smooth and seamless transition. With that, now let me turn over the call to Ron to review our third quarter financial results and discuss 2025 guidance. Ron, please.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As usual, today, I will review the financial highlights for the quarter. and would like to remind investors that on our Investor Relations website, we also have included a financial presentation containing additional detailed financial information, including certain reportable segment information. Starting with our third quarter sales results, I will provide details on total sales, total sales growth as well as constant currency sales growth compared with the prior year. .\nGlobal sales were $3.3 billion, with sales growth of 5.2% compared to the third quarter of 2024, reflecting constant currency sales growth of 4.0% and a 1.2% increase resulting from foreign currency exchange. Acquisitions contributed 0.7% sales growth for the quarter. Our GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2025 was 4.88%, a decrease of 6 basis points compared to the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin for the third quarter was 7.83% and an increase of 19 basis points compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven by lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales, partially offset by lower gross margin.\nWe continue to drive improved operational efficiency by integrating acquisitions, restructuring and executing our new value creation programs. Gross margin was down 56 basis points year-over-year, primarily related to product mix and our global distribution group and in our Global Specialty Products segment, sequentially, gross margins versus the second quarter declined primarily due to the seasonality of flu vaccine sales in our medical business. Of note, gross margin stabilized in the U.S. dental distribution business. Turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2025 on a non-GAAP basis was 22.9%. The lower effective tax rate reflects the nontaxable nature of the remeasurement gain recognized in the quarter. This compares with an effective tax rate of 24.9% for the third quarter of 2024. We expect the effective tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range in the fourth quarter, which is more in line with recent historical rates.\nThird quarter 2025 GAAP net income was $101 million or $0.84 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $99 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2025 non-GAAP net income was $167 million or $1.38 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $155 million or $1.22 per diluted share. Foreign currency exchange favorably impacted our third quarter diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 versus the prior year. Our third quarter results include a remeasurement gain resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of our previously held noncontrolling equity investment. That business has performed well since we made our initial investment. And as a result, we recognized a pretax remeasurement gain of $28 million this quarter.\nThis compares to a pretax remeasurement gain of $19 million in the third quarter of 2024. The remeasurement gain in the third quarter of 2025 and its related tax treatment contributed approximately $0.23 to EPS, which is approximately $0.08 more than the remeasurement gain recognized in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $295 million compared with third quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $268 million, representing growth of 10%. Turning to our sales results. The components of sales growth for the third quarter are included in Exhibit A in this morning's earnings release. So I will provide the primary highlights of the main sales drivers in each reporting segment. Starting with our global distribution and value-added services group, whose sales grew by 4.8%.\nWithin this segment, U.S. dental merchandise sales grew 3.3%, and U.S. dental equipment sales grew 1.2% and with strong growth in digital equipment. We ended the quarter with a good equipment order backlog for fourth quarter sales. U.S. medical distribution sales grew 4.7% despite lower demand for influenza vaccines and respiratory diagnostic products. Our Home Solutions business had another strong quarter, growing over 20% on an as-reported basis and 6% excluding acquisitions. International dental merchandise sales grew 6.0% or 2.5% in constant currency, driven by sales growth in Brazil, Canada, Italy, Spain and Australia.\nInternational dental equipment sales were strong with 10.1% total growth with constant currency growth of 5.7%, driven by sales in Germany, the U.K., Canada and Australia. And finally, global value-added services sales grew 3.3%, driven by consulting services. Turning to the Global Specialty Products Group. Sales grew 5.9% or 3.9% in constant currency. Our implant and biomaterials business experienced solid growth in the third quarter including double-digit growth in value implants and low single-digit growth in premium implants. We achieved modest implant sales growth in a stable U.S. market due to a high prior year comparable, and high single-digit sales growth in Europe, including low double-digit growth in Germany.\nWe also had strong results in the Global Technology Group with total sales growth of 9.7% and with 9.0% in constant currency. In the U.S., sales growth was driven by practice management software with double-digit growth in Dentrix Ascend as well as solid growth in our revenue cycle management business. Internationally, sales growth was primarily driven by double-digit growth at our Dentale cloud-based practice management solutions products. Turning to our restructuring program. From the restructuring program announced in August of 2024, the company recorded restructuring expenses of $34 million or $0.20 per share during the third quarter of 2025.\nWe expect to achieve annual run rate savings of more than $100 million from that restructuring program. Additionally, from the value creation initiatives announced last quarter, we believe the opportunity should deliver over $200 million of operating income improvement over the next few years. Therefore, we are extending our restructuring plan, and we will continue to record restructuring charges in 2026 and 2027. We expect these initiatives to support a return to our long-term goal of high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth. Regarding share repurchases. During the third quarter of 2025, the company repurchased approximately 3.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $68.62 per share for a total of $229 million.\nAt the end of the quarter, Henry Schein had $980 million authorized and available for future share repurchases, which includes $750 million that the Board of Directors authorized in September. As Stan mentioned, our expectation is to continue to execute buybacks at a similar pace to this past quarter. Turning to our cash flow. We generated strong operating cash flow of $174 million in the third quarter of 2025. And and continue to expect operating cash flow to exceed net income for the full year. This compares with operating cash flow of $151 million in the third quarter of 2024. Our accounts receivable increased slightly during the quarter, in line with sales growth as third quarter revenues were approximately $100 million higher than the second quarter revenue.\nLet me conclude my remarks with a discussion of our updated financial guidance. At this time, we are still not able to provide without unreasonable effort an estimate of restructuring costs associated with the restructuring plan for 2025. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We are raising our 2025 financial guidance as follows: we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to be in the range of $4.88 per share to $4.96 per share, reflecting stable markets and good third quarter financial results as well as the remeasurement gain realized in the third quarter. 2025 sales growth is now expected to be 3% to 4% over 2024.\nWe expect a full year non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24% to 25%, and we are maintaining our 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance, which is expected to grow in the mid-single digits versus 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. Our guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain generally consistent with current levels and that the effects of tariffs can be mitigated. Our 2025 guidance is for current continuing operations and acquisitions that have closed. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. I'd like to give you -- this is very unusual for our calls -- a bit of a reflection on the past 30 years as a public company. Tomorrow, we will be ringing the opening bell at the NASDAQ Stock Exchange to celebrate our 30th anniversary since our IPO. That's 120 quarterly calls. The growth on the journey from IPO in '95 to today has been quite significant. With sales growth over this period growing at over 11% compounded average growth rate from a market capitalization of $280 million, the value of the company has grown at almost 12% compound average growth rate, including the value of the Animal Health business we spun off in 2019. So this 12% compounded annual average growth rate over this 30 years as a public company.\nLike all rapidly growing businesses, there have been some significant ups and downs along the way. When we merged some of the Dental and [indiscernible] back in 1997, skeptics questioned whether we could integrate 3 distinct cultures and turn our business from a [dental mail] holder company to a dental full service operation including a field sales organization, equipment sales and service, while integrating these 3 cultures. That year, we also acquired Dentrix Dental Systems creating what some call a 3-legged share. selling products, services and technology. Shortly thereafter, we had a dental and aesthetic recall issue. When our stock price fell, we chose the difficult path of continuing the journey of creating world's largest full-service dental distribution and dental practice management software businesses.\nWithin a short period of time, our customers saw the value of our one-stop shop of products and related services. Then came or build expansion into Europe, which was accelerated in 2004 with the acquisition of the Midas recently spun out distribution business of Sirona. This created a global platform which changed the level of discussion within the industry to global new markets, new regulations, new cultures, new common values. When the 2008 financial prices struck, we were forced to make difficult decisions or strength true to our values. We tightened our belt but kept investing in our people and our future. Fast forward to 2020, COVID temporarily closed down the dental market. There were empty offices, disrupted supply chains and uncertainty everywhere. But team Schein adapted and using our world-class supply chain network played a key role of governments and supplying personal protective equipment, mainly as masks as well as COVID [indiscernible] of course, health care professionals, health care practices throughout the world.\nWhen the world reopened, we bounced back. The business was growing well until October '23 when the cyber event hit us for a moment, it felt like everything we built was vulnerable to an invisible threat. But once again, our team rallied, stored our systems and began the recovery. Some customers took a while to return but appreciated our offering in the end. This is now behind us, not forgotten that overcome by this incredible [indiscernible], which is once again focused on driving sales. Each challenge made us sharper, more resilient and more united, which brings us to today's BOLD+1 strategy, which accelerates us into product development, innovation, expanding our digital capabilities, deepening customer partnership and our owned brands.\nAll of this enables us to provide our customers with solutions to operate a more efficient practice so that our customers can focus on providing better patient care. Our recent results demonstrate the success of the strategy. In addition to the outstanding growth over the past 30 years, I'm particularly satisfied with the work of the company and all team Schein members who have undertaken this incredible journey to make an impact on the profession and the communities we serve around the world. We have become a leader and a model with our work to create and strengthen public private partnerships, whether it's in the profession or in the local markets that we serve or even on a global basis that have expanded access to care around the world.\nWe have made a difference in enhancing global health preparedness and reinforce the vital link between oral and overall health, including as I said, access to care. This has been a big goal of ours and has driven our brand and driven our sales and related profits. In closing, I have huge confidence in the management team who are talented, motivated, working diligently to execute our strategies, including our value creation programs which we provide further clarity today, and I'm quite very optimistic about where this will go and how this will drive up operating income, and therefore shareholder value. So before we take questions, let me thank all 25,000 Team Schein members around the world, our incredible Board, our suppliers, those investors that have confidence in us. I believe you will be well rewarded in the years to come.\nThank you for supporting us for the past 30 years. I personally wish to thank those on this call that I've known for so many years, many analysts for decades, many investors since the beginning. It's been a true wonderful journey. It's been wonderful getting to know all those constituents that are active in supporting the office space, dental and medical practitioners. So with that in mind, let me turn over the call now to the operator to answer some questions.\nThank you very much. And sorry for [indiscernible] words here, but I just -- 120 calls later I think I should make a couple of extra words Thank you."

Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\nWe had good sales growth in our global distribution group this quarter while experiencing lower margins in the U.S. versus the prior year, primarily resulting from lower glove pricing as well as some time limited targeted sales initiatives. We are pleased with the results from these initiatives and have returned to normal levels of promotional activity. Strong merchandise sales in July caused us to be optimistic about these results.\nOur Specialty Products and technology groups continue to deliver strong results, driven primarily by sales from innovative products, solutions and cost efficiencies and July sales also continued to be strong. We are maintaining our full year guidance which continues to reflect earnings weighted to the second half of the year. We expect 2025 to be the base year from which to grow and achieve our previously provided long-term goal of high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth.\nWe are partnering with KKR's Capstone, We have engaged two leading global management consulting firms to support our efforts to enhance distribution gross margins, including accelerating sales of our owned products portfolio and support our ongoing company-wide initiatives to increase efficiencies. We expect these projects, which expand on our BOLD+1 strategy to start producing results towards the beginning of 2026 and will support our ongoing initiatives to drive superior customer satisfaction and our financial goal of high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth.\nWe expect these projects to streamline processes, partially through introducing new technology, including AI solutions thereby enhancing the customer experience and improving efficiencies.\nLet me touch on a few of the highlights from the quarter that advance our BOLD+1 Strategic Plan. Overall, we believe we are continuing to gain market share across the portfolio. Our customers highly value our price value commercial model which encompasses technical support, the industry's broadest product offering, including corporate brand, customer loyalty programs, advanced value-added services, business analytics and reliable next-day high fulfillment. We achieved over 45% of our non-GAAP operating income from high-growth, high-margin businesses during the quarter, driven by sales growth and profitability in our high-growth, high-margin businesses, which outpaced growth in the rest of the business.\nWe remain on track to achieving our goal of 50% -- over 50%, should we say, of our total non-GAAP operating income coming from these businesses. Plus, in addition to that, 10% or more coming from our corporate brands. In the United States, our Medical business continued to show strong results, including our Home Solutions platform underscoring the strength of our strategy of following the patient inflow. We continue to implement initiatives to rightsize expenses in our distribution businesses. and corporate functions and consolidated various manufacturing facilities. We now expect the run rate for these savings to be slightly over $100 million by the end of the year and beginning in 2026, we expect further enhanced profitability as a result of our new value creation initiatives.\nAnd after our team successfully launched our new global e-commerce platform, henryschein.com in the U.K. and Ireland, we have begun a phased launch in North America, first in Canada and now in the United States that will continue into the fourth quarter.\nTurning now to a review of our businesses. Let me start with the Global Distribution & Value-Added Service group. We achieved volume growth in our U.S. Dental merchandise business but at lower average selling prices compared with the second quarter of 2024, primarily due to glove pricing and limited targeted sales initiatives. We have also invested in sales talent and as mentioned earlier, along with our targeted sales initiatives, we expect this will accelerate merchandise growth as reflected in our July sales results.\nU.S. dental equipment sales were temporarily impacted by market uncertainty related to tariffs in the second half of the quarter. Dentists are continuing to invest in their practices and the order intake has since returned to normal. There was a rebound in new office design activity in June, and our equipment backlog recovered with some of these installations being deferred into the third quarter. Overall, this supports our view that the equipment sales will improve in the second half of the year. We are seeing good volume growth in the digital equipment arena but at a lower average selling price as the growth has primarily come from entry-level intra-oral scanners.\nMoving on to the United States business. The United States Medical business, sales grew mid-single digits for the quarter. Patient traffic increased steadily. Our sales reflected strong growth in medical products and pharmaceuticals, particularly -- sorry, partially driven by new accounts and the continued outperformance by our Home Solutions business. International Dental merchandise sales growth was steady during the quarter, although April was impacted by the timing of Easter. Sales growth was particularly strong in Brazil.\nInternational dental equipment sales growth was strong in Canada and across Europe, particularly in traditional equipment. Growth was bolstered by this year's International Dental Show in Cologne. Digital equipment volumes grew well with sales at a lower selling price or a lower average selling price. Sales of parts and service in both the U.S. and internationally continue to grow well in the mid-single digits. Value-Added Services sales growth was impacted again this quarter by lower sales in our practice transitions business as a result of a high prior year comparable. This is a high-margin business where sales fluctuate quite a bit from quarter-to-quarter.\nWe have a strong pipeline of active transactions that we expect to close throughout the remainder of the year.\nSo let's now go to the Global Specialty Products Group. As a result, this group includes -- as a reminder, this group includes implants and biomaterials as well as endodontic, orthodontics and orthopedic products. Sales in the second quarter reflected accelerating growth in dental implants and biomaterials and endodontic consumables. Profits were also bolstered by a recent consolidation of manufacturing facilities. We are pleased with the sales growth of our implants business, which grew mid-single digit in constant currencies, and we believe that we continue to gain market share in the implant and bone regeneration area.\nSpecifically, we achieved double-digit growth in value implants, driven by our S.I.N. and Biotech Dental Implant Systems that were complemented by low single-digit growth in our premium brand BioHorizons Camlog. Our U.S. implant sales grew low single digits and reflected the continued rollout of the BioHorizon's Tapered Pro Conical implant, which is gaining momentum. SmartShape healer buttons, sales also continued to grow supported by the expansion of our BioHorizons sales force in the U.S. This expansion is expected to increase sales on a continued accelerating sales growth basis.\nEuropean implant growth this quarter was impacted by the timing of Easter. Momentum accelerated later part of the quarter and the business is doing well in the first -- in the third quarter. Orthodontics remain a small part of the Specialty Products business, and we continue to work to improve this business.\nNow finally, our Global Technology Group sales accelerated during the quarter driven by strong growth in our core practice management system solutions business, particularly our cloud-based platforms, including Dentrix Ascend in North America, and Dentally outside of North America as well as strong growth in our revenue cycle management offerings, including e-claims, electronic billing and patient messaging. As a result, we are driving growth in annual recurring SaaS subscription revenues and increasing adoption of transactional services.\nPractice Management software growth was in the mid double digits driven by a 20% year-over-year increase of cloud-based customers. We now have over 10,000 customers subscribe the Dentrix Ascend and Dentally systems. We believe our One Schein marketing approach enables greater customer adoption of the Henry Schein One platform and provides us with a unique competitive advantage. This platform differentiates us by seamlessly integrating workflows through technology to create meaningful operational efficiencies. Our workflow integration, deepens customer engagement and reinforces our ability to deliver scalable, reoccurring solutions and revenue growth.\nThe overall technology business and our own brands businesses, specialty businesses are all doing well. Let me comment for a minute on the announcement that I'll be retiring as CEO at the end of the year, while continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board.\nIt has been an incredible journey over the past 45 years, and I'm very pleased with all that Team Schein has accomplished over this time. Many transitions from a mail order, a small mail order dental distribution business, to a global provider of products and services to the dental community and to the alternate care side. Many, many changes along the way, expansion of the product and strength-ed the product offering, the services we offer and strengthening of our management team as well as the team in general. It has been especially gratifying to have worked with the tens of thousands our incredibly committed and talented Team Schein members who remanaged and reinvented Henry Schein's role, as I mentioned, from one of product delivery and logistics to one is mission today is to help over one million healthcare professionals operate better and more efficient practices so that our customers can focus on outstanding political care.\nThank you to each and every Team Schein member for your individual and collective efforts in playing such an important part in building our unique company. Thank you to our investors for your support in almost 30 years as a public company come in -- full 30 years come this November.\nAs part of succession planning over the years, the company has focused on developing the next generation of leaders and earlier this year, simplified the business by separating into three operating divisions, each with outstanding leadership. I fully expect that Andrea Albertini, CEO of the Global Distribution Group, or who also has responsibility for the Global Technology Group from our investment point of view; and Tom Popeck, CEO of the Global Specialty Group, together with the rest of the company's executive management committee. I expect these two leaders, together with the EMC to elevate Henry Schein to new heights, continuing to advance the BOLD+1 strategy in conjunction with KKR value creation initiatives and a broad-based employee ownership program.\nGuided by our purpose-driven mission, we've built an agile company that meets the evolving needs of our customers with much more to come. We've also created significant shareholder value and positioned Henry Schein for continued growth and success. Of course, I remain fully committed to Team Schein and look forward to working with the Board to identify my successor and effect a smooth transition. I'm committed to doing this, of course. In the meantime, the team remains focused on advancing our BOLD+1 strategy thereby driving value for our customers and, of course, our shareholders.\nLet me now turn the call over to Ron to review our second quarter financial results and discuss our 2025 financial guidance. Ron, please.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As usual, today, I will review the financial highlights for the quarter and would like to remind investors that on our Investor Relations website, we have also included a financial presentation containing additional detailed financial information.\nStarting with our second quarter sales results, I will provide details on total sales -- total sales growth as well as constant currency sales growth compared with the prior year. Global sales were $3.2 billion, with sales growth of 3.3% compared with the second quarter of 2024. Constant currency sales grew 2.7% with 0.6% attributable to foreign currency exchange and 0.8% growth from acquisitions. Our GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2025 was 4.67%, a decrease of 42 basis points compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, the operating margin for the second quarter was 6.96%, a decrease of 79 basis points compared to the prior year non-GAAP operating margin, driven by lower gross margins within our U.S. distribution business due to lower glove pricing as well as targeted initiatives to accelerate growth in market share.\nIn addition, operating income was impacted by higher operating expenses compared to the prior year, attributable to acquired companies, foreign exchange, increased technology and marketing investments in anticipation of the launch of henryschein.com and non-income tax credits in the prior year that did not recur this year. We continue to drive improved operational efficiency by integrating acquisitions and restructuring as well as executing our new value creation programs.\nSecond quarter 2025 GAAP net income was $86 million or $0.70 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $104 million or $0.80 per diluted share. Second quarter 2025 non-GAAP net income was $135 million or $1.10 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $158 million or $1.23 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2025 was $256 million compared with second quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $268 million.\nTurning to our sales results. The components of sales growth for the second quarter are included in Exhibit A to this morning's earnings release. So I will provide the primary highlights of the main sales drivers for each reporting segment, starting with our Global Distribution & Value-Added Service group.\nU.S. dental merchandise sales declined 1.2%, resulting from increased volume offset by lower product pricing. U.S. dental equipment sales declined 4.7% and resulting from economic uncertainty beginning in May. Both traditional and digital equipment sales growth declined. As Stan mentioned, there was a rebound in new office design activity in June, and we expect equipment sales to grow in the second half of the year. We are pleased that sales grew by 6.3% in our U.S. medical distribution business, reflecting increased patient traffic and our Home Solutions business having another strong quarter.\nInternational dental merchandise sales grew 1.9% or 0.5% in constant currency and was impacted by the timing of Easter. International dental equipment sales were good and grew 12.1% or 9.1% in constant currency, driven by strong sales growth in Canada, Germany and Austria and New Zealand. Finally, Global Value-Added Service sales grew 3.6%. Sales growth was impacted this quarter by lower sales in our practice transitions business, partially a result of a tough comparison in the prior year.\nTurning to the Global Specialty Products Group. Sales grew 4.2% or 3.3% in constant currency. Our implant and biomaterial business experienced solid growth in the second quarter including double-digit growth in our value implants and low single-digit growth in premium implants. Our orthodontic business sales declined year-over-year, but at a slower pace than in prior quarters. As we previously discussed, this business is being reorganized to support future profitable growth.\nWe also had strong results in the Global Technology Group with total sales growth of 7.4% or 6.6% in constant currency. In the U.S., sales growth was driven by revenue cycle management and practice management software with double-digit growth in Ascend. Internationally, sales growth was primarily driven by our Dentally cloud-based practice management solutions, as well as strong growth in Canada.\nTurning to restructuring. Our restructuring expenses in the second quarter were $23 million or $0.13 per diluted share. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits. We now expect to achieve annual run rate savings of over $100 million by the end of 2025, which is when the current plan is expected to have been completed.\nAs Stan mentioned, we have initiated two important value creation projects to enhance distribution gross margins, including accelerating sales of our own products portfolio as well as company-wide initiatives to increase efficiencies. We will provide a further update on these initiatives on our upcoming third quarter earnings call.\nRegarding share repurchases, during the second quarter of 2025, the company repurchased approximately 3.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $70.88 per share for a total of $259 million. This included approximately 3.1 million shares of common stock under the previously announced accelerated stock repurchase plan at an average price of $71.60 per share for a total of $223 million, which followed the company's sale of 3.3 million shares of common stock at an average price of $76.10 per share for a total of $250 million to KKR. The ASR plan was completed in July.\nIn addition to the ASR plan, the company repurchased approximately 0.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $67.36 per share for a total of $36 million. The impact of these share repurchases on second quarter diluted EPS was immaterial.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $432 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases plus a further $27 million authorized under the ASR, which as mentioned, has now been completed.\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated operating cash flow of $120 million in the second quarter of 2025. We still expect operating cash flow to exceed net income for the full year. This quarter, we invested in additional inventory in the U.S. as part of our plan to mitigate the effects of tariff increases. Our accounts receivable also increased slightly in line with sales growth. As a reminder, working capital is still returning to normal levels in the second quarter of the prior year following the cyber incident, resulting in stronger than normal cash flow.\nLet me conclude my remarks with a discussion of financial guidance. At this time, we are not able to provide without unreasonable effort and estimate of restructuring costs associated with the restructuring plan for 2025. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We are maintaining our 2025 financial guidance. As a reminder, this is as follows: We expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.94. 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow in the mid-single digits versus 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. 2025 total sales growth is expected to be 2% to 4% over 2024, and we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 25%.\nOur guidance assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain generally consistent with current levels that the effects of tariffs can be mitigated and also includes expected remeasurement gains related to the purchase of controlling interest of previously held noncontrolling equity investments, consistent with our business strategy. Our 2025 guidance is for current continuing operations and includes acquisitions that have closed. It does not include the impact of restructuring expenses and other items detailed in our press release.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. Thank you, everyone, again, for calling in. So we believe Henry Schein is well positioned to accelerate growth. Of course, we're happy to answer any questions that investors may have. We -- with respect to our distribution business, we are pleased with the results from the time-limited targeted sales initiatives, which, together with the rebound in equipment orders and momentum in our medical business sets us up well for growth for the second quarter -- for the second half, third and fourth quarter. The results from our technology, value-added services and specialty businesses are strong, and we look forward to this continuing into the second half of the year as well.\nWe are also excited about the significant opportunities from our new value creation initiatives, and we are optimistic about returning to high single-digit, low double-digit earnings growth.\nSo with that overview, operator, we're ready to take questions from investors."

Welcome to Henry Schein's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the -- introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Strategic Finance Project Officer\n\nThank you, operator. And thanks to each of you for joining us today to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the first quarter of 2025. With me on today's call is Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information as forward-looking. Risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements, and the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and included in the Risk Factors section of those filings. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.\nToday's remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in Exhibit B of today's press release and can be found in the Financials and Filings section of our Investor Relations website under the Supplemental Information heading and in our quarterly earnings presentation also posted on our Investor Relations website.\nThe content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 5, 2025. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Lastly, during today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let me begin by saying that we are pleased with our first quarter financial results as well as the momentum we are seeing heading into the second quarter and remain confident in the fundamentals of our business. After a rather slow January, which was a result of weather-related events, February and March sales performance was good and within our full year guidance range. As reported, sales growth was significantly impacted by a strong U.S. dollar.\nAnd I would like to remind everyone that last year's U.S. equipment business was impacted by a deferral of sales from the fourth quarter of '23 into the first quarter of 2024, making for a difficult year-over-year comparison. Once we adjust for the effect of the strong dollar as well as PPE and COVID test kit sales, our sales growth was approximately 2% with sales growth accelerating throughout the quarter.\nWe are advancing our BOLD+1 strategic plan, which has been refreshed for '25 to '27, with the team focused on growing the distribution business through increasing operational efficiency and enhancing customer experience, growing our dental and medical specialty businesses and corporate brand products and further developing our digital footprint and digital solutions.\nWe do remain committed to our long-term financial goal of high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth by continuing to successfully execute against the strategy. Our last earnings call -- during the call, we announced the establishment of 2 main Henry Schein business units, the global distribution and value-added service group and the Global Technology group, which is led by Andrea Albertini and the Global Specialty Products group, which is led by Tom Popeck. This past quarter, we began to operate the company through these new business groups and are pleased with the leadership and the performance of both of these business groups.\nSo here are some highlights from the first quarter with respect to advance in the BOLD+1 strategy, continue to launch several new products and solutions in our specialty products and technology businesses. We've broadened our Home Solutions platform with the acquisition of Acentus, a U.S. national distributor of Continuous Glucose Monitors, [indiscernible].\nWe expanded the sales of specialty products through our distribution businesses, those are the specialty products that are now being sold through the Henry Schein distribution sales organization. We continue to implement restructuring initiatives to rightsize expenses in our distribution businesses, court functions and to consolidate manufacturing facilities. And yes, the Global eCommerce Platform, GEP, in the U.K. and Ireland is now fully operational, and we are on track to begin a phased launch in North America during the third quarter of this year.\nAfter exceeding our strategic goal of achieving 40% of our operating income from high-growth, high-margin businesses in 2024, we expect operating income from high-growth, high-margin businesses to continue to grow steadily. We now expect these businesses to contribute over half of our total operating income by the end of our strategic planning cycle of 2027. These businesses include specialty products, value-added services and technology. Additionally, operating income in excess of 10% of our total operating income is attributable to our corporate brand products.\nTurning now to a review of our key businesses. We'll start with the Global Distribution and Value-Added Services group. During the quarter, we believe the U.S. and international dental merchandise and equipment markets as well as the U.S. medical market were overall stable and that we gained market share. Sales growth in our core dental and medical distribution businesses did accelerate following a slow start in January, which, as I noted, was primarily the result of weather-related events and our growth in March was within our full year guidance range of 2% to 4%.\nU.S. dental merchandise sales grew low single digits with excluding sales of PPE. Product pricing was overall in line with last year, and our sales growth, therefore, reflected volume growth. We also recently implemented a new commission plan that we expect will drive sales and profitability growth. The U.S. dental equipment sales growth was impacted by a deferral of sales from the fourth quarter of '23 into the first quarter of 2024. So moving from the fourth quarter of '23 into the first quarter of '24, making for a difficult year-over-year comparison.\nWe see -- we do see consistent demand for both traditional and digital equipment as practitioners continue to invest in their practices. We are also seeing the number of new practice build-outs increasing. Our U.S. Medical business growth -- sales growth was solid for the quarter, reflecting increased patient traffic to physician offices for respiratory illness, a strong performance by our Home Solutions business and some acquisition growth.\nInternational dental merchandise sales was strong in Canada, Central Europe and Brazil offset by softness in France. Similar to the rest of the company's sales accelerated throughout the quarter. I would like to stress that we're reviewing our international sales that investors take into account the swings in foreign exchange.\nInternational dental equipment sales grew well in Canada and across most of Europe. The focus of new product launches at this year's IDS, International Dental Show in Cologne included 3D printers and intraoral scanners to help improve dental office workflows and we expect our sales to benefit in future quarters from orders taken at the show. Again, foreign exchange did impact our sales results in U.S. dollars.\nOn the value-added services sales side, the sales decreased in the quarter one as a result of lower sales in our practice transitions business. Sales in this business can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. However, there is a strong pipeline of active transactions that we expect to close throughout the remainder of the year.\nNow on the Global Specialty Products side, the Global Specialty Products group includes, of course, implants and biomaterials as well as endo, orthodontics and orthopedic products. Sales in the first quarter reflected continued growth in implant and biomaterials and some acquisition growth. Sales of implants grew mid-single digits in constant currency again, big swings in foreign exchange here with strong sales growth in the DACH region, as well as in Latin America, driven by both our premium brand BioHorizons' Camlog as well as S.I.N. value brand.\nWe estimate that the U.S. domestic market for dental implants was slightly down in the quarter. Our U.S. sales were in line with market growth and reflect continued rollout of the BioHorizons' Tapered Pro Conical implant and SmartShape Healers -- SmartShape Healers [indiscernible] as well as growing sales of the S.I.N. implants in the United States.\nOverall, in the markets we [indiscernible], we believe we continue to gain market share [indiscernible] this quarter, and that's for implants and biomaterials. We continue to launch new internally developed products in our endodontics business and are pleased with our underlying growth. While orthodontics remains a small component of our specialty business product sales were down year-over-year as we continue working to restructure this business. Finally, our orthopedic products generated solid first quarter sales growth in high single digits.\nLet me conclude my prepared remarks with a discussion on the Global Technology Group. So we had rather strong growth in practice management systems, including Dentrix Ascend and Dentally cloud-based solutions as well as in revenue cycle management [indiscernible], these were partially offset by lower sales of certain legacy products that we are sunsetting.\nThe consolidation of these products is having a short-term impact on this segment's sales growth that has enabled us to reduce operating costs and achieve strong operating income growth, while positioning the software portfolio for better customer experience going forward.\nPractice Management software growth was driven by a 20% increase in cloud-based customers, and we now have 9,500 customers subscribed to Dentrix Ascend and Dentally and are making good progress in advancing these cloud-based systems into DSOs.\nWe also continue to enhance the functionality of our practice management software with a new dental imaging subscription plan that automatically attaches images directly to insurance claims for faster payments.\nYes. So here are some comments on the tariffs. Let me conclude my remarks with these comments. Several years ago, we began diversified in moving sourcing of corporate brand products to what we anticipated to be lower tariff countries. In addition, most of our specialty products are manufactured in their local markets. We have been working closely with our suppliers and customers to address the impact of current tariffs.\nFor our more price-sensitive customers, we'll continue to offer corporate brand alternatives. We believe our current and future actions or suppliers and customers will be effective at mitigating this year's impact on our financial results from the current tariff situations. We are monitoring the situation carefully as, of course, we cannot predict [indiscernible] tariffs will change again. Of course, tariff changes are -- have been quite volatile. And [indiscernible] can we [indiscernible] or anticipate [indiscernible] if they will have a significant impact on the macroeconomic conditions.\nSo let me now turn the call over to Ron to review our first quarter financial results and discuss our 2025 guidance and financial guidance. Ron, please?\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As usual, today, I will review the financial highlights for the quarter and would like to remind investors that on our Investor Relations website, we have also included a financial presentation containing additional detailed financial information.\nStarting with our first quarter sales results, I will provide details on total sales -- total sales growth as well as constant currency sales growth compared with the prior year. Global sales were $3.2 billion, with sales down 0.1% compared with the first quarter of 2024. Sales growth reflected a 1.5% decrease attributable to foreign currency exchange and a 1.2% growth from acquisitions.\nAs Stanley mentioned, excluding the impact of PPE and COVID test kits, constant currency sales growth was 2.0%. Our GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2025 was 5.53%, an 81 basis point improvement compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the first quarter was 7.25%, a 14 basis point improvement compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin, driven by lower operating expenses resulting from our restructuring program.\nFirst quarter 2025 GAAP net income was $110 million or $0.88 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $93 million or $0.72 per diluted share. First quarter 2025 non-GAAP net income was $143 million or $1.15 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $143 million or $1.10 per diluted share.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025 was $259 million compared with first quarter 2024 adjusted of $255 million.\nTurning to our sales results. The components of sales growth for the first quarter are included in Exhibit A to this morning's earnings release. So I will provide the primary highlights of the main sales drivers for each reporting segment, starting with our global distribution and value-added services group. The global distribution and value-added services group benefit from acquisition growth of 0.9%, mainly from the acquisition of Acentus, our most recent acquisition in the home solutions space.\nConstant currency sales, including acquisition growth, grew by 1.5% after excluding PPE and COVID test kits. U.S. dental merchandise sales grew 0.7% when excluding PPE products, and U.S. dental equipment sales declined 8.9%. Our sales growth was impacted by a deferral of approximately $20 million in equipment sales from the fourth quarter of 2023 into the first quarter of 2024, making for a difficult year-over-year comparison. Adjusting for this, U.S. dental equipment sales growth was flat versus the prior year.\nRegarding U.S. medical distribution, after excluding sales of PPE products and COVID test kits, sales grew by 4.7%. Our Home Solutions business had another strong quarter with total sales growth of 23%, including 9% internal growth. International dental merchandise constant currency sales grew 1.1%. PPE products did not have a meaningful impact on our international dental merchandise sales growth. International dental equipment constant currency sales grew 4.3%, driven by strong growth in Canada and solid growth across Central Europe.\nFinally, global value-added services, sales growth was impacted by the timing of transactions within our practice transitions business.\nTurning to the Global Specialty Products Group. Constant currency sales growth was 4.3%, benefiting from acquisition growth of 4.0%, primarily attributable to TriMed, the orthopedics products business we acquired last year. Beginning in the second quarter, this business will be part of internal sales as our TriMed acquisition annualized in April.\nIn addition, our implant and biomaterials business experienced good growth in the first quarter, especially in the DACH region of Europe, where sales increased high single digits. The Global Specialty Products Group also includes the endodontic business, which had slightly [indiscernible] growth this quarter as a result of a supply chain issue [indiscernible] Edge Pro laser product, which has now been resolved, as well as the orthodontic business, which has negative sales growth and as I mentioned last quarter, is being reorganized to support future profitable growth.\nRegarding the Global Technology Group, while total sales growth was 2.9%, operating income grew 24% versus the prior year, reflecting strong expense management. Restructuring expenses in the first quarter were $25 million or $0.14 per diluted share. These expenses mainly related to severance benefits. We now believe we will achieve annual run rate savings at the high end of our $75 million to $100 million goal by the end of 2025. Our first quarter GAAP results include $20 million in pretax proceeds as part of our cyber insurance claim, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results. We have now received all of the proceeds from this claim, which totaled approximately $60 million over the course of 2024 and the first quarter of this year.\nRegarding share repurchases. We repurchased approximately 2.3 million shares of common stock during the first quarter at an average price of $71.58 per share for a total of $161 million. At quarter end, we had approximately $718 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases.\nTurning to our cash flow. We generated operating cash flow of $37 million in the first quarter of 2025. The first quarter typically has a lower cash flow than other quarters in the year, and we still expect operating cash flow to exceed net income for the full year.\nLet me conclude my remarks with a discussion of financial guidance. At this time, we are not able to provide without unreasonable effort and estimate of restructuring costs associated with the restructuring plan for 2025. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. Our 2025 guidance is for continuing -- for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have closed and does not include the impact of restructuring and integration expenses and other items detailed in our press release.\nRegarding tariffs, as Stanley said, we believe our current and future actions with our suppliers and customers will be effective at mitigating this year's impact on our financial results from the current tariff situation. We have the widest selection of alternative products, including corporate brand products. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we continue to monitor the tariff situation closely, and we will provide updates to our guidance as appropriate.\nSo today, we are maintaining our 2025 financial guidance. As a reminder, our 2025 guidance is as follows: we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.94. And that it is expected to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow in the mid-single digits versus 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion.\n2025 total sales growth is expected to be 2% to 4% over 2024. Our 2025 guidance also assumes an estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25% and that foreign currency exchange rates remain generally consistent with current levels.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. Operator, do we have some questions?"

Today's remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results.\nWe believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of the business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in Exhibit B of today's press release and can be found in the Financials and Filings section of our Investor Relations website under the Supplemental Information heading and in our quarterly earnings presentation also posted our Investor Relations website.\nThe content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 25, 2025. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. [Operator Instructions].\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. I hope that the new time is appreciated by analysts and investors. And if not and you would like to go back to a later time, please be in touch with Graham, and we will take your thoughts into account. The financial results and guidance being provided today are consistent with the preliminary financial results and guidance provided on January 29.\nOur fourth quarter financial results reflect relatively stable dental and medical end markets. We continue to make progress as we sunset our 2022 to 2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, which is now completed. We exceeded our key goal of -- and the major target in the plan of 2024 -- by 2024 generating 40% of our worldwide operating income from high-growth, high-margin businesses. And let me remind our investors, there's another 10% or so of our profits that are coming from our own brands. So well over half of our profits are today coming from our high-growth, high-margin and own brand products.\nWe have confidence in the underlying fundamentals of our business and look forward to advancing the opportunities contained in our updated '25 to '27 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan. KKR announced its investment to become our largest non-index shareholder recognized -- as they recognize the potential of Henry Schein. We expect 2025 to be the base year from which to grow and achieve our previously provided long-term goal of high single-digit to low double-digit earnings growth with the cyber incident now in the rear mirror.\nAs part of the launch of the updated '25-'27 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan, we have simplified our organizational structure and appointed Andrea Albertini to have responsibility for our Global Distribution and Value-Added Services Group as well as our Global Technology Group. The Global Distribution and Value-Added Services Group includes distribution to the global dental and medical markets of national brand and corporate brand merchandise as well as equipment and related technical services. This group also includes value-added services such as practice transitions, continuing education, consulting, financial and other services. The Technology Group includes development, marketing and sales of practice management software, e-services and other products and related services.\nWe also appointed Tom Popeck to lead our Global Specialty Products Group, which includes manufacturing, marketing sales of dental implant and biomaterial products, [ endodontic ], orthodontic and orthopedic products and other health care-related products and services as well as management of our corporate brand offering, which is essentially distributed through our distribution group. We expect that these complementary businesses will drive growth by leveraging our current product portfolio across our entire customer base, providing new products and services to our customers and growing our e-commerce business. I think the relationship between each of our groups and the driving of synergies will, of course, grow sales and related profits.\nWe are also today announcing a change to our reportable segments. This was also requested by investors during our investor survey some time ago. And we have now prepared financial statements in accordance with these reported the segments and aligned with our management reporting and provide more meaningful information to investors on the business performance. Ron will detail the performance of each of these 3 groups in his prepared remarks. We will continue to provide information on our high-growth, high-margin products and services, but these are now included in each of our reportable segments and which -- and of course, it's a key metric for us to drive high-growth, high-margin profits -- sales and profits, a very important metric for our 2025 to 2027 strategic plan. We'll provide you with separate data on that.\nNow let's turn to a review of our key business units. Let me start by reporting on the Global Distribution and Value-Added Services Group. During the fourth quarter, we continued to see relatively stable patient traffic. Market growth for dental and medical products continue to be below the long-term guidance range we provided at our Investor Day, partially as a result of customer migration to value-priced products. Now if we look specifically at the U.S. dental merchandise growth, which was strong excluding sales of PPE, personal protective equipment, and impacted by low prior year comparable, offset by the midweek timing of Christmas. Ron again will give you specifics later in the call.\nOn the U.S. dental equipment sales, which increased double digit and benefited from the deferral last year of some sales in the fourth quarter of '23 into the first quarter of '24 as a result of the cyber incident, we achieved strong growth in traditional equipment and parts and technical service. Digital equipment sales also increased with unit growth quite good, offsetting some price declines. On the U.S. medical business, results reflect a late start of the flu season and lower sales of vaccines, PPE and COVID tests.\nOur Home Solutions business performed particularly well during the fourth quarter. In January, we strengthened the business as we completed the tuck-in acquisition of Acentus. This is adding to our offering of continuous glucose monitors, an area of the home care market that we're quite bullish about. Now we've increased the annual run rate in this home care Solutions business that we entered a couple of years ago to approximately $400 million with a significant amount of that $400 million coming from internal growth.\nLet's take a look now at our international dental merchandise sales, which grew strongly with good growth in Canada, and Canada now is included in the international group -- dental group. Strong growth in Canada, Europe, Brazil, slightly softer growth in Australia, new Zealand and Asia. International equipment sales growth was solid. Stronger growth in traditional equipment compared to digital equipment, which was again good units, but digital was impacted by pricing, all similar to the U.S., a global trend. But overall, our equipment business was quite good this quarter.\nRight. Now let's turn to a review of the Global Specialty Products Group, which had solid growth in dental implants, biomaterials and endodontic. The core businesses in this group did well. Our new entry into the orthopedics arena last year, special -- well, we did have some orthopedic products before, but the significant investment we made last year also performed well. This offset -- this growth was offset by a decrease in the orthodontic sales, and we're addressing that through restructuring, largely a result of product -- an important product going off patent. We have a new product coming. Actually, we have it in place now and it's gaining some traction in the orthodontics field.\nImplanted biomaterial sales in Europe continued to be quite strong, especially in the DACH region, that's the German-speaking region, where our BioHorizons Camlog products continue to grow well. While the launch of BioHorizons Tapered Pro Conical implants in the U.S. is proceeding well, the initial sales are largely coming from product conversions with existing customers resulting in modest incremental sales. But we expect the Tapered Pro Conical implants to be a way to generate business from new customers in our implant business.\nOverall, our sales of implants in the value segment posted very strong quarterly growth. The S.I.N. product line posted solid double-digit growth in Brazil, and we continue to roll out the brand across the U.S. to serve the value segment of the market. Our endodontics sales growth was strong as a result of our expanded sales focus through our U.S. distribution sales channel of the Edge product offering as well as some new product [ actions ].\nA little bit more on the orthopedic business. which continues to perform well, including our TriMed acquisition which is complementary to our medical focus on ASCs and specialty customers. New products in both upper and lower extremities as well as good momentum with a new dedicated sales team in foot and ankle helped drive sales growth. So this whole area of specialty is working well for us. We will deal with the orthodontic challenge. But overall, take that out, the performance is quite good.\nNow if you look at the Technology Group. While overall sales growth was low, we had strong operating growth in the business. Sales continued to perform well in cloud-based practice software, that's management -- practice management software. And revenue cycle management also did quite well, partially offset by the sunsetting of certain brands. The whole idea here is to drive towards common brands for each type of application. We lose a little bit of business along the way, but we can provide better service and, of course, greater margins. And we now have over 9,000 customers subscribed to Dentrix Ascend and Dentally with year-on-year growth of approximately 6.5%.\nIt's very important to understand that this is a shift from an on-prem sale to a SaaS model, which creates short-term headwinds on the revenue side, which is outweighed by longer-term benefits from higher recurring subscription revenues. This model is working quite well. Cost efficiencies in the business are there. They've been reaped, more to go as we merge brands, and this is driving technology operating margin up. This trend, we expect to continue.\nNow let me turn the call over to Ron to review our fourth quarter financial results and our '25 guidance. Ron, please.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As Stanley mentioned, we are also today announcing a change to our reportable segments to align with management reporting and provide more meaningful information for investors on the business. The results being reported today reflect this change, and a recast of prior comparative segment information has been provided in Exhibit B of today's press release.\nTurning to our fourth quarter sales results. I will provide detail on total sales, total sales growth as well as LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared with the prior year and excludes acquisitions. Global sales were $3.2 billion with sales growth of 5.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This includes 0.7% growth from acquisitions and a 0.4% decrease attributable to foreign currency exchange. Please note that sales in the fourth quarter of 2023 were negatively impacted by the cybersecurity incident. LCI sales increased 5.5% for the quarter or 6.6% when excluding lower PPE sales and COVID test kits.\nOur GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2024 was 4.86%, a 358 basis point improvement compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the fourth quarter was 7.46%, a 260 basis point improvement compared to the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. In the prior year, both the GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins were negatively impacted by the cybersecurity incident.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, our operating margin benefited from lower operating expenses year-over-year as we are starting to realize cost savings from our restructuring initiatives. We also continue to experience year-over-year gross margin expansion in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of acquisitions we have made to advance our BOLD+1 strategy. For the full year, we achieved 41% of our total operating income from high-growth, high-margin businesses.\nFourth quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $94 million or $0.74 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income at $18 million or $0.13 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income was $149 million or $1.19 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $86 million or $0.66 per diluted share. The foreign currency exchange impact on our fourth quarter diluted EPS was unfavorable by approximately $0.01 versus the prior year.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2024 was $270 million compared to fourth quarter of 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $172 million.\nTurning to our fourth quarter sales results. We are updating the breakdown of sales as detailed in Exhibit A of today's press release to reflect the updated reportable segments as well as other internal management responsibilities. Of note, we are now reporting U.S. distribution sales instead of North America distribution sales. This means Canada is now being reported as part of international. As a point of reference, Canada has approximately $400 million of annual revenues. Approximately 2/3 of those revenues are merchandise sales with the remaining 1/3 as equipment sales.\nGlobal Distribution and Value-Added Services Group sales were $2.7 billion with sales growth of 5.9%, including LCI growth of 5.8%. Sales were positively impacted by a soft comparison to the prior year. Excluding PPE and COVID test kits, LCI sales growth was 7.3%. Our U.S. dental distribution LCI sales grew 5.9% versus the prior year with LCI growth in dental merchandise of 4.8% or 6.5% growth when excluding PPE products and equipment LCI's growth -- sales growth of 10.0%. U.S. equipment sales growth was driven by both traditional and digital equipment, with digital equipment unit growth offsetting some pricing declines.\nU.S. medical distribution LCI sales grew 4.5% compared to the Q4 of 2023. Excluding sales of PPE products and COVID test kits, LCI sales grew 7.3%. Sales of point-of-care diagnostics and vaccines were negatively impacted by the timing of the flu season. Our Home Solutions business had another strong quarter growing 8% year-over-year. Our international dental distribution LCI sales grew 7.3% versus the prior year with LCI growth in dental merchandise up 7.9% or 8.0% growth when excluding PPE products, and equipment LCI sales growth was 6.0%.\nFinally, global value-added services sales grew 8.1% versus the prior year with an LCI sales decrease of 0.7%. We achieved strong sales growth in e-Assist and financial services, offset by lower sales at large practice sales as a result of the timing of closing of some practice transition services sales.\nTurning to the Global Specialty Products Group, which includes our dental specialty products, orthopedic and other products. Sales were $368 million with sales growth of 7.2%, including LCI growth of 5.0%. This segment includes the orthodontic business which is being reorganized for future profitable growth. It also includes certain expenses relating to managing our own brands that support sales in the distribution businesses and provide a headwind to the segment's operating margin.\nGlobal Technology Group sales during the fourth quarter were $160 million with total sales growth of 2.4% and LCI sales growth of 2.1%. This was driven by revenue cycle management and practice management software with double-digit growth in Ascend and internationally led by our Dentally cloud-based practice management solution, offset by lower revenues of certain patient experience modules and, as Stan mentioned, a headwind to revenue growth as a result of the movement to a SaaS model.\nRestructuring expenses in the fourth quarter were $37 million or $0.23 per diluted share. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits and costs related to exiting certain facilities. Our restructuring activities in the third and fourth quarters are estimated to provide over $80 million in annual run rate savings. We continue to expect savings from this plan to be $75 million to $100 million of aggregate annual run rate savings by the end of 2025.\nOur fourth quarter GAAP results include $20 million in pretax proceeds as part of our cyber insurance claim, which are excluded from our non-GAAP results. As of the end of the year, we collected approximately $40 million. All items excluded from our fourth quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2024 and 2023 are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results is also available in our quarterly earnings presentation on our website.\nRegarding share repurchases, we repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter at an average price of $71.35 per share for a total of $75 million. For the full year, we invested $385 million to repurchase 5.4 million shares. At fiscal year-end, we had approximately $380 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. An additional $500 million of share repurchases was authorized by our Board of Directors on January 27, 2025, including a commitment to repurchase $250 million in shares under an authorized accelerated share repurchase program.\nTurning to our cash flow. We had strong operating cash flow of $204 million for the fourth quarter, which compares with operating cash flow of negative $32 million last year. Operating cash flow for the full year in 2024 was $848 million, which is $348 million more than in 2023. Our strong operating cash flow for the quarter and the year was driven by lower working capital, particularly lower customer receivables, which we've been focused on throughout the year.\nTurning to our 2025 financial guidance. At this time, we are not able to provide without reasonable effort an estimate of restructuring costs associated with the new restructuring plan for 2025, although we expect this to primarily include severance pay and facility-related costs. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. Our 2025 guidance is for continuing -- current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have closed and does not include the impact of restructuring and integration expenses and other items described in our press release.\nGuidance assumes modest improvement in the dental and medical markets during the year and is supported by strategic initiatives outlined in our strategic plan and recent acquisitions as well as a positive contribution from our restructuring plan. This is partially offset by investments in technology and a return to historical levels of incentive compensation. We also assume that foreign currency exchange rates remain generally consistent with 2024 levels.\nOur 2025 total sales growth is expected to be 2% to 4% over 2024. For 2025, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.94, which reflects growth of 1% to 4% compared with 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.74 per share. 2025 non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be more heavily weighted to the second half of the year. This guidance assumes there is no debt impact from the issuance of new shares to KKR, which is expected to be offset by an accelerated share repurchase program. It also assumes an estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25%.\nOur 2025 adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow in the mid-single digits versus 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than non-GAAP diluted EPS due to higher depreciation expense, primarily related to the global e-commerce platform.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. Operator, we're ready to respond to questions."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Strategic Finance Project Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the second quarter of 2024. With me on today's call are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call include information that is forward-looking. Risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements, and the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such statements.

Lastly, join today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Graham, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered solid second quarter financial results, including strong operating cash flow that reflected stable end markets. Gross margin has continued to increase, driven by our strategies to expand our high-growth, high-margin products and services and by the successful performance of our recent acquisitions.\nWe are experiencing improving sales trends in our distribution businesses. However, the pace of recovery since the cyber incident last year has been slower than anticipated. Now given the challenging economic environment, we'll talk about it a little bit later, in certain markets as well as the delay in cyber incident recovery, we are updating our '24 full year financial guidance. We remain committed to our long-term financial goals through our advancement of the BOLD+1 strategic plan, which has stood us well supported by a strong balance sheet and new restructuring plan.\nAs we continue to generate synergies by connecting our distribution businesses, specialty products and technology and value-added services, we continue to see great symbiotic relationships between our various businesses. We are also announcing a restructuring plan to integrate recent acquisitions and rightsize operations and further increase efficiencies, targeting somewhere between $75 million to $100 million in annual savings. We are comfortable that we will continue after this restructuring plan is put in place with improving operating margins. And we are increasing, at the same time, our repurchase authorization. Following recent board approval, an additional $500 million as we expect to leverage the strong cash flow we have.\nSo let me turn to the various business units, dental distribution to start with. In North America, patient traffic was generally flat with the prior quarter. However, the pace of recovery since the cyber incident late last year, has been slower than anticipated. We reported year-over-year decline in merchandise sales, which reflects the pace of recovery and of course, lower sales of PPE products, which are primarily the result of lower glove pricing.\nMembership in the Thrive Signature program continued to increase with nearly 1,500 new members added in the second quarter, bringing the total membership to approximately 6,000 U.S. dental practices. This subscription-based program drives customer loyalty and has been very good, again, in driving stickiness to our various businesses, whether it's distribution, specialty products or for that matter, specialty services.\nWe were pleased with our North American dental equipment sales growth, this reflected positive trends across the board, traditional equipment, digital imaging, CAD/CAM and parts and services. We achieved modest growth in international dental merchandise sales driven by good growth in the DACH countries and in Brazil.\nInternational dental equipment sales were impacted by a decrease in sales in France as a result of changes in the DSO legislation, a generally slow economic -- generally slow equipment market in Italy and the expiration of tax incentives last year in Australia, with other markets generally in line with last year.\nGiven demographic trends, we expect patient demand to outpace the supply of dental services. We've seen this for a while and for this to drive further efficiency need in the dental practices, which we expect to be a positive driver in the growth about our dental businesses all fitting in the Gulf of BOLD+1 strategic plan.\nNow let's take a look at Dental specialties. Shifting to our Dental Specialties business. Sales growth in the quarter was generally consistent to the pace of growth in the first quarter as acquisitions and our organic growth in Europe were offset by lower sales in North America. In Europe, sales of dental implant products posted solid growth as we continue to gain market share with our broad and highly competitive offering.\nWithin North America, we received FDA approval to launch the BOLD Level Tapered pro conical implant in mid-June. This was a bit later than we expected, and we believe this timing impacted the quarter 2 sales growth as some customers held back on purchases, deferred them in anticipation of the launch of this important new product. We expect dental implant sales growth in North America to resume in the third quarter aided by this new product line.\nAs a reminder, we tapered Pro Conical positions us to provide an innovative, highly competitive offering for the half of the U.S. dental implant market we weren't previously addressing. The initial feedback we are receiving from customers is quite positive and we look forward to reporting on our progress in future calls.\nOur endodontics business continued to grow, aided by small, a small acquisition we made in Latin America, the focus for orthodontics last quarter was the launch of the biotech Smile Clear aligner into the U.S. market. Again, our orthodontic business is very, very small relative to the entire specialty business.\nNow it's important for our investors to understand. We continue to align our dental sales teams successfully deepening our penetration of the DSO segment last quarter across our specialties. It's the distribution side working in concert with the specialty businesses and the value-added services that are creating great value for our customers and turn for the profitability of Henry Schein.\nSo now let's turn to the technology and value-added services and Henry Schein One which is our dental software business. The customer base for our Dentrix, Ascend and entirely cloud-based solutions continues to grow during the second quarter and was up more than 25% year-over-year, with now worldwide installations exceeding 8,000.\nWhat I think is important to understand is when we -- in the past, when we sold software, we recognized sale on-prem software right away. We are switching rapidly to cloud-based solutions, which are highly profitable in the long run, and retention rate is great, but you don't recognize the full sale at the time -- the full revenue at the time of the sale. These cloud-based practice management software products of both the cornerstone of Henry Schein One and at the same time, a powerful enabler of additional product sales and equipment merchandise at the Henry Schein level as well as driving specialty products through the Nemotec Software that is now being advanced in sales.\nThe number of claims processed by our revenue cycle management e-claims business increased by single-digit percentages versus the prior year. Now this is despite the changed health care cyber incident and the normal circumstances, we would have expected the greater growth but the Change Healthcare cyber incident has slowed us down. We are servicing our customers. There's no interruption from that point of view, but there is some impact on the cash collection of our customers because Change did process the actual payment, we process through Change the claims processing.\nWe found an alternative source, but the actual check or electronic transfer to the customer of the funds is still going through Change. Some dental practices are therefore facing cash flow challenges due to reimbursement delays and we believe this continued to temporarily impact demand for certain software products, and we think a little bit also on the equipment side. This is -- we believe, a temporary cash flow issue, which will get resolved, but never impact -- may impact our collections of our receivables, but it is a bit of a challenge to some practices that are not getting the checks as frequently as they were. The claims are being processed.\nThe collaboration between Henry Schein One and our distribution of specialty products businesses supports highly integrated solutions enables deeper customer relationships and multiple touch points between Henry Schein and our dental customers, which helps drive growth, as I mentioned early on, and this is especially the case for the DSO segment, although as we move towards our 2025 strategic plan, we will drive the synergy down into the smaller accounts.\nMany of our high-quality leads for Dentrix products and services are generated by the U.S. dental field sales representatives. And by the way, this is the case, not only in the U.S., but in Canada and in all the markets abroad where Henry Schein One operates.\nHere are a few further examples integration. Nemotec, the specialty software that was developed by biotech in France is now integrated with our Dentrix practice management software in the U.S. providing, as we discussed during our Investor Day, the integrated 3-click digital workflow software for implants and orthodontics. This has been recognized by some of the big DSOs as very, very important. We have implementation with some of the big DSOs, and we expect this to advance further, advancing Henry Schein's strength and connectivity to these DSOs and again, will, over time, advance the smaller practices.\nWe also expanded our solutions offering by Parent Dentrix, the tech AI. That's our -- the AI system, clinical AI system we sell powered by video health and early carries detection solution with a terrific power product Curodont, and early carries treatment product. We're also having early success for the recent launch of Reserve with Google. All of these are being well received by the more sophisticated larger DSOs, and we are quite optimistic that the Curodont Solution will become standard of care over time in many practices.\nSo these are some of the examples of the unique strength of our combined platform, and we continue to unlock benefits and value from the inter-connectivity -- the interconnectedness across our business. All of this is contained in our strategic plan thinking.\nLet me just now quickly return -- turn now quickly -- turn to our Medical Group. Second quarter sales also reflect the slower-than-anticipated pace of recovery from the cyber incident. In addition, sales were impacted by ongoing migration to generic alternatives for certain branded pharmaceuticals and in particular, in injectable area where we have very strong market presence.\nOf course, there was a decline in sales of PPE products, yes, or primarily a result of lower pricing -- club pricing. As with the dental distribution business, we continue to win back episodic medical customers and in particular, large accounts that moved from -- moved their prescription drug business to other distributors, primarily the drug distributors.\nOnce the customers understand our unique logistics capabilities, they are moving back, it takes time. It may enter into commitments. And I think although this is slower than anticipated, we will get these customers back. Excluding the impact of point of care diagnostic tests, which were impacted by flu seasonality. So the quarterly sequence of the flu diagnostic testing, moving from one quarter to another did have an impact on the quarter. But sequentially, medical sales growth is improving.\nOur Home Solutions business again performed well with sales up double-digit percentage during the quarter, led by the Shield Healthcare and Prism Medical businesses. We're particularly pleased with Shield, and it's been well received since we acquired the majority interest in last October. So although our overall home care sales volumes are still relatively modest, this is a strategically important market for us. And together with the movement of procedures to the ASC, the Ambulatory Surgical Center represents enormous growth opportunity for Henry Schein.\nSo let me conclude my remarks -- my opening remarks before Ron takes over with the specific math. We believe we delivered solid second quarter financial results, again, including strong operating cash flow. And although in the short term, we expect our results to be impacted by the challenging economic environment in certain markets, we have in dentistry experienced these kinds of ups and downs over the years. This one seems to be a little bit more of a challenge. And of course, the anticipated recovery from the cyber incident has been slower, but consistent. Every month, we get a little bit better.\nSo we remain bullish about the prospects for the business in general. Of course, we'll get into more details. But before we get into answering questions, let me ask Ron to discuss our quarterly financial results and the '24 guidance with a little bit greater detail. So thank you, everyone. Ron, please?\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. All items excluded from our second quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2024 and 2023 are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is also available in our quarterly earnings presentation on our website.\nWith respect to sales, I will provide details on total sales, total sales growth as well as LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared to the prior year and excludes acquisitions.\nTurning to our second quarter results. Global sales were $3.1 billion, with sales growth of 1.1%. This reflects 4.0% sales growth from acquisitions, a 0.5% sales decrease resulting from foreign exchange rates, a 0.5% sales decrease from lower sales of PPE, which is primarily the result of lower glove pricing and the pace of recovery from the cyber incident late last year.\nLCI sales for the quarter decreased 2.4%, which includes a 0.5% decrease from lower PPE sales. As noted by Stan, our underlying sales growth for the quarter reflects improving sales trends in our distribution businesses. However, the pace of recovery in these businesses since the cyber incident late last year has been slower than anticipated. Our GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2024 was 5.09%, a 137 basis point decline compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the second quarter was 7.75%, a 41 basis point decline compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. Consistent with our BOLD+1 strategic plan, gross margin expanded by 101 basis points primarily due to a greater contribution from high-growth, high-margin products and services. Operating expenses were higher as a percentage of sales, primarily due to recent acquisitions and lower sales at our distribution businesses.\nSecond quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $104 million or $0.80 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $140 million or $1.06 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income was $158 million or $1.23 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $173 million or $1.31 per diluted share.\nThe foreign currency exchange impact on our second quarter diluted EPS was unfavorable by approximately $0.01 versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2024 was $268 million compared to the second quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $279 million with EBITDA growth expected to accelerate in the second half of the year.\nTurning to our second quarter sales results. Global dental sales were $1.9 billion, with sales decreasing 1.7%. LCI sales decreased 2.1% or 1.7% when excluding PPE sales. Global Dental merchandise LCI sales decreased 2.6% versus the prior year as the pace of our recovery in merchandise sales following last year's cyber incident is taking longer than anticipated.\nRegarding dental equipment, although our global LCI sales decreased 0.4%, our North American equipment LCI sales grew 2.9%, with solid growth in our traditional equipment category, digital imaging, CAD/CAM as well as our parts and service business. Overall, digital equipment sales were up slightly from the prior year.\nOur international equipment LCI sales decreased 5.5%. And as Stan noted earlier, this was the result of sales decreases in France, Italy and Australia, with sales in other markets in line with last year. Changes in French legislation limiting DSOs negatively impacted equipment investment in France, while the overall equipment market in Italy was slow. In addition, the end of tax incentives last year in Australia and the U.K. provide a difficult year-on-year comparisons in these markets.\nWe expect modest overall equipment sales growth for the remainder of the year in both North America and internationally. Dental specialty product sales were approximately $279 million with growth of 7.2%, driven by strong dental implant and biomaterial sales in Europe as well as endodontics sales globally.\nGlobal Technology and value-added services sales during the second quarter were $214 million, with total sales growth of 10.8%. LCI sales growth of 3.9% included 2.9% LCI sales growth in North America and 10.5% LCI sales growth internationally. In North America, while sales growth is still recovering from the Change Healthcare disruption, we have solid growth in our value-added services, revenue cycle management and Dentrix, Ascend practice management businesses.\nInternational growth was driven by our entirely cloud-based solution. Global Medical sales during the second quarter were $1.0 billion, with sales growth of 5.0% and LCI sales decreased of 4.3%, reflecting the slower pace of recovery from the cyber incident as well as lower PPE sales as a result of lower pricing and ongoing migration to generic alternatives for certain branded pharmaceuticals.\nExcluding PPE sales, LCI sales decreased 3.6%. Our Home Solutions business had strong growth driven by recent acquisitions. As Stan noted, we also benefited the first quarter this year from strong point-of-care diagnostic test sales driven by flu seasonality.\nRegarding stock buybacks, we repurchased approximately 1.4 million shares of common stock in the open market during the second quarter, buying at an average price of $70.64 per share for a total of approximately $100 million. We had approximately $90 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases at the end of the quarter. An additional $500 million of share repurchases was authorized by our Board of Directors on July 31. We expect to repurchase approximately $175 million in shares in the second half of this year, but this new authorization provides us the flexibility to repurchase more.\nTurning to our cash flow. We had strong operating cash flow of $296 million for the second quarter, which exceeded operating cash flow of $274 million last year. Year-to-date, operating cash flow was $493 million, driven by lower working capital and $192 million more than last year. Restructuring expenses in the second quarter were $15 million or $0.08 per diluted share and were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative, that specific initiative was completed on July 31, 2024, and these expenses mainly related to severance benefits and costs related to exiting certain facilities.\nAs Stan mentioned, we also announced today a new restructuring initiative that we expect to continue over the next 18 months, targeting $75 million to $100 million in annual run rate savings.\nOur second quarter GAAP results include $10 million in pretax proceeds as part of our cyber insurance claim. As we have previously mentioned, this policy has a $60 million claim limit on after-tax losses with a $5 million retention. We expect to continue to receive payments over time. The $10 million of proceeds received in the second quarter is not included in our non-GAAP results and is detailed along with other non-GAAP adjustments in Exhibit B of today's press release.\nI'll conclude my remarks with our updated 2024 financial guidance. At this time, we are not yet able to provide without unreasonable efforts an estimate of the restructuring costs associated with the new restructuring plan for 2024, although we expect this to primarily include severance pay and facility-related costs. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance.\nOur 2024 guidance is for continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have closed and does not include the impact of potential future acquisitions. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\nOur 2024 total sales growth is now expected to be 4% to 6% over 2023 versus our previous guidance of 8% to 10% growth. The previous guidance anticipated a stronger economy as well as a faster recovery from the cyber incident. This sales guidance also includes sales from the acquisitions we have completed to date.\nFor 2024, we now expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $4.70 to $4.82, which compares with previous guidance of $5 even to $5.16 and reflects growth of 4% to 7% compared with 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.50. This guidance reflects an estimated non-GAAP effective tax rate of 25%.\nAs a result of the timing of implementing our restructuring plans, we expect year-over-year growth in diluted EPS to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Our 2024 adjusted EBITDA is expected to grow in the low double-digit percentages versus 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $984 million and compares with prior guidance of more than 15% growth.\nWe expect adjusted EBITDA to grow faster than non-GAAP diluted EPS because of higher interest expense, a higher effective tax rate and higher depreciation as a result of the investments we have made to execute on our strategic plan. Through the second quarter, our specialties products, technology and value-added services contributed 38.5% of total non-GAAP operating income. We continue to believe that we will achieve our goal of exceeding 40% operating income contribution from these products and services for the full year.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. So as we lead into the Q&A, I want to reiterate, we are confident in the prospects for our business even in the face of challenging economic conditions. Although we do believe the markets are stable. And then we continue to gain market share to the recovery from the cyber incident, which are going in a good direction, but not as fast as we expected when we gave last guidance a quarter ago. And we're also comfortable that we will benefit from the trends and increased specialty procedures.\nI think we've rounded out the implant offering we have. We had a big gap. We've got that in place in the United States in Canada soon. And we're also confident that the movement of medical procedures to alternate care settings will continue. We are generating good synergies, connecting our distribution businesses, specialty products and technology and value-added services. While we focus on these opportunities, we're also taking action to increase shareholder value, as you've noted, in the restructuring plan, we need to rightsize the restructuring plan. The sales have not grown as rapidly as we thought. Some of that is attributable to the fact that inflation does not exist at the moment. We believe in our markets very moderate and actually going down slightly as our customers are more price conscious and moving to some alternative brands and owned brands. But we think from a gross profit point of view, this will be fine. In fact, maybe slightly accretive. And of course, we will continue to buy stock. We anticipate spending the $500 million.\nAnd so with that in mind, please, let's answer some questions, operator."

[Operator Instruction]. And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of Investor Relations & Strategic Finance Project Officer\n\nThank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the first quarter of 2024. With me on today's call are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that's forward-looking. Risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements, and the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such statements.\nThese forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and included in the Risk Factors section of those filings.\nIn addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates.\nToday's remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in Exhibit B of today's press release and can be found in the Financials and Filings section of our Investor Relations website under the Supplemental Information heading. And also in our quarterly earnings presentation also posted on our Investor Relations website.\nThe content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 7, 2024. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. Lastly, during today's Q&A session, please let yourself to a single question and a follow-up.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our first quarter financial results reflect solid earnings, driven by gross profit -- gross margin expansion and strong recovery from last quarter's cyber incident. We estimate that the incident lowered merchandise sales growth by low to mid-single-digit percentages during the quarter.\nOn PPE products, sales continued to decrease primarily due to lower glove prices for the last year -- from the last year. We estimate a reduced impact on sales growth from PPE as the year progresses.\nWe're very pleased with the progress we're making on executing our BOLD+1 strategic plan, and we are pleased with the contribution of our recent acquisitions. These acquisitions contributed to the profitability we achieved in the first quarter.\nWe are affirming our expectations for 2024 non-GAAP diluted EPS and -- and 2024 adjusted EBITDA growth and tightening our expectations for 2024 total sales growth.\nOur projected sales growth reflects continued recovery from last year's cyber incident and a strong pipeline of new specialty products and software innovation.\nSo let me turn to the review of our business units and start with Dental on the distribution side. In North America, patient traffic to dental offices in January and February was impacted by weather events and by seasonal viruses, including the flu, but improved beginning in March.\nOverall, we see steady dental merchandise sales improvement throughout the quarter, reflecting this trend, which has continued into April.\nIn the U.S., our Thrive signature program is contributing to sales growth and membership continued to increase with about 2,000 new members added in the first quarter. bringing the total number of Thrive Signature members to approximately 5,000.\nFor monthly subscription, this program provides a package of services to customers such as free shipping, discount on product and services and Thrive reward points, which, of course, in the aggregate drive customer loyalty.\nInternational merchandise also experienced steady sales improvement in most markets as the quarter progressed. Sales growth was negatively impacted by 2 less selling days in most of the international markets.\nGlobal dental equipment sales were consistent with the prior year and were favorably affected by a shift in sales in the United States from late 2023 into the first quarter. Equipment sales grew in North of America but decreased slightly internationally.\nSo now a few comments on our dental specialties, the global dental specialties business. We had a strong growth across oral surgical products, endodontics and orthodontics, largely driven by acquisitions and we believe we also gained market share organically in the global dental specialties market.\nNorth America implant and North American implant sales were largely consistent with last year. And international sales under our leading Verizon's Camlog brand were very good, and this was especially good in Germany.\nIn the first quarter, international sales benefited from the introduction of Easy 2.0, our value implant system in Germany, which is also designed for ease of use. We expect the launch of a new BioHorizons implant system in the U.S. in the second half of the year and early next year in Canada.\nThis launch will be for a new bone-level implant with a deep conical connection and is based upon our proven Camlog technology. We expect this will expand our addressable market significantly in the United States, thus increasing implant sales growth in the second half of the year.\nSo along with the introduction of [ SIN value implants, ] this launch will position the company well in all market segments in North America. We achieved good endodontic growth sales during the first quarter as we launched our Edge branded products through the Henry Schein U.S. distribution business.\nAlthough orthodontic product sales are relatively small -- a relatively small part of our specialty product sales, the launch of our Motion Probe bracket system is performing well and specifically addressing the exploration last year's motion product rates.\nWe also launched the BioTech Smilers Clear Aligner clinical, digital workflow software at the American Association of Orthodontics meeting last week, both of which have already been successfully launched in Europe through Biotech Dental.\nLet me now turn to the technology and value-added services businesses. We're the largest component is Henry Schein One, our dental software business. The customer base for Dentrix Ascend and Dentally, our cloud-based solutions continue to grow and increased 36% and -- in the first quarter over the prior year, and now we have approximately 8,000 installations of our cloud-based systems.\nWe achieved solid growth in our revenue cycle management e-claims business despite the impact of Change Healthcare impact of their cyber incident. This was due to the Henry Schein One team's prompt responsiveness to establish an alternative approach to processing customer insurance claims.\nWithin 48 hours, we successfully were processing claims and backlog through an alternative clearing house. We are very pleased with the team's approach on dealing with the Change Healthcare cyber incident. And this helped us navigate a challenge for our customers, and I might add many new customers that now have turned to Henry Schein One for help during this challenging period for Change Healthcare.\nAlthough we believe overall technology sales were impacted by the Change Healthcare cyber incident, we expect sales in the second quarter to return to more normalized growth levels.\nTurning to the Medical business. There was a strong contribution from sales of point-of-care diagnostics, including flu and multi [indiscernible] flu COVID combination test and a shift in sales towards lower-priced generic pharmaceuticals in our medical business.\nOur North American Rescue business, which provides first responder and Military Medical Solutions as well as our Home Solutions businesses performed well during the quarter.\nWe also completed our acquisition of TriMed in early April strengthening our medical group's deep and long-standing relationships with IDNs, ASC and orthopedic specialist customers as we expand our offering into the orthopedic marketplace.\nFinally, we are pleased to share that late last week, we hosted our fourth Annual Thrive Live event in Las Vegas and had record attendance this year of nearly 1,500 attendees with significant support from our suppliers. This is primarily an education event where our customers gain continuing education credits through seminars in the largest -- in the latest innovation and clinical dentistry, including digital equipment and software.\nThis year featured the launch of some new innovations to help our customers attract new business, such as our new Dentrix eligibility Pro module that automates the delivery of claims eligibility data directly into the practice management software system. We believe this is quite a unique software feature.\nAnd I'm particularly pleased with the integration was Reserved with Google, a new product that we also launched at the Thrive Live event. This enables consumers who search on Google to make dental appointments directly from the pro -- their Google business listing into our customers' practice management systems and schedulers.\nThese advancements support our continued commitment to driving innovation in the industry with products and services that add value to our customers' dental practices, enabling our customers to operate in more efficient practice while actually providing better clinical care.\nLet me now turn over the call to Ron to discuss our quarterly financial results in a bit more detail. Thank you very much.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. The items excluded from our first quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2024 and 2023 are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release.\nA reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP income statement is also available in our quarterly earnings presentation on our website, which includes the non-GAAP effects of adjustments on noncontrolling interest.\nAlso, please note that for most international businesses, the first quarter had 2 fewer selling days than the first quarter of last year. With respect to sales, I will provide details of total sales, related sales growth and LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared with the prior year and excludes acquisitions.\nTurning to our first quarter results. Global sales were $3.2 billion, with sales growth of 3.7% and LCI sales decreased 1.8%. Please note that our sales growth for the quarter reflects the residual impact of the cyber incident, which we estimate reduced sales growth by approximately 300 to 400 basis points.\nIn addition, lower PPE sales, primarily due to lower glove pricing, reduced sales growth by 60 basis points. Our GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2024 was 4.72%, a 101 basis point decline compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the first quarter was 7.11%, a 57 basis point decline compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. Gross margin improved 32 basis points primarily due to the contribution of businesses acquired in 2023.\nOperating expenses were higher as a percentage of sales, primarily due to lower sales at our distribution businesses.\nFirst quarter 2024 GAAP net income was $93 million or $0.72 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $121 million or $0.91 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2024 non-GAAP net income was $143 million or $1.10 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $161 million or $1.21 per diluted share.\nThe residual impact of the cyber incident on our first quarter 2024 results was consistent with the expectations we set out in the guidance we provided on our earnings call in February.\nThe foreign currency exchange impact on our first quarter diluted EPS was favorable by approximately $0.01 versus the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2024 was $255 million, which is consistent with the first quarter 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $256 million.\nTurning to our first quarter sales results. Global Dental sales were $1.9 billion, with sales growth of 0.8% and LCI sales decreased by 2.9%. The Global Dental merchandise LCI sales decreased by 3.7% versus the prior year. Merchandise sales were impacted by lower purchases by episodic customers and by lower PPE sales.\nGlobal Dental Equipment LCI sales increased 0.2%. Our North American equipment LCI sales grew 2.9% and with some traditional equipment sales having shifted into the first quarter from last year.\nInternational equipment sales decreased 3.8% with positive trends in Germany, driven by technical service. On a global basis, CAD/CAM equipment grew nicely with pricing on intraoral scanners having stabilized. Digital imaging sales decreased slightly.\nDental specialty product sales were approximately $284 million with growth of 21.6% driven by acquisitions with low single-digit organic growth in implants and endodontics.\nGlobal Technology and value-added services sales during the first quarter were $217 million with total sales growth of 13.8%. LCI sales growth of 3.2% included 2.3% LCI sales growth in North America and 8.9% LCI sales growth internationally.\nIn North America, sales growth was driven primarily by value-added services, while international growth was driven by our Dentally cloud-based solution.\nDuring the first quarter, we exceeded our goal of generating 40% of total non-GAAP operating income from our high-growth, high-margin businesses, with that metric coming in at 40.9% for the quarter.\nGlobal Medical sales during the first quarter were $1.0 billion, with sales growth of 7.3% and LCI sales decreased 0.7%. The -- we have strong sales of point-of-care diagnostics, but lower PPE sales as well as lower pharmaceutical sales due to conversion to lower-priced generics. The cyber incident also impacted sales to episodic customers, which we are working to regain.\nRegarding stock repurchases, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock in the open market during the first quarter. buying at an average price of $75.10 per share for a total of approximately $75 million. We had approximately $190 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases at the end of the quarter.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the flexibility and financial stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while continuing to return capital to our stockholders and reducing borrowings.\nOperating cash flow for the first quarter was $197 million compared with $27 million last year, driven by a reduction in our receivable balances, which were elevated at the end of the year.\nRestructuring expenses in the first quarter were $10 million or $0.06 per diluted share and were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits and costs relating to exiting certain facilities.\nWe reported other non-GAAP adjustments in the first quarter, which are detailed in Exhibit B to today's press release.\nI'll conclude my remarks with our 2024 financial guidance. At this time, we are still unable to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and restructuring for 2024. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance.\nWe are affirming our guidance for non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA growth. In addition, we are updating our guidance for total sales growth.\nFor 2024, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc, to be in the range of $5 to $5.16 per share. reflecting growth of 11% to 15% compared to 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.50.\nAs a reminder, our 2024 guidance does not include any associated benefit from potential insurance claim proceeds related to last year's cyber incident. Our policy has a $60 million claim limit on an after-tax basis with a $5 million retention.\nWe have begun the process of filing a claim and believe it is covered under our cyber policy, although final resolution remains subject to insurer approval. We do not expect to begin recording any benefits from the claim recovery until later in the year.\nOur 2024 adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to increase by more than 15% versus 2023 adjusted EBITDA of $984 million. Our 2024 total sales guidance is now expected to be 8% to 10% growth over 2023 versus our previous guidance of 8% to 12% growth.\nThis projected growth reflects continued recovery by our distribution business from the cyber incident and a strong pipeline of new specialty products and software innovation contributing to higher sales growth in the second half of the year.\nWe expect modest overall equipment sales growth for the remainder of the year, with traditional equipment sales in line with last year and strong growth in Technical Services and CAD/CAM equipment.\nThis sales guidance also includes sales from the acquisitions we have completed to date. Our 2024 guidance is for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have closed, does not include the impact of future share repurchases and potential future acquisitions.\nGuidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. As investors can hear, we continue to make good progress in restoring sales to pre-incident levels with specific focus on bringing back episodic customers and advancing several programs, of course, to reinforce to our customers the value and benefits Henry Schein provides to our customers.\nAgain, we have made steady progress in this area and are quite optimistic as we restore our sales on the distribution side to pre-incident levels and beyond. We are making good progress with the BOLD+1 strategic priorities, which are driving growth and further strengthening our business and value proposition.\nYou can see from the investor package posted on the website, that in each area of the BOLD+1, we are executing quite well. The new innovative products and software enhancements, clinical digital workflow for dental implants some good work in the endodontic and orthodontic areas should positively impact momentum as the year goes by.\nThese new innovations, coupled with sales growth we are seeing from our recent acquisitions, should enable us to meet both short and long-term expectations and are hopeful that we could even exceed that.\nSo with the overview of the business and our financial results, we are ready to take questions. Operator, we're ready if you are. Thank you."

Lastly, to join today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We are rather pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023, which was in line with our expectations and reflects a solid recovery from last year's cybersecurity incident. Our fourth quarter financial results included strong growth in our technology and value-added services businesses and in global sales of implants and biomaterials, largely driven by acquisitions and were negatively impacted by higher-than-usual acquisition-related expenses and adjustments.\nAs we discussed last quarter, the cyber incident primarily affected our dental and medical distribution businesses in North America and Europe. These distribution businesses have covered well in the second half of the quarter. The revenue impact from the incident was at the low end of our expectations, and the earnings impact was at the high end, largely due to the success of our promotion activity which drove sales and customer retention. Overall, we feel good about the pace of our recovery driven by our durable customer loyalty, and strong relationships, our field sales consultants, our telesales representatives and service technicians have with our customers around the world. And of course, coupled with our most effective direct marketing and customer care capabilities, which includes a very strong e-commerce presence, particularly on social media.\nToday, our North American and international distribution businesses are experiencing merchandise sales and are running below pre-cyber security below the pre-cyber security levels pre-cybersecurity incident levels, and we estimate that the incident is currently having a low single-digit percentage headwind in to our merchandise sales growth with some episodic customers not fully return yet. We are doing a lot of work in this area, and we expect the residual impact to be short term and diminish over the first half of the year through our sales and marketing programs, and as I noted, including our digital marketing --\n-- the 2024 guidance we are introducing today reflects our continued confidence in the stability of the underlying markets we serve, our recovery efforts from the cybersecurity incident and the execution of our strategic plan. For 2024, while we expect to have some short-term residual impact from the cybersecurity incident, we believe we will continue to strengthen our leading market position. The markets we serve are expected to grow towards the lower end of the ranges we set out at our Investor Day last year. And we also expect some remaining impact from lower year-over-year PPE pricing, primarily impacting sales growth in the first quarter or the first third of the year. We are also introducing adjusted EBITDA guidance as we believe this provides investors with an additional metric that reflects the performance of the business as we pivot to higher growth, higher-margin products and services. We believe we are well positioned to grow the business in line with our financial goals of high single-digit to low double-digit operating income and earnings per share by continuing to execute on our BOLD+1 strategic plan.\nSo let me now turn to a review of our quarterly highlights from each of our business units, beginning with the dental distribution business. In North America, we believe patient traffic to [ denotes picked ] up in November and December. Although in January, illness and weather impacted cancellations, but this has improved in February. We have seen in our medical business that point-of-care diagnostic sales are also strong, indicating that flu visits to medical doctors are elevated as a result of the SAS late flu season, and which adversely impacted dental patient traffic. We expect the effect on patient traffic from the flu season to normalize by the end of March.\nInternational markets remained steady and consistent with the third quarter. Regarding North America and international demo equipment, there was a decline in sales, both in traditional and digital equipment. Equipment sales is very important, reflects a redeployment of our field sales consultants as well as our equipment sales specialists during the cybersecurity incident to focus on addressing immediate customer needs rather than initiating and processing new equipment orders, resulting in moving sales into the first quarter 2024.\nDigital equipment sales also reflected year-over-year lower prices of intra-oral scanners, but we expect to see good demand for intra-oral scanners to continue and the impact of these price declines to be less significant going forward. We've had a lot of questions on this, but we expect equipment sales to be supported by the investment plans of many of our DSO customers we have in place -- who have these plans in place and have continued to expand their operations, and this not only applies to the national DSOs, but to many of the regional DSOs too, who are investing in their practices both from an equipment point of view and a software point of view.\nThe impact of lower global equipment sales was partially offset by overall good growth in our global equipment technical services. Our technical services capability is a strategic advantage for us as we believe we provide excellent response times and high-quality service for our customers. We are known for this globally.\nNow let's turn to the global dental specialties businesses or products. Turning to the global dental specialty products. We believe we continue to increase our global market share in implants and biomaterials this quarter as we believe for the full year of 2023. We believe the implant markets we serve in the aggregate were generally flat in the fourth quarter against the previous [ case, the 22 ] sales against that backdrop, and I'm referring to the market in general, by the way, against that backdrop, our global implant and biomaterial sales grew by quite a bit more than 30%, mainly due from acquisitions, but also some internal growth.\nWe posted significant growth in the European, Latin American and Asian markets, mainly from the biotech acquisition of France and the Sun acquisition in Brazil, along with above market share growth. in our leading [ by Horizon's Camlog ] brand in Europe, primarily in Germany, while we had low single-digit growth in our U.S. implant sales. As a result of the cyber incident, our endodontic sales growth slowed somewhat last quarter. Our orthodontic sales were also impacted by the cyber incident and by the expiration of the motion product patents earlier this year.\nTo address this, we launched the replacement up this quarter, which is being well received in the marketplace. We remain fairly optimistic about the growth in our data specialty products in 2024. As we have a robust pipeline of product innovations plan across various geographies in the first half of the year, and we expect sales growth to continue to outpace the market growth.\nLet's turn now to our Technology and Value-Added Services business. Excellent sales growth was driven by Henry Schein One with most core products posting double-digit gains, including our practice management software, revenue cycle management, analytics and our AI solutions. As we have seen earlier, Henry Schein in growth was driven by Dentrix Ascend and entirely cloud-based solutions. The customer base of cloud solutions continue to grow well and increased by about 36% compared with the start of the year. We launched a number of digital clinical workflow solutions for our customers, including AI technologies to provide our customers with highly effective diagnostic solutions.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we worked with 1 of the largest DSOs to introduce their AI solution. We are pleased to now have over 1,000 users subscribing to these solutions. Product enhancements introduced last quarter, including remote scheduling and payments are also contributed to growth. claims eligibility and patient relationship management features will be areas of significant focus during 2024. We continue to see strong interest and good growth in Dentrix Ascend from our DSO customers, and we have recently announced 2 new large multisite Dentrix Ascend accounts.\nTurning to our Medical business. Growth during the fourth quarter was also impacted by the cybersecurity incident. In addition, the late flu season also negatively impacted point-of-care diagnostic sales and patient visits, which were down versus the prior year. However, the late flu season is driving higher quarter 1 sales. Our new $300 million-plus home care platform grew sales in the high single digits during the quarter, with this market segment continued to grow faster than the overall health care market.\nFinally, in late December, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire a majority interest in TriMet, which marks our entry into the upper and lower extremity segment and the growing orthopedic market. This being a complement to our [ Brusa ] source and blades business, which is also doing quite well. This transaction, the TriMet investment fills a need, particularly for our ambulatory surgical center and orthopedic specialist customers, we expect to leverage our customer relationships and our contractual expertise to grow the business. We expect to close this transaction later this quarter. Concurrently, we entered into a strategic relationship with extremity medical and [ most device ] company focused on developing complementary products for bone infusion, fixation and motion prevention treatments.\nSo in summary, we are executing well against our BOLD+1 strategic plan, and we made significant progress, very pleased with us on our strategic priorities during 2023. We did complete a number of strategic acquisitions, investing almost $1 billion, supportive of our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan. These acquisitions are growing well in the high single digits to low double-digit percentages. And we are on track to achieve our goal of generating 40% of our operating income from sales of our high-growth, high-margin products and services. And we estimate that we would only have to be slightly below that threshold that we would only would have been slightly below that threshold in the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2023, if the cyber incident had not occurred.\nAs we look to 2024, our priorities include continuing to focus on customer experience. This is critical for us in all businesses. And of course, the recovery of sales post cyber post the cybersecurity incident. Third, we also will focus on and prioritize further enhancing technology and product development, including our integrated digital workflow and continue to grow sales in specialty products by integrating recent acquisitions and through new product launches. And we believe we have a good pipeline of product launches in both our dental specialties products area and our value-added services, including Henry Schein well. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron to discuss our quarterly financial results and our 2024 guidance release.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2023 and 2022 exclude integration and restructuring costs, amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, certain asset impairment costs as well as expenses directly related to the cybersecurity incident. This is detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. The fourth quarter of 2022 included 1 additional selling week compared with the fourth quarter of 2023.\nWe report on a 52-, 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. And the extra week in 2022 was the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day. The next time, our results include an extra selling week will be in 2028. With respect to sales growth, I will focus on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared with the prior year and excludes acquisitions. To facilitate a more meaningful comparison, we've also excluded the estimated extra week of sales in the prior year from our LCI sales growth figures.\nPlease note that our sales growth was adversely impacted by the cybersecurity incident, and we estimate the reduction of fourth quarter sales was between $350 million to $400 million worldwide.\nTurning to our fourth quarter results. Global sales of $3.0 billion reflected an LCI sales decrease of 12% with the cybersecurity incident impacting sales growth by an estimated 10% to 12%. Our GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 1.28%, an 87 basis point decrease compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, Operating margin for the fourth quarter was 4.86%, a 279 basis point decline compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin and was primarily a result of the cybersecurity incident, and the sales recovery initiatives we introduced in the quarter. We estimate that the cybersecurity incident negatively impacted our operating income by approximately $120 million to $130 million in the fourth quarter.\nFourth quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $18 million or $0.13 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $47 million or $0.34 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $86 million or $0.66 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $184 million or $1.35 per diluted share. The fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP EPS includes $0.05 of acquisition expenses and related adjustments, which compares to $0.02 in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Details for the quarter and full year are included in Exhibit D to our press release.\nWe estimate that the cybersecurity incident impacted our fourth quarter 2023 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per diluted share. The foreign currency exchange impact on our fourth quarter EPS was favorable by $0.01, and the impact on full year EPS was immaterial. Turning to our fourth quarter sales results. Global Dental sales were $1.8 billion, and LCI sales decreased by 10.9% and with underlying sales growth being offset by the impact of the cybersecurity incident. Global Dental merchandise LCI sales decreased by 11.3% versus the prior year. Global dental equipment LCI sales decreased 9.7%.\nAs Stanley mentioned, there were delays in processing new equipment orders, moving some sales into 2024. Dental specialty product sales were approximately $281 million in the fourth quarter with growth of 17.2%, driven by acquisitions and solid organic growth in implants and biomaterials. Global Technology and Value-Added Services sales during the fourth quarter were $212 million with total sales growth of 13.4%. And sales growth of 7.1% included 6.8% LCI sales growth in North America and 9.8% LCI sales growth internationally. In North America, sales growth was driven primarily by our practice management solutions business, particularly [ Dentrend ], while internationally, growth was driven by our [ Dentale ] cloud-based solution. Global Medical sales during the fourth quarter were $1.0 billion, and LCI sales decreased 17% as sales were also impacted by the cybersecurity incident. Regarding stock repurchases.\nWe repurchased approximately center to 92,000 shares of common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, buying at an average price of $72.32 per share for a total of $50 million. For the full year, we invested $250 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares. At fiscal year-end, we had approximately $265 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases.\nAdditionally, to accelerate the implementation of our BOLD+1 strategic plan, we invested $287 million in business acquisitions during the fourth quarter and $955 million for the full year. Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the flexibility and financial stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our stockholders. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was an outflow of $32 million compared with positive $254 million last year.\nThis decrease is primarily due to delayed billings in the quarter relating to the cybersecurity incident which resulted in abnormally high receivable balances at the end of the year. We expect improvements to cash flow in the first quarter as we make these collections and receivable balances return to normal levels. For the full year, operating cash flow was $500 million compared with $602 million in 2022. Restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter were $21 million or $0.08 per diluted share that were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits, costs relating to exiting certain facilities and the planned exit of a noncore business. In addition, in the fourth quarter, we incurred expenses of $11 million or $0.06 per diluted share that were directly related to the cybersecurity incident mostly consisting of professional fees. We expect to incur some additional professional fees and other expenses related to the cybersecurity incident in 2024, but at a lower amount.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we also recorded a charge of $27 million or $0.15 per diluted share related to a noncash impairment of capitalized assets in Europe and a charge of $7 million or $0.04 per diluted share related to a noncash impairment of some intangible assets. I'll conclude my remarks by introducing our 2024 financial guidance. At this time, we are unable to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and rest restructuring for 2024 and direct expenses associated with the cybersecurity incident, Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance.\nAs usual, we are introducing 2024 financial guidance for total sales growth and diluted non-GAAP EPS. In addition, we are providing guidance for 2024 adjusted EBITDA. We believe this provides an additional metric, reflecting the performance of the business as we pivot to more high-growth, high-margin products and services. For 2024, we expect our non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $5 to $5.16. And reflecting growth of 11% to 15% compared with 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.50. This guidance reflects an estimated residual impact of the cybersecurity incident of approximately $0.15 per diluted share, which we expect to primarily impact the first quarter. and an estimated increase in the non-GAAP effective tax rate for 23% to 25% or approximately $0.13 per diluted share.\nWe expect to file an insurance claim arising from the cybersecurity incident and believe our claim will be covered under our cyber policy. Although final resolution is subject to insurer approval, this policy has a $60 million claim limit on an after-tax basis, with a $5 million retention, and we would not expect it to be recognized until later in the year.\nOur 2024 guidance does not include any associated benefit from potential insurance claim proceeds from this claim. As Stan said, we now believe the sales of COVID test kits and PPE have reached a point where year-over-year comparability has largely normalized, and we do not expect to break out the related EPS impact. We do expect there to be some remaining impact from lower year-over-year PPE pricing, primarily impacting sales growth in the first quarter.\nOur 2024 non-GAAP total sales guidance is 8% to 12% growth over 2023 with higher growth anticipated in the second half of the year, reflecting merchandise sales growth from the business recovery from the cybersecurity incident. This sales guidance also includes sales from the acquisitions we completed in 2023. Our 2024 adjusted EBITDA growth is expected to increase by more than 15% versus 2023 adjusted EBITDA and of $984 million. As Stan mentioned, we expect market growth rates to be at the lower end of our long-term assumptions.\nOur 2024 guidance is for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have been announced, and does not include the impact of future share repurchases and potential future acquisitions. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Stan.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe 2024 guidance that Ron just discussed reflect somewhat of a transition year following the cyber incident. That said, we are incredibly pleased with the great strides the team has made in our recovery efforts. Actually, it's quite remarkable how effective this team operated while actually advancing our -- the execution of our strat plan. We look forward to continuing this momentum and delivering our long-term growth metrics that we established during our Analyst Day event last February. I know we've covered a lot of ground today. It's a little bit complex, but we are here to clarify any questions or thoughts that investors may have. So please."

[Operator Instructions]\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before reviewing our third quarter performance, I'd like to update investors on the cybersecurity incident that were discovered on Saturday, October 14, primarily affecting some of our distribution businesses. That morning, we initiated our business continuity plan when we promptly took precautionary actions, including taking certain systems off-line and other steps intended to contain the incident, which led to temporary disruption of some of our operations.\nThe following week, our distribution centers were processing orders with temporary interim processes and were generally delivering orders to customers within 1 to 2 business days. In accordance with our business continuity plan, we activated a previously identified team of leading cybersecurity experts to assist in the investigation and recovery of the systems and to advise us through the recovery process. Over the past weeks, we have worked to create a clean network in a controlled manner from the backup data we maintained.\nOur distribution businesses are now operational and we are initiating our e-commerce platform early this week, and we're indeed hopeful that the website will come up tomorrow morning. We've also made significant progress resuming the high levels of service our customers expect from us. Over the last week, orders from our distribution businesses were approximately 85% to 90% of what they were pre-incident.\nWe expect orders to increase with the reactivation of our e-commerce platform. Of course, our field sales consultants and telesales representatives have deep relationships with our customers, and our complementary software and other value-added services bring value that we believe continues to make us the best choice for our customers in the areas of services we provide.\nAs a reminder, this incident mostly affected the operations of our North American and European dental and medical distribution businesses. Our distribution operations in Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Brazil were generally not affected. Henry Schein One, our practice management software, revenue cycle management and patient relationship management business was not affected. And our manufacturing businesses and our equipment sales and service operations were mostly unaffected.\nWe are now aware that a significant amount of information was obtained by an unauthorized third party in the cybersecurity incident. Bank account information for a limited number of suppliers was misused, and we have already separately addressed this with those impacted. More details have been posted on our Investor Relations website. We are continuing our investigation of the cybersecurity incident. In a moment, Ron will speak about the financial impact of the cybersecurity incident, which will affect our fourth quarter financial results.\nI would like to extend a harmful thanks to our customers as well as our suppliers and team members for their patience and the incredible support we've received from all of our constituents during this period. Our customers, our suppliers and our team understand that a cyber incident could occur to any business and has been particularly prevalent in the health care arena over the last 6 months.\nTurning now to the third quarter. We're reporting solid financial results for the third quarter. We achieved good total sales growth and non-GAAP diluted EPS growth despite continued lower sales of PPE and COVID-19 tests. Our internal sales growth slowed in the third quarter due to some market softness in September as a result of general macroeconomic weakness as well as lower sales of PPE products at COVID tests. However, we believe that the dental and medical markets that we serve are relatively recession-resilient.\nSales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits continue to decline but at lower rate compared to the earlier year. Increased customer demand for lower-priced corporate brand, merchandise and generic products, along with growth of equipment technical service revenue, also has helped our profitability this quarter. Profitability for the quarter benefited from our technology, value-added services and dental specialty products as we continue towards our goal of achieving 40% of operating income from sales of high-growth, high-margin products.\nWe are now more than halfway through our 3-year gold BOLD+1 strategic plan. Despite current macroeconomic conditions and the cybersecurity incident, we have confidence in the stability of the dental and medical markets and remain committed to our strategic priorities and long-term financial model, which includes high single-digit to low double-digit growth in operating income.\nYear-to-date, we have closed several strategic investments, and just last month, we were pleased to announce the closing of the acquisition of Shield Healthcare, a business that distributes medical products to patients in the home including continuous glucose monitoring. Overall, these acquired businesses are performing well.\nSo let me turn to a review of our quarterly highlights from each of our business units, beginning with dental distribution. In North America, dental offices generally remain busy. However, dental patient traffic somewhat slowed in September. This seemed to be the result of an increase in patient cancellations, which we believe were partially due to the seasonal uptick of flu cases and COVID-19. And our overall consumable merchandise sales, excluding PPE products reflected this.\nLooking at our international dental business, overall volumes of consumable merchandise held steady across the regions. Sales of traditional dental equipment in North America have largely reverted to prepandemic levels with growth in it mid-single digits. Dental equipment sales continued to be impacted by lower average selling prices, and we expect this to normalize in the first quarter of 2024. The equipment backlog was sequentially slightly higher and included strong orders taken at DS World Show held in September -- actually at the end of September of 2023.\nThis increase reflects typical seasonality as we head into the fourth quarter. International dental equipment sales reflect a slowdown in sales in large equipment, and this is in parts of the world outside of North America, not everywhere. Our equipment sales vary quarter-to-quarter, of course, partially as a result of purchasing dynamics of large DSOs. But over the long term, we continue to expect equipment sales growth in the range of low to mid-single digits.\nDentistry is undergoing a significant transition to integrate high-tech digital workflow systems in the dental practice. Henry Schein is well positioned to be the brand of choice for our customers who are seeking an integrated digital clinical workflow, and we remain confident in the long-term outlook for dental equipment in general.\nTurning now to the dental specialties. Overall, we believe we continued to gain global market share during this quarter. Our global implant business grew 40%, predominantly through acquisitions. BioHorizons Camlog to continue to perform -- outperform the market, growing sales in the mid-single digits. Our acquisitions of Biotech Dental in France and S.I.N., S-I-N, in Brazil are showing strong growth in implants and related products in the local markets. Our value brand, The Dentist, is also growing well. This is offset by somewhat slower -- in fact, a slowing market in North America.\nThe performance of our endodontic business continued to be strong, and the clear aligner segment of our orthodontic business grew by double digits, albeit on a small base. So we're optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for the specialty markets as we continue to see adoption of specialty procedures among general practitioners the growing adoption by DSOs of specialty procedures and, of course, due to the macro trends of demographics.\nWe're also optimistic about the dental specialty products in 2024 as we have a robust new product line with upcoming launches in various geographies. So we are really optimistic about our specialty businesses in 2024 driven by the macro demographic trends and our robust new product pipeline.\nLet's now turn to our technology and value-added services businesses. We had excellent sales growth in our technology and value-added service businesses, driven by the Henry Schein One practice management software sales and by Large Practice Sales, a brokerage business we acquired at the close of this quarter. Henry Schein One's growth continues to be driven by practice management software solutions and, of course, particularly by Dentrix Ascend and Dentally, our cloud-based solutions, which provides the opportunity for their practices to integrate clinical workflow, and it's very important throughout the dental office.\nOnce again, the customer base of cloud solutions increased by about 40% this quarter compared to prior year. DSO accounts in particular are seeking integrated platforms along with the tools that are enhanced by artificial intelligence. In this connection, we recently formed a DSO Strategic Advisory Council, which is strategically focused on growing practice revenues and solving operational issues for large group practices. We, of course, have similar programs for midsized practices and for the smaller practices, where this advisory kind of service is provided by our field sales consultants.\nDuring the third quarter, we introduced new features and upgrades, including the launch of Lighthouse 360. This new platform facilitates integrated patient communications, reputation management and overall practice success. This feature-rich product includes online patient scheduling, digital customized forms for patient intake and payment reminders and more. Henry Schein One's goal is to continue to grow our practice management customer base and to increase the breadth of solutions offered to our existing customers. Our priorities regarding software integration are critical to achieving this goal, and we are well on our way towards an integrated clinical offering for the clinical aspects of the practice with a focus on specialty procedures as well.\nTurning to our medical business. Third quarter growth was in the low single-digit, excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test, similar to recent quarters. This growth reflects high prior year comparison sales growth and higher sales on lower-priced products, including generics and corporate brands, albeit with higher margins. Of note, we are now distributing COVID-19 vaccines, although we do not expect this low-margin product category to have a significant impact on sales or profits. In September, we saw an uptick of sales COVID-19 test kits, which we expect to continue into the fourth quarter.\nSo in summary, the underlying fundamentals of our core business remain solid. We are executing ahead of schedule with our 2022-2024 BOLD+1 strategic plan. So with that in mind, let me ask Ron to discuss the quarterly financial results and our full year guidance. Ron, please?\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nVery good. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As you may have seen on November 2, we filed a notification with the SEC advising that we will not be filing our Q3 Form 10-Q until later in November. This delay is related to our recent cybersecurity incident. We were able to complete our consolidated income statement prior to deactivating our systems. However, we have been delayed in completing our consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows, which we normally include as attachments to our earnings release. These statements will be available when our Q3 Form 10-Q is completed.\nThe third quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2023 and 2022 exclude integration and restructuring costs and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. This is detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. Note that there are no effects of the cybersecurity incident on our Q3 results as the incident occurred in October.\nWith respect to sales growth in the quarter, I will focus primarily on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared with the prior year and excludes acquisitions. Third quarter global sales of $3.2 billion reflected an LCI sales decrease of 1.2%. However, when excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, our LCI sales grew 1.1%. We sold $131 million of PPE products in the third quarter of this year, a decrease of approximately 19% year-over-year. And we sold $44 million in COVID-19 test kits, a decrease of approximately 46% year-over-year.\nOur GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2023 was 6.3%, a 52 basis point decline compared to the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for Q3 was 8.1%, a 12 basis point decline compared to the prior year non-GAAP operating margin with higher gross profit margins offset by higher operating expenses, primarily acquisition-related expenses.\nThird quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $137 million or $1.05 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $150 million or $1.09 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $173 million or $1.32 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $177 million or $1.29 per diluted share. Details of acquisition expense and acquisition-related adjustments for the quarter and year-to-date are included in Exhibit C to our press release. The foreign currency exchange impact on our third quarter EPS was immaterial.\nNow turning to our third quarter sales results. Global Dental sales were $1.9 billion. and LCI sales decreased by 0.2%. Excluding sales of PPE products, LCI sales growth for Global Dental was 0.3%. Global Dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 0.3% or 1.1% when excluding PPE products. North American dental merchandise LCI sales decreased 1.2% compared to the prior year and decreased 0.1% when excluding sales of PPE products.\nInternational dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 2.9% and by 3.2% when excluding sales of PPE products. Global Dental equipment LCI sales decreased 2.0% with mid-single-digit growth in traditional equipment, offset by lower digital equipment sales, reflecting lower intraoral scanner prices as a result of new products introduced late last year.\nOur North America dental equipment LCI sales increased 0.2%. This was against a difficult comparison as North America dental equipment LCI growth was 12.8% in the third quarter of 2022. International equipment LCI sales decreased 5.9% compared to the prior year as a result of some macroeconomic uncertainty in Europe, which primarily impacted digital equipment sales.\nDental specialty products include implants, bone regeneration materials, orthodontic products and endodontics products. Sales of these products were approximately $268 million in the third quarter with reported growth of 25% driven by acquisitions.\nGlobal Technology and value-added services sales during the third quarter were $210 million with LCI growth of 9.6%. In North America, sales growth was driven primarily by our Dentrix Ascend practice management business. Growth internationally was driven by our Dentally cloud-based solution. Our technology and value-added services and specialty products represented about 35% of total operating income in the third quarter.\nGlobal Medical sales during the third quarter were $1.1 billion and LCI sales decreased 4.6% due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. In North America, excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, LCI sales grew 1.0%. This was against a typical comparison as LCI growth, excluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits grew 9.7% in Q3 of 2022.\nRegarding stock repurchases. We repurchased approximately 660,000 shares of common stock in the open market during the third quarter, buying at an average price of $75.79 per share for a total of $50 million. At quarter end, we had approximately $215 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the financial flexibility and stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our stockholders.\nAs we stated last quarter, we have committed over $1 billion to the acquisitions we have announced so far this year, with $417 million invested in business acquisitions that closed in the third quarter and $668 million invested year-to-date. Restructuring expenses in the third quarter were $11 million or $0.06 per diluted share and were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits and costs related to exiting facilities. We still expect restructuring activities to extend through 2024.\nLet me conclude my remarks with our 2023 financial guidance. At this time, we are still unable to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and restructuring for 2023 and expenses directly associated with the cybersecurity incident. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We are updating guidance for 2023 -- our non-GAAP guidance to $4.43 a share to $4.71 a share, reflecting a narrowing of the range of our guidance for 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS for the underlying business to $5.18 to $5.26 from $5.18 to $5.35 that was previously communicated, reflecting softening macroeconomic conditions and estimated $0.55 to $0.75 per share impact is due to business interruption from the recent cybersecurity incident.\nAs Stan mentioned, we believe that our teams have contained the cybersecurity incident, and we have mostly restored our operations. Although we believe a significant portion of sales had been disrupted while certain systems were off-line were deferred, we estimate the percentage of sales growth for the full year will be negatively impacted in the low to mid-single digits. Our estimated fourth quarter impact of $0.55 to $0.75 per share does not include certain expenses directly associated with the cybersecurity incident as we expect to report these as non-GAAP expenses in the fourth quarter.\nThe financial impact does not include any future insurance claim recovery. We expect to file an insurance claim arising from this incident under our cyber insurance policy, although final resolution is subject to insurer approval. This policy has a $60 million after-tax claim limit after a $5 million retention, and any claim recovery will likely not be recognized until late 2024.\nOur 2023 net sales are now expected to be 1% to 3% lower than 2022 net sales, which is an update from prior guidance of 1% to 3% sales growth. This change in guidance primarily reflects lower sales as a result of the cybersecurity incident which, as previously mentioned, is expected to lower full year 2023 percentage sales growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. As a reminder, our guidance also reflects 1 less selling week to 2023 and 2022.\nOur 2023 guidance includes higher interest expense than in 2022 as a result of higher interest rates and higher borrowing levels. We also expect an effective tax rate for the year in the 23% range, assuming no changes in tax legislation.\nOur guidance is for continuing -- for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have been announced and does not include the impact of future share repurchases and potential future acquisitions as well as certain expenses directly associated with the cybersecurity incident. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\nWe intend to introduce 2024 financial guidance when reporting Q4 and full year financial results. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. I appreciate that. Operator, we are ready to take any questions that investors may have."

[Operator Instructions] And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are today reporting solid results for the second quarter driven by our North American dental businesses with strong equipment and steady general merchandise sales and with continuing strength in sales of our technology and value-added services, our implants, biomaterials and endodontic products. The underlying fundamentals in the U.S. dental market remains strong and demand for dental services and customer confidence continues to improve as, of course, evidenced by our -- by the ongoing investments our customers are making in their practices.\nIn addition, we are seeing growing demand for our implant systems and endodontic products as well as our integrated software and services solutions, which are generating strong growth by delivering greater efficiency and a better experience to our customers. In the alternate care market, that's the medical market, electric procedures are close to normal levels while second quarter visits to primary care physicians were down year-over-year, reflecting last year's higher visits to physician offices and urgent care centers as a result of the extended flu season last year. As expected, sales of PPE and COVID test kits continue to decline. However, we are now seeing sales level sequentially -- we're now seeing sales level off sequentially, and we expect the year-on-year impact to be much lower in the second half of 2023. When excluding these product categories, local currency internal sales growth for the company was 3.3%.\nIn general, our North American dental business performed better than we expected at the start of the year, offset by some incremental COVID-related headwinds facing our medical business, as discussed earlier on. Our outlook reflects overall confidence in our business and in the markets we serve, and accordingly, we are affirming our non-GAAP diluted EPS financial guidance for 2023. Our financial results and guidance demonstrate the strength of the business as discussed earlier and continued advancement of our 2022-2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan. We are successfully executing key initiatives -- 3 the key initiatives actually, in the plan including expanding our specialty products and value-added services portfolio, optimizing our distribution businesses, leveraging key customer relationships and driving digital transformation.\nYear-to-date, we have committed over $1 billion to acquisitions that accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan, adding high-growth, high-margin products and services to our offering. With this clear focus, we believe we are well positioned to further enhance Henry Schein's leadership in the markets that we serve and to deliver long-term sustainable shareholder value. Among the larger transactions are our strategic partnership with Biotech Dental, which we closed in April, the acquisition of [ SIM ] Implant Systems, which we closed in July, and the recently announced acquisitions of Shield Healthcare and [ large practice sales ], which we expect to close in the third quarter. With these transactions, we have significantly expanded our implant, bone regeneration and clear aligner product portfolio, digital workflow capabilities, presence in distributing products directly to the patient in the home care arena and value-added services.\nContinuing our strategy of following the patient to provide health care services where it's being delivered, we expect our recently announced agreement to acquire Shield will create an offering with more than $300 million in annual revenue that distributes medical supplies across the United States directly to patients in their home. On completion of this acquisition, this business will be led by [ Adam Drees ], who joined Henry Schein as Vice President, General Manager of Homecare Medical Products and has significant experience in this area. We are excited about the fundamentals of this market, which supports a growing aging demographic experiencing more chronic disease. Beyond added convenience to the patient, the trend of moving care to their home is expected to provide efficiency in the overall health care system. And most important, many of our customers have asked us to provide the service. We've been providing it in a moderate way up to now, but now we are committed to advancing our position in this market to support our customers who have requested us to move into the home care arena as a continuum of care.\nOur home care medical product offering will now include [ intra-oral ostomy ], incontinence, wound care and diabetes products. And we plan to leverage our physician relationships, as noted earlier on, product distribution expertise and corporate brand assortment to further grow this area. Also for many years, we have had a successful practice transitions group dedicated to existing smaller and midsized dental practices. And I'm most enthusiastic about the acquisition of [ Large Practice Sales ], a leading transition advisory services business which expands our capability to advise dental practices on larger practice transitions, of course, being of service to our DSO customers as well.\nWe are also advancing the integration of our digital -- of our dental digital workflow software with our practice management software to create a unique digital solution for dental practitioners. In this connection, we have asked [ Andrea Albertini ], CEO of our International Distribution Group to lead the cross-company One Schlein solution and accelerate out what we have internally called our 3-click integrated software solution for our customers. This simplified open architecture process begins with the capture of any image from an intraoral scanner or 2D-3D Digital Imaging unit through our practice management software, followed by the application of embedded artificial intelligence solutions to help in diagnosis, case acceptance, planning and design and ending with the direct connection to fabricate the prosthetic through either [indiscernible], a 3D printer or the transmission digitally of the file to the dental lab.\nLet me now turn to a review of the quarterly highlights from each business unit, beginning with the dental distribution. In North America, dental offices were generally busy, and this helped our second quarter dental merchandise growth, of course, excluding sales of PPE products. A driver in equipment sales was a broad equipment -- was, of course, our broad equipment offering, which enabled our customers needing solutions to increase productivity to meet demand and of course,drive up the efficiency of the practice and of course better clinical care. North American dental equipment sales were up double digits. Sales of traditional equipment continued to be strong, and we are pleased that sales of digital equipment returned to growth this quarter. International equipment sales were relatively flat to the prior year. The equipment backlog in North America has held steady, and our international equipment backlog is returning to pre-pandemic levels.\nNow turning to our dental specialties. Sales of dental implants and biomaterials were key drivers in the second quarter, complemented by endodontics and clear aligner businesses. We are seeing implant demand increasing in North America with sales of our BioHorizons Camlog premium implant delivering mid-single-digit growth, a sequential improvement versus the first quarter Internationally, demand for implant systems remains very good. Generally, demand for implants continues to favor value-priced products. We believe that our Camlog -- BioHorizons Camlog product offering is well positioned. But also the moving of demand for value-priced products is reflected in our double-digit growth achieved by our [ dentist ] provider of dental implants and bone generation products.\nLooking at recent deals, our transaction with Biotech Dental brings a market-leading portfolio of dental implants at clear aligners to Henry Schein and digital workflow software. Soon, on the other hand, that dental implants systems provides us an entree into the large Brazilian implant market and complements our successful Brazilian general dental consumables and equipment business. Both Biotech and SIM offer high-quality implants at an attractive price, and we have exciting opportunities of expanding these cost-competitive products to other geographies including the United States, providing, of course, a more comprehensive offering and enabling us to be even more competitive in the implant and bone regeneration space.\nThis quarter, growth in our endodontic business continued to be driven by our Brasseler and Edge brands in both North America and internationally. Our orthodontic business is making steady progress with our liner business, although this is still a relatively small component of our global revenues. We are seeing growing demand for our specialty products from DSOs, and that's from -- specifically from our DSO customers. And recall, we have a pretty decent market share in the DSO market. And we see continued adoption of specialty procedures among dental practitioners. We have grown our global implant bone regeneration and related products and services into over $800 million in revenue, and our specialty products to approaching $1.2 billion in revenue in the aggregate on an annualized basis. We now offer a broad range of premium and value alternatives to North American and international practitioners. We expect dental specialty growth to accelerate in the second half of the year due to these acquisitions, but also due to year-over-year comparisons easing.\nNow let's turn to the technology and value-added services business, where the largest component of course is Henry Schein One. Global growth in Henry Schein One is being driven by ongoing migration to our cloud-based practice management software solutions, Dentrix Ascend and Dentally, and by growth in our revenue cycle management business resulting from increased patient traffic driving a higher volume of e-claims. Dentrix Ascend and Dentally grew to approximately 7,000 customers, and this today represents approximately 40% year-over-year growth. Customers and prospective customers are particularly enthusiastic about incorporating our artificial intelligence solution into their practice management software product. We believe our embedded solution is certainly best in class. We've grown our technology and value-added services businesses into an almost $900 million revenue portfolio on an annualized basis.\nIn addition to Henry Schein One's technology solutions, we now offer a broad range of value-added services through our businesses such as eAssist, which provides revenue cycle management, and Unisys providing advice on PPO agreements with insurance providers along with other services including financial services, practice transitions, staffing services, education and remote patient monitoring for office-based dental and medical practitioners. We expect the technology and value-added services sales growth will accelerate during the second half of the year.\nTurning now to the medical business. During the second quarter, our medical business achieved low single-digit growth, excluding PPE products and, of course, COVID-19 test kits. This compares with mid-double-digit growth last year. It's really important to us then when results benefited from some late-season sales at point-of-care flu diagnostic tests. This year was a more typical flu season, and as a result, we had much lower sales of flu COVID-19 and multi-assay diagnostics and related products. Sales growth was also affected by the conversion of certain pharmaceuticals and other products to lower-priced generics and corporate brands. of course, with a higher gross profit margin. This is a trend that is taking place throughout health care. Sales of medical equipment were relatively soft in the market. The market took a temporary pause to assess likely future demand. However, we have subsequently seen investment interest return in July.\nSo in summary, the fundamentals of our core business remains solid, in fact, very good. And the team is executing well on our 2022-2024 b1 Strategic Plan. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron to discuss specifics relative to our quarterly financial results and provide full year guidance. Thank you. Ron, please.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. I'll be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our second quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2023 and 2022 exclude integration and restructuring costs and amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. This is detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release. With respect to sales growth, I will focus on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared to the prior year and excludes acquisitions.\nSecond quarter global sales were $3.1 billion or an LCI sales decrease of 0.2%. However, when excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, our LCI sales grew 3.3%. We sold $138 million in PPE products in the second quarter of this year, a decrease of approximately 28% year-over-year, and we sold $26 million in COVID-19 test kits, a decrease of approximately 62% year-over-year. Our GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2023 was 6.5%, an 81 basis point decline compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin for the second quarter was 8.2%, a 14 basis point decline compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. Excluding the impact from lower PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales, we estimate that non-GAAP operating margin expanded 27 basis points.\nSecond quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $140 million or $1.06 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $160 million or $1.16 per diluted share. Our second quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $173 million or $1.31 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $179 million or $1.30 per diluted share. These results were impacted by a decreased contribution from lower PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales, estimated to be $0.08 per diluted share relative to the prior year period. The foreign currency exchange impact on our second quarter EPS was immaterial.\nAs Stanley mentioned, we have committed over $1 billion in the acquisitions we have announced so far this year, with $250 million invested in equity investments and business acquisitions in the second quarter of this year, and we have subsequently signed agreements committing another $800 million. The increased capital deployment for acquisitions has impacted quarterly financial results more than in previous years. The second quarter 2023 GAAP and non-GAAP financial results included high acquisition activity that resulted in acquisition expenses of $6 million or $0.04 per diluted share, which were offset by net acquisition-related fair value adjustments of $16 million or $0.09 per diluted share, including a related remeasurement gain resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of a previously held equity investment. This resulted in a net favorable impact of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share for the quarter, as illustrated in exhibit C to our press release.\nOn a year-to-date basis, the favorable net impact of these acquisition expenses and acquisition-related fair value adjustments, including the related remeasurement gain resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of a previously held equity investment, was only $0.01 per diluted share. We are confident that these strategic investments will drive enhanced growth and value creation over the long term as we accelerate the implementation of our 2022-2024 BOLD+1 Strategic Plan.\nTurning to our second quarter sales results. Global dental sales were $2.0 billion and LCI sales increased by 2.0%. Excluding sales of PPE products, LCI sales growth was 3.7%. Global dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 0.7% but increased by 2.8% when excluding PPE products. North America dental merchandise sales were flat compared to the prior year and grew 2.6% when excluding sales of PPE products with good underlying growth offset by lower growth in our dental lab business as a result of digitalization and in our traditional orthodontics business. International dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 1.9% and by 3.2% when excluding sales of PPE products. Global dental equipment LCI growth was 6.4%. Our North America dental equipment LCI sales increased 9.8% as we continue to see strong sales growth for traditional equipment and sales of digital equipment in North America returned to growth. International equipment LCI sales increased by 1.6%.\nDental specialty products include implants, bone regeneration materials, orthodontic products and endodontic products. Sales of these products were approximately $270 million in the second quarter, with growth of 15.7% driven by acquisitions and good implant sales in both North America and internationally, particularly in Austria, Switzerland and in Germany where we have a leading market position. Global technology and value-added services sales during the second quarter were $193 million, with LCI growth of 5.5%. Sales were again negatively impacted by a government contract which expired early in the third quarter of 2022. LCI sales growth was 6.9% when adjusting for this contract. In North America, sales growth was driven primarily by our Dentrix Ascend, practice management and revenue cycle management businesses. Growth internationally was driven by our Dentally cloud-based solution.\nGlobal medical sales during the second quarter were $950 million and LCI sales decreased 5.3% due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. In North America, excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, LCI sales grew 2.0% and were impacted by lower flu cases versus the prior year, which resulted in lower point-of-care diagnostic tests and related product sales. Keep in mind, this was against a very difficult comparison as LCI growth, excluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, grew 14.3% in the second quarter of 2022.\nRegarding stock repurchases, we repurchased approximately 638,000 shares of common stock in the open market during the second quarter buying at an average price of $78.36 per share for a total of $50 million. At quarter end, we had approximately $365 million authorized and available for future stock repurchases.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the financial flexibility and stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our stockholders. We further strengthened our balance sheet by recently extending the maturity date of our $1 billion revolving credit facility to July of 2028 and also closed on a new $750 million credit facility. Operating cash flow for the second quarter was $274 million compared with $157 million last year, primarily as a result of lowering inventory levels.\nRestructuring expenses in the second quarter were $18 million or $0.10 per diluted share and were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits and costs related to exiting facilities. We now expect restructuring activities to extend through 2024.\nLet me conclude my remarks with our 2023 financial guidance. At this time, we are still unable to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and restructuring for 2023, therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We are affirming our guidance for 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. of $5.18 per share to $5.35 per share, which is down 1% to 4% compared with our 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.38, and includes the previously announced $0.05 to $0.10 dilution from 2023 acquisitions which is consistent with our prior guidance and has been updated to include second quarter results and the impact of all acquisitions that have been announced so far. The net impact of acquisition expenses and acquisition-related fair value adjustments, including the related remeasurement gain resulting from the purchase of a controlling interest of a previously held equity investment, is expected to be insignificant for 2023 and has been included in guidance. We expect these acquisitions to contribute to earnings growth beginning in 2024.\nIt is important to recognize that we expect year-over-year growth in diluted EPS to be higher in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter of this year. Our guidance for 2023 assumes total sales growth of approximately 1% to 3% over 2022. As a reminder, our guidance reflects 1 less selling week in 2023 than 2022. Our sales growth reflects a larger decline in sales of COVID-19 test kits, which we now expect to decrease by approximately 70% to 80% from 2022 versus our previous guidance of a 65% to 70% decrease. Additionally, PPE product sales are expected to decrease about 25% to 30% versus our previous guidance of a decrease of 20% to 25%. Despite the expected lower PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales, the impact on 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS from PPE products and COVID-19 test kits is still estimated to be $0.35 to $0.40 per share due to higher-than-anticipated gross margins on PPE sales relative to our original guidance.\nWe are driving strong earnings momentum in our underlying core businesses, and we still expect non-GAAP operating income will grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range when excluding the contribution from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales. We continue to expect non-GAAP operating margin contraction of 10 to 15 basis points from the 2022 non-GAAP operating margin of 8.2%, and this was largely a result of lower PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales and profits. Our guidance reflects non-GAAP operating margin expansion when excluding income from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales. Our 2023 guidance includes higher interest expense than in 2022 and as a result of higher interest rates and borrowing levels. We also expect an effective tax rate for the year in the 23% range, assuming no changes in tax legislation.\nOur guidance is for current continuing operations as well as acquisitions that have been announced and does not include the impact of future share repurchases and potential future acquisitions. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. We're here to answer any questions, which investors may have. So operator?"

Market trends stayed consistent with those we discussed during the previous quarter's conference call compared to the fourth quarter of last year, where we saw a high number of flu cases patient traffic to dental offices around the world has recovered and is at or nearing pre-pandemic levels. Patient traffic through the physician practices has also normalized.\nAs we anticipated, our results continued to be impacted by decreasing sales of PPE products and COVID test kits. Within the PPE credit category, the pricing focus was lower, again, as we discussed, but pricing at this stage has stabilized on a sequential basis. COVID-19 test kits volume was lower. Excluding these product categories, we achieved strong internal growth company-wide of 6.3% in local currencies. Our financial results were also adversely impacted by acquisition-related expenses as well as foreign exchange.\nWith respect to acquisitions, our pipeline remains robust. In early April, we closed our acquisition of a minority -- of a majority stake in Biotech Dental a business with a market-leading portfolio of dental implants and clear aligners, and we also recently announced our plans to enter the large Brazilian implant market with the acquisition of S.I.N. Implant System, one of Brazil's leading manufacturers of dental implants and a complement to our successful resilient general dental consumables and equipment business. And we also announced the acquisition of Regional Healthcare Group entering the medical market in Australia and New Zealand and leveraging our dental infrastructure in the region very successful business we have today in the region. I'll discuss these in more details in a moment.\nToday, we are updating our non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance financial guidance for 2023 to include the impact of biotech Dental, the acquisition of Biotech Dental. The outlook for the underlying business is consistent with prior estimates, including expectations for operating income growth in the high single to low double-digit percentage range when excluding the contribution from PPE products and COVID test kits and acquisition-related expenses.\nLet me now turn to a review of the highlights from each of our business units. So let's begin with dental, the dental distribution business. Overall, the underlying fundamentals of our dental end markets remain solid, fueled by an aging global population, low unemployment levels and global and a growing global awareness of health care benefits of preventative care and oral hygiene. First quarter dental sales growth, excluding PPE products reflect stable patient flow. Dental merchandise sales, when excluding PPE products, was very good, partially driven by lower prior year merchandise sales comparison that was impacted by the higher level of flu cases and some COVID -- Omnicon COVID-19. Our dental equipment sales were solid. Traditional equipment sales grew very well, while digital equipment sales comprising of 2D, 3D digital imaging, mills, intra-oral scanners continued to be lower than the previous year.\nIn North America, the traditional equipment growth included some price increases introduced in the second half of last year as well as good growth in our parts and service business. We've been focusing on this area for a while. This growth was offset by a decrease in sales of digital equipment. The market for intraoral scanners is healthy, as demonstrated by increased unit sales in the quarter. However, as we commented last quarter, our sales decreased reflects declining average selling price for intra-oral scanners, plus we also had a significant sale in the previous quarter -- in the previous year of scanners to a DSO.\nUnit sales in other digital categories are lower, and we believe are now normalized compared to the last year. We also posted good sales growth in the general equipment in Europe. International external equipment price inflation has not been significant, and the growth was supported by the equipment backlog, which is reverting to a more normalized level in Europe and also, our parts and service business is doing quite well. The biennial IDS show in Cologne in March was once again a good event for Henry Schein. And from a sales perspective, the overall impact was consistent with previous IDS meetings. Our global equipment order book, which is mainly comprised of traditional equipment remains robust and it's up year-over-year.\nLet's take a look in a bit more detail on our Global Dental specialties business. Our Global Dental specialty products sales growth increased from the fourth quarter. We continue to expect modest year-over-year growth to the first half of the year given the strong first half of 2022. Implant sales growth was driven by meaningful growth in our premium Camlog product line in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where we have our biggest strongest market share in the category, and we continue to achieve double-digit growth in our Medentis value price line. In North America, we are seeing an increase in dental specialty practices being acquired by larger DSOs. Importantly, we have excellent relationships with a growing number of DSO accounts and are committed to driving specialty product conversion at practices within those networks. We also continue to see growing adoption of specialty dental procedures amongst general dental practitioners and as demonstrated by enrollment in Henry Schein's continuing education courses in these categories.\nAs mentioned earlier, recent highlights in our Global Dental specialty business was the acquisition of a majority stake in Biotech Dental and an announcement of our entry into the Brazilian implant market with S.I.N. Implant System -- through the acquisition of the S.I.N. Implant System business. Biotech Dental provides Henry Schein with a compliance integrated suite of planning and diagnostic software as well as a fast-growing portfolio of dental implants and Clear Aligners. Together, these products resulted in revenue of approximately $100 million in 2022. We are particularly excited about bringing the Biotech Dental software products to our customers, along with our existing portfolio of practice management software and clinical software we will offer a seamless digital workflow solution to a growing number of customers worldwide, very, very exciting.\nLast week, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire S.I.N. Implant System, which is one of Brazil's leading manufacturer of dental implants with revenues of approximately $60 million in 2022. This agreement marks our planned entry into the large Brazilian implant market. Brazil has been a very good growth market for Henry Schein, where we have brought good value to Brazilian dentists, and dental laboratories over the last 5 or 6 years since we became active in that market. S.I.N. recently expanded distribution of the value price dental implants including United States and other geographies. We expect this transaction to close later this year, subject to, of course, regulatory approval. Both the S.I.N. Implant System and the Biotech Dental transactions represent progress we are making to advance our BOLD+1 strategy, which calls for us to focus internal growth and, of course, business development activities on the high-growth, high-margin opportunities and particularly with innovative products and services.\nThis quarter, our endodontic business continued to grow nicely, primarily through our [ Brasseler ] edge brands in North America. Our orthodontic business is quite small, but we're pleased with the continued positive development of our Clear Aligner business. particularly with DSOs. So now let me turn to our Technology and Value-Added Services business, where the largest component as Henry Schein One, which had an excellent quarter. Investing in growing these businesses a key pillar of our BOLD+1 strategic plan, and we believe our customers are recognizing the advantages in technological innovation that we bring to the marketplace. Growth in North America continues to be driven by Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend cloud-based solutions and customers upgraded from our Easy Dental product with the Easy Dental life cycle ending later this year.\nInternational growth was supported by the entirely cloud-based solutions for customers outside the United States, particularly in Australia and New Zealand, where it was recently launched. The number of customers on Dentrix Ascend and Dentally, these are our cloud-based solutions has increased approximately 30% over the last year. We are very, very pleased and excited with our customers moving to the cloud to our cloud-based solutions. We also saw growth with our revenue cycle management insurance claims product with growth driven by the number of e-claims reprocessed and enhanced functionality by electronic invoicing and reimbursement solutions. Sales of this product are a strong indicator of the underlying markets as evidenced by higher -- by the higher number of claims we processed. In short, our practice management solutions provide a competitive advantage to our dental business. Our highly integrated software is at the core of the operatory and supports clinical workflow while improving practice efficiency. Our practice management software also provides opportunities for us to sell products and solutions into the practice, including digital devices demand generation analytical software as well as our growing AI-enhanced product portfolio.\nTowards the end of the first quarter, we announced the full integration hub detect AI powered by video Health and BolaAI into Dentrix Ascend. This software automatically analyzes digital images to identify and localized carriers and for us faster evaluation of x-rays and effective treatment recommendation. Products, this AI product offering has been well received. Additionally, our new voice technologic feature improved speed and efficiency for dentists and hygienists and completing paradigma exams and clinical nodes. While at the stock early in the launch, we have already seen good adoption of this new AI-driven solution, and we are excited to extend our reach and support dentists and provide the best possible patient care. So in our medical business, the distribution business. During the first quarter, our medical business achieved growth of 4%, excluding PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, we expect the internal sales growth in our underlying medical business to continue to grow quite nicely, but at a somewhat slower pace this year than last year, given the prior year comparison resulting from significant growth we achieved last year. We remain highly bullish also on our medical business. Unit sales for COVID tests were down significantly. And within the PPE category, drug pricing has stabilized, albeit at a lower price than last year. Looking at specific product categories, once again, pharmaceutical and equipment sales were strong, while sales of point-of-care diagnostic products decreased to some extent because of the high flu diagnosis last year this quarter. We were also pleased to announce our acquisition of Regional Healthcare Group in Australia and New Zealand both growing markets that have contributed to the growth of our dental business. Through this acquisition, we will be able to further leverage our Australian and New Zealand infrastructure and expand our global medical products footprint.\nIn summary, the underlying fundamentals of our core business remain solid, and we are executing well as anticipated with our BOLD+1 strategic plan. So we're very comfortable with where we are. We're bullish about the business and are excited as we advance our BOLD+1 strategy.\nWith that in mind, I will turn the call over to Ron to discuss our first quarter financial results in our full year guidance. Thank you very much, everyone.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our first quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2023 and 2022 exclude restructuring costs as well as amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. This is detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release.\nWith respect to sales growth, I will focus on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies compared to the prior year and excludes acquisitions. First quarter global sales of $3.1 billion reflected an LCI sales decrease of 3.7%. However, when excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, our LCI sales grew 6.3%. This sales growth benefited somewhat from the timing of our fiscal reporting calendar whereby the December 2021 holiday week was included in the first quarter of 2022, but Q1 2023 did not include a holiday week as it fell in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we sold $149 million in PPE products, a decline of approximately 35% year-over-year and $52 million in COVID-19 test kits, a decline of approximately 80% year-over-year. On a combined basis, PPE and COVID-19 test kits declined approximately 60%. As a reminder, our first quarter sales in both PPE and COVID-19 test kits were especially strong last year.\nOur GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2023 was 5.7%, a 196 basis point decline compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating margin for Q1 was 7.7%, a 102 basis point decline compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. This decline was mainly a result of lower gross profit dollars from PPE and COVID-19 test kit sales, which helped to cover our fixed costs as well as higher acquisition-related costs, partially offset by gross margin rate improvement.\nFirst quarter 2023 GAAP net income was $121 million or $0.91 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $181 million or $1.30 per diluted share. Our first quarter 2023 non-GAAP net income was $161 million or $1.21 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $200 million or $1.44 per diluted share. Several factors adversely impacted our GAAP and non-GAAP results this quarter. Specifically, the contribution from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales to diluted EPS decreased by an estimated $0.24 per diluted share relative to the prior year period. Acquisition-related costs impacted diluted EPS by $0.04 per diluted share this year compared with approximately $0.015 per diluted share last year. And note that these acquisition costs are operating expenses that we do not add back for non-GAAP reporting purposes. Additionally, foreign current exchange negatively impacted our first quarter diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 versus the first quarter last year.\nSo turning to our first quarter sales results. Global Dental sales were $1.9 billion, and LCI sales increased by 4%. When excluding sales of PPE products, LCI sales growth was 7.4%. Global Dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 4%, but increased by 8.4% when excluding PPE products. We expected strong merchandise sales growth as last year's sales were impacted by the Omicron variant and timing of the reporting calendar, as I previously mentioned. North America dental merchandise sales increased 1.3% and by 6.6% when excluding sales of PPE products. International dental merchandise LCI sales increased by 8.1% or 11% when excluding sales of PPE products with strong sales growth in Central Europe, Australia as well as in Brazil. Global Dental equipment LCI growth was 3.9%. We had strong LCI sales growth for traditional equipment, and this was offset by a decrease in digital equipment LCI sales.\nOur North America dental equipment LCI sales increased 2.6%. International equipment LCI sales increased by 5.8% and were bolstered by tax incentives in Italy and the U.K., which ended this quarter, and in Australia, which are due to expire at the end of the second quarter. Dental specialty products include implants, bone regeneration materials, orthodontic products and endodontic products. Sales of these products were approximately $233 million in the first quarter with LCI growth of 4.4%. Global technology and value-added services sales during Q1 were $191 million, with LCI growth of 6.5%. Sales were again negatively impacted by a government contract, which expired early in the third quarter of 2022. LCI sales growth was 12.4% when adjusting for this contract.\nIn North America, sales growth was driven by our practice management and revenue cycle management businesses. Growth internationally was driven by our Dentally cloud-based solution. Global Medical sales during the first quarter were $971 million, and LCI sales decreased 17.1% due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. In North America, excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, LCI sales grew 4.2%, led by strong medical equipment and pharmaceutical sales offset by lower point of care diagnostics revenue. Keep in mind, this is against a difficult comparison as North American medical LCI sales growth, excluding PPE and COVID-19 test kits was approximately 15% in Q1 of 2022, driven by higher office visits related to the Omicron variant. Regarding stock repurchases, we repurchased approximately 1.2 million shares of common stock in the open market during the first quarter buying at an average price of $81.70 per share for a total of $100 million.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the financial flexibility and stability to execute on our organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, while continuing to return capital to our stockholders. Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $27 million compared with $93 million last year, with the decrease primarily due to lower income from PPE and COVID-19 test kits as well as restructuring expenses incurred in the quarter. Those restructuring expenses in Q1 were $30 million or $0.16 per diluted share and were incurred as part of our previously disclosed restructuring initiative. These expenses mainly relate to severance benefits and costs related to the exit of facilities. We expect to continue to record restructuring charges during the remainder of 2023.\nLet me conclude my remarks with our 2023 financial guidance. At this time, we are still unable to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and restructuring for 2023. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. We are updating our guidance for 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein to a range of $5.18 to $5.35 per share, reflecting growth of negative 4% to negative 1% compared with our 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.38. This guidance now includes $0.05 to $0.10 of estimated dilution for the Biotech Dental acquisition, primarily due to acquisition accounting adjustments for inventory and integration-related expenses.\nOur outlook for the remainder of the business remains consistent with our prior guidance. Our guidance for 2023 assumes total sales growth of approximately 1% to 3% over 2022, with sales of COVID-19 test kits now expected to decline by approximately 65% to 70% from sales in 2022 as compared to our previous 2023 guidance of a decline of 35% to 40%. Additionally, PPE product sales are expected to decline about 20% to 25%, consistent with our original 2023 guidance. Note that our sales growth guidance reflects 1 less selling week in 2023 than in 2022. The impact on 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS from lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits is still estimated to be $0.35 to $0.40. We expect the impact of the steeper-than-anticipated decrease decreases in COVID-19 test kit sales in 2023 to be offset by slightly higher-than-anticipated gross margins on PPE sales relative to our original guidance. These headwinds are anticipated to be largely offset by earnings momentum in our underlying core businesses, and we expect non-GAAP operating income will grow in the high single digit to low double-digit range when excluding the contribution from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales and acquisition-related expenses.\nWe expect lower non-GAAP operating margin of 10 to 15 basis points below the 2022 non-GAAP operating margin of 8.2% and this was largely a result of lower PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales and profits. Our guidance reflects non-GAAP operating margin expansion when excluding income from PPE products and COVID-19 test good sales and acquisition-related expenses. Our 2023 guidance includes higher interest expense that in 2022 as a result of higher interest rates and higher borrowings along with higher minority interest from our higher growth businesses such as Henry Schein One. We also expect an effective tax rate in the 23% range, assuming no changes in tax legislation.\nOur guidance for 2023 diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as completed acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, other announced or potential future acquisitions or integration and restructuring expenses. While the recently closed biotech dental acquisition is now reflected within our guidance, our recently announced acquisition of S.I.N. Implant System is not. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels and that end markets remain consistent with current market conditions.\nTo summarize, although we are updating our financial guidance for the year, we are maintaining expectations for the underlying business and continue to anticipate steady growth trends in both dental and medical markets. And we do expect that the second quarter will continue to have some headwinds from PPE and COVID-19 test kits, but we do expect good income growth in the second half of the year as some of the year-over-year comparatives already covered on this call should normalize.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer\n\nThank you, Ron. Graham, if we can now open the call to questions, we'll be happy to answer any questions investors may have. ."

During today's Q&A session, please limit yourself to a single question and a follow-up. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you, Graham, and thank you all for calling in today. We closed our 2022 with a very good fourth quarter in which we continue to execute effectively on our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan goals, achieving strong growth in earnings for the fourth quarter and, of course, for the full year of 2022, despite the macroeconomic concerns and of course, the foreign exchange headwinds. We overcame significant headwinds from lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.\nOur sales were affected by a decline in sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. Excluding sales of PPE products and COV19 test kits, and taking out the 53rd sales week for 2022, we achieved very good internal growth of 5% in local currencies, that's internal. There was a negative impact on dental visits for seasonal flu and COVID-19 last quarter. And this was both in North America and internationally. So dental visits were down because of the impact of flu, both the seasonal and the COVID.\nOn the other hand, this was offset by a positive impact at least from a product sales point of view of visits to our physician customers. We experienced growth in each of our business units across the board. And overall, we generated some financial results for the quarter, reflective, I think, of a stable market -- in the markets that we serve. So we made excellent progress in advancing our 2022 to 2024 BOLD+1 strategic plan.\nSo first year of the plan was '22, where we advanced our one distribution strategy to enhance the customer experience and improve operational efficiency, very important, by creating our North American distribution group led by Brad Connett, and our international distribution group led by Andrea Albertini. We had good results across the board, both in North American distribution and in our international distribution group.\nWe strengthened our dental position with national DSOs One new accounts and have an excellent success with our technology solution and specialty products within our -- within this national DSO segment. And on the medical side, we did expand our position with IDNs and large group practices. On the digital side, the BOLD plan calls for a significant effort in this area. We created our global digital team, including the appointment of experienced veterans in this area: Trinh Clark as Chief Global Customer Experience Officer; Sara Dillon, as Chief Data Officer. We are working closely with Lee Benowitz, Chief Global Digital Transformation Officer and Mark Hillebrandt, Chief Digital Revenue Officer.\nWe made excellent progress designing and building our global e-commerce platform, and this is an advancement of our current platform, which we expect to start rolling out in the latter part of this year, and that's -- we start to roll out the upgrades to the current platform. At the same time, we had some exciting news on the AI side, where we launched our Detect AI and AI-enabled x-ray analysis, too, powered by VideaHealth. And last week, we were advised that VideaHealth has received 510(k) FDA clearance for its periodontics solution, which we expect will further advance the use of AI as a tool dentistry.\nWe were active on the M&A front. We acquired Midway Dental in the U.S. and Condor Dental in Switzerland, thereby expanding our reach into underpenetrated areas in the market. We acquired a majority stake in Unitas and announced plans to acquire a major -- majority stake in Biotech Dental. Both of these investments will address in a moment. We have begun implementing our restructuring plan to reduce our global real estate footprint to reflect TSM, that's Team Schein Members, preference for flexibility in work locations. In this connection, we have closed one of our 2 buildings in our Melville headquarters on Long Island. We intend to invest in our remaining real estate footprint around the world to provide modern and flexible office space, and we will also continue to invest in technology to ensure that we maintain and build on our strong competitive position from a technology point of view, in other words, the tools that we provide our team to operate and, of course, the tools we offer to our customers to interface with us.\nThis past quarter, we disposed of an unprofitable business so we can redirect our resources to operations that are priorities in our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan. The costs associated with this exit are included in our restructuring costs for the quarter. So if you look ahead a bit, we are introducing guidance for 2023, which Ron will discuss in a moment. We expect operating income growth in the high single digits to low double-digit percentage range when excluding the contributions from PPE products and COVID-19 test kits.\nWe anticipate the impact of lower selling prices of PPE products and reduced demand from COVID-19 test kits will largely be offset by earnings momentum in our underlying core businesses. And the good momentum we have, as we enter 2023, this gives us confidence in the 2023 guidance. And the -- specifically the growth in our operating income when you exclude PPE products and COVID-19 tests.\nSo a little bit of specifics on our dental distribution business. Merchandise sales in North America grew slightly when excluding sales of PPE and taking out sales from the 53rd week. In North America, we have a relatively stable market. And our market share, we believe, remains stable to slightly positive. We believe global dental consumable merchandise growth, as noted earlier, was impacted by the high incidence of flu and COVID-19 cases, which caused increased rates of patient appointment cancellations and accentuated the staffing shortages.\nNow what's important is the rate of patient flow appears to have returned to more normal levels in January -- this past January of 2023. The impact from manufacturing merchandise price increases, we believe, lessened as last year's increases began to annualize. The depth and breadth of the Henry Schein product portfolio, of course, allows us to support our customers' needs when we have customers that are concerned with pricing as we have offerings of alternative national and corporate brand products, that's our own brands, as well as alternative national brands where we experienced customers resistance to price increases.\nBut having said that, price increases, we believe that are speaking in the marketplace are relatively stable now and not anywhere near what they were at the beginning of last year. Our demand for dental equipment in North America remains healthy, and our North American equipment order book is stable. Although we saw good sales from traditional equipment and steady sales for digital imaging equipment, which we had challenges in the past because of pricing issues, but this seems to be stabilized now.\nAnd there was a decline in sales of digital restoration equipment compared to corresponding -- the corresponding period in the fourth quarter. And of course, we had good sales in the fourth quarter last year. But the challenge has been customer demand is shifting from chairside mills, quite expensive, to 3D printing, much less expensive, and a mix shift to lower-priced intraoral scanners. There was also a supply chain issue with one of our important intraoral scanner suppliers that introduced a new scanner this in the last few months.\nSo all in all, the demand for digital restoration, that market is pretty hot, but there are these mix challenges that I've just described, and we can go into in greater detail if anyone has questions. The value of our North American order book for equipment is stable. We continue to see construction delays to some extent and a slight reduction in the number of planned new office openings amongst specifically some of our larger DSOs. On the international general merchandise sales side, the same impact as in the United States, North America that COVID patient flow challenges we experienced also as well as the lockdowns in China that were offset on the international side, but those were largely offset by good growth in the U.K., Eastern Europe and Brazil.\nTowards the end of the quarter, dental office staffing absenteeism and patient appointment cancellations will begin to ease likewise in our international business. Demand for equipment internationally held up quite well, with sales moving to lower-priced intraoral scanner units as well and the overall equipment sales essentially were in line with last year.\nThe fourth quarter equipment sales and our outlook was slightly impacted by purchase delays in anticipation, this is on the international side again, with the biennial IDS show in Cologne, where customers expect new promotions to be introduced new products, and that show takes place at the end of the first quarter. The fundamentals in our dental end markets remain solid. Of course, the aging population and the growing global awareness of the health care benefits of preventative care and oral health, all play into our strategic benefits for Henry Schein, short, medium and long term.\nSo demand for dental service is also generally correlated, we believe, with unemployment rates. And in the developed world, these remain relatively sort of consistent historically low, if you will. So we think the underlying base is okay, supporting oral care. And let me now turn a little bit to the dental specialty products business, where we were impacted, particularly in our largest sector, implants and bone regeneration products, with significant prior year growth prior year comparisons.\nThe BioHorizons camlog premium value implant segment continues to grow in North America and Europe. And we have some offset here with the decline in China, although I'll point out that our China business is not material, but it did impact the gross line to some extent. Sales for DSO customers in the United States for the BioHorizons camlog line remains solid, and our value brand, Medentis, primarily in Germany but also to some extent in China, achieved double-digit sales growth. But this was mainly coming, as I said, from Europe and a little bit from Asia.\nWhen I refer to Asia, specifically talking to Japan, where our implants are doing good and oral surgery products are doing quite well. In December, we announced planned, subject to regulatory approval, to acquire majority ownership stake in the French dental solutions provider, Biotech. We look forward to bringing Biotech Dental's high-quality software that is so important. It's the whole digital flow that is so important that Biotech Dental will contribute to Henry Schein, but also the general products and services that dentists and dental labs are important for new geographies with respect to Biotech, specifically in France, where we believe we will be close, if not the leader in implants at some point in the near future.\nThese will also have a line of product that is well received in that market. So dental products implants, biomaterials, all are high-growth, high-margin products, and Biotech will contribute to that as well as providing support -- additional support for our leading digital workflow solution in dentistry, of course. On the orthodontic side, sales growth remained strong, driven by new products introduced earlier in the year.\nRecent data suggests that the percentage of general practitioners in the U.S. who perform root canal procedures is increasing. That plays right into our's sweet spot as well. We believe that this trend, combined with an aging population [intent on retaining it with the] bodes quite well for the Henry Schein in orthodontic business. Now turning to our technology and value-added business. The largest segment, of course, is Henry Schein One, our software business. Growth was strongest in the international business due to the strength of our entirely cloud-based solution, which is doing very well outside of the United States.\nGrowth in North America was driven by sales of our practice management software. Also the -- specifically the cloud-based software that we offer Dentrix Ascend. And we see customers upgrading to Dentrix Ascend as design life cycle of our Easy Dental product ends. So we're very pleased with the progress are progressing from Easy Dental to our Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend products.\nWhat is very important is we now see close to 6,000 customers on our cloud-based products, Dentrix Ascend entirely. We have noted in the past, these cloud-based systems drive demand for other Henry Schein One products. We also had nice customer wins during the fourth quarter with our Jarvis Analytics business. He assisted well as well. This is the business that helps with revenue cycle management. eAssist made a significant investment in Unitas, a PPO solutions provider and generally puts us in a very, very good position to help practitioners operate a more efficient practice while, of course, they provide good clinical care.\nWe've enjoyed a relationship with Unitas since 2014, and we're now delighted to be able to integrate these value-added services into our product offering at Henry Schein One. So you'll see that the dental specialty products technology value-added services business did well, record year this year, up against some tough comps towards the end of the year. And this is where we're placing a lot of emphasis on an important part of our '22-'24 BOLD+1 strategic plan, which we'll talk about in greater detail at our Investor Day.\nThe medical distribution business continued to see excellent growth. This did reflect higher patient traffic to alternate care side partially driven by the incidence of flu and COVID-19. But generally, the trends are there moving from the acute care setting to the alternate care side. We had good sales, of course, as you would expect, in point of care diagnostics and other products associated with the flu.\nWhen excluding sales of PPE products, COVID-19 test kits, we experienced double-digit growth in local currencies adjusting for that extra week and really absent any public health outbreaks, new ones, medical sales should return to more normal mid- to high range single digits. We are pleased with the continued growth of new accounts across the independent and large group practices as well as Ambulatory surgical centers and urgent care facilities. Strong pharmaceutical sales were driven by pneumonia treatments, and equipment sales also continued to do quite well as practitioners invest in their practice and as the offering of office space practitioner equipment expands in terms of availability to treat and diagnose more treatments with more diseases and other ailments in the office-based practitioner environment.\nOver the last several years, Henry Schein has been able to shift priorities and provide solutions needed to help our medical and dental customers. And the public, of course, during the COVID-19 crisis and last year's flu season and even with -- during last -- and during the crisis and of course, last year's flu season. And even with this change, the impact of COVID-19 and flu, which required huge support from our team to deal with these currently significant inflows of orders to realize that we delivered a compounded average sales growth even with these inflows, unusual inflows of PPE, COVID tests of about 6-point -- just over 6% when you take out the PPE and COVID.\nSo Henry Schein's internal growth in general, excluding PPE and COVID, is quite solid. And so we also believe that the PP&E and COVID efforts that we undertook helped us generate more customers, help our customers understand that for health care products is better to go to a reliable source. And so I want to thank the team for doing a remarkable job getting out the billions of dollars of unusual onetime in respects COVID tests and PPE products, which help generate customer loyalty. So with that, I'll turn over the call to Ron for a review of the fourth quarter results and our 2023 guidance.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nVery good. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I'll be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2022 and 2021 exclude restructuring and integration costs as well as acquired intangible asset impairment charges. This is detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website.\nAs Stanley mentioned, the fourth quarter of 2022 included one additional selling week compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, which was the holiday week between Christmas and New Year's Day. We report on a 52-, 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The next time our results will include an extra selling week will be in 2028. With respect to sales growth, I will focus on LCI sales growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions.\nTo facilitate more meaningful comparisons, the estimated extra week of sales will also be excluded from LCI sales growth figures. A detailed breakout of the components of our sales growth, including LCI growth, is included in Exhibit A of today's press release. Fourth quarter global LCI sales decreased by 1.8% versus the prior year. However, when excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, our LCI sales grew 5%. We sold approximately $161 million in PPE products and approximately $93 million in COVID-19 test kits, including multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination kits in the fourth quarter.\nThis compares with approximately $261 million in PPE products and approximately $187 million in sales of these tests in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 2.15%, a 387 basis point decline compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. This was primarily a result of restructuring and integration expenses and the impairment of certain intangible assets incurred in the quarter.\nOur non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 was 6.74%, a 56 basis point improvement compared with the prior year non-GAAP operating margin. This improvement was driven by gross margin expansion, mainly as a result of sales mix favoring higher-margin products, along with lower operating expenses as a percent of sales. Regarding income taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2022 was 23.6%. This compares with a 22.5% GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.2%, and this compares with the prior year non-GAAP effective rate of 22.5%. Fourth quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $47 million or $0.34 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $147 million or $1.05 per diluted share. Our fourth quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $165 million or $1.21 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $151 million or $1.07 per diluted share.\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets for the fourth quarter of 2022 was $30.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares with $32.6 million or $0.14 per diluted share for the same period last year. And this expense is included in the 2022 and 2021 non-GAAP net income results I just mentioned. A key goal to our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan is to invest in higher-growth businesses that have a larger intangible asset component. And going forward, we believe earnings, excluding amortization expense of acquired intangible assets, better represents the underlying business results.\nBeginning with the first quarter of 2023, we will be modifying our non-GAAP reporting to exclude amortization expense of acquired intangible assets. Using this method, our full year 2022 non-GAAP net income was $741 million or $5.38 per diluted share. We will include a reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results with the new methodology in our quarterly presentation available on our Investor Relations website.\nAnd finally, foreign currency exchange negatively impacted our fourth quarter diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 versus the fourth quarter of last year. I'll now provide some detail on our fourth quarter sales results. Global Dental sales were $2 billion, and LCI sales decreased by 2.6%. Excluding sales of PPE products, our Global Dental LCI sales growth was 0.9%. Global Dental consumable merchandise LCI sales decreased by 3.7%, but increased by 1.0% when excluding PPE products. Global Dental equipment LCI growth was 0.7%.\nNorth America dental LCI sales decreased 3.4% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a 5.1% decrease in consumable merchandise sales. However, when excluding sales of PPE products, North America dental consumable merchandise LCI sales grew 1.3%. North America dental equipment LCI sales also increased 1.3%. International Dental LCI sales decreased by 1.4% and consumable merchandise LCI sales decreased by 1.7%. When excluding sales of PPE products, International consumable merchandise LCI sales increased 0.7%. International equipment LCI sales decreased by 0.4%. Sales of dental specialty products were approximately $247 million in the fourth quarter, with LCI growth of 0.3% compared with the prior year.\nGlobal technology and value-added services sales during the fourth quarter were $187 million, with LCI growth of 3.4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2021. Sales were negatively impacted by the expiration of a government contract, which we mentioned during our Q3 2022 conference call. Adjusting for this contract, the underlying sales growth was 9.1%. During the fourth quarter, our technology and value-added services businesses, together with our dental specialty products, achieved LCI sales growth of 1.6% or 3.9% after adjusting for the expiration of the government contract.\nGlobal Medical sales during the fourth quarter were $1.2 billion, and LCI sales decreased 1.3%, due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. In North America, excluding sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, LCI sales grew 14.9%, led by strong point-of-care diagnostics, medical equipment and pharmaceutical sales. Regarding share repurchases, we repurchased approximately 3.6 million shares of common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, buying at an average price of $79.55 per share for a total of $285 million.\nThe impact of the repurchase of shares on our fourth quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. For the full year, we spent $485 million to repurchase 6.1 million shares. At fiscal year-end, we had approximately $115 million authorized and available for future share repurchases. An additional $400 million was approved by the company's Board of Directors on February 8, 2023.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the flexibility and financial stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $254 million compared with $277 million last year, with the decrease primarily due to an increase in working capital that was driven by the timing of accounts payable.\nFor the full year, operating cash flow was $602 million compared with $710 million in 2021. Regarding our restructuring program, as part of our previously disclosed integration and restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in the fourth quarter of $121 million or $0.70 per diluted share. These expenses mainly relate to vacating one of the buildings at our Melville headquarters and the impairment of intangible assets associated with the disposal of an unprofitable business. There were also restructuring expenses associated with severance and costs related to the exit of some other facilities.\nDue to the disposal of certain assets and the lengthy remaining period of certain leases we exited, expense savings from this plan are expected to be realized over a longer period of time. We expect to continue to record integration and restructuring charges in 2023. However, an estimate of the amount of these charges has not yet been determined. Any restructuring and integration charges are expected primarily to include severance pay and facility-related costs.\nWe also recorded an impairment expense for intangible assets of $34 million pretax or $0.17 per diluted share related to certain continuing operations. Let me conclude my remarks with our 2023 financial guidance. At this time, we are not able to provide estimates for costs associated with integration and restructuring for 2023. Therefore, we are not providing GAAP guidance. As I mentioned, beginning with our Q1 2023 financial results, we will modify our non-GAAP treatment to exclude amortization expense of acquired intangible assets.\nThis is in addition to the other adjustments we made in 2022 to our GAAP financial results. All guidance today reflects this change. 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS excludes amortization expense of prior acquisitions of $0.56 a share in 2023, and this was $0.57 in 2022. For 2023, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.42 per share, reflecting growth of negative 2% to positive 1% compared with our 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $5.38.\nOur guidance for 2023 assumes total sales growth of approximately 1% to 3% over 2022, with sales of COVID-19 test kits declining approximately 35% to 40% from sales in 2022. Additionally, PPE product sales are expected to decline about 20% to 25%. In the aggregate, revenues of these product groups are expected to decrease approximately 30% to 35% from 2022. The impact on 2023 non-GAAP diluted EPS from the lower contribution to earnings from sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits is approximately $0.35 to $0.40 per share. This impact will be much more pronounced over the first half of 2023 and especially in the first quarter as we had sales of almost $500 million of PPE and COVID-19 test kits combined in the first quarter of 2022.\nThese headwinds are largely offset by earnings momentum in our underlying core businesses. And we expect non-GAAP operating income will grow in the high single-digit to low double-digit range when excluding the contribution from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales. Please note that 2023 will include one less selling week compared to 2022, which will occur in the fourth quarter. For 2023, we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be 10 to 15 basis points below our 2022 non-GAAP operating margin of 8.2%. And this is largely a result of lower PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales and profits.\nOur guidance reflects non-GAAP operating margin expansion when excluding income from PPE products and COVID-19 test kit sales. Our 2023 guidance includes higher interest expense than in 2022 as a result of higher interest rates and higher minority interest from our higher-growth businesses, mainly Henry Schein One. We also expect an effective tax rate in the 23% range, assuming no changes in tax legislation.\nOur guidance for 2023 diluted EPS is for current continuing operations as well as completed acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, the acquisition of Biotech Dental and other potential future acquisitions or integration and restructuring expenses, if any. Guidance assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, the end markets remain consistent with current market conditions and that there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ron. We have about 20 minutes -- over 20 minutes to answer questions. Sorry, the call was that long, but there's a lot going on. We're highly confident in the business. And the business ex PPE and COVID tests is doing quite well, even though there are challenges from a macro point of view. Having said that, I think we've got great momentum in the business and look forward to answering any questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) And as a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Thank you, sir. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance Project Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the third quarter of 2022. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that's forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and included in the Risk Factors section of those filings. In addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analyses and estimates.\nOur conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures.\nReconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website and in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website. The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, November 1, 2022. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call.\nFinally, we have prepared slides summarizing our third quarter financial results. These also can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website. (Operator Instructions) And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on this call today. Our financial results for the third quarter of 2022 reflect solid underlying growth across our business and actually in most geographies. We grew our non-GAAP diluted EPS compared with the third quarter of 2021, and this is despite the significant currency headwinds and lower sales of PPE and COVID test kits. Today, we are narrowing our 2022 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance range, which reflects our confidence in the underlying strength and the stability of our business.\nOverall, we feel very good about the outlook for the company and remain highly focused on delivering on our BOLD+1 strategy, which we're happy to go into details during the Q&A period, and as we continue to increase the sustainable profitability of the business. Importantly, current market demands in both our dental and medical businesses are generally stable and actually have been this way for a while. We continue to receive price increases from various suppliers with additional price changes towards the end of the second quarter.\nThe depth and breadth of the Henry Schein portfolio allows us to satisfy our customers' needs and to offer alternative national brand and corporate brand products to price-sensitive customers, thus positioning us to also protect our gross profit. This is reflective of the deep and lasting relationship we have with our customers and our suppliers.\nAs we commented in previous quarters, market prices for gloves continue to decrease, however, we believe at a reduced pace while our unit volume for gloves is relatively stable, and this is driving lower sales and profits in the PPE category. Remember, the PP&E category is largely gloves. Suddenly, sales and profit of COVID test kits have declined compared to the prior year, but pricing and volume for these products is also stabilizing. So generally, the PP&E market on gloves has deflated, volumes are definitely stable and test -- COVID-19 tests are relatively stable from a pricing point of view and a volume point of view compared to the previous year. So we'll, of course, provide further information on the whole PP&E and COVID test category. Having said that, our business, excluding PP&E and COVID tests, did perform quite well as we will discuss in detail during this call.\nSo let me start by reviewing performance highlights for each of our business units, starting with the dental distribution business. Internal growth in local currency of Global Dental sales, excluding PPE, was good. Consumable merchandise growth, excluding PP&E, was solid, and we were especially pleased with the excellent growth of our North American equipment business and continued strength in our global equipment order book. That's the backlog.\nWe had a strong growth in sales of traditional equipment during the third quarter. We are also experiencing continuing good demand for high-tech equipment, an area where Henry Schein is a global leader. And this is because dental practices look to secure and maintain a competitive advantage and the product offering available in the space has expanded and there is practically something for every dental practice.\nSo this growth was largely driven by volume as we are seeing new innovation in digital dental equipment come to market at somewhat lower average selling prices. But the market is significant, big opportunity, lots of units, and we have a very good offering. We believe that consumable merchandise sales growth in Europe was impacted this year because of summer holiday -- because of the summer holiday season as dental practitioners and patients took more vacation days than in the previous year. But we also believe that our consumable merchandise growth in Europe will remain stable, leaning slightly positively.\nOn the other side of the coin, other parts of the world, international growth did benefit from ongoing strength in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, which was partially offset by continuing lockdowns in China. Having said that, our China business is relatively small compared to our total business.\nOur North American equipment order book remains robust and continues to grow from last quarter. And this is partly a result of quite a successful DS World from our point of view. This event was held late in the third quarter compared to the previous year, when it was earlier, and we saw continuing demand for intra-oral imaging, chairside mills, 2D/3D digital extra-oral imaging devices, 3D printing with a number of other manufacturers too. And of course, all the CAD/CAM lines did well also from an order-taking point of view, leading to probably a stronger, we believe, fourth quarter in a market that we're doing quite well generally.\nLead times for traditional equipment are reducing slightly, although installations are still being affected by delays of dental office construction, so we expect our demand and our sales in the equipment area to continue to be strong. Our international equipment order book is also solid. So dental growth during the third quarter was aided by, as our investors know, Midway Dental acquisition, which strengthened our long-standing presence in the Midwest of the United States, provided dental customers of Midway with access to an expanded portfolio of solutions and, of course, a highly competitive pricing.\nMidway built an excellent reputation within the industry over the past 35 years. And the vision of senior executives at Midway strongly aligns with the Henry Schein commitment to helping dentists operate a more efficient practice while allowing a focus by the dentists on delivering high-quality patient care. We have successfully completed the integration relatively quickly of the Midway Dental business, distribution business, and the Condor Dental that we recently acquired in Switzerland that is -- on the distribution side is also largely completed from an integration point of view.\nSo we continue to invest in our dental specialty portfolio and add new customers. Sales to DSO customers in the United States once again were good in the specialty areas and demonstrate success of our One Schein strategic initiative. We are seeing some signs of economic caution in several specialty markets regarding high-end oral surgery procedures. I would not say this is the case as it relates to endodontics, but in oral surgery, there is some caution on the high-end side of implants, and our orthodontic business is relatively small. I'll cover that in a minute.\nBut importantly, we believe that Henry Schein is well positioned to capitalize on these shifts, specifically in the oral surgery market, as we offer a full range of dental implant options at various price points. So we think on the unit side, we will continue to do well and also on the profit side.\nSo we had strong growth in our clear aligner business. Of course, let me remind those participating in today's call, our aligner business is relatively small but it is growing nicely and specifically with some DSOs. And again, as I mentioned, we are seeing solid demand for our endodontic specialty products, which is driven by sales of new products, particularly our Triton irrigation solution and our EdgePRO laser system. Both of these have done well. But I would also say units of endo have done relatively well. And so we believe that our dental specialty business is doing quite well from a foundation point of view, and we always need to look at comparable quarters in previous years, trends, et cetera. And I think the business is in pretty good shape.\nLet's move on to the technology and value-added services. Our technology value-added services businesses had good underlying sales growth in the third quarter. Sales growth was impacted by the expiration of a modestly profitable but significant large government contract. The largest business in this segment is Henry Schein One, it's a software business, which once again posted solid sales growth domestically and internationally, driven by our Dentrix practice management software and our Dentrix Ascend and entirely cloud-based solutions.\nDuring the quarter, we surpassed 5,000 cloud-based customers, adding more than 1,000 new customers year-to-date and currently exceeding 100 new installations per month. We have launched entirely across the United Kingdom and in Australia, New Zealand as well over the past 6 months and remain on track to further geographic expansion in 2023. Ascend has been growing its customer base by double-digit percentages quarter-to-quarter. Notably, these cloud-based practice management systems also drive traction for other Henry Schein One solutions and for effect, stickiness to the entire Henry Schein portfolio.\nWe recently announced that Dentrix Ascend was selected as the exclusive cloud-based practice management system of Smile Brands, a dental service organization, a DSO organization, with more than 700 locations, reflecting the competitive advantage of this product offering. So an important part of the BOLD+1 strategic plan is to place greater emphasis on these high-growth, high-margin products and services. Of course, no guarantees, but this is an area of focus for inorganic growth. And we feel that we're on track to deliver on our expectations in that area with organic -- inorganic growth. Although we will announce that any opportunities in that area or any deals in that area once those deals are closed, and there's no certainty as to when that may be.\nSo another bright spot in the organization in our performance in sales growth in local currencies in our medical business continue -- which continue to be excellent during the third quarter when excluding PPE and COVID test kits, largely pricing issues, PP&E related to gloves and test kits just relating to demand for the test kits, which we've discussed on several calls in the past. Our expectations were relatively in line on the test kits specifically. So we are continuing to deepen our relationships with existing large IDN customers while nicely growing our other medical businesses.\nWe are especially pleased with strong growth in our government sector, our [medic] schools accounts, and we continue to make solid progress in gaining business from independent physicians. Although several years ago, this group reduced, there is still -- we've reduced the number of independent physicians. It is a relatively stable group today and we continue to gain market share within that group. And of course, the smaller medical groups are also areas where we're adding customers and market share, we believe.\nOur focus on equipment, pharmaceutical products and point of care diagnostics remain bright spots in this business, although I must say the whole of the medical business is doing well. And of course, the volatility of sales in COVID-19 test kits, which went down dramatically in earlier quarters, has moderated, but of course, at a lower level of sales. And on the PP&E, the gloves side, the volume is stable, but the pricing is still somewhat unstable but less volatile than we saw in earlier quarters.\nThird quarter sales growth had a challenging prior year comparison when patient traffic to physician office was bolstered by a surge in Delta variant, and that tough comparisons will continue into the fourth quarter. Yet we expect medical sales growth, excluding PP&E and tests, to continue at healthy levels, reflecting volume gains, some price increases, but generally, growth in our market share in this area, this important area for growth for Henry Schein.\nMost experts are expecting a high coincidence -- the high incidence of flu this year, the illness in the United States due to winter experienced in the Southern Hemisphere. We would expect strong flu season to drive patient visits to physician offices and, in turn, increase demand for a host of products we provide, specifically tests, the traditional point-of-care test for flu and other diseases, including our multi-assay COVID-19 influenza diagnostic test kits.\nSo with that overview on our business, I will turn the call over to Ron for a more detailed review of our financial results. Ron, please?\n\nRonald N. South\n\nSenior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nVery good. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. As we begin, I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results as reported on a GAAP basis and on a non-GAAP basis. Our third quarter non-GAAP financial results for 2022 and 2021 exclude certain items detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release and in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website. I will focus my comments on sales, primarily to LCI sales and LCI growth, which is internally generated sales in local currencies and excluding acquisitions compared with the same quarter in the prior year.\nA detailed breakout of the components of our sales growth, including LCI growth, is included in Exhibit A of today's press release. Our third quarter global LCI sales decreased 2.4% versus the prior year. However, when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, our LCI sales grew 6.8%. Third quarter combined sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits were $260 million lower than in the third quarter of the prior year. Our GAAP operating margin for the third quarter of 2022 was 6.86%, a 23 basis point improvement compared with prior year GAAP operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 7.18%, a 55 basis point improvement compared with prior year non-GAAP operating margin. Operating margin improvement was driven by gross margin expansion, mainly as a result of increased growth in sales of higher-margin products.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2022 was 22.7%. This compares with a 23.9% GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2021. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8%, and this compares with the prior year non-GAAP effective rate of 23.9%. Third quarter 2022 GAAP net income was $150 million or $1.09 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $162 million or $1.15 per diluted share. Our third quarter 2022 non-GAAP net income was $157 million or $1.15 per diluted share. This compares with prior year non-GAAP net income of $155 million or $1.10 per diluted share.\nAmortization from acquired intangible assets for the third quarter was $31.6 million or $0.15 per diluted share. This compares with $30.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period last year. Foreign currency exchange relatively impacted our third quarter diluted EPS by approximately $0.02 versus the third quarter of last year.\nI'll now provide some detail on our third quarter sales results. Global Dental third quarter sales were $1.8 billion with LCI growth of 1.2%. LCI growth, excluding sales of PPE, was 5.8%. Global Dental consumable merchandise LCI sales decreased by 0.8% but increased by 5.1% when excluding PPE. Global Dental equipment LCI growth was 8%. North America Dental LCI sales decreased 0.1% compared with the prior year, primarily due to a 3.6% decrease in consumable merchandise LCI sales. However, when excluding sales of PPE, North America Dental consumable merchandise LCI growth was 3.8%.\nNorth America dental equipment LCI sales increased 12.8%, primarily driven by traditional equipment sales. The equipment backlog in both our North America and International businesses remain strong. International Dental LCI growth was 3.3%, driven by consumable merchandise LCI growth of 3.9%. Consumable merchandise LCI growth was 6.9% when excluding sales of PPE and was driven by strength in Australia, New Zealand and Brazil. International equipment LCI growth was 1.4%. Let me point out that this was against a tough comparable as international equipment LCI growth in the third quarter of 2021 was 23.9%.\nSales of dental specialty products were approximately $223 million in the third quarter, with LCI growth of 2.5% compared with the prior year. Global technology and value-added services sales during the third quarter were $176 million, with LCI growth of 4.2% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Sales growth was impacted by the expiration of a government contract. Adjusting for this contract, underlying OCI growth was 8.5%.\nIn North America, technology and value-added services LCI growth was 2.5% and was 7.3% when adjusting for the impact of the government contract, with strength in our revenue cycle management, patient relationship management, business solutions and practice management businesses, including Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend. Internationally, technology and value-added services LCI growth was 16.5%, driven by strength in the U.K. During the third quarter, our technology and value-added services businesses, together with our dental specialty products, achieved total sales growth of 0.8% and LCI sales growth of 3.2%.\nGlobal Medical sales during the third quarter were $1.1 billion, and LCI sales decreased 8.8% due to lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits. In North America, LCI growth was 9.3% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits, led by strong growth in sales of pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and point-of-care diagnostic products. We sold approximately $81 million in COVID-19 test kits in the third quarter, including multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination tests. This compares with approximately $207 million of test kits sold in the third quarter of 2021.\nRegarding stock repurchases, we repurchased common stock in the open market during the third quarter, buying approximately 1.2 million shares at an average price of $76.42 per share for a total of $90.5 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on our third quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. As of the end of the quarter, we had approximately $400 million authorized and available for future share repurchases.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses with the flexibility and financial stability to execute on organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flow for the third quarter was $98 million compared with $211 million last year, with the decrease primarily due to an increase in working capital driven by timing of accounts payable.\nWith reference to restructuring, as part of our previously disclosed integration and restructuring initiative, we recorded a pretax charge in the third quarter of $10 million or $0.05 per diluted share. This plan focuses on the strategic plan and streamlining operations and other initiatives to increase efficiency. The company expects to continue to record integration and restructuring charges for the remainder of 2022 and in 2023. However, an estimate of the amount of these charges has not yet been determined. Any restructuring and integration charges are expected to primarily include severance pay and facility-related costs. The expense savings from this plan are expected to be realized mainly in 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to 2022 financial guidance. As we are not able to provide estimates at this time for costs associated with integration and restructuring for the remainder of the year, we are not providing GAAP guidance. Also, our guidance for the balance of 2022 is for completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include potential future acquisitions or integration and restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain generally consistent with current levels. However, additional headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates may further impact our sales and EPS.\nOn a non-GAAP basis, we are narrowing our diluted EPS guidance range to $4.79 to $4.87, reflecting growth of 6% to 8% compared with our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.52. This includes $0.10 adverse impact from foreign exchange rates versus 2021. We also continue to expect full year 2022 non-GAAP operating margin expansion of 20 to 25 basis points over 2021 non-GAAP operating margin. We are revising our full year sales guidance and now expect sales growth of approximately 1.5% to 2.5% versus our previous guidance for sales growth of 3% to 6%, which mainly reflects a strengthening U.S. dollar and lower PP&E sales.\nWe continue to expect 2022 full year sales of COVID-19 test kits to be 25% to 30% lower than in 2021. And 2022 full year sales of PPE are expected to decrease 30% to 35% from 2021. 2022 full year sales of PPE and COVID-19 test kits combined are expected to be approximately 30% lower than full year sales in 2021. This trend of lower sales may continue in the coming year versus 2022. We do expect to continue to achieve gross margins on these products that are generally consistent with our dental and medical businesses.\nDespite these meaningful market-related headwinds, we continue to be confident in the strength of our underlying businesses. And we are taking additional time to finalize our view of the overall effect of PPE pricing and COVID-19 test kits volume for next year. As we have seen in 2022, this has a meaningful impact on our business. We want to ensure we give an appropriate consideration along with ongoing analysis of macroeconomic trends. We intend to issue 2023 financial guidance with our fourth quarter earnings results. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Stan.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ron. So before we open the call to questions, I would like to take a moment to note the passing of our Board Director, Dianne Rekow, in August. Dianne was an internationally known authority on aesthetic and restorative dentistry as well as an early pioneer in digital dentistry. She served on our Board since 2014 and brought a valuable perspective to Henry Schein and was a wonderful human being.\nI would also like to spotlight that early last month, Henry Schein was named to Fortune magazine's annual Change The World list. We were recognized for our leadership, initiatives to advance health equity, for individuals with disability, and in particular, our engagement with our key stakeholders in support of this work. Our CSR report, which was released in mid-August, aligned with 2 of the most common disclosure standards, SASB, GRI. This is an important milestone as we prioritize transparency and accountability in our ESG work.\nSo in conclusion, while there are a number of external factors at play specifically as it relates to PP&E and test kits and FX, our BOLD+1 strategy remains our North Star, and our team is executing according to plan. As a result, we feel very good about our position in the markets we serve, and generally, the team is focused on priorities and delivery. So with that review of our third quarter financial results and some commentary on our future. I'd now like to open the call to questions. Operator, please."

And my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's financial results for the second quarter of 2022.\nWith me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Henry Schein; and Ron South, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that's forward looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements.

Lastly, this quarter, we have also prepared a presentation summarizing our second quarter financial results. This can also be found in the Investor Relations section of our website.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us.\nToday, we are pleased to report record second quarter financial results that reflect the good underlying momentum in the business and execution on our strategies. Sales were particularly strong in our technology and value-added services businesses and our medical businesses. Although there were some near-term headwinds in the quarter due to COVID infection rates, among other factors, our solid operational execution this quarter and our results demonstrate the strength, the underlying strength, of the business. In June, we saw COVID-19 infection rates which we believe contributed to a -- so there was rising COVID-19 infection rates, which we believe contributed to a decline in patient traffic. This was particularly so in our dental business. We expect patient traffic to increase again when the infection rates moderate, and this is to some extent quite regional.\nWhile we are maintaining our full -- 2022 full year guidance for EPS, for 2022, and that's the guidance range of $4.75 to $4.91, we are adjusting our expectations for full year sales growth to reflect changes, which include continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar and declining demand for COVID-19 test kits.\nThe company's management team is laser-focused on executing our BOLD+1 2022 to 2024 strategic plan's priorities, thereby providing our customers with an exceptional experience, delivering differentiated solutions that make our customers practice more -- practices more successful and improve patient outcomes, leading to delivery of our financial goals as we've set out in our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan. We believe that the long-term trends across our end markets provide a solid platform for us to deliver on our goals.\nIn short, Henry Schein remains well positioned to deliver consistent, sustainable profit growth; and to create value for our shareholders as we have for almost 28 years as a public company.\nBefore we turn to a business update and the progress we have made in executing on our strategic growth initiatives, I would like to touch on macroeconomic challenges in general and discuss Henry Schein's ongoing efforts to be best positioned to succeed in this dynamic environment that we're now all living through.\nFirst, concerns with a potential economic downturn. Given Henry Schein's broad portfolio of medical and dental products and services, we are an important partner to health care providers treating their patients and keeping communities healthy. The markets Henry Schein serves have weathered past slowdowns quite well. During the challenging economic times, consumers continue to need services from office-based health care practitioners, that's both medical and dental, and from the alternate health care sites that we service. That said, we are working to mitigate the future impact of any potential economic slowdown on our key stakeholders, including advancing efficient and low-cost supply chain solutions and practice management solutions in general such as patient demand generation services and generally those services that can help the practitioner operate a more efficient practice so that they can provide the best of clinical care for their patients.\nWe're announcing today a restructuring plan that is focused on funding the priorities of our strategic plan, in other words moving resources to the areas we want to focus on, but at the same time streamlining operations and other initiatives to increase efficiency. Ron will speak more about this topic in a moment.\nSecond, we continue to work with our suppliers to limit the impacts [on] inflation on price increases for product suppliers as well as the costs of transportation of those goods. During the second quarter, we estimate the price inflation for non-PP&E merchandise from brand manufacturers to have ticked up to approximately 3%. It could in fact be slightly lower, yes. We've, I think, done a good job working with our manufacturers on this. And the inflationary impact on equipment sales, in other words, other than non-PP&E merchandise, the impact of inflation on our equipment sales was relatively insignificant. Of course, on PP&E is significantly down because they've got the deflation in glove prices.\nWhen customers express price concerns, we believe that, given the breadth of our offering, we are typically able to provide a lower-cost national brand solution or corporate brand alternative, allowing us to maintain our margins but also helping our customers deal with inflation. So -- with the impact of inflation on their practices.\nSo third, while global supply chain pressures have been relatively stable over the past 3 quarters, our product portfolio, which we believe is the industry's broadest, once again affords us a competitive edge, as it more easily enables substitutions when a particular product or brand is in short supply. We continue to expect that supply chain issues for traditional equipment will impact sales through the year-end. That said, the situation appears to be stable and probably improving with some of our suppliers of -- particularly on the traditional side, to the extent expanding their capacity and are now providing us with much better service than 3 or 4 months ago. When I say better service, I'm talking about on fill rates.\nOur strong order book on the equipment side, across the board actually, in all product categories and globally. And that backlog continues to grow and do well, supports good equipment sales over the next few quarters.\nFourth, Henry Schein is well positioned to manage rising interest rates. Our low level of borrowings means that our interest expense is not significantly affected by interest rate changes. And at the same time, most of our current debt is at a fixed interest rate. The primary area of our business that could be impacted is dental equipment, as those purchases are typically financed. Having said that, it's important to bear in mind that interest rates are still relatively low from a historical context. And our equipment order book remained strong and is [tending] to get stronger.\nLast, regarding -- and this is last of our macro trends, regarding the shortage of labor and skills. Henry Schein has always been an attractive place for talents to build a career. The Team Schein values and philosophy is an attractive place for talents. Of course, we are continuously evaluating and supporting our pool of human capital to make sure we retain our existing personnel while attracting those whose skills we need. We believe our internal talent pool is better than ever and will be instrumental in Henry Schein executing on our growth plans.\nTalking about growth plans. Our strategic plan addresses how we will stay ahead of the fundamental shifts affecting our customers. There's a significant amount of change taking place in the dental and medical professionals -- professions, and we are addressing these plans through our strategic -- these dynamics through our strategic plan. These plans include the goal to accelerate the adoption of digital technology not only within the company but also helping our customers digitalize, and there's a great pressure on our customers to digitalize in their practice. And we are providing excellent handholding consulting services and, of course, an excellent offering of digital products to help our customers advance the digitalization of their practices.\nSo in this connection, yesterday, we announced 3 new senior executive strategic roles designed to further enable us to fulfill our strategic plan. We are forming 3 new teams led by experienced leaders, actually exceptional leaders, who will work together to advance digital technology to create an exceptional customer experience with Henry Schein and accelerate the development of new and complementary technologies and platforms, of course, as I noted, to drive efficiency in our customers' practices while positioning them to provide better quality of care but at the same time also to drive efficiency within Henry Schein. We expect this will enable our sales team and customers to collaborate together to harness this technology. These 3 teams we've set up, each one led by an outstanding executive, will enable our sales teams to provide even better connectivity to our customers as our customers go through this massive change in running their practices driven through digitalization of their management systems and, of course, their clinical support.\nThe first is Leigh Benowitz, who has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Global Digital Transformation Officer. Leigh, a member of our executive management committee, is reporting to Chris Pendergast, our Chief Technology Officer. Leigh will be responsible for enabling the delivery of digital sales by developing our e-commerce infrastructure capabilities; and will continue to lead the implementation of our global e-commerce platform, GEP, which is well underway. And Leigh has played a key role in getting us to where we are and will lead us to the successful implementation of GEP. Leigh is a terrific executive. There is a press release that was issued this morning talking about these -- Leigh and Trinh that I'll speak about in a minute and another press release about Mark Hillebrandt. And I think you'll read those and you'll understand why these 3 executives are so important for the future of Henry Schein and, at the same time, appreciate what they've done and what they're going to do.\nThe second is Trinh Clark, who has been named Senior Vice President and Chief Global Customer Experience Officer, also a member of our executive management committee. And Trinh reports to Brad Connett, CEO of our North American distribution group. Trinh will be responsible for designing, developing and implementing a consistent customer experience and brand marketing strategy globally. Well, these strategies, to a large extent, are developed. And Trinh will take them down to much more detail; and be responsible for implementation and working with the entire organization on driving consistent customer experience, branding, of course, given the change in the environment from a technology point of view. Trinh will also continue to lead our technology enablement and strategic marketing teams in North America.\nAnd finally, Mark Hillebrandt has been named Vice President and Chief Digital Revenue Officer, also reporting to Brad. Mark will be responsible for engaging customers online through our e-commerce platform to drive digital transactions while also securing a healthy pipeline of digitally sourced teams -- leads, sorry, digitally sourced leads, and new prospects to be delivered to our field sales organization. Mark has done a pretty -- has done a very good job in setting us up with respect to digital leads, making shopping experience from a digital point of view much better; and in that context, working closely with our sales organization, who in the end are responsible for driving sales and through our consultative selling methodology that's worked so well for the company.\nWe're also making very good progress on our One Distribution strategy contained in our strategic plan, in other words operationalizing One Distribution dental and medical. In May, we announced the appointment of Dirk Benson as Chief Commercial Officer of our North American distribution group. Dirk joined Henry Schein following a distinguished career with Medline Industries. Also reporting to Brad Connett, Dirk is responsible for the entire dental and medical distribution group's customer-facing organization in the U.S., focused on helping us to advance our goal of exceptional customer experience, increasing efficiency and sales growth in these businesses.\nSo that's a little bit about the implementation of our strategies, so let me pivot a little bit now to provide some color on the performance of each of our business units, starting with our dental distribution business.\nThe second quarter growth in our Global Dental business once again was driven by strong global equipment sales as dentists continued to invest in their practices. Consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies, excluding PP&E and COVID-19-related products, and Ron will give specifics, was impacted by an increase in patient appointment cancellations and staff shortages, which we believe were related to COVID-19 infection rates. Lower sales of PP&E products in the quarter were mainly a result of the decline in glove prices. Glove prices reached a peak at the end of the second quarter 2021 and have been coming down, deflation. And so we expect pricing will continue to be a headwind for the next quarter or 2, albeit to a much lesser extent.\nSo we had these 2 factors taking place in the second quarter, impacting our dental distribution internal growth rates. One, of course, was the appointment cancellations and staff shortages; and the second is deflation with respect to glove prices. Now internal sales growth in our North American dental equipment business, as noted earlier, reflects continued demand in both traditional and digital restoration categories, both of them. Our equipment results also benefited from sales to some of our larger DSO accounts, who we expect will continue to be investing in their practices. And as I noted earlier on, our equipment order book remained solid. Our international equipment sales were strong too, similar trends.\n2 fast-growing areas in digital dentistry are digital restorations, and that's the traditional scanners, the chairside CAD/CAM, et cetera; and a rapidly growing, new area which is 3D printing. Based on significant investments we have made in both of these areas over the years and our strong relationship with our suppliers, we believe we offer our customers a differentiated digital product offering across multiple brands. And we expect these categories will continue to grow well for us into the future.\nWe have, of course, a goal of continuing to expand our geographic footprint; and we recently announced the acquisition of Condor Dental. Condor Dental services dental general practitioners, specialists and laboratories in Switzerland, the one market we don't have a strong general presence, although we've served the Swiss dental market since 2004 through Camlog, our leading oral surgery business. And Condor Dental expands our presence in this market with a full-service dental distribution offering.\nNow turning to dental specialty and technology and value-added services, I'd like to touch upon the progress we are making with our goal of building complementary high-growth software, services and specialty products; and the shift in our corporate profit contribution to these higher-margin products. We are -- we have invested in good properties. We expect to continue to invest heavily in this area. We have great management teams and are very enthusiastic about the potential.\nSo our high-margin technology and value-added services and specialty products are growing at a good pace and now represent about 14% of our total sales but, more important, 36% of our total operating income. Of course, there's no way to determine exactly which quarter these numbers will go up, but we're quite confident that we have a team in place that will drive these high-margin businesses with in-demand products towards a greater percent of our operating income.\nSo if we just look at the sales of our dental specialty products. They were very solid during the second quarter and were driven by BioHorizons' oral surgery products in North America. This was partially due -- and by the way, in Germany which is a big market for us in the implants, COVID was quite serious in the third and second quarter but actually seems to have picked up again in July. This was partially due -- so BioHorizons' growth was partially due to the growth of our national DSO customers, but also across the customer landscape, including mid-size and smaller practices, as we are seeing implants becoming adopted as a standard procedure in overall dental care. And I think we have outstanding marketing materials, sales force and, of course, backed up with great products, so we expect this trend to support continued growth.\nIn this connection, we are pleased to announce the partnership between BioHorizons, Camlog and Orthocell on the Striate+ tissue membrane. This product has demonstrated positive qualities for tissue regeneration, and we are excited to be able to further differentiate our offering in this area to our customers. BioHorizons, Camlog now has exclusive global rights to this product in the dental field and a long-term supply agreement with Orthocell. And we expect to launch the product towards the end of the third quarter.\nWithin our endodontic products offering, we showed good growth and have been quite successful and actually quite excited with our recently launched [EdgePRO] irrigation laser. In the second quarter, we had good new console sales. And we are starting to see sales of consumables from our first placements in the first quarter, but it's good to see the positive feedback from customers and how well this product is being received in the marketplace. We're very, very excited about this technology.\nOur priority in the orthodontic business is the Reveal clear aligner product. Sales in wires and brackets were not very strong in the second quarter. I think this is a market issue. Having said that, we've had quite a bit of success with our Reveal clear aligner product, specifically in the DSO market. The launch of our Studio Pro 4.0 software is giving the Reveal aligner business quite a boost. So we remain quite enthusiastic about our 3 specialty areas. That is oral surgery, implants, bone regeneration products; our endodontic business; and our orthodontic business specifically as it relates to the Reveal clear aligner offering.\nSo now technology and value-added services. We are pleased with the growth in our technology and value-added services businesses, where once again North America and international sales increased by double-digit percentages. Henry Schein One sales growth accelerated compared to the prior year growth. And we are seeing healthy demand from our national DSO accounts for these solutions but also, I might add, for the Dentrix Ascend and Dentally cloud-based solutions. Some are going to DSOs, but general reception from GPs and specialists, small and mid-sized practices is also [very good]. Both dental Ascend and Dentally showed solid increases in the number of users. In fact, one -- Henry Schein One added more than 400 new cloud customers during the second quarter. Meanwhile, our total number of cloud customers is up 20% over the past 6 months, which demonstrates good momentum within this part of the business, again the movement of digitalization towards the cloud.\nWe continue to invest in product development and customer service, and these impact -- these investments did impact the second quarter margins. We believe these investments are providing a solid growth driver for the business.\nThere are other services in this area that we report on, financial services, a number of other publication services, et cetera, but we are particularly pleased with the performance of eAssist, the revenue cycle management solution that we acquired last June, a great complement to the business, in fact, helping our field sales consultants provide better consulting services, more relevant consulting services to our customers on the dental side.\nTurning to our medical business. This business has performed well over many years and again had another excellent quarter with double-digit internal growth in local currencies when excluding PP&E and COVID-19-related products. During the second quarter, we had strong sales in point-of-care diagnostic tests, including flu tests as well as generic drugs and equipment, which is all a good sign. Patient traffic was bolstered by higher numbers of visits for seasonal influenza, which is a departure from prior years when the flu season typically ends during the first quarter. Ambulatory surgical centers are still not up to where they were pre COVID but I think are moving in the right direction. Having said that, the rest of the business is very solid in the medical arena.\nSo with that overview of our business and the environment in which we operate, I will now ask Ron for a more detailed review of our financial results. Thank you.\nRon, please?\n\nRonald N. South\n\nSenior VP & CFO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Stanley. And good morning, everyone.\nTurning to our second quarter financial results. Total net sales for the second quarter of 2022 were $3.0 billion, reflecting growth of 2.1% compared with the prior year period. Internally generated sales in local currencies, which I will refer to as LCI, increased 2.4%. And when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, our LCI growth was 6.7%.\nAs Stanley mentioned, prices for PPE products and specifically for gloves increased last year due to market volatility and supply chain disruptions. More recently, prices of gloves and COVID-19 test kits have declined. This pricing volatility, combined with the strong prior year sales comparison, is driving a year-over-year decline in sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products. Additional details of sales performance are contained in exhibit A in our earnings press release issued earlier today.\nOperating margin for the second quarter of 2022 was 7.27%, representing an 18 basis point improvement compared with prior year GAAP operating margin. When compared with prior year non-GAAP results, operating margin improved by 6 basis points. Operating margin improvement was due to gross margin expansion mainly as a result of an increase in sales of higher-margin products. This was partially offset by higher operating expenses as a percent of sales, which grew as a result of increases in payroll and travel since our operations have generally returned to normal this year.\nTurning to taxes. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter of 2022 was 23.8%. This compares with an effective tax rate of 23.4% for the second quarter of 2021 on a GAAP basis and 23.2% on a non-GAAP basis.\nGAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein, Inc. for the second quarter of 2022 was $160 million or $1.16 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $156 million or $1.10 per diluted share and prior year non-GAAP net income of $157 million or $1.11 per diluted share.\nAmortization from acquired intangible assets for the second quarter of 2022 was $31.3 million or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares with $30.1 million or $0.13 per diluted share for the same period last year.\nForeign currency exchange negatively impacted our second quarter diluted EPS by approximately $0.03 versus the second quarter of last year. And at the current foreign exchange rates, we expect the impact to be more pronounced in the second half of the year, as compared to the first half of the year.\nI'll now provide some details on our second quarter sales results. Global Dental sales of $1.9 billion declined 3.1% compared to the same period last year, with LCI sales down 0.3%. LCI sales growth excluding PPE and COVID-19-related products was 3.5%. Global Dental consumable merchandise LCI sales declined 2.2%, but when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, they increased 2.4%. Global Dental equipment LCI sales growth was 7.0%.\nNorth America dental LCI sales declined 1.1% compared to the prior year primarily due to consumable merchandise LCI sales declining 3.5%. However, when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, North American dental consumable merchandise LCI sales increased 2.2%. Consumable merchandise sales were impacted by lower patient traffic during the quarter, offset by price inflation. North America dental equipment LCI sales increased 8.1% compared with the second quarter of 2021 with good performance in both traditional and digital restoration categories.\nInternational dental LCI sales growth was 1.0% compared with the second quarter of 2021, driven by equipment LCI sales growth of 5.5%. The growth in equipment LCI sales was partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in international dental consumable merchandise LCI sales. However, these sales increased 2.7% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products. Lower patient traffic, which we believe is a result of higher COVID-19 infection rates, resulted in lower consumable merchandise sales in parts of Europe and in Australia and New Zealand as well as China because of the required lockdowns and were offset by double-digit sales growth in Brazil.\nOur equipment backlog in our North America and international businesses remained strong.\nSales of dental specialty products were approximately $242 million in the second quarter, with LCI growth of 6.6% compared with the prior year. Growth was particularly notable in North America for oral surgery products, consisting of implants and bone regeneration products.\nTechnology and value-added services sales during Q2 were $181 million, an increase of 18.1% compared with the prior year, including LCI growth of 10.8%. In North America, technology and value-added services LCI sales growth was 10.4%. This growth was broad-based, with particular strength in our practice management business, including Dentrix and Dentrix Ascend. Internationally, technology and value-added services LCI sales increased 13.4% compared to the prior year, driven by performance in the United Kingdom.\nDuring the second quarter, our technology and value-added services businesses, together with our dental specialty products, achieved total sales growth of 9.0% and LCI sales growth of 8.2%, slightly lower than our goal of double-digit growth for the full year.\nGlobal Medical sales during the second quarter of $1.0 billion grew 10.3% compared to the same period in 2021, with LCI sales growth of 6.7% led by growth in point-of-care diagnostics. We sold approximately $68 million in COVID-19 test kits in the second quarter of 2022, including multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination tests. This compares with approximately $75 million in test kit sales in the second quarter of 2021. We expect continued volatility in sales of test kits for the remainder of the year. Excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, Global Medical LCI sales increased 13.6% compared with the second quarter of 2021.\nRegarding stock repurchases. We repurchased common stock in the open market during the second quarter, buying approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $81.42 per share, for a total of $110 million. The impact of the repurchase of shares on our second quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. As of the end of the second quarter, we had $90 million authorized and available for future share repurchases.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses flexibility and financial stability. Operating cash flow for the second quarter of 2022 was $157 million compared to the $159 million for the second quarter of last year.\nAs Stanley mentioned, today, we are announcing a company-wide restructuring plan that is focused on funding the priorities of the strategic plan and streamlining operations and other initiatives to increase efficiency. The company expects to record restructuring charges in 2022 and 2023. However, an estimate of the amount of these charges has not yet been determined. Any restructuring charges are expected primarily to include severance pay and facility-related costs. The expense savings realized from this plan are expected to mainly affect 2023 and beyond.\nTurning to 2022 financial guidance, I will conclude my remarks by noting that we are affirming our 2022 full year GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $4.75 to $4.91, reflecting growth of 7% to 10% compared with our 2021 GAAP diluted EPS of $4.45 and growth of 5% to 9% compared with our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.52. With reference to the balance of the year, we currently anticipate higher EPS growth in Q4 than in Q3.\nWe are revising our full year sales guidance and now expect sales growth of approximately 3% to 6% over 2021 versus our previously communicated expected sales growth of 5% to 8%. This change reflects adverse effects from foreign exchange rates; and a decrease in anticipated sales of PPE and COVID-related products, including COVID-19 test kits. Sales of COVID-19 test kits are now expected to decline 25% to 30% from 2021 versus a previously estimated decline of 15% to 25%.\nWe continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin expansion of 39 to 44 basis points over 2021 GAAP operating margin and expansion of 20 to 25 basis points over 2021 non-GAAP operating margin.\nOur guidance is for current as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include potential future acquisitions or restructuring expenses. Guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain generally consistent with current levels. However, additional headwinds from foreign currency exchange rates for the remainder of the year may further impact our sales and EPS. Guidance further assumes that end markets will remain stable and consistent with current market conditions and that there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ron.\nJust a couple of very brief comments on senior leadership, a couple of updates. As of July 1, Gerry Benjamin retired from Henry Schein as EVP and Chief Administrative Officer. And he stepped down from our Board when his term expired in May. Gerry has been with the company for 34 years. He will be continuing as a consultant and was an -- was invaluable as we grew from a domestic mail-order business of a couple of hundred million dollars into a global full-service products and services business of nearly 22,000 Team Schein Members and operations in 32 countries.\nWe are fortunate to have a deep bench, and with Gerry's retirement, Michael Ettinger became EVP and Chief Operating Officer, reporting to me. In addition to Michael's corporate affairs responsibility, he has assumed responsibility for HR, IT and supply chain, where each of these 3 functions is led by highly competent, long-standing Henry Schein executives. Michael joined the Henry Schein in 1994, serving most recently as Senior Vice President of Corporate Affairs. The creation of the COO position is a result of growing size, scope and complexity of our operations. And I am confident that Michael will be successful in his new role, together with the leadership in general of our business units, the 5 big business units, and the rest of the executive management team.\nBarry Alperin also retired from our Board of Directors at our Annual Stockholder Meeting in May. And I would like to take this opportunity to thank Barry for his 26 years of exceptional service on our Board, having joined in 1996, shortly after the company's initial public offering.\nSo operator, with those comments, I'm pleased to answer any questions."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Please go ahead, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance Project Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty)\nOur conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with the useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allows for greater transparency that reflects the key metrics used by management in operating our business. These non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for information and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement to corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in the supplemental information section of our Investor Relations website and in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nLastly, the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, May 3, 2022. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. (Operator Instructions).\nWe've updated the format of today's call with Stanley covering the business performance, followed by Ron's review of our financial results, and we hope you find this format beneficial.\nAnd with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Graham. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Before we get into the details of today's call, I would like to take a moment to express my appreciation once again to Steven Paladino, who retired last week after 35 years of outstanding service to Henry Schein, for the excellent execution of Steven's succession plan and the smooth transition of his responsibility to Ron South. I'm certain that investors will appreciate working with Ron and Graham, as we continue to build our Investor Relations communication communications. Ron is joining us on today's call and will discuss details of our first quarter financial performance and full year guidance. So Ron will discuss that in a moment.\nAt the start of the call, I would like to highlight that 2022 is off to a strong start with record first quarter financial results as we successfully execute on our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan that sets out our winning proposition. Our winning proposition is that customers rely on us for an exceptional experience, delivering differentiated solutions that make their practices more successful and improve patient outcomes.\nAnd our BOLD Plus One priorities, which we have discussed with investors in the past, is as follows: The B stands for building complementary software, specialty and services businesses for high growth, Operationalize one distribution to deliver exceptional customer experience, increased efficiency and sales growth. And the L stands for One Schein to broaden and deepen relationships with our customers that is with our entire product offering -- service offering. And the D, the Drive, stands for driving digital transformation for our customers and for Henry Schein. So our BOLD priorities will be executed in the context of the Plus One, aligning our key stakeholders, which, of course, our suppliers, customers, shareholders, investors and Team Schein members and society.\nToday, we are affirming our full year 2022 GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $4.75 to $4.91, reflecting the solid growth and stability of our business; two, emphasize we are very, very excited about our 2022 to 2024 strategic plan, which started at the beginning of this year. And we believe we're on a very, very good trajectory in that regard.\nSo let me comment on 2 topics that are on the minds of many investors, that being inflation and also global supply chain. We are continually monitoring the potential impact of inflation on our business. The impact generally varies by product category, both merchandise and equipment, and to an extent, it also varies by geography. We estimate that on balance, price inflation on our product offering so far this year has been about 3%. Some of our manufacturing partners are currently implementing additional price increases, which obviously will in all probability impact at 3%. But so far, it's been about 3%.\nWhile we have generally been able to pass along these increases to our customers, we do seek to reduce supplier increases wherever possible. Of course, we're aligned with our customers in that regard. Where customers wish to explore alternative sources of products because of these pricing pressures, we are typically able to offer various less expensive alternatives given our broad product assortment of national brands, as well as our wide selection of Henry Schein corporate brands and own brand products.\nOur extensive offering to our customers provides many options and is an important differentiator for Henry Schein in the marketplace given the extensive options that we uniquely offer, we believe, to our customers. The impact of inflation on our equipment business is significantly deferred due to the lead times between confirmation of an equipment order by manufacturers and delivery of the equipment.\nSo generally, we book orders in advance with our manufacturers for delivery at a future date, and that's generally at a confirmed price. So not much inflation in the first quarter, some, of course, but not much on the equipment side. In addition, inflation largely impacts the traditional equipment products as average selling prices for digital equipment continues to decline, although somewhat modestly.\nNow turning to the supply chain pressure on our business. Here, the situation is relatively stable, pretty similar to the fourth quarter. Of course, we continue to experience extended lead times for certain products, which are primarily impacting equipment. On the consumables side, merchandise side, we generally have products, may not be every single product option in a particular category, but we have basically the products. And the lead time problems are, in fact, impacting our equipment deliveries.\nThe recent lockdowns in China, we've received a lot of questions on that, are so far not having a significant supply chain impact on us. As most of our manufacturing partners are located outside the affected regions. And ports are largely operational from our point of view with, of course, some delays. Now this may be slightly different for specific suppliers of ours of finished goods. Our team is actively managing these inflationary and supply chain matters, which are reflected in our financial guidance.\nTurning now to Ukraine. Henry Schein has relatively low dental sales to customers and really no direct presence in either Ukraine or Russia. So the conflict itself is not directly impacting our business per se. Of course, it could impact our suppliers. Consistent with our long-standing commitment to humanitarian work and disaster relief, our team continues to support refugees and displaced persons in and from the Ukraine as we have done, for example, with refugees from Syria, other parts of the Middle East and of course, elsewhere.\nOur support is through the delivery of health care product donations in partnership with several of our suppliers and with international NGOs that we've worked with for a long time. And yes, in this case, through our local teams on the ground in Poland. And there are other on-the-ground teams working with us to provide these relief -- support these relief programs, these humanitarian relief programs. So we're actively supporting refugees through managing of donations of products, clothing and yes, in some instances, money.\nWe also are responding to those affected by natural disaster around the world, such as floods in Australia, last year in Germany and continuing to work in advancing health equity. Advancing health equity has been a key component of Henry Schein's success for many, many years. Our goal is to advance access to oral care and in many respects to primary care as well.\nTurning now to the business review of recent accomplishments, starting with our dental distribution business. The first quarter growth in our Dental business was driven by strong global equipment sales as dentists continued to invest in their practices. And consumable merchandise sales recovered well during the second half of the quarter, in line with the decline of COVID-19 infection rates.\nSo let me peel the onion a little bit more for you. In North America, we believe consumable merchandise sales were impacted by lower patient traffic in January as a result of COVID-19. But we're progressively stronger in February and March. Sales were also impacted by lower sales of personal protective equipment. I'll refer to that, and Ron will refer to that as PPE products for the rest of the call. This decline in patient traffic was primarily a result of appointment cancellations, staffing shortages and some office closures given the spread of COVID, although we believe patient traffic has now returned to the levels of early December 2021. We are seeing similar trends globally, but obviously...\n(technical difficulty)\nSorry, we had -- evidently, the line disconnected, but let me continue kind of where we ended.\nSo the decline in patient traffic was primarily the result of appointment cancellations, staffing shortages and some office closures given the spread of COVID, although we believe patient traffic has now returned to December '21 levels. I think I covered that already, and I think it went through.\nThe global trends are somewhat varied depending on the region of the world. So lower sales of PPE products in the quarter were primarily as a result of lower glove sales. The glove market has been quite volatile for about a year, maybe a little longer, not much longer, 15 months. We expect glove pricing will be increasing -- will be an increasing headwind for a few quarters, since pricing peaked in the second quarter of last year. That's '21. Nevertheless, if you exclude PPE products, North American consumable merchandise internal sales growth in local currencies was quite solid despite the softer start to the quarter. We gained momentum as the quarter progressed. This was supported by good growth in sales to new DSO accounts.\nOur North American dental equipment business has a very -- had a very good quarter with strong sales in both traditional and digital categories. Now particularly in digital restoration equipment, our equipment order book in North America remained strong at the quarter end, consistent with the backlog at the beginning of the quarter. So new orders continue to come in at a very nice rate.\nAs commented earlier in the call, we did not see a significant impact from inflation on this quarter's equipment sales due to long lead times for equipment as we had largely locked in supplier prices for orders shipped during the quarter. Our equipment results benefited from sales to some of our large DSOs as we believe that anticipation of further price increases -- also, we believe that anticipation of further price increases is modestly providing some of the elevated demand we see today. It's not a huge impact but there are some orders coming in from customers who expect pricing to go up and would like to get into the gate before the prices go up. Not a huge impact, but I'll nevertheless point that out to you.\nWe continue to experience supply chain issues for traditional equipment arising from component part shortage delays in office build-outs and renovations as well as longer lead times for digital imaging technology. This is not that the product is not available, it's just taking a little longer on the digital side to deliver our orders. Having said that, if a practitioner needs anything urgently, we, of course, will make sure that we supply both traditional equipment and digital imaging.\nWe now expect these equipment delays will continue to be factored through the second half of the year, and we'll provide further support for good -- and we'll provide further support for good equipment sales over the next few quarters. In fact, bottom line is we remain bullish on the equipment market and especially the digital dental equipment product offering, and we expect to continue demonstrating good growth in the digital category, including intra-oral scanners. And now in the last period of time, the impact of digital 3D printing we're starting to see that flow through as well, let demand to be of interest.\nWe continue to look for innovative ways to add value to our customers, and last month, we hosted THRIVE Live in Las Vegas. This is a 3-day dental educational conference that replaces the successful Dentrix business dentistry conference we have held in years prior to COVID. We designed this inaugural event to offer a learning path for every member of the dental office from the front office staff to the hygienist and the dentists themselves. So everyone from the staff, hygienists, all the way to the dentists participated in this conference. And the programs is designed for the various players in the office.\nWe were able to select from over 50 CE credited courses led by more than 40 leading commissions, with the strong educational focus on digital technology and practice management solutions that Henry Schein has quite a bit of competency in advising our customers on. The customers' feedback we received has been most positive. And while events like THRIVE, at least from our point of view, position us to connect with our customers in deeper ways and positions our team to help drive greater productivity and provide better clinical care in their practices, educational type events like this provide great sales opportunities as well.\nTurning now to the International Dental. Our international equipment sales were also quite strong for the quarter. Our international consumable sales were impacted by similar trends as in North America, including lower PP&E and COVID-19 related product sales and by a decline in patient visits, particularly during the first half of the quarter. That said, compared to North America, the impact of COVID-19 was more pronounced internationally, especially in Europe.\nSo to peel the onion a bit more in Europe, patient traffic picked up at varying paces as the quarter progressed and COVID-19 restrictions were relaxed in certain parts of Europe. And we expect these markets to continue to recover. We also expect the Australian market to start to recover having reached the peak COVID-19 infection rate towards the end of the quarter. This should help (inaudible) in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nOur (inaudible) business was strong throughout the first quarter. Our sales in China impacted our business (inaudible) note, our growing Chinese business is still relatively -- still a relatively small part of our global Dental business. These lockdowns also intensified during our fiscal second quarter. So they had little impact in the first quarter. I remind you, though, we have a nice growing business in China, but it's not material in the relative concept -- the relative size of Henry Schein relative to our global consolidated sales.\nSo turning to Dental Specialties and Technology and Value-Added Services. Sales of our Dental Specialty products were solid during the first quarter, specifically oral surgery, which consists of dental implants and bone regeneration products. In particular, sales of BioHorizons implants grew by double digit this quarter, executing well in North America, where this business is primarily focused, and where the markets for restorations continue to be quite strong.\nOur Camlog and Medentis brands in Europe, primarily in Germany, also had quite a good quarter -- first quarter for the implants and the bone regeneration products in Europe. We have also had success selling our ACE bone regeneration product into the large DSO market. And this is really another very good example of the L in our BOLD strategy, leveraging One Schein strategic priorities.\nNow within our endodontics products offering, and endo business is also quite solid. We recently launched our EdgePRO laser which is actually off to quite a successful launch, having been well received at last week's AEA (sic) [AAE] meeting here in the United States. We do believe that EdgePRO laser offers outstanding cleaning, debridement and disinfection, coupled with greater value compared with competing products.\nMeanwhile, our priority in the orthodontic businesses with our Reveal Clear Aligner product line. In March, we completed the U.S. domestic launch of the Studio Pro 4.0 product. That's the software. And we are now rolling out the software update globally. Software features advanced treatment planning and utilization tools.\nObviously, I think investors are aware that orthodontic sales were not great in the first quarter because of practices not being at full capacity, i.e. as a result of COVID. So overall, our solid position in Dental Specialty products is built upon strong customer offering. And our commitment to meaningful ongoing investments in R&D, there are questions on that, happy to provide further color during the call.\nTurning to Technology and Value-Added Service sales. They also increased by double digits during the first quarter in both North America and International. We believe Henry Schein One offers one of the broadest product offerings of dental practice management and related software and services and is the largest contributor to sales in the sector of Technology and Value-Added Services. Growth within Henry Schein One continues to be driven primarily by a recovery in patient traffic to dental offices, which generates demand for our revenue cycle management solutions and also by cloud-based solutions -- our cloud-based solutions that create flexibility, scalable services to drive practice efficiency, and yes, patient engagement, too.\nAs another example of our commitment to expanding our technology product offering, we have begun making our Jarvis Analytics software product available to private dental practices whereas previously, the Jarvis software was available primarily to DSOs. Also within our Value-Added Services business is our eAssist business, which provides revenue cycle management solutions for insurance reimbursements. We are quite pleased with the integration and performance of this business, which we acquired last year.\nSo now turning to our Medical business, where the global medical sales were excellent as we achieve further penetration into existing customer accounts. Internal sales growth in local currency, if you exclude PPE and COVID-19-related products, also continued to be strong.\nIn the U.S., patient traffic to physician offices and alternate care sites and that, in particular, in our cases, the ambulatory surgical centers, was up consistently throughout quarter 1 versus the prior year. Sales of medical laboratory equipment were up double digits, while demand for non-COVID point-of-care diagnostic test is also quite strong. Sales of PPE products declined by double digits compared to the strong first quarter last year. As I mentioned earlier, we expect further pricing declines for gloves throughout the rest of the year, yet prices to remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nSales of COVID-19 tests were extremely strong during January, very strong, and declined sharply towards the end of the quarter. In the future, these products are difficult to predict as we face the somewhat offsetting forces of new variants spreading rapidly creating demand, along with increased availability of home tests on the other side and many of which have been paid for by the governments in the U.S.\nSo that's a broad overview. Now Ron will give you more specifics on the financial results for the first quarter. So Ron, there you go, welcome to your first call.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nVery good. Thank you, Stanley, and good morning, everyone. So turning now to our record first quarter financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended March 26, 2022, were $3.2 billion, reflecting growth of 8.7% compared to the prior year period. Internally generated sales were up 7.7% in local currencies, and when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, internal growth in local currencies was 8.9%.\nAs Stanley mentioned, prices for PPE products and specifically gloves increased last year due to market volatility and supply chain disruptions. More recently, prices of these products, along with COVID-19 test kits, have declined. This pricing volatility, combined with a strong Q1 prior year sales comparison, is driving a year-over-year decline in sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products. Details from sales performance are contained in Exhibit A in our earnings press release issued earlier today.\nOperating margin for the first quarter of 2022 was 7.7%, representing a decrease of 17 basis points compared with the prior year GAAP operating margin. when compared with the prior year non-GAAP results, operating margin decreased 71 basis points. Operating margin contraction was due to higher operating expenses, primarily as a result of increases in payroll, commissions and travel and entertainment since most of our operations have returned to normal this year. The year-over-year contraction was also due to the unusually high operating margin in the first quarter of last year.\nTurning to taxes, our effective tax rate for the first quarter of 2022 was an even 24%. This compares with an effective tax rate of 25.1% for the first quarter of 2021 on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. GAAP net income attributable to Henry Schein for the first quarter of 2022 was $181 million or $1.30 per diluted share. This compares with prior year GAAP net income of $166 million or $1.16 per diluted share, and prior year non-GAAP net income of $178 million or $1.24 per diluted share.\nAmortization from acquired intangible assets for Q1 2022 was $32.2 million pretax or $0.14 per diluted share. This compares with $29.7 million pretax or $0.13 per diluted share in the same period last year. And foreign currency exchange negatively impacted Q1 2022 diluted EPS by approximately $0.01.\nI'll now provide some detail on our sales results for the first quarter. Global Dental sales of $1.8 billion increased 2.2% compared to the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 3.5% in local currencies. Global Dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased 1.3% in local currencies. And excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, internal sales in local currencies increased 4.7%. Global Dental equipment internal sales growth in local currency was 11.9%.\nNorth America Dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.8%, which was driven by especially strong performance in equipment, which internally grew 13.2% compared with the prior year period, with strong performance in both traditional and digital categories. This growth also comes off a difficult comp as Q1 2021 internal equipment sales growth in local currencies was 17.4%. North America dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 2.6% compared with Q1 2021 or 7.3% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products.\nInternational Dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 1.8% compared with the first quarter of 2021, where we had an exceptionally strong sales quarter with internal sales growth of 17.9% in local currencies. International Dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies decreased 0.5% compared with the first quarter of 2021 and increased 1.3% when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products. Sales were impacted by an increase in COVID infections, especially in January and February. This sales growth is also against a difficult comp as the internal sales growth in the prior year was 19.2% in local currencies.\nInternational Dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 10.1% and this is also against a difficult first quarter 2021 comp and such growth was 12.9% in local currencies.\nSales of Dental Specialty products were approximately $236 million in the first quarter, with internal growth of 7.2% in local currencies compared with Q1 2021 when we had an exceptionally strong sales quarter with internal sales growth of 18.3% in local currencies. This quarter, growth was strong in our oral surgery category, which consists of implants and bone regeneration products.\nTechnology and Value-Added Services sales during Q1 were $179 million, an increase of 23.4% compared to the prior year, including internal growth of 11.1% in local currencies. In North America, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 10.3% in local currency. This growth was driven by our practice management business, with strong growth from Dentrix and Ascend. Our Revenue Cycle Management business also exhibited solid revenue growth.\nInternationally, Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales increased 15.7% in local currencies compared to the prior year. This growth was driven by a strong performance in the U.K., which benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior year when the lockdown was just beginning to ease. During Q1, our Technology and Value-Added Services businesses, together with our Dental Specialty products, achieved total sales growth of 13.1% and internal sales growth in local currencies of 8.7%, and this total sales growth is in line with our double-digit growth goal for the full year.\nGlobal Medical sales during Q1 of $1.2 billion grew 18.3% compared with the same period of 2021, with internal sales growth of 14.7% in local currencies led by growth and COVID test kits and other point of care diagnostics. We sold approximately $250 million in COVID-19 test kits in the first quarter of 2022, including multi-state flu and COVID-19 combination test kits. This compares with approximately $180 million in test kits in Q1 of 2021. We expect continued volatility in sales of test kits for the remainder of the year.\nExcluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, Global Medical internal sales in local currencies increased 14.5% compared with Q1 of 2021.\nRegarding share repurchases, we did not repurchase any shares of Henry Schein stock during the first quarter because we had a 10b5-1 plan that did not result in any shares being repurchased during the quarter. We intend to put in place an additional plan that is effective as of tomorrow, May 4. As of the end of the first quarter, Henry Schein had $200 million authorized and available for future share repurchases. This program remains a core pillar of our balanced capital allocation strategy, which also includes ongoing disciplined investment to support organic growth and strategic acquisitions.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow, we continue to benefit from significant liquidity, providing our businesses flexibility and financial stability. Operating cash flow for the first quarter of 2022 was $93 million compared with $63 million for the first quarter of last year.\nTurning to 2022 financial guidance, I will conclude my remarks by noting that we are affirming our 2022 full year GAAP diluted EPS guidance range of $4.75 to $4.91, reflecting growth of 7% to 10% compared to our 2021 GAAP diluted EPS of $4.45, and growth of 5% to 9% compared with our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.52.\nWe expect 2022 full year sales growth of approximately 5% to 8% over 2021 versus our previously communicated expected sales growth of 6% to 8%. This change primarily reflects the latest foreign exchange rates and a decrease in sales of COVID-19 test kits. As Stanley mentioned earlier, the future demand for test kits is difficult to predict. However, given recent trends, we now estimate sales of COVID-19 test kits to be 15% to 25% lower than 2021 as opposed to the 10% decline we have previously communicated.\nWe continue to expect full year 2022 operating margin expansion of 20 to 25 basis points over the 2021 non-GAAP operating margin, an expansion of 39 to 44 basis points over the 2021 GAAP operating margin. Our guidance is for current as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions and does not include the impact of future share repurchases, potential future acquisitions or restructuring expenses, if any.\nGuidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates will remain generally consistent with current levels. That end markets will remain stable and consistent with current market conditions, and that there are no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you very much, Ron. Unfortunately, the beginning part of our call where Graham made his introductory remarks were not fully broadcast to our participants. There was a problem with the operator and eventually, the call got disconnected. I think my remarks and Ron's were fully picked up. Graham, you may want to repeat some of your remarks. Please, Graham.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance Project Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nSure. Thank you, Stan. So I'd just like to state that some comments made during this call will include information that's forward-looking.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Graham Stanley, Henry Schein's Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategic Financial Project Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGraham Stanley\n\nVP of IR & Strategic Finance Project Officer, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator, and my thanks to each of you for joining us to discuss Henry Schein's results for the 2021 fourth quarter and full year. With me on the call today are Stanley Bergman, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Henry Schein; Steven Paladino, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Ron South, Vice President, Corporate Finance and Chief Accounting Officer and who will be assuming Steve's responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer at the end of April.\nBefore we begin, I would like to state that certain comments made during this call will include information that is forward-looking. As you know, risks and uncertainties involved in the company's business may affect the matters referred to in forward-looking statements. As a result, the company's performance may materially differ from those expressed in or indicated by such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in Henry Schein's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the Risk Factors section of those filings.\nIn addition, all comments about the markets we serve, including end market growth rates and market share, are based upon the company's internal analysis and estimates. Our conference call remarks will include both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are presented solely for informational and comparative purposes and should not be regarded as a replacement for corresponding GAAP measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures can be found in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website and in Exhibit B of today's press release, which is also available in the Investor Relations section of our website.\nLastly, the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, February 15, 2022. Henry Schein undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this call. (Operator Instructions) With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Stanley Bergman.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Graham. Good morning, everyone and, of course, thank you for all joining us. Let me take this opportunity to thank Team Schein for the team's extraordinary effort over the past 2 years. Despite the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, we are pleased to report excellent full year 2021 financial results, including an outstanding fourth quarter that exceeded our expectations. Our fourth quarter results were driven by strong internal sales growth in local currencies of 6.3% when excluding sales of personal protection equipment or PPE and COVID-19-related products as well as prior year sales to Covetrus under the transition agreement, and acquisition growth of 4.3% while also reporting operating margin expansion of 30 basis points. So we are pleased with our sales results and we are pleased with our operating margin expansion.\nWe have updated our 2022 financial guidance based on this latest view of our businesses. Steven will provide additional details on that topic in a moment. We have also completed a strategic review recently of our businesses, and we're excited to recently present an updated 2022 to 2024 strategic plan to our Board. We update our strategic plan generally every 3 years. The 2022 to 2024 strategic plan was very well received by our Board.\nThe updated guidance reflects the execution of 2 key strategic priorities contained in the strategic plan: first, continuous operational improvement in our distribution businesses, leading to exceptional customer experience and profit improvement. This is complemented by increasing the overall contribution of our technology and value-added services businesses and our Dental Specialty products, which have higher sales growth and higher operating margins.\nSo specifically, our technology and value-added services businesses and our dental specialties products businesses, together, for the full year of 2021 achieved internal local currency sales growth of over 21%, combined with operating margin of 20%. Together, these products and services represented, in 2021, 13% of our global revenue and about 36% of our full year operating income, with combined sales -- with a combined sales run rate of over $1.7 billion and growing at low double digits.\nBefore I return the call over to Steven -- before I turn over the call actually to Steven, I would like to comment on an announcement that we made in early last month. For the past 35 years, it has been my privilege to work alongside Steve Paladino. Steve joined the Henry Schein finance department in 1987 when the business was approximately $125 million in revenue and has served as our CFO for the past 20 years. Steve has been a remarkable leader during the pre-IPO period, the period leading to the IPO, the IPO and in the 27 years since. Steve led in a consistent and most credible way, balancing the needs of our constituents and resulting in 13% compound annual growth in stock price since the IPO's post spin-off of Covetrus.\nIn early January, we announced Steve's planned retirement from Henry Schein, which will be effective as of April 29. Of course, it's bittersweet to bid farewell to a colleague who has worked right down the hall for 3.5 decades. However, Steve will remain a member of our Board of Directors and will come an adviser to Henry Schein. All of us at Henry Schein wish Steve the best in his well-deserved retirement. But he's still going to be part of the company.\nWe have a deep bench strength in our management team across the company. And as Graham mentioned, on the finance side, Ron will be assuming Steve's responsibility as our new CFO. Ron has been our Vice President of Corporate Finance since 2008 and our Chief Accounting Officer since 2013. Ron will be supported by Olga Timoshkina, who will be assuming the role of Chief Accounting Officer. Olga joined Henry Schein in September from EY, where she was a partner in Accounting Advisory Services and has a deep technical accounting knowledge. We actually worked with Olga before when she was at EY.\nRon and Olga are complemented by Graham, who has been with the company for almost 2 decades, having rotated through most of our businesses as the business Chief Financial Officer. And of course, the rest of our outstanding finance team will continue to provide outstanding services. We are confident there will be a smooth transition from Steve to Ron. Ron is joining us on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Steve to review our financial results and discuss our 2022 financial guidance. Please, Steven, and thank you again for all you've done for the company, for all our team and for our shareholders. Thank you.\n\nSteven Paladino\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Executive Director, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nOkay. Thank you very much, Stanley. Thank you for those kind words, and good morning to everyone. Before I review our financial results, as this will be my last of more than 100 quarterly conference calls as CFO, I'd like to acknowledge the relationships I have built with so many of you in the investment community, our investors and analysts. I would also like to express my deep appreciation to the finance team here at Henry Schein and other colleagues with whom I have worked closely with over the years. While I'm looking forward to life's next chapter, it's those relationships that I will remember most. I thank you for those memories and for your friendships.\nNow turning to our review of financial results. I'd like to point out that I will be discussing our results from continuing operations as reported on a GAAP basis and also on a non-GAAP basis. Our fourth quarter non-GAAP results for 2021 and 2020 exclude certain items that are detailed in Exhibit B of today's press release as well as in the Supplemental Information section of our Investor Relations website.\nTurning to our financial results. Total net sales for the quarter ended December 25, 2021, were $3.3 billion, reflecting growth of 5.2% compared with the prior year. Internally generated sales were up 1.4% in local currencies, acquisition growth was 4.3% and foreign exchange impacted sales growth by minus 0.5%. Excluding sales of personal protective equipment, or PPE, and COVID-19-related products as well as prior year sales to Covetrus under the transitional services agreement, our internal growth in local currencies was 6.3%.\nAs you may recall, in 2020, prices for PPE products and specifically, gloves, increased due to some increased due to some supply chain disruptions that we experienced. However, prices of those products along with COVID-19 test kits have since declined, and this pricing volatility is driving the negative year-over-year sales growth in PPE and COVID-related products. You could look at the details of our sales performance contained in Exhibit A of our press release that was issued earlier today. On a GAAP basis, operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 6.02%, representing an increase of 30 basis points compared with the prior year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin of 6.16% for the fourth quarter of 2021 also expanded 30 basis points compared with the prior year. Operating margin expansion was driven by increased profitability in our Dental Specialty products and technology businesses as well as lower inventory adjustments and improved customer supplier rebates -- sorry, improved supplier rebates.\nTurning to taxes. Our reported GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 22.5%. This compares with 17.3% GAAP effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020. On a non-GAAP basis, our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 22.5% compared with 17.5% for the quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate for the fourth quarter last year in 2020 was favorably impacted by income tax resolution, both in the U.S. and internationally.\nMoving on, GAAP net income from continuing operations attributable to Henry Schein for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $147.2 million or $1.05 per diluted share. This compares with the prior year GAAP net income from continuing operations of $141.9 million or $0.99 per diluted share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $150.7 million or $1.07 per diluted share, and this compares with the non-GAAP net income from continuing operations of $143.6 million or $1 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOur amortization from acquired intangible assets for Q4 '21 -- Q4 2021 was $32.6 million pretax or $0.15 per diluted share. This compares with $25.3 million pretax or $0.11 per diluted share for the same period last year, and that excluded a noncash intangible asset impairment charge that was $18.1 million. For the full year 2021, amortization from acquired intangible assets was $122.9 million pretax or $0.54 per diluted share, and this compares with the prior year, that was $102.1 million pretax or $0.46 per diluted share. That also excluded the combined noncash asset impairment charges in Q1 and Q4 of the prior year of $20.3 million. I'll note that foreign currency exchange positively impacted our Q4 2021 diluted EPS by approximately [$0.005].\nLet's now look at some of the details of our sales results for the fourth quarter, starting with Global Dental, which had sales of $2 billion and increased 9.4% compared with the same period last year, with internal sales growth of 6.4% in local currencies. Global Dental consumable merchandise internal sales increased 6.6% in local currencies in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared with the prior year. Excluding sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products, internal sales growth in local currencies increased 7.4%. Our North American dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 9.3% compared with Q4 of last year and was driven by solid growth, both in our consumable merchandise as well as our equipment product categories.\nOur North American dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 10.3% compared with Q4 of 2020 or 10.1%, again, when excluding sales of PPE and COVID-related products. North American dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 6.6% compared with Q4 of 2020. We had strong growth in our high-tech product offering, specifically CAD/CAM in the U.S., which received a boost from the DS World event, which we saw modest growth in traditional equipment also, which remains impacted -- the traditional equipment remains impacted by manufacturing and office construction delays.\nInternational dental internal sales growth in local currencies was 2.5% compared with Q4 2020. And we had really strong sales growth in the prior period with sales growth of 14.2% in Q4 2020 in local currencies. International dental consumable merchandise internal sales in local currencies increased 1.9% compared with Q4 of 2020 or 4%, excluding sales of PPE and COVID-related products. Again, as a reminder, Q4 2020, the prior year international dental consumable merchandise sales growth was quite strong at 16.7% in local currencies.\nInternational dental equipment internal sales growth in local currencies was 4.2%, and that is also against a bit of a difficult comp in the prior year when the growth was 6.8%. If we look at our Dental Specialty products, sales of Dental Specialty products were approximately $244.8 million in the fourth quarter with internal growth of 15.1% in local currencies compared with the prior year. Growth was strong in each of our Dental Specialty categories, including oral surgery, which consists of implants and bone regen products as well as endodontic and orthodontic products, with all 3 categories performing well globally. For the full year 2021, our Dental Specialty products were $928.6 million with growth of 27.2% in local currencies over the prior year and contributed $186.3 million to our operating income.\nTurning to Global Medical. Our Global Medical sales during Q4 of $1.1 billion was a decline of 3.2% compared with the same period in 2020, and internal sales growth in local currencies declined 7.1%. Internal sales growth declined in North America 6.6% and international sales declined also at 24% year-over-year. The medical sales decline was driven primarily by lower sales of PPE and COVID-related products, mainly COVID test kits. If we exclude the sales of the PPE and COVID test kits, our Global Medical internal sales growth in local currencies increased 3.6% compared with Q4 of 2020.\nI'll also note, we sold approximately $185 million of COVID test kits in the fourth quarter of 2021. That includes about $40 million in multi-assay flu and COVID-19 combination test kits, and this compares with approximately $270 million in test kits that were sold in Q4 of 2020. We expect continued volatility in sales of test kits in the upcoming quarters.\nNow turning to Technology and Value-Added Services sales, during Q4, were $177.2 million, an increase of 27.8% compared with the prior year, and that includes internal growth in local currencies of 13.4%. North American Technology and Value-Added Services internal sales growth was 12.6%. That growth was primarily driven by our revenue cycle and claims management revenue products. Internationally, the Tech and Value-Added Service internal sales increased 17.8% compared with the prior year. And this growth was driven primarily by strong sales in EMEA, including sales growth in the U.K., which benefited from a favorable comparison due to last year's prior year lockdown.\nFor the full year 2021, Technology and Value-Added Services sales was $640.9 million, an increase of 24.6% compared with the prior year and included internal growth of 13% in local currencies and had operating income of $125.6 million.\nWe continue to repurchase common stock in the open market during the fourth quarter, buying approximately 2 million shares at an average price of $75.50 per share for a total of $150 million. The impact of this repurchase on our fourth quarter diluted EPS was immaterial. For the full year, we spent $400 million to repurchase 5.5 million shares of our stock. And I'll note at the year-end, Henry Schein had approximately $200 million available for future stock repurchases.\nTurning to our balance sheet and cash flow. We continue to have access to significant liquidity, providing flexibility and financial stability. Our operating cash flow from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $276.6 million. That compared to $345.1 million for the fourth quarter of last year. And this decrease in operating cash flow was attributable primarily to increased inventory including COVID test kits, year-end investment inventory and reserve stock due to delayed lead times from manufacturers. For the full year, our operating cash flow from continuing operations was $709.6 million and that compares to $593.5 million in 2021 -- in 2020, sorry.\nI will conclude my remarks by noting that we are updating our 2022 EPS guidance. The guidance is for GAAP EPS only. We are not providing non-GAAP EPS guidance for 2022 as we do not currently anticipating using non-GAAP financial measures for the year, although this decision could change in the future. For 2022, we expect EPS attributable to Henry Schein will be in a range of $4.75 to $4.91, reflecting growth of 7% to 10% compared with our 2021 GAAP diluted EPS of $4.45 and growth of 5% to 9% when compared with our 2021 non-GAAP diluted EPS of $4.52.\nOur guidance for 2022 has a number of key assumptions. I'll review some of those. 2022 assumes that our total sales growth will be somewhere in the range of approximately 6% to 8% over 2021. That includes sales of COVID tests declining approximately 10% from 2021 levels that were approximately $650 million. I'll also note that 2022 includes 1 extra selling week compared with 2021. This is our 53rd week year, and that occurs in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nFor 2022, we are also expecting to achieve operating margin expansion. Our guidance assumes a range of 20 to 25 basis points over the 2021 non-GAAP operating margin of 7.06% and operating margin expansion of 39 to 44 basis points over the 2021 GAAP operating margin of 6.87%. Lastly, we expect the effective tax rate to stay in the 24% range and, of course, that assumes no significant changes in tax legislation.\nOur guidance for 2022 diluted EPS is for continuing operations as well as completed or previously announced acquisitions but does not include the impact of future share repurchases, future acquisitions or restructuring expenses, if any. Our guidance also assumes that foreign currency exchange rates are generally consistent with current levels, that end markets remain stable and are consistent with current market conditions and there's really no material adverse market changes associated with COVID-19.\nLast, I'd like to note that we anticipate our first quarter EPS first quarter of 2022 will be slightly lower to flat compared with the first quarter of 2021 non-GAAP EPS. This is due to really a very strong prior year and a difficult prior year comparison that we're seeing in Q1. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ron South.\n\nRonald N. South\n\nCAO & VP of Corporate Finance, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and it's great to be speaking with all of you this morning. I'm honored and excited to be stepping into the role of Henry Schein's CFO. I have worked closely with Steve for more than a dozen years, and I'm looking forward to working with Olga, Graham and the entire Henry Schein global finance team.\nTo underscore what Stanley said, I expect a smooth transition into my new position. Steve has been a tremendous steward of Henry Schein's finances during several decades of impressive growth and expansion. I look forward to continuing his legacy of transparency, coupled with fiscal responsibility. You'll be hearing more from me when we report our Q1 financial results in early May. But in the meantime, it's great to be joining the team on today's call. Now I'd like to turn the call back to Stanley.\n\nStanley M. Bergman\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Henry Schein, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ron. Congratulations on your well-deserved promotion. You are truly respected by our entire management team at Henry Schein, and thank you for your service. Of course, I thank Graham as well for his new role and for his service and, in fact, the entire finance team.\nIn September of 2021, we announced a new leadership structure associated with what we internally refer to as One Distribution. Our One Distribution strategy contemplates a North American dental and medical distribution leadership under the leadership of Brad Connett, a 25-year veteran of Henry Schein. Our international distribution businesses are being led correspondingly by Andrea Albertini, an exceptional health care executive who joined our team 9 years ago.\nAs noted earlier, One Distribution is part of Henry Schein's commitment to continuous operational improvement in our distribution businesses, leading to exceptional customer experience -- building on our exceptional customer experience and, of course, profit improvement.\nTurning now to our most recent accomplishments in our distribution businesses, let me start with Dental. Fourth quarter Dental revenue growth was solid. In North America, we are especially pleased with the growth in dental consumable merchandise sales with strong internal growth in local currencies with and without sales of PPE and COVID-19-related products. The growth reflects the impact of some modest price increases as well as the contribution from 2 large DSO contracts awarded in 2021. We expect additional price increases from suppliers to be made by the end of the first quarter, which unfortunately, we're having to pass on to our customers. And there may be more throughout the year.\nPatient traffic held quite well in December. However, we believe there was a decline in January resulting from higher patient appointment cancellations and dental staff shortages due to absenteeism. We consider our Dentrix insurance claims data as a good proxy for U.S. patient traffic. And in January, we saw a modest decline compared to 2021. This is consistent with our January average sales volumes. Our view is that while there may be some postponed office visits as a result of the Omicron variant, we expect the market to be stable. Any impact is likely to be temporary in our view, and that most canceled appointments will be rescheduled.\nWe have factored these movements into our financial guidance. And the first couple of weeks of February have shown that there is resiliency in the dental market in the United States. Of course, the international market is a little bit varied but generally quite consistent with the trends we've experienced in North America.\nWe have experienced some supply chain disruption to our merchandise business, like everyone. And while we may not always have every brand in every size for all products, we generally have substitutes available. We have increased our safety stock for some items, and we are leveraging our global supply chain partners to mitigate delays and expedite our shipments where possible. We have very good logistics partners as well, I might add.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we continued to experience some delivery and installation delays in the U.S. traditional dental equipment business as we had expected. These are caused by a combination of component shortages and construction delays, component shortages with our suppliers and construction delays, which we expect to continue through the second half of this year. We also experienced, for the first time, some modest delays in the delivery of digital imaging units, which we expect to last a quarter or so.\nSales of intra-oral scan equipment was particularly strong again this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had a bit of a tailwind from the DS World, positive support from that meeting, as we discussed during our last call. We remain bullish on the equipment market, especially about the future of digital dentistry as we believe the market remains underpenetrated. We expect to continue to see good growth in the digital category, including digital imaging, intraoral scanners and digital 3D printing, offset in part by what we believe may be lower ASPs for the new products -- with some new products.\nIn our international dental business, in the fourth quarter, we had very good strong -- very strong sales growth in the U.K., driven by recovery from last year and, in Brazil, where we have seen some accelerated consolidation within the dental distribution industry as well as good growth in Italy, Spain, Eastern Europe and Australia. Our global equipment businesses are performing very well overall as we believe dental offices continue to invest in their businesses. And we have expanded our Brazilian equipment business as well. At this time, we have a strong underlying global equipment order book, and that is throughout our business domestically and globally.\nNow turning to our Medical business. We have continued to gain new customers while achieving deeper penetration among existing accounts. Internal sales in local currencies for the fourth quarter declined against a tough prior year comparison that is extremely strong because of PP&E and COVID-19-related products. Yet as Steven mentioned, when normalizing for sales of these products, growth was a solid 3.6%. Patient traffic to physician offices and alternate care sites were all positive during the fourth quarter. While early in the quarter, patient traffic was generally improving and trending towards more normalized levels, late in the fourth quarter, we saw patients deferring some elective procedures, which we believe will be temporary.\nWe expect demand for COVID-19-related testing products will continue to be choppy as the Omicron variant runs its course. We are currently seeing a surge in demand for COVID-19 testing. However, there are also production challenges and some suppliers -- with some suppliers, leading to some However, demand is good and we have product. In addition, we expect pricing for COVID-19 tests, as Steven noted, to remain volatile.\nWe are optimistic about the future, in fact, I would say, highly optimistic about the future of our medical group as procedures continue to migrate to the alternate care setting and as the current COVID wave continues to decline. We believe the use of PPE products for both dental and medical practitioners will remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future, with glove pricing to continue to decline modestly. These factors are all reflected in our financial guidance.\nNow turning to our Dental Specialties and Technology and Value-Added Services product offerings, we are really excited about these various businesses and product offerings. As mentioned earlier, sales of our dental specialties products performed extremely well during 2021. Under the seasoned leadership of René Willi, Chief Executive Officer of our Global Oral Reconstruction Group, which includes oral surgery products; and David Brous, Chief Executive Officer of our strategic business groups. David is also, by the way, a partner to Andrea Albertini in our international distribution businesses.\nAnd David's businesses include endodontics, orthodontics and other specialty products and services. David had previously led our M&A function as well as a number of businesses, both domestically and internationally. Our solid position in the oral surgery market consisting of implants and bone regeneration products as well as in endodontics and orthodontics products is built on a strong customer offering in our specialties. We believe it's a deep offering and a commitment -- actually, it's a continued commitment to invest in research and development. Our growth is fueled by new product launches and the strengthening of the market for dental solutions.\nTurning to our Dental Technology and Value-Added Services business. Henry Schein One, the largest contributor to sales in the segment, once again posted record high quarterly revenue. Growth within Henry Schein One continues to be driven primarily by recovery in patient traffic to dental offices, which generates demand for our revenue cycle management solutions plus new products. And we have also been adding new talent to the Henry Schein One team, including Mike Baird as the CEO of this business who joined us about 1.5 years ago to lead Henry Schein One. And Mike has a deep background in technology.\nWe continue to focus on the migration to the cloud and on cloud-based solutions to create flexible, scalable services to drive practice efficiency and patient engagement and moving to a SaaS model, as we've discussed in the past, resulting in more stable recurring revenue and those streams are, of course, welcome.\nWe are seeing good growth in both the Ascend and the cloud-based practice management system, which now have more than 4,000 customers globally. And we believe we have the largest installed base of cloud-based systems, which we continue to expect to grow in the dental arena. We are also executing well for our large customers and, most recently, we're pleased that our partnership with led to the installation of Dentrix into Brooke Army Medical Center, one of the U.S. Army's premier medical centers. This is part of a global program with the U.S. military to install our dental software, our Dentrix software systems.\nHenry Schein is also working with several customers to collaborate on building next-generation innovative digital and clinical solutions, the first of several [510(k)] applications to uniquely embed computer vision, AI technology into Henry Schein's flagship practice management software, Dentrix and Ascend, has been filed with the FDA. These applications will create valuable and powerful workflows, combining practice management software, imaging and AI insights to assist dental professionals in diagnosing dental treatment and automating the construction of appropriate treatment plans. This is very, very exciting.\nThe final topic I'd like to draw the attention of our investors to is our continuous commitment to M&A strategy, led by Mark Mlotek, who has been leading strategy and M&A for Henry Schein for 27-plus years. Mark is our Executive Vice President of -- Vice President and Chief Strategic Officer and works and is supported by Scott Saunders, our VP, Global M&A and Business Development, also a long time Henry Schein veteran, and M&A remains an important part of our growth and capital allocation strategy.\nDuring 2021, we completed several acquisitions across our business units, representing annualized sales of over $560 million and capital deployment of $570 million. These acquisitions were primarily focused on broadening our technology and value-added solutions, servicing the ambulatory surgery market, expanding our presence in the health market and supporting our brand -- owned brand strategy. Of course, we will continue to seek additional investment opportunities in the specialty -- product specialty and services areas. With these comments and a review of our fourth quarter and full year financial results, we'd like to open the call to your questions. Operator, please?"

Welcome to the MarketAxess Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. If you would like to ask a question during this time, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. The conference call is recorded for third quarter 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with an update on our strategy and our trading businesses, and Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2024. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.\nLet me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our third quarter financial results. As highlighted on slides 3 and 4, our third quarter results reflect a return to more challenging market conditions and historic levels of new issue in September, as well as continued revenue growth challenges in US credit. Revenue was $209 million in the quarter, up slightly from the prior year. Our revenue growth outside of US credit was strong at 10%. With regard to the operating environment, we are focused on providing our clients with a platform that has the right mix of protocols and workflow tools to meet their needs in all market conditions. We intend to deliver a platform that will be protocol-agnostic, that uses data and analytics to help clients decide the appropriate protocol for each trading situation.\nOur current model does exceptionally well in higher volatility when spreads are widened out and liquidity is in higher demand. Unfortunately, we have only seen limited periods of volatility over the last several years, and we continue to see fairly tight spreads. Revenue growth in US credit has also been impacted by the growth of new protocols like portfolio trading, the growth of the dealer-to-dealer market, and smaller-sized trades moving from RFQ to portfolio trades at lower capture rates. The good news is that we are modernizing our technology platform, while at the same time delivering new protocols and workflow tools to help our clients be more efficient. Most importantly, we continue to gain significant traction with our new initiatives. In the client-initiated channel, we generated 10% growth in block trading ADV across US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds.\nThis strong growth continued in October with a 21% increase in block trading ADV. In the portfolio trading channel, we generated a 20% increase in total portfolio trading ADV, with record US high-yield ADV. In October, total portfolio trading ADV was up 25%, and market share in US credit portfolio trading increased 300 basis points. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, we generated an 18% increase in dealer-initiated ADV. Again, this strong growth continued into October with a 22% increase in dealer-initiated ADV, supported by strong growth in Mid-X for Eurobonds, and the addition of Mid-X for US credit. As announced earlier this week, we will also be launching a new protocol introducing the concept of closing auctions to the fixed-income market. Many of you are familiar with the auction protocol used in the global equity markets.\nNow, we are bringing it to the fixed-income market. We believe a closing auction in the most liquid bonds will provide the market with an end-of-day liquidity solution, while delivering a more organized market closing process. Protocol innovation, market data, and automated solutions will continue to evolve as this market becomes more and more electronic. Before moving to the next slide, I wanted to provide some context for our October volumes. As you will recall, the prior year period is a tough comparison for US credit given the heightened level of activity in advance of the US presidential election. Despite this, our US high-yield ADV growth in October was strong, up 9%, reflecting a strong performance of our platform with only a slight increase in volatility during the month. While we know we need to drive higher levels of share growth, we were pleased to see the improvement of market share month over month in both US high-grade and high-yield and across all of our key initiatives.\nSlide 5 highlights the underlying strength of our global credit franchise. As you can see from this slide, our credit business is a global business, and increasingly diversified. While US credit trading volume is growing at a 4% CAGR in North America, our other credit products are growing double digits in North America and throughout the rest of the world. Furthermore, 36% of our global credit trading volume is now driven by clients outside of North America, up from 29% in 2020, and we continue to add international clients. This trend is supported by the over 6,000 international dealer and investor traders that are now on the platform.\nSlide 6 and 7 provide you with a year-to-date view of how well we are executing with our new initiatives in the three strategic channels, as well as the strong growth we are continuing to see with automation. On slide 7, in the client-initiated channel, we continue to make strong progress with block trading globally. Our targeted block solution continues to grow in emerging markets and Eurobonds, while we see consistent growth in block trading in our US credit business as well. Block trading represents the next step function to the growth of electronic trading and is an opportunity for real transformation in the fixed-income markets. We are attacking the block market in two ways. First, we are leveraging automation by providing clients with unique tools that execute blocks in a more automated way.\nThe second way we are attacking blocks is through our targeted RFQ workflow, which allows clients to target a short list of dealers for liquidity while increasing execution likelihood and reducing information leakage. Our total block trading ADV is approximately $5 billion year-to-date, up 23% across US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds. Our cumulative block trading volume since the launch of our targeted block trading solution in US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds was approximately $12 billion through October 2025. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, total portfolio trading ADV year-to-date is running 50% above the prior year. US credit portfolio trading market share was over 18%, up 210 basis points over the prior year, including a 360 basis point increase in US high-yield. In the dealer-initiated channel, we are continuing to see progress. Dealer-initiated ADV was $1.7 billion year-to-date, representing an increase of 34%.\nOur new Mid-X solution for US credit was launched in September, and while it is early days as we expand the number of sessions and bring on new dealers, over the last 10 days, we have executed over $1.3 billion in matching volume. We are pleased with the recent momentum. The evolution underway in the US high-grade market is highlighted on slide 8. The average size of non-block trades is decreasing, while at the other end of the spectrum, the average block size trades are increasing. Blocks greater or equal to $5 million in trade size represent approximately 45% of trade volume in US high-grade, and they are largely executed over chat or the phone. This is the segment of the market that we are attacking with our targeted RFQ solution.\nTrades less than $5 million in size make up the other 55% of the market in terms of volume, but approximately 98% of the ticket count. This is the segment of the market that we are attacking with our suite of low-touch automation tools, as well as our portfolio trading tool. In third quarter, two-thirds of trades executed by our largest clients were done through automation. The good news is that this business comes in at a more attractive price point, and becomes sticky as clients convert. Part of this evolution has been the explosion in ticket count, as shown on slide 9, driving client demand for automation, underpinned by our differentiated liquidity. Trades in US high-grade, less than $5 million in size, have almost tripled since 2021. This significant increase in tickets has been driven by a couple of factors, including the growth of ETFs and SMA accounts.\nAssets Under Management in SMA accounts, by some estimates, are expected to top $5 trillion. Other factors driving the explosion in tickets are the growth of portfolio trading, and the increased usage of automation tools in fixed-income. The increase in automation is becoming more important to handle the increase in tickets in smaller-sized trades, but increasingly also for larger-sized trades. We recently profiled a very large investment manager on our platform who has invested in automation by targeting block-sized trades for automated execution. In just two years, for trades $2 million and higher, they have gone from doing 14% of their volume and 54% of their tickets to 35% of their volume and 82% of their tickets today. On our platform, automation trade count and trade volumes are growing at a three-year CAGR of 29% and 28%, respectively.\nOn the dealer side, with the growth of dealer algos, execution quality and dealer responsiveness have improved, with tighter bid-ask spreads and higher RFQ response rates, even for block trades. Dealer algos now contribute 88% of the responses and win up to 87% of trades in US high-grade, including 28% of the block trades. In summary, this year has been a tale of two very different market environments, and we believe that the protocols and workflow tools we are developing will help us grow through all market conditions. While we are pleased with the continued strong contribution from our new initiatives, we know that we have to deliver technology enhancements faster to drive revenue growth.\nWhile the time it is taking to return to higher levels of growth has frustrated many of you, I assure you we are investing in the fixed-income market of tomorrow while also addressing the competitive landscape of today. This is why we feel good about our positioning and our ability to return to higher levels of revenue growth in the coming quarters. Now, let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. Turning to our results, on slide 11, we provide a summary of our third quarter financials. We delivered 1% revenue growth to $209 million, which included a $1 million benefit from foreign currency fluctuations and diluted earnings per share of $1.84. Looking at our revenue lines in turn, total commission revenue was flat compared to the prior year. Services revenue increased 9% to a record $29 million. Information services revenue of $14 million increased 6%, or 5% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Post-trade services revenue of $11 million increased 9% versus the prior year, or 4% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Technology services revenue of $4 million increased 20%, driven by higher license fees, as well as connectivity fees from RFQ hubs. Total other income increased approximately $2 million, driven by a tax credit and lower FX losses in the current quarter of approximately $4 million. This was partially offset by lower interest income and a $1 million negative swing in unrealized gains and losses on investments.\nThe effective tax rate was 27.1%, up from 23% in the prior year, reflecting the increased accrual for the uncertain tax position reserve we established in Q1 of this year. Slide 12 provides you with a quick summary of our KPIs. We continue to deliver strong growth across most of our KPIs, which reflects the progress we are making in our new initiatives. On slide 13, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Lower total credit commissions and lower total rate commissions revenue was mostly offset by higher other commission revenue, which included the impact of RFQ hubs. Total credit commission revenue of $165 million was down 2% compared to the prior year. The strong 11% growth in emerging markets and 9% growth in Eurobonds total commission revenue was more than offset by a 9% decline in US high-grade and flat growth in US high-yield. The reduction in total credit fee capture year-over-year was principally due to protocol mix. On a sequential quarter basis, fee capture was slightly up, due largely to duration in US high-grade.\nOn slide 14, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Total expenses increased only 3%, which includes a $1 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The increase was driven principally by higher employee compensation, technology, and communication costs, as we continue to strike the right balance between investing to drive future growth and continuing to drive increased efficiency. Headcount was 896, up only 2% from 881 in both the prior year period and at the end of Q2 2025. We are reconfirming our full year 2025 expense guidance and expect to be at the low end of the previously stated expense range of $501 million to $521 million on an ex-notable non-GAAP basis, or on a GAAP basis, $505 million to $525 million.\nOn slide 15, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and corporate bonds and US Treasury investments totaling $631 million as of 30 September 2025. We generated $385 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months. We repurchased 595,000 shares year-to-date through October 2025 for a total of $120 million, including 239,000 shares repurchased during third quarter at a cost of $45 million. As of 31 October 2025, $105 million remains on the board's share repurchase authorization.\nNow, let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Ilene. In summary, on slide 16, we are continuing to innovate and execute with our technology modernization, and we are focused on the delivery of new product enhancements and new protocols for the remainder of 2025. Our new strategic hires are already making a difference in our execution, and we continue to show performance across our new initiatives for block trading, portfolio trading, and the dealer-to-dealer business. Our revenue growth profile outside of US credit is strong, and we are addressing our challenges in US credit. While we are pleased with the growth we are generating with our new initiatives, we are confident that we can execute faster to generate higher levels of growth.\nNow, we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. We'll pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Chris Allen with Citi.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nYeah, good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Nice to see you at Solid Spence Controls this quarter. I have a bit of a two-parter. One, on the Mid-X US launch, obviously you see nice volumes to start. Can you talk about the pipeline to add additional dealers there, how it's interacting with PT, whether you're seeing benefits there? The second part, well, you're seeing good uptake in new offerings like Mid-X. As you noted, your overall share gains have been elusive, which is leading to investor frustration. Can you elaborate on your comments in terms of taking action to deliver faster technology enhancements, how you're addressing competition, particularly for your legacy areas of strength, which some are questioning, whether there's been a degradation there, just as you're seeing uptake in new solutions, but overall share is moderated?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGreat. Okay. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, I'll try and get to all those parts of the two-part question. First, on the recent launch of Mid-X, which is our mid-market matching solution, really finally addressing that dealer-to-dealer market that has been growing over the last few years. Now, about 30% of the TRACE market is the dealer-to-dealer market. We obviously have been engaged in dealer-initiated business, particularly using our dealer RFQ, which, as you can see in the numbers, and certainly in October, continues to grow. The dealer-initiated business in October was up 22%. That's really without the full rollout of Mid-X, which only rolled out in late September and still early days. We are excited about those early days, though. As I mentioned in the opening comments, we're now seeing Mid-X run on a daily basis. When it launched, it was running several times a week. We have plans to increase the number of Mid-X sessions. We only run one a day today.\nRight now, we're on track to deliver around $2.7 billion in the month. That's the kind of run rate we're on. We're pretty excited about that, just given it's one session a day and off to a good start. The other important piece of that Mid-X solution is really our relationship with the dealer community, who are a key ingredient to our ecosystem. As you mentioned, it has a relationship to portfolio trading. Really, as dealers enter into portfolio positions, they obviously want to exit those positions in an efficient way. Certainly, the mid-market sessions that are out in the market have been very helpful to the dealer community for exiting that inventory. Unfortunately, some of them were priced at quite higher levels.\nPart of our Mid-X offering is really to cater to the dealer's needs to get out of positions in an efficient way. I think we've struck that balance. It will lead to that lower fee per million for that Mid-X solution. We do want to make sure people understand the connection to that volume being helpful for dealers as part of our broader partnership with the dealer community.\nOn your second question, and a very fair question around just our overall growth, the two areas, obviously, top-line revenue in US credit, and our just overall growth of market share in US credit, really have been largely slower growth than we would like. I think the way to think about what we've been doing in this area is we really made a decision, or I should say I made a decision, to invest in our technology using what I call a portfolio approach. As opposed to investing in a few areas, one or two critical areas, we invested in several critical areas that needed to be addressed. First, there is the overall tech transformation that is underway here at MarketAxess. We've been investing heavily into that tech transformation. At the same time, we had to address the competitive landscape that we sat in, in US credit in particular.\nWe chose to make several investments, not just our tech transformation, but you see us investing in portfolio trading, what we just talked about, the dealer-to-dealer business, where we made sizable investments. We made investments in our Algo Suite or our automation suite. We also made investments in block trading across all of our products. Finally, with the recent news this week, we were also investing in our recent announcement around closing auctions. We made a decision to make a multitude of investments, all tech-heavy investments, to address each of those areas that needed either a competitive dynamic or it was part of our broader tech transformation that's underway. As for the tech transformation, X-Pro has been a key ingredient to that tech transformation. Those are investments that are replacing existing UI technology with new, modern technology. We've also leveraged our Pragma acquisition, and we're using that Pragma acquisition technology, acquired technology for our automation suite, where our legacy automation suite is now migrating to the Pragma technology stack.\nFinally, you're seeing the first elements of the Pragma matching technology being delivered into the closing auctions. Where those investments are working, obviously, our portfolio trading numbers reflect a return on investment. Our dealer-initiated numbers also reflect a return on investment, and automation continues to grow somewhere in 17% in Q3. Those are all up. However, both portfolio trading and dealer-initiated come in at that lower fee per million, so that revenue challenge doesn't overcome the other areas of our core business, and the growth in that core business. The core RFQ business, obviously, has been impacted by what we call the market environment. If you look at the low volatility, very tight spreads, and that we haven't we've been seeing over the last few quarters, it presents challenges to the growth of that traditional all-to-all RFQ platform.\nWe've seen that where we are competing with the phone and with chat, we're seeing block market behavior going direct to dealers. That's some of the overall environmental challenges. Obviously, while we've had block growth, it's been not big enough or not fast enough as we would desire. We continue to make those investments in that block strategy. We are seeing success in our Eurobond and EM products, where the block growth is growing. Where we sit today, I'd say we feel good about the momentum we're seeing in all those initiatives, but we would expect to deliver higher market share growth in the quarters ahead, just given all the investments that we are making and where they are in just being rolled out to the market.\nWe feel pretty good that the investments we are making are yielding results in terms of volume, but we obviously want to have them yield results in terms of revenue. Look, we're not stopping that investment. We have releases going out this weekend that are targeting all of the areas I just talked about. We have the closing auction that we just announced, which is going live this month as well. A lot of areas of investment, some that were required for tech transformation, but most of them were required for the competitive landscape we sit in.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask about the closing auctions and the announcement that you made recently. Can you help us get a sense for just the size of that opportunity, what it could mean for data, what it could mean for your market share, and then how large a piece of the overall credit market do you think that that sort of volume could become over time? Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Patrick. Obviously, a great question, just given how much time we've worked on the closing auction. We were very excited to finally get that news out because it's been a sizable investment for us. It's been really an ongoing strategy over the last four years. We have some really great partners advising us on the project. BlackRock, State Street Alliance, and DWS have just been great partners. There's actually more large investment managers beyond that list that we didn't disclose in the release.\nWe've been working closely with the large investment banks and ETF market makers. They are very key ingredients to, obviously, the liquidity in a closing auction like the one we're designing. We also have worked with the SEC. Our closing auction requires filing with the SEC because it's part of our ATF. Lots of years of work and effort is finally coming to market. We're super excited about that. First, let me tell you what it is not. The closing auction is not a mid-market matching session. The fixed income market has lots of mid-market matching sessions where you match buy and sell interest and just use a price at mid of the market. That's not what we've built. We've built a true auction where buy and sell interest find a clearing price, and that clearing price ends up being where all the trades that are matched execute.\nIt's a very important difference to what is quite popular in the fixed income market. The other key ingredient to an auction is an all-to-all network that is sizable. Just given our position with our all-to-all network, we are able to allow any participant match with any other participant. That's really a key ingredient in any auction and why we felt it was a unique position for us to be in to launch an auction of this size and this magnitude. The most important part of the strategy around this auction and where we spent the most time talking to our client partners is really it's really designed to support the growing indexation of the fixed income market. If you look at our overall global market, it's a $150 trillion market. It's the largest asset class on the planet.\n20% of that market is benchmarked to an index or held within an ETF benchmarked to an index. It's a very large portion. That 20% continues to grow each year. Just within the fixed income ETF market globally, that's now hit $2.7 trillion. It continues to grow and is expected to grow over the next five years to somewhere close to $5 trillion. It is designed to cater to that growing part of the fixed income market. Every index fund needs a closing price, and every ETF needs a NAV to close its fund. What's interesting about the index is that those ETFs and index-based funds are benchmarked against, they tend to have higher turnover than traditional equity indices. We see that on every month end.\nThe month end, really, there's really more new issue in the bond market than there are IPOs in the equity markets globally. You tend to have higher turnover of the index that all this money is benchmarked towards, and that's a really key ingredient. Just to give you some stats, in US investment-grade volumes, the last hour of the last day of the month, 25% of that day's volume is done in that last hour. We're seeing aggregation of activity moving closer to the close. On a normal trading day, we're now seeing almost 15% of total volume now within the last hour of the close as well. There's been a trend line where much of the bond market is moving further and further closer to the closing time of the day. The other key ingredient, other than all-to-all and all-to-all network, is price.\nThe price that we are providing as the closing price has to be relevant to the index funds and the ETF. How do we make that relevant? You'll recall that we entered into a partnership with S&P where we provide our CP+ data feed to S&P to help them input that into their value-added pricing tool. That's been a great partnership with S&P from just a pure data perspective. The key ingredient is S&P also owns some very key indices which are powered by that end-of-day price. One of those key indices is the iBoxx Index, which is what the HYG and LQD is based on, the two iShares ETFs, the two largest ETFs on the planet.\nThat's an important ingredient where our CP+ price is now being delivered to the S&P eval product to help support an evaluated closing price for some very key index funds, but certainly key ETFs as well. As the closing auction rolls out, we will be targeting the more liquid end of both the IG and high-yield market, and looking to form a closing price that powers our CP+ end-of-day price in those bonds. The data piece, as you asked in your question, is a very critical ingredient to the success of the auction itself. We're excited that we've been working on this for several years, and we are excited about all the partnerships that we've established. Certainly, the S&P partnership is a key ingredient.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nExcellent. Thank you, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, hey. Good morning, everyone. Just on the kind of laundry list of new initiatives and some of them that are running a little bit slower, maybe unpack US block trading a little bit more. I know success outside of the US so far. It seems like US block is still very early, but anything you can help us with in terms of timing of more dealer liquidity on those, and, yeah, anything else where we could expect to see some uptake here?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. Thanks, Alex. Certainly, we see the block market as the biggest opportunity in front of this company. It is really, when you think about the overall global fixed income markets, right now, the non-electronic portion of that market globally is far greater than what is already electronic. We see it's rare that you have a company that has a market opportunity that is bigger than the market it sits in today. We're pretty excited about the block opportunity globally, particularly here in the US. Overall, as you saw in some of our numbers, our block growth rates in Q3 across all the products was about 10%. In October, we saw that jump to 21%. We are seeing the block initiatives yield some results. I'd say in US, as you point out, it's not at the levels that we would want. Just to give you some stats, in US IG, in October, we did see it jump to 30% growth. Our block activity in October is up. As you can see in our share, it's up slightly. We'd like it to be up much further.\nI think the key ingredients are really still content. We have made huge inroads in the content that we share with our clients, both in US credit, but certainly in EM and Eurobonds, where we have pretty robust content. We are also constantly delivering new features. We're excited about new offerings rolling out just in another week that will help address some of the key ingredients to block solutions and block trading, where we want our bank partners, our large investment bank partners, to be able to share their AXA content directly with our clients. That's a key ingredient for the block market to take hold. Where we have content, we're seeing success.\nNow we're delivering with the rollout of X-Pro in Europe. We're now delivering just a better workflow for that block trading content in Europe. Certainly, in the US, we're making regular changes to our block solution. We're excited about the coming months and some of the changes that we're delivering.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nFair enough. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays.\n\nChris O'Brien\n\nEquity Research AVP of Brokers, Exchange and Asset Managers, Barclays\n\nGood morning. This is Chris O'Brien on for Ben. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a broader question about the environment. We're seeing continued lower credit spreads, lower volatility. Just curious how you're thinking about growing through this kind of environment if it were to persist, and if there's anything that you could see that would maybe make a meaningful shift in the environment that we've been seeing over the last several months. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. Great question. Certainly, over the last several years, we've seen generally lower volatility, tightening of spreads, and certainly, that has had an impact on some of our core offerings. We did see a return to volatility in the second quarter. We were happy and pleased with that second quarter spike of activity. Much of that was short-lived, and we can see how quickly volatility comes and goes in the marketplace. I'd say in the current month, we are seeing higher levels of volatility. Obviously, you're seeing VIX above 20, and we're seeing spreads widen in the current environment. Certainly, in November, the market is reflecting higher levels of volatility. TRACE is up 46% in investment grade, and it's up about 25% in high yield. We are seeing in the current month activities that would suggest a little bit of unlocking to that lower spread and lower volatility.\nAs you point out, if you'll look at the summer months in the third quarter, there was very little spikes of volatility or volatility activity. Challenging environment, but certainly, both in October and now in November, we're seeing higher levels of volatility and a little bit of spread widening, which makes our all-to-all liquidity that much more attractive.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI would also just add, if you think about market expectations for Fed rate cuts this year, they've remained sort of at the 2 to 3 with a possibility of a third cut in December, having declined a bit as we heard post Powell's remarks last week. There's still a more likely than not probability of a December cut, but perhaps with less conviction. Having said that, the curve is still trending towards a gentle steepening, with the front end staying fairly anchored, the belly largely holding, and the long end remaining sort of sticky.\nIn other words, if you think about short-term yields could fall when the Fed cuts and long-term yields not falling maybe as much, if such a scenario plays out, this should be positive for liquidity, secondary turnover, things like that. You could see more willingness to buy longer duration bonds. I think, as you might have imagined, right, we saw just, for instance, on our platform during the quarter, we saw that the weighted average years to maturity moved up to about 9.1 years from the 8.5-year level we saw the prior quarter. All of that said, as Chris just said, we are seeing some interesting movement in November. Even just in the first few days, we've seen weighted average years to maturity.\nNow, it's only the first few days, so you have to keep that in mind. We did see weighted average years to maturity up to about 10 years, let's call it. There are some other factors to keep in mind as well when you think about the macro environment.\n\nChris O'Brien\n\nEquity Research AVP of Brokers, Exchange and Asset Managers, Barclays\n\nGreat. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Michael [inaudible] with Morgan Stanley.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just continuing with the last question, macro backdrop, clearly moving your way in November, as you just answered with the last question. If that proves short-lived and macro backdrop returns to a bit more challenging backdrop like we've seen for some time, I guess, what's the scope to be turning to higher levels of growth? Which parts of the business do you see as perhaps the most meaningful contributor to that? I know you mentioned some tangible progress on new initiatives, some of which are lower fees. Just curious how you're thinking about that as you look out over the next 12, 18 months.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. Great question. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, a key ingredient to our strategy going forward is being what we call protocol agnostic. We need to deliver protocols that our clients choose at times of high volatility or at times of low volatility. When I think about low-vol environments, the things that tend to stand out in the market are portfolio trading, the dealer-to-dealer mid-market sessions, things like Mid-X, which we've just rolled out. You see higher levels of block activity move into the market where spreads are stable and tight. Our investor clients tend to move back to going direct to dealers. They don't leverage that unique liquidity in the all-to-all marketplace that we run.\nThe key ingredient is providing those protocols seamlessly to our clients, but then using our unique proprietary market data to help them decide which protocol to choose from. It gets complicated to decide whether to do a portfolio trade or to do a list and just go out to all via RFQ. A lot of our data can help traders decide which protocol to use for any given environment. That's kind of the key ingredient of the strategy going forward, that protocol agnostic approach where we can provide things like block trading tools directly to the client, where that client can trade directly with a dealer that has an AXA or has content. More importantly, we can help that client select a dealer based on their activity in the market that we see.\nAll of the key initiatives, the block portfolio trading, and the dealer-to-dealer initiative are really designed for lower-vol environments, whereas our key liquidity solution, the all-to-all network, is certainly robust in the volatility that we're seeing in today's week and the last couple of days.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Simon Clinch with Rothschild.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director of Financials Research, Rothschild\n\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Again, sort of thinking about the market environment, I was wondering, Chris, if you could give us some thoughts around the mix of volumes in credit and just the real reasons why and sustainability for the surge in sort of the size of trades at the block end side and then the sort of shrinking of the size of trades at the other end. Really, what we're seeing month in, month out seems to be a squeezing of the dealer-to-client portion of the market.\nI just wanted to get a sense of, is that just a trend that's going to keep going for you, or do you think that there's a cyclical element here versus? Any thoughts will be useful. Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. It's a great question because certainly the stats that we shared in our slides are unique, where you see the smaller trades get smaller and the larger trades get larger. You don't see that too often across an evolving marketplace. With regard to the smaller trades getting smaller, we are absolutely well-positioned to capture the efficiencies that are required to handle all of those trades and all of those trade sizes. That is clearly driven by, one, portfolio trading. Remember, portfolio trades are big notionally, but each of the line items are quite small.\nPart of the growth of those tickets in the market that we shared is the growth of portfolio trading over the years. The other key ingredient to the growth of the smaller tickets is obviously the growth of SMA in the fixed income market. That's been a real driver of asset allocation among our biggest clients and will continue to be a driver as it collects more and more assets over time. Those are certainly where we see the largest use of our automation tools are coming from clients with very large SMA. We're happy to report that some of our biggest clients are continuing to invest in SMA either through acquisition or just overall investment in their SMA investment. We're expecting the smaller tickets to grow as a percent of the overall TRACE market. We think we're well-positioned.\nThe other reason why we think they'll grow is larger trade sizes are going to be broken into smaller trades. We're already seeing that in our algo suite where clients are taking advantage of our credit algos, where they are able to trade large blocks of 20 in sizes of $1 million or $2 million at a time. That's yielding very good returns in terms of execution quality and reducing information leakage. We have every expectation that the overall TRACE will see more tickets growing. With regard to the block market going through its growth, where those tickets are getting larger, I think that is really when I look up and look at the trend line and the volatility in the market. We've really been at historically low vol and historically tight spreads over the last few years relative to prior market environments.\nI think that has led to block size being a little bit more of an attractive tool in exchanging risk. Dealers are certainly willing to trade that block size and take that risk. Obviously, clients are looking to move a lot of volume at any size they can that's efficient. I do think that we'll end up in a world where when vol returns to a more normal level, those larger blocks get broken up. We will continue to see, like any electronic transformation, the tickets will explode. Large blocks will get broken into smaller size tickets, and that will be the trend line going forward. For both, I think we've positioned ourselves to solve portfolio trading, solve the small ticket automation growth, and obviously, we're trying to solve the block solution as well.\nHopefully, that answers your question.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director of Financials Research, Rothschild\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Josh Smith with William Blair.\n\nJosh Smith\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThere has been a lot of growth in industry share portfolio trading through last year. It seems to have stalled out at around 11% or 12% of credit volumes. You've still been able to grow share nicely, but what do you think is driving that pause? Has that protocol matured, or do you think it can continue to grow?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nIt's a great question because we've been watching that portfolio trading share. Remember, it's a sizable part of the market. It's a key tool for our investors. From a market opportunity, it's quite small from an overall revenue opportunity. Because it's a critical tool for our clients, we continue to invest in it. We're seeing kind of an equilibrium, I call it, in the IG market from a portfolio trading standpoint.\nI know some people predicted it would go to 20%, but it's really, as you point out, has really flatlined anywhere from 10% to 12% of the overall market. However, that said, where we have seen growth is in the high-yield market. That market, even in November, is up closer to 15% of the overall market, whereas just a few years ago, it was closer to 5% and 6% of the overall market. We are seeing a number of our clients using the high-yield portfolio trading tool as a way to access liquidity. What's interesting is, as you point out, in IG, the flatness of the growth is not for lack of dealer liquidity. We have seen more and more dealers move into the dealer space for providing liquidity on portfolio trades.\nThere is ample liquidity in that portfolio trading market to support a higher percentage of the market. I just think the market is quite comfortable at the levels that they are hitting, which is anywhere from 10% to 12%. The only times that we see it spike up is when we see what we call a mega portfolio, something greater than $1 billion in a single portfolio. We have seen those be anywhere from $1 billion to $11 billion in size. Those are obviously rare and just come once in a while. Yeah, I do think we have hit some level of equilibrium in IG, but we are seeing the growth in high yield. Our high-yield market share of the portfolio trading market share has grown dramatically. We have been quite proud.\nWe obviously talk to the dealers a lot about how we're doing in that one asset class. We're certainly in what we call leadership position in high-yield PT right now. We're excited about the investment we've made there and the returns that we're seeing.\n\nJosh Smith\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\n\nRitwik Roy\n\nSenior Equity Research Associate, Jefferies\n\nGood morning. You have Rit Roy on for Dan today, but I'm sure you're going to be excited for a third follow-up to the macro environment. Just on that, we see duration and yield to maturity, at least measured on the bond index, creeping up month to month. Your charts show that as well. I was hoping you could provide an updated outlook on maybe where you think the curve could land from that perspective and maybe the updated impacts to fee per million based on that. Separately, with the expense control that you guys have demonstrated year to date and the reaffirmation of guidance today, I get to kind of an implied sequential increase in Q4 that seems a bit elevated relative to historical seasonal patterns. If you're able to quantify which line items might be driving this increase and if I'm so lucky to get a little bit of insight into 2026, that would be helpful as well. Thank you.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nOkay. Let's unpack your questions. Let me take them in turns. If I start with the macro and the weighted average years to maturity, look, I think I kind of laid out when I spoke before about what we're seeing in the environment in terms of the rate environment and how things could play out in the scenarios depending on where we end up with a rate cut.\nI did talk about how we're currently—remember, we're talking four trading days here, so we've got to understand that we've got to see where this lands. We're seeing about 10 years weighted average years to maturity on the platform. In terms of yields, we actually saw yields out a little bit, although still insignificantly from the prior year time period. I think we're going to have to wait and see how that goes. I think you guys all remember the sensitivities at this point in terms of where high-grade duration helps us when it comes to yield. If you're 100 basis points in terms of yield, we can see that adding, call it, $3 to $5 on the fee per million in high grade.\nObviously, we've talked about this as well, but one year out on weighted average years to maturity could be worth about, let's call it, $15 more or less. Those sensitivities still hold within high grade. Obviously, there are lots of puts and takes, and we have to look all in at the credit fee per million and the different protocols and what's happening. That kind of gives you a sense for how to think about the high-grade duration piece of this.\nNow, let me take your expense question. It's a good question. I think that we obviously—you heard me continue to guide to the low end of approximately $505 to 525 on a GAAP basis. If you think about the progression of expenses, that, to your point, would imply a fourth-quarter expense level of around, let's call it, $134 million with an incremental $10 to 12 million flowing through the next quarter. This $10 to 12 million increase in the fourth-quarter expense relative to Q3 is really driven by items such as depreciation, technology, the impact from hires, as well as some timing-related expenses that haven't yet come through the panel. I think we need to take a step back and really look at the expenses for the year. I'd remind you that we took management actions in the beginning of the year. Those were to drive productivity, and we really wanted to do that through the expense base in a sustainable way. Those actions reduced our full-year expenses by an expected $17 million.\nThose included things like vendor management, vendor consolidation, role eliminations, and really better aligning our resources to the strategic initiative that you heard Chris talk about earlier in this call. Now, those actions that we took allowed us to self-fund to the tune of about $16 million of those investments in our technology, our products, our key strategic hires that we've made throughout the year. That's really how I would think about overall how we continue to really manage a disciplined expense base. We're really being mindful of the environment that we're in and, at the same time, self-funding our really important investments.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Eli Abboud with Bank of America.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig into your growth in open trading. It looks like Open Trading ticked up to 39% of your credit volume in October, which is the highest level since the regional bank crisis. Usually, I know this is a protocol that does well on the volatile backdrop, but volatility was up pretty modestly in October, certainly not on par with the levels during the regional bank crisis and April's tariff disputes. What can you share to help us make sense of the stronger Open Trading adoption lately?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.",
    "content2": "Yeah, great question. Obviously, Open Trading certainly in lower vol environments have not had the level penetration that we would prefer. Certainly, in October, we saw Open Trading move up just from September from 30% up to 34 and change. While there were spikes of volatility, as you point out, in October, it was quite muted across the month. I think one key ingredient that we've been adding to our Open Trading liquidity is new sources of liquidity. It's coming in two forms. One, we continue to add systematic hedge funds to the platform. They certainly enjoy the benefits of all-to-all, where they can price other clients' bond requests on RFQ. We've also seen a number of very large investment managers take advantage of all-to-all as well, where they are providing responses to other investors' requests for price. That's actually a fairly new phenomenon here.\nUsually, we try to provide things like our algo suite or our autoresponder to traditional buy-side clients, but we've seen one or two buy-side clients make sizable investments in their own automation tools. We're starting to see that behavior help support the liquidity even when there's lower volatility in our OT marketplace. We also saw where we see higher penetration is in high yield. We also saw that tick up in October, up as high as 43% of that market is our Open Trading liquidity source. Again, it's part of a longer investment of both helping large investment managers use tools to provide liquidity. It's also the new entrants into the market that are creating unique liquidity opportunities that's increasing our overall Open Trading penetration.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The electronification of high-yield corporate bond trading isn't as far along as investment grade, but it's also seen share gains stall out by you as well as other platforms. What are some of the unique challenges to growing electronic market share in high yield?\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nGreat question. Obviously, by nature of the high-yield market, one key ingredient is liquidity. Our clients come to us and talk about the challenges of liquidity in high yield. Obviously, when there is volatility, our high-yield all-to-all provides that liquidity and certainly jumps in terms of market share. Really, the key complaint that we hear from clients in the high-yield market is just a lack of liquidity, sorry, in that market. The other challenging in the high-yield market is information leakage. If you're in a position and you're looking to move that position, you want to be very careful how that information is shared to move that position. Picking the right bank or the right counterparty to seek that liquidity is a critical ingredient.\nWe spend a lot of time on the high-yield block trading solution and high-yield dealer content to provide our clients with that unique information, so they can actually reduce information leakage by increasing the likelihood of being filled when they reach out to a dealer. We also have developed an AI tool where we help with using AI to select dealers that are more likely to respond to your request for price. Those are key ingredients that we see being deployed in that market. The other unique fact that we're seeing play out this summer and continuing into November is the growth of portfolio trading in the high-yield market. That's a new fact that we didn't see in prior years. We've also seen it play out in higher times of volatility. Normally, portfolio trading tends to move further down as a tool when there's high volatility.\nUniquely, high yield has recently been a tool that our clients are turning to even in heightened volatility as a way and a source to get liquidity. I think, obviously, the ETF market and having a very liquid high-yield ETF market is supporting the liquidity that we're seeing in the portfolio market as well. I would say that we are seeing growth in the E part of the high-yield market. It's coming in the form of that portfolio trading tools.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nManaging Director, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Rothschild.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director of Financials Research, Rothschild\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for the follow-up. Chris, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the competitive environment as well. You were just talking about portfolio trading, and we know that there's been more competition in that space, and that's kind of reduced the revenue pool in PT. Are we seeing any other sort of incremental changes elsewhere that would ultimately affect the overall revenue pools in other protocols or other parts of the market?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nObviously, if you look at our fee per million, it's largely been a result of the mix. The two areas where we run lower fee per million is, obviously, as you mentioned, the portfolio trading area, and that's an area of growth for us. We actually came from behind and certainly are growing against a pretty fierce competition. Certainly, the dealer-to-dealer space, which, as I mentioned earlier, is a very large part of the market. Thirty percent of the market is dealer-to-dealer, and it's an area that we really underinvested in that one area and made a decision to support the dealer community with better tools for exiting inventory.\nOur growth in the dealer-to-dealer segment of the market certainly comes at a lower fee per million, but it's all incremental revenue. The launch of our Mid-X matching solution is brand new. It's certainly early days, but that's at a lower fee per million, but it's all new revenue to the MarketAxess top line. We're excited to see the early days of growth and a way to address the market as we proceed. When we look internationally, obviously, the EM market is quite exciting for us. We've seen sizable growth across LATAM, APAC, and we continue to see that growth. We've launched India just recently, so we're excited about adding additional product to that overall market. We feel very good from a competitive standpoint in that market.\nWe have certainly years of investment and many, many sales visits to grow that market and add clients to that market. Obviously, our all-to-all network is a sizable portion of that market, close to 40% of the liquidity in that market. We're seeing consistent quarter-over-quarter growth in the EM market. We're quite pleased with the competitive landscape there. I'm also happy that we have a portfolio trading tool that is being adopted by clients in EM, and we've launched a Mid-X for EM as well. We've tried to address all the areas where we've seen competition move into the market, and we'll continue to do that as we invest in that EM business because it's a sizable business for us. If you look at the overall EM market, it's about the same size as US credit.\nIt's a very exciting market to be certainly positioned where we are in that market.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Chris for any closing remarks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, everybody, and we look forward to talking to you in the new year about our fourth quarter. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 6 August 2025. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess second quarter 2025 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with an update on our strategy and our trading businesses. Ilene Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2024. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our record second quarter 2025 financial results. These strong results, as shown on slide three of my strategic update, reflect a very strong operating environment and the progress we have made to transform our model to be more protocol agnostic, expand our addressable market, and drive growth. We are delivering multiple protocols to solve our clients' different execution needs, and we are giving them the automation workflow tools that they need to do more with less. We delivered record automation volume and trade count with a record number of active clients during a period of increased volatility, and to accelerate our delivery of product enhancements and automation tools, we have made several important strategic hires over the last several months, including Dean Berry and Spencer Lee, both of whom will be integral to driving growth.Now turning to our results in terms of revenue generation, we are very pleased with our execution in the quarter, delivering 10% revenue growth excluding the impact of FX. We generated these strong results on record trading volume across most product areas, surpassing one trillion dollars in total credit trading volume for the first time and delivering a record two trillion dollars in total rates trading volume, which drove a 12% increase in commission revenue to a record $192 million. We continued to deliver strong performance in our US government bond business over the last several months. We saw a benefit from the spike in volatility around tariffs, but we are also seeing strength driven by our new hedging services, new customers driving incremental revenue, and institutional client adoption of our rates algorithm, which now represents over 10% of our trading volume.\nWe are in the process of expanding our RFQ business, and we are looking to continue to enhance our rates algo solution as large asset managers continue to request enhancements. Underpinning these results was strong progress with our new initiatives across our three strategic channels. In the client-initiated channel, we generated 38% growth in block trading ADV across US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds. In the portfolio trading channel, we generated a 69% increase in total portfolio trading ADV, and last, in the dealer-initiated channel, we generated a 40% increase in dealer-initiated ADV. In terms of expenses, we continue to show cost discipline, with expenses up only five percent, excluding notables and FX, as we continue to invest in the platform with a full slate of product deliveries coming in the next couple of quarters.Last on the capital front, we have been more opportunistic with our share repurchases as we move beyond just offsetting dilution from stock-based compensation. Before I get into our results, I would like to address our July US high grade market share. While we are disappointed with the headline share, there have been significant swings in block volume moving between phone and electronic over the last several quarters. This has both helped and hurt us. We believe that this has been driven in part by the macro environment. In July, investment grade spreads tightened significantly, and the combination of tighter spreads and low volatility generally translates into more large trades getting done over the phone and an uptick in portfolio trading. Block trades equal to or larger than five million dollars in size increased dramatically and represented 47% of the entire market in July, up from 42% in June.\nAdditionally, our share of this market dropped to 10%, down from 12% in June, and the bad news is that those large blocks move to the phone and to chat. The good news is that this is the very market that we're attacking with the recent launch of our High Touch strategy in US credit on X-PRO. It's still early days, but it's the part of the market that we've been talking about targeting for some time, and we believe we will be successful in electronifying this segment of the market. Slide four, five, and six update you on how we are executing across the three strategic channels we are focused on to grow our market share.As slide five clearly shows, the key performance indicators across our platform are all green this quarter, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of our business, as well as the strong progress we are making with our new initiatives. Turning to slide six, in the client-initiated channel, we made strong progress with block trading, with our targeted block solution now rolled out in emerging markets and Eurobonds, and recently launched in US credit. This is one of the most exciting areas of growth for us because we are delivering a click-to-trade solution where the trade is against a dealer axe or an indication of interest, and the trade goes direct to the dealer without information leakage. This is also the largest segment of the market that remains largely phone based. We've registered record total block trading ADV of over five billion dollars across US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds.\nOur share of blocks in US high grade was a record 12.5%, representing an increase of almost 200 basis points, and was a key driver of the year-over-year increase in our estimated market share in US high grade. Our cumulative block trading volume since the launch of our targeted block trading solution in US credit, emerging markets, and Eurobonds was approximately eight billion dollars through July 2025. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, which is a very important part of the market, we generated record levels of total portfolio trading ADV, with a strong increase in US high grade estimated market share on record ADV, as well as record ADV in US high yield and Eurobonds. US high grade portfolio trading market share was over 19% in the quarter, up 370 basis points over the prior year.Last in the dealer-initiated channel, we are beginning to see progress as we prepare to launch a new Midex solution in September. In US credit dealer RFQ, ADV was $1.6 billion, with record ADV in municipal bonds. Midex total volume hit a new quarterly record of over $9 billion, with record volume in emerging markets and Eurobonds. We are very excited about the launch of our new Midex solution in a few weeks. It's a very streamlined midpoint matching solution for dealers using our award-winning CP+ for pricing. Slide seven highlights the strong growth in our international product areas, where we are executing across all three strategic channels. The strong growth that we generated across emerging markets and Eurobonds was driven by multiple levers at different stages of growth, with different fee profiles.\nGrowth across block trading, portfolio trading, and dealer-initiated activity drove our total volume growth to over 20%, and this strong increase in trading volumes on robust market volumes and share gains was accompanied by a small three percentdecline in fee capture, principally driven by protocol mix, delivering commission revenue growth of 17%. We believe that our global presence in EM local markets, as shown on slide eight, will be a key driver of our future growth. The opportunity with local EM markets is enormous, as indicated on the right side of the slide, with 85% of the EM market made up of local currency corporates and sovereigns compared to just 15% hard currency corporates and sovereigns, and the estimated ADVs for both hard currency and local markets combined are greater than the ADVs for US credit markets.Our estimate is that most local market trades take place with onshore clients, while only a small percentage of our trades are taking place with onshore clients. We believe that this is a large growth opportunity for us. We are also focused on facilitating global investing in local markets. As you saw with our press release last week, we just recently executed the first Indian government bond trade electronically. MarketAxess is the first fully electronic trading solution for foreign portfolio investors, and this launch further deepens our global EM franchise. I would like to thank our clients BlackRock and Standard Chartered for their support in executing the first trade. In summary, we are pleased with our execution in the second quarter, where we benefited from a very supportive market backdrop and delivered strong growth across our new initiatives.The July share numbers in US high grade were disappointing, but we believe that the solution we are bringing to the market will be successful, and we now have the right team in place to help us accelerate growth in the coming quarters. Now let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financials.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. Turning to our results on Slide 10, we provide a summary of our second quarter financials. We delivered 11% revenue growth to a record $219 million, which includes a two million dollars benefit from foreign currency fluctuations. Excluding the impact of FX, revenue growth was 10%. We reported an 11% increase in diluted earnings per share to $1.91, or $2.00 per share excluding notable items, representing an increase of 16%. Notable items in the quarter included $4 million, or $0.08 per share, in repositioning charges in our expenses in the employee compensation and benefits line, and a $600,000, or $0.01 per share, acquisition-related charge included in other income. My comments on our results from this point forward will largely exclude the impact of notable items and will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn, commission revenue increased 12% to a record $192 million, driven by strong market volumes on an increase in volatility in the quarter, as well as the strong progress we have made with our new initiatives in 2025 across our three strategic channels. Just over 50% of the incremental $20 million in revenue generated in Q2 2025 versus Q2 2024 was from block trading, portfolio trading, and dealer-initiated activity. Services revenue increased seven percent to a record $28 million. Information services revenue of $13 million increased four percent. Info services growth was 1% excluding the impact of FX. Growth in the quarter was lower due to data deals that were pushed to the second half of 2025, but the pipeline remained strong, with demand increasing from systematic funds and dealers.\nPost-trade services revenue of $11 million increased seven percent versus the prior year, or one percent excluding the impact of FDX. Here too, we see a healthy pipeline of new contracts and expect pricing increases in the second half of the year. Technology services revenue of four million dollars increased 16%, driven by higher license and connectivity fees, and the addition of RFQ Hub. Total other income increased approximately $1,000,000, driven by an increase in FX gains of approximately $2,000,000 in the current quarter, partially offset by lower interest income. For modeling purposes, with the closing of RFQ Hub in mid-May and consolidation of their revenues and expenses, the earnings of unconsolidated affiliate line will go away in Q3. There is a performance incentive plan underway with our non-controlling shareholders, which had a non-cash impact of approximately $900,000 in the current quarter.In other net, the effective tax rate was 26.9%, up from 24.8% in the prior year, reflecting the increased accrual for the uncertain tax position reserve we established in Q1 2025. On slide 11, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue increased 12% to a record $192 million. We experienced 12% growth in credit variable commission revenue, with US credit up 10%, record emerging markets of 17%, and record Eurobonds up 19%. These strong results were driven by market buying strength and progress with our new initiatives, partially offset by lower fee per million. The reduction in total credit fee capture year over year was principally due to protocol mix. On slide 12, we provide a summary of our operating expenses excluding notable items. Second quarter operating expenses of $124 million increased six percent compared to the prior year, five percent excluding FX.\nThe increase in expenses was driven principally by higher employee compensation and technology and communication costs, as we continue to strike the right balance between investing to drive future growth and continuing to drive increased efficiency. Higher employee comp and benefits was driven by the strategic hires we have made over the last several months that we expect to help drive our growth, as well as higher variable incentive compensation driven by the strong increase in revenue in the quarter. Headcount was 881, up only two percent from 864 in the prior year and up one percent from 870. At the end of Q1 2025, we are reconfirming our full year 2025 expense guidance and expect to be at the low end of the previously stated expense range of $501 million to 521 million on an ex notables non-GAAP basis, or on a GAAP basis $505 million to 525 million. On slide 13, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and corporate bond and US Treasury investment totaling $621 million as of 30 June, down from $699 million at the end of 2024. We generated $360 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of five percent over last quarter. We repurchased 380,000 shares year to date through July 2025 for a total of $80 million, including 168,000 shares repurchased during the second quarter at a cost of $37 million. As of 31 July 2025, $145 million remains on the Board's share repurchase authorization. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth, while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Ilene. In summary, on slide 14, we made solid progress with the key new initiatives that will drive improved market share in US credit in the remaining quarters of 2025. We are continuing to increase the pace of innovation and execution, and we will continue to enhance our delivery of new product enhancements in the coming months. We are pleased with the performance of the platform in the quarter, which benefited from a more favorable macro environment, and our new initiatives, which provided over half of our incremental revenue in the quarter. The launch of our targeted block trading solution drove record levels of block trading across US high grade, emerging markets, and Eurobonds. We delivered record portfolio trading ADV, and our market share in US credit portfolio trading increased 240 basis points. Forty percent growth in dealer-initiated ADV reflects our increasing focus on this important channel.We generated record Midex volumes in emerging markets and Eurobonds, and we look forward to the launch of Midex for US credit in September. We have made several very important strategic hires over the last several months, including Dean Berry and Spencer Lee, that will be integral to driving future growth. In summary, we expect to drive growth, namely in US credit, in the coming quarters through continued progress across the client-initiated portfolio trading and dealer-initiated channels, combined with our expanded leadership team. Now we would be happy to open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press Star then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please limit to just one question per caller, and then rejoin the queue by pressing Star then the number one for any follow up questions. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nSenior Vice President, Citi\n\nYeah, morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to see if you could give some more details on the progress again on the new initiatives. Maybe some color just in terms of where you are from client penetration, adoption perspective, then the outlook you just mentioned for the rest of the year, and if you could help us reconcile the progress you've made, the momentum we saw in Q2 versus July specifically in market share US high grade, that'd be helpful as well. Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, first of all, we, you know, at the beginning of the year, we promised the market that we were going to focus on really three key areas: the client-initiated area, particularly portfolio trading, the dealer-to-dealer business, and block trade. As of July, year to date, our IGPT business is up 47%. Our market share in portfolio trading is up 340 basis points. Year to date, our investment grade dealer business is up 42%, and our market share in the dealer-to-dealer business is up 100 basis points. That's our promise. Also, we're launching Midex in September. That's without a mid market matching solution in the dealer-to-dealer business in high yield. Year to date, our portfolio trading business is up 42%, and our market share in high yield portfolio trading is up 100 basis points. We're showing growth year to date across all of those segments. Most exciting is around our block activity. We're seeing growth across the markets that we've launched our block solution in, Eurobonds, emerging markets, and obviously US Credit as well. Year to date, our block activity is up over 20%, and our block share has increased as a result of those solutions in that market. Across the three initiatives, we are delivering outsized performance, and we're pretty excited about what's to come in those three areas. You know, we are also excited about this Midex launch for US Credit. We do think that will have an impact on our dealer to dealer growth rates as a result, and that is due to go live in September. I'm also excited about our block trading solution in investment grade and in high yield.\nIt's really just been recently launched to a number of users, and we're expanding that user base in the coming weeks as we onboard more dealer content. You know, all of this initiative was also while we were upgrading our technology. We're seeing further rollout of that new tech into Europe, with X-PRO going live in Europe just this month. We have some exciting new features rolling out in the coming months in our portfolio trading platform as well. Certainly, year to date progress that we're excited about those three initiatives. With regard to July, I certainly would like to cover the July market share numbers, particularly in IG. July was a very similar market dynamic that we saw in February of this year, with exceptionally narrow spreads and quite low volatility.When we see that kind of market dynamic, we typically see a pickup in portfolio trading and mid market matching solutions in the market. Certainly, portfolio trading volumes did go up in July and rose to 13% of the overall market. What's interesting is we tend to see a pickup in the mid market matching solutions as dealers kind of recycle that higher PT volume into those mid matching, midpoint matching solutions. They tend to exit that risk using those midpoint matching solutions. We did see some progress in the overall market in blocks. Really, the number one competitor in July that we saw was phone and chat. We saw the phone and chat block market grow, as we mentioned on the opening remarks, 400 basis points to 47% market share. That's a sizable increase that we saw in that block market that typically tends to be on phone and chat. As you've seen in our numbers, we are addressing that very market share, that block market in particular, and showing some promise with the rollout of our block solution in both Eurobonds and EM, and obviously finishing that here in US high grade. Not a great month for us, but one month doesn't really make a quarter or a year. Obviously, we saw a certain market dynamic in July that is much more favorable to large pts or sizable portfolio trades in July. Really, that mid market matching solutions tend to do quite well in a stable, low volume environment.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, the next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nDirector, Piper Sandler\n\nYes, good morning. Thanks for taking the question, Chris. I was hoping you could just update us or maybe just elaborate on some of the drivers of the fee per million decline in the quarter. It didn't fall too much sequentially, but it was the lowest it's been in a few years. Just wondering kind of what the drivers were there and what your expectations are going forward. It looks like it popped up a little bit in the month of July. Any color on fee per million would be great. Thanks.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nHey Patrick, it's Eileen. Thanks for the question. I think this is probably not a surprise, right? If you look at what the drivers have really been for us in terms of fee per million recently, it's sort of the same as you've heard from us in the past. As you noted for the month, we saw it pop up a little bit in terms of the sort of 25 July versus 25 June. That was really due to what we were seeing in terms of high grade duration. We saw that move out to about 8.9 years, and that was obviously a benefit. That actually offset what we saw in portfolio trading, which was, as Chris mentioned, we saw an increase in PT volumes. That actually goes the other way, right?Think of that as like four dollar, you know, sort of in the positive column and then two dollar offset because we saw additional PT volumes. When you think about it from the year over year perspective from the quarter that you asked about, and this is also true, but on a smaller level in terms of the quarter over quarter for the quarter, it's really more than about, you know, again, it's new protocols, right? When we see that we have more PT coming through, in particular, you're going to see that that puts some pressure on fee per million. Now we know, and as we just saw in July, that when high grade moves out, when duration moves out, that's a good guy, and that can help us. The moves you saw really were based on sort of protocol, you know, and product mix within what we were seeing have happening.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, the next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director, UBS\n\nYes. Hey, good morning everyone. Chris, you gave a pretty big laundry list of the initiatives earlier to Chris Allen's question. Would love for you to give a little bit more detail on the US blocks. I know it's early, but I know it's also your biggest initiative for the year. I think you said some pretty, again, timelines and how quickly you want to see really traction. Maybe learnings from EM and Eurobonds that are translating into that, perhaps. Yeah, how should we be thinking about the timelines to really make an impact on your market share here?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Unfortunately, part of your question broke up a little bit, but I'm excited to talk about block activity. I think that was certainly at the heart of the question. First, we're very excited with the success we're seeing in both emerging markets, as well as Eurobonds, from a block perspective. As I mentioned, our block volume year to date is up over 20%. More importantly, in Q2, we saw sizable performance in block trading. It increased just in IG, 40%, and we actually picked up block market share, hit as high as 12.5% in the quarter. Certainly exciting to see that in our US investment grade offering. In the offering in EM and Eurobonds, we continue to see success in blocks. Our EM block volume was up 27% in Q2, and we saw $1.6 billion in EM block trades in Q2. Certainly it's having an impact. We're seeing trader behavior changes, and that's exciting when you roll out a block solution because, again, we always point out the other 50% of the market is largely blocks across the credit market. Being able to show that we have launched an offering and are finally cracking into that phone and chat market is truly exciting. We also are seeing further progress. I think some of our best progress is in Eurobonds in blocks, where we continue to grow market share. As a result of blocks, our block volume just in July alone was up 54% in Eurobonds.\nWe're having a really positive reaction from the market in that block volume across both EM and Eurobonds in the US. Moving to your question, around investment grade and high yield, we are seeing clients enjoying the benefits of having that block tool. It's still early days in terms of what we rolled out in the US. We are planning on having more dealer content come into that market. We're working with dealers closely across the US credit market. It's a key ingredient to have that dealer content in order to attract a block trade solution. Exciting for the progress and excited about what's to come. I look at where we have very strong dealer content in EM and Eurobonds has really led to the success of the block tool. I expect similar outcomes from our client traders when they see the content become more robust in US credit. Exceptional performance where we have that content, and very excited about overall progress in the US.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Maybe just digging a little more on the blocks if I could. Just on Europe to start, sounds like great success there. You were just talking about with the growth. Just curious how much of that you attribute to the new blocks solution. If you could maybe elaborate on what adoption looks like. There's, and in the US it sounds like it's early days. You mentioned you're rolling out, you're continuing to roll it out. Can you just elaborate on your sort of expectations around the pace of the rollout in the coming months and quarters, the steps you're taking to broaden adoption, how you're looking to gauge early traction, and what might success look like in the US with this new high touch solution into year end and in 2026.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Again, on the block side, you know, our progress in Eurobonds in particular was certainly heavily driven by our block trading pickup. As I mentioned, in the quarter, block trading grew 31%, so we're seeing that. Here in July in Eurobonds, our block trading grew an additional 34%. We're certainly seeing that impact, and it's really partly because of the content that we have on the platform. In Eurobonds, where we probably have most of the enriched dealer content on the platform when it comes to EM, we also are seeing that same growth rate in EM. Again, the EM blocks have been driven partially by our new targeted solution, but also by the willingness of clients to use our all-to-all Open Trading for block size liquidity. Part of the growth has been a client's change in behavior to put large size orders, particularly in EM local markets, into our platform to access that unique liquidity and the all-to-all solution. With regard to the rollout here in the US, it's only been a handful of traders that we've rolled the solution out. We plan to increase that number in the coming weeks as we continue to onboard dealer content. You know, it's an important part of the market. You know, as I think about how we've addressed the market historically, we've really addressed the market clients' needs when they have an identified set of bonds and they come to market and request price. That's been the traditional means of adoption of electronic trading.\nWhat's exciting about this new part of the market, it's where dealers are really pushing their content or their inventory into clients. Clients make decisions about selection of bonds as a result of that inventory being pushed to them. This is a part of the market that we have historically not engaged in. It's really opening up two things. One, a much better relationship with our dealer community, and two, it's really getting into areas for investors to see content in a more efficient way than over chat or phone, and really ingest that content to impact their portfolio selection. That's something new for us, something that's been rolled out here. It's an exciting part of the market because largely the block market, particularly in US investment grade, is driven by this inventory push out to clients. It's exciting to finally be tapped into that part of the market and pushing dealer inventory or dealer axes into the hands of investors.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director, Financials Research, Redburn\n\nThanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we could just look at the PT market for a second because your comments around how PT tends to sort of pull back in times of, or tends to thrive in terms of, low volume. I used to think the reverse was the case as well. We have seen PT penetration in both US credit, in high grade and high yield, just continually rise this year, even through some pretty ropey periods in the market. I was wondering if you could talk about how you're seeing your clients use PT differently. Could this be a much bigger part of the market than we initially perceived maybe a year or two ago? Love your thoughts on that. Please. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Well, there's definitely a pattern that we've seen. The majority of the pattern is during times of low volume, even intraday low volume or weekly low volume, higher use of PT. It's easier for dealers to price a PT. It's certainly easier for clients to evaluate PT pricing. There's definitely a trend. You do point out correctly, in some of the high volatility months of the second quarter we did see clients make use of portfolio trading, particularly in high yield, where they were obviously attracted by the liquidity and the ability to move, you know, large notional sums of bonds. We did see, ironically, the pickup in PT in high yield during some volatile times. I think that was largely driven by, you know, demand for cash by a number of the clients. The continued use of PT is obviously an important part of the market. We've certainly been growing our PT market share as a result of rolling out new portfolio trading solutions, and we'll continue to address that part of the market because it's such an important market share driver. There has been a number of very large size portfolio trades in the month of July, large being over one billion dollars. We've seen those portfolio trades be on platform but also be off platform. There's still a number of, in these market environments, higher levels of clients coming to market with PT. There's obviously some very outsized PT trades that we've seen in the market from month to month happen, you know, somewhere in the size of four to five billion in PT sizes. Again, we remind everyone the market opportunity in PT is quite small relative to the bigger part of the market. We think it's, you know, in the zone of $50 million in US IG in terms of revenue. You know, you know, these are priced at very low rates, and they're really facilitation trading solutions for clients. Exciting about market share movement in PT, but again, very low revenue opportunities in the overall PT market.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director, Financials Research, Redburn\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from Benjamin Fernadez at Barclays, please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Fernandez\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Chris, in your prepared remarks you talked about a number of new strategic hires. I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit. What are these individuals tasked with doing? What are their primary KPIs you're going to be measuring? How do you think they'll be moving the needle? If you're successful in these hires, when do you think that might translate into results? Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Again, very excited about our new hires, some that have started and some are due to start in the coming months. Spencer Lee is really overseeing all of our product in the US credit market. It's exciting to see the impact he's already had on our products, our product priorities, and organizing our efforts around portfolio trading solutions. He certainly has a known brand among our clients and a known brand among the dealer community. He has been building out solutions for really larger trade sizes in his prior role. We are excited about his input and his knowledge around our block trading solution and expect him to obviously focus on portfolio trading, block trading, and our dealer solutions in the coming months. Dean Berry will be joining in late September. We're excited about his entry to MarketAxess. He has a breadth of knowledge across markets, data, and analytics, and certainly skilled in M&A as well. We're excited about Dean joining us in the coming month.\n\nBenjamin Fernandez\n\nManaging Director, Barclays\n\nOkay, great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, Equity Research, KBW\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe I could just ask a question on the muni business. I still know it's still small, obviously, but can you just kind of update us on market share progress? What else do you need to do in terms of capability or new product rollout to kind of find the next leg of market share growth there, and then anything you can also share just regarding some of the movement on kind of implied fee capture within that bucket and how you expect that to perform, progress moving forward?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Look, we're very excited about our muni business. The year-over-year growth in munis has been exciting. Certainly, the Q2 activity that we just published has been up quite dramatically. Our overall ADV, we hit records in Q2, our market volume was up 23%. What's exciting about Q2 and current performance is a lot of that growth has been driven by our tax-exempt business, which is a very unique part of the business. Within the tax-exempt business, we were up 34% in terms of record volume. Here in July, which was a much lighter month for the muni market, we were up 12% in our tax-exempt business. We continue to see excitement around electronification of the muni market. We've rolled out portfolio trading to our muni market investors, which is an important tool for them. A key component to that muni market is also our all-to-all solution, where clients are able to access unique liquidity across that muni market. We continue to make investments in the muni market. Our most recent investment was our CP+ for Munis. The feedback on that data feed is quite exciting. Certainly, in the second quarter, clients noted that our CP+ for Munis outperformed the other real-time market data solutions in the muni market. We see further adoption as a result of that data and its performance in the market. Overall, pretty excited about our muni business. Our fee per million actually in July was up as a result of the activities across that market. We are certainly happy about the direction of travel of fee per million overall.We also have a sizable dealer business in the muni market as well, and seeing that grow not only in the second quarter but also here in July, it grew about 38%. Overall, pleased with the muni progress we've made year to date and year over year. July was obviously a slow month from an overall secondary market turnover for us, but certainly an exciting progress across those initiatives that we continue to talk about.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey everyone, good morning. This is actually Aditya filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking our questions. Appreciate all the updates on block trading. PT was hoping to just talk about the firm's capital return priorities and importantly where M and A stacks up in the mix.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Happy to discuss that. I think as you know, market equity over time has always really been driven by and focused a lot on the organic opportunity ahead of us, which we know, we still think is really quite, quite significant. If you think about the priorities and our capital priorities, you know, at the same time you've also seen us, and we talked about this a bit in the prepared remarks, you've also seen us doing more share repurchases and being really opportunistic in that space as well. At the same time you've also seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions. Right. You saw Pragma, obviously, which we've talked about. We in the past, you know, did muni brokers, and we just had a discussion about our muni business. We had the LQA Rates acquisition, and then obviously most recently RFQ Hub.You've seen us do a number of bolt-on acquisitions. I would actually talk about our capital priorities exactly in the way that I just described them to you, which is first investing organically to really capture that market opportunity we have in the global fixed income market, continuing to return capital to investors through dividends, and more opportunistic share repurchases as you've seen us do. I would say bolt-on acquisitions like I just discussed.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nI would just add, obviously, as Eileen mentioned, our organic opportunity is quite large, quite attractive, and certainly high accretion. As a result, our balance sheet is positioned certainly attractively to engage in M&A. With the more recent executive changes here at MarketAxess, we also have executive level capacity to engage in M&A. I'm excited about our opportunity to look at the market with a fresh balance sheet and a fresh set of eyes looking for opportunities in the M&A market.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you dig more into your performance in Europe? It looks like volumes are up 21% year to date. I know part of that is from a larger pie, but it also seems like there's been some pretty good share gains lately. What's driving those share gains? Who's it coming from? Are there any particular protocols or customer channels that have been particularly strong?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks for that question. The Eurobond market has been a very exciting market in 2025. Overall market activity has continued to grow. Our investor base is quite exciting, and certainly adopting a number of our new initiatives. Our block trading in the second quarter was up sizably. Our portfolio trading was also up dramatically in the second quarter, and just in July alone, our PT volume was up 64%. We're delivering on all of those initiatives. Block, portfolio trading, and the dealer initiative and client adoption is high. We're seeing outsized growth rates in those markets and market share increases. Eurobonds happens to be a place where we have a robust block solution with all the dealer content. We have a number of key investors using that solution. We have a robust portfolio trading tool with lots of analytics and pre-trade analysis for traders to use our portfolio trading tool, and then our dealer business, with the full rollout of Midex across the Eurobond business, we're seeing growth rates there in the dealer business as well. It's really where we're firing on all three initiatives that we're seeing that very attractive growth rate across the Eurobond business.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon [Managing Director\n\nResearch Analyst] (Jefferies)\n\nThanks.Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the previous question around the hires and management changes. Just curious if you're done with that process, if there are more to go, and the team that you have together is the one that you think can execute upon the goals you've outlined for this year and beyond.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks for the question. Super excited about the team we have, and with Dean's arrival, the team will have as early as late September, so excited about what that capacity brings certainly to our product knowledge and the practical knowledge of the product team. Spencer Lee came from an EMS, and as I've mentioned on these calls before, as we expand our protocols and become more protocol agnostic, we look and feel more like an EMS to our clients. That's a key ingredient, and a key skill set that he brings. He also sat in the desk of a trader, so he has that buy side trader knowledge that he brings to MarketAxess, and those two components are very exciting for our product knowledge and what we're able to put out in terms of product to our investor clients. Dean obviously has a breadth of international experience, a breadth of large P&L management experience, M&A experience, and obviously product and data analytics experience. Again, really helpful entries to MarketAxess as we kind of move on to our kind of next journey in this market and ATT and ck. What I'm most excited about is really that large dealer-to-client block trade market, and having, you know, the additional help across the globe is going to be quite exciting here in the coming months.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, the final question for today comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking the follow up question here. Just wanted to ask about portfolio trading in the month of July, and I know it's just a month, I don't want to overemphasize. Just curious what was driving the decline year on year in US credit portfolio trading share. I think that was down about 160 basis points to around 15.6% US credit PT share. I'm just curious what macro environment might we see your PT share expand. Maybe talk about some of the initiative steps you can take to drive that meaningfully higher, and then over time, what might success look like for you in portfolio trading and US credit.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, great question. Obviously we've been investing in our portfolio trading tools for some time, and as I mentioned, we are very excited about the progress we've made year to date in portfolio trading. Certainly, portfolio trading swings can be very client specific. We've seen clients come to market with very large portfolio trades not regularly, but once a quarter. It really is client specific, and that can have a meaningful impact on your market share. Obviously, the client mix of portfolio trading in a month like July can certainly have an impact in high yield. In particular, we did actually grow our portfolio market share in July. We did see a pickup of 70 basis points in market share and portfolio trading market share in July. Certainly, we're seeing that client demand continue to come to use our portfolio trading solution. I think going forward clients are really asking for additional pre-trade analytics. They want to analyze portfolios before they submit them, and they really want to optimize those portfolios. Having some of our proprietary market data embedded in our portfolio trading tool will help clients determine what they should put in a portfolio before they go to the market. Those are exciting items, and certainly there are additional items that we're working with some of the dealers on when they want to show portfolios to clients. That market where dealers are looking to move large baskets of bonds and show them to clients, we are now engaged in that as well. That's an exciting new area of the portfolio market that's been developing. Having a platform deliver a solution to both the dealer and the client is an exciting enhancement in that portfolio trading space.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat.

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update. Rich Shiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on our trading businesses, and then Ilene Fiszel Bieler, Chief Financial Officer, will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the Company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us. To review our Fourth Quarter and Full year 2024 Financial Results, before I provide my strategic update, I would like to welcome Roberto Hornweg to our Board of Directors effective 1 March 2025. Roberto's wealth of experience in fixed income and international markets will be integral to our continued global expansion. Now turning to slide three of my strategic update, we've reported solid financial results for the year with 9% growth in revenue, our strongest annual revenue growth rate since 2020, with record commission revenue and record services revenue in 2024.\nWe also made solid progress with our High Touch strategy, focused on meeting both the portfolio trading and block trading needs of our clients. We generated record levels of portfolio trading add in 2024, with record levels of US high grade portfolio trading estimated market share.\nBuilding on our focus on blocks during the year, we launched our block trading solution late in Q4 in emerging markets and Eurobonds, and we will be rolling out our full High Touch block solution in US credit at the end of Q1 this year. To be clear, 2024 was a build year, and now 2025 will be a year of delivery and execution. We will be highly focused on growing our market share across our leading client-initiated channel, the portfolio trading channel, and the dealer-initiated channel, and we plan to regularly report back on our progress in each of these channels. Slide 4 illustrates the record levels of credit and rates ADV we delivered in 2024.\nIn credit, we generated a record $712 million in commission revenue, and record commission revenue across most product areas on record. Total Credit ADV, we have maintained our leadership position in client-initiated RFQ and US Credit, while growing across our other product areas in emerging markets, Eurobonds, munis, and rates. Our challenge was US Credit market share across key protocols.\nI will walk you through how our enhanced functionality, differentiated data, and innovative client solutions are expected to drive increased revenue and market share in 2025. Turning to our rates business, we have been very pleased with our growth in 2024 trading. Add in, our client-focused rates pool increased significantly from $2.9 billion per day in Q1 2024 to $11.4 billion ADV in Q4.\nA lot of this growth was driven by more clients leveraging our rates algos, which they use to work larger block orders with low market impact over a specific time range. In 2025, we expect to see more usage of our client algos as we migrate clients to Pragma technology. Launching in Q1, slide 5 illustrates the strong progress we have made with our High Touch Block strategy.\nFirst, in terms of portfolio trading, we gained over 200 basis points in share in US high-grade portfolio trading in 2024, while we rolled out our new Expro platform and delivered portfolio trading tools in emerging markets, Eurobonds, and munis. In the fourth quarter, with the launch of our global PT offering, portfolio trading in Eurobonds doubled to approximately $11 billion in volume compared to Q3 2024 in emerging markets.\nOur portfolio trading ADV was up 175% for the full year 2024 versus 2023, and I'm pleased to report that we did over $400 million in portfolio trading volume in munis in 2024. Turning to our high touch block solution, during 2024 we continued our investment in our block trading solution, and now we are seeing early signs of progress.\nSince our launch in emerging markets in late November, we have done over half a billion in block trades, with over 75% of trades won by dealers recommended by our proprietary pre-trade selection tool. That win rate substantially reduces information leakage on our platform. The feedback from clients and dealers is very positive as we expand our pre-trade analytics and block solutions into Eurobonds and US credit in Q1 2025.\nBefore I discuss the expected drivers of our growth in 2025, we released our January trading metrics yesterday, which reflect continued elevated market volumes and disappointing US high-grade market share. We have always guided investors to look at longer-term trends and not read too much into the month-over-month fluctuations in our market share, as we experienced in January.\nDuring the month of January, we saw continued spread tightening and low spread volatility. We also saw a sizable jump in block volumes in the market and a drop in non-block volumes. Both factors have an impact on our high-grade market share, but they make us even more focused on solving the block trading solution for our clients.\nWe have a clear strategy to return to market share growth in US Credit across our three channels, and we believe that we will begin to see the benefits of our investments and acquisitions in 2025, which I will now walk you through on the next slide. Slide 6 highlights the enhanced functionality, differentiated data, and innovative client solutions that we expect to drive growth in 2025. As I mentioned earlier, our key initiatives are focused on these three channels.\nThe client-initiated channel, where we have a clear leadership position in smaller size trades and are focused on increasing our block share. The Portfolio Trading Channel, we are very excited that we just launched our global benchmark portfolio trading solution.\nWe also saw a pickup in high-yield portfolio trading market share in January in the Dealer Initiative channel, where we have been in the process of enhancing our dealer solutions. Slide 7 lays out the key deliverables for 2025 as we realize the benefits of our investments, tech modernization, and acquisitions. First, in the client-initiated channel with our High Touch solution, we are focused on the global rollout of our block trading solution, which began in Emerging Markets in December.\nEurobonds have launched in this quarter, and we are on target to launch our High Touch block trading in the first half of this year. With our low touch solutions, we are expanding our automation suite with products like Adaptive Auto-X to support our global product set and integrate our client algo solutions with key markets like ICE Bonds.\nIn terms of Expro, our goal is to roll out traditional RFQ on Expro in Europe in the first half of 2025, while expanding our High Touch and portfolio trading tools in the US. Next, in the portfolio trading channel, we're expecting a full rollout of global benchmark pricing for portfolio trading, and we will continue to enhance our offering. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, Dealer RFQ is expected to benefit from the migration to Expro for dealers, and we are looking to relaunch Midex on Pragma Technology, both in the first half of 2025.\nOur expectation is that the client initiative and portfolio trading channels will be feature complete in the first half of 2025, and the enhancements for our dealer initiative channel will be launched and available to dealers in Q2.\nSlide 8 frames the US high-grade market opportunity and the market channels that we are attacking to grow our share. First, the client-initiated channel is an estimated $690 million revenue opportunity, representing approximately 63% of the total estimated e-trading opportunity in US high-grade. This is where we have a clear leadership position and have very high share in small size trades. Blocks made up 39% of the market at the end of 2024, and electronic penetration is very low.\nThis is the most exciting opportunity in the market for us, and we are already seeing positive trends. Next is the portfolio trading channel, which is important from a market share perspective, but smaller from a revenue perspective. Expro and the pre-trade analytics that fuel Expro have been integral to our share gains in portfolio trading.\nLast is the dealer-initiated channel, which is also attractive, representing approximately $310 million or 28% of the TAM. We are attacking this channel with our dealer RFQ, our automation for dealers, Midex, and Live Markets protocols, supported by our data and our new Expro for dealers. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our trading businesses.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, Market Axess Holdings\n\nThanks, Chris. On slide 10, we highlight the key performance indicators for our Trading businesses across channels for full year 2024. As this slide clearly shows, with the exception of US credit market share, the key performance indicators across our platform are largely green in 2024, reflecting the underlying fundamental strength of our business. As Chris highlighted, we have a comprehensive plan and are laser focused to address our US credit market challenges.\nFirst, across our client-initiated channel, we generated record US credit ADV, up 10% to $8 billion. We saw strong growth in international products ADV to a record $5 billion, up 17%. The EM local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective. We produced record local markets ADV of over $1.4 billion, up 18%.\nOur performance in municipal bonds is a positive example of our product diversification strategy, with record ADV up 22% and record estimated market share of 7%, up from 6% in the prior year. We are very pleased with the liquidity coming from our partnership with ICE Bonds. This started with municipals and is now expanded to US high yield and price-based US investment grade. ICE is becoming a valuable micro lot liquidity provider in US corporate Open Trading.\nWe experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation, with record trade volume of $378 billion, up 25%. We had 245 active automation clients in 2024. Seventy-five clients are now enabled for our algos, up from 13 in the prior year. Open Trading ADV was a record $4 billion in 2024, an increase of 8%.\nOpen Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the US credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. Our share of blocks in US high grade was just over 11%, up slightly from 2023. In the portfolio trading channel, we generated record total PT ADV of over $900 million and record US credit PT ADV of $800 million, with record market share of 16%. Last, in the dealer-initiated channel, Dealer RFQ and Midex ADV was a record $1.3 billion, representing a 17% increase over the prior year.\nWhile we are in the early innings of our expanded dealer services strategy, we are encouraged by the improvement we are seeing in Midex activity in Europe. Now let me turn the call over to Eileen to review our financial performance.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThank you, Rich. Turning to our results on Slide 12, we provide a summary of our fourth quarter financials. We delivered total revenue of $202 million compared to $197 million in the prior year. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn, commission revenue increased 2%, largely driven by increased market volumes, partially offset by lower market share. Information services revenue of $13 million was up 10% and included a $300,000 benefit from FX.\nThe increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+ post-trade services. Revenue of $11 million was flat versus the prior year and included a $200,000 benefit from FX. The prior year period included over $1 million in one-time resubmission revenue. Technology services revenue of $4 million increased 41%, driven by higher Pragma-related license fees.\nTotal other income decreased approximately $2 million due principally to mark to market losses on our US Treasury portfolio in the current quarter of approximately $2 million versus a gain of $1 million in the prior year period. The effective tax rate was 23%, and we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.73. On slide 13, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture.\nTotal commission revenue was $175 million compared to $172 million in the prior year. Strong growth in credit commission revenue across emerging markets of 18%, Eurobonds up 10%, and municipals up 6% was partially offset by a 19% decline in US high yield and lower levels of credit spread volatility. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix, specifically lower high yield activity. Total credit fee capture was in line with Q3 2024 levels.\nThe decline in fixed distribution fees was principally driven by dealer migrations to variable fee plans. On slide 14, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $122 million increased 2% compared to the prior year as we anniversary the Pragma acquisition. Higher employee comp and benefits, tech and communications, and marketing costs were partially offset by lower depreciation and amortization, professional and consulting, and general and administrative costs.\nHeadcount was up 1%. On slide 15, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Our balance sheet continues to be strong, with cash, cash equivalents, and corporate bonds and US Treasury investments totaling $699 million as of 31 December 2023, up from $602 million at the end of last year. We generated $328 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of 6% over last quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, we repurchased 341,000 shares for a total of $75 million, including 64,000 shares repurchased during the fourth quarter at a cost of $16 million. As of 31 January 2025, $220 million remains on the current authorizations. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. On Slide 16, we provide you with our full year 2025 guidance.\nTotal services revenue, which includes information, post-trade, and technology services, is expected to grow in the mid single digits in 2025. We expect total expenses to be in the range of $505 million to $525 million off a base of $476 million in 2024. This would imply a growth rate of approximately 8% to the midpoint of the 2025 range.\nThis includes the full year effect of 2024 hires, inflationary increases, as well as tech investments and higher variable costs. We expect that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 23.5% to 24.5%. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $65 million to $70 million, of which roughly 80% relates to capitalized software development costs for the investments we're making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks, Ilene. In summary, on slide 17, we delivered solid financial results in 2024. In 2024, we made solid progress building our portfolio trading tools, our High Touch Block Trading Solution, and our dealer solutions. Our focus in 2025 is now on realizing the benefit of our investments and the acquisitions, and delivering those solutions across all three of our channels. 2025 is a year of delivery, and we look forward to reporting on the progress through the coming quarters. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, and we will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press STAR one again, and just a reminder to please limit yourself to asking one question. If you have any further questions, please rejoin the queue. With that, your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nYeah, morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to talk about the block trading.\nLaunch in the US. I'm kind of.\nCurious why you led with emerging markets or Sierra bonds first. We think about the block trading.\nLaunch, which we've anticipated in the US. Just how integral is having the dealers on board for success on block penetration moving forward, and what steps you're taking to ensure that success?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure. Thanks, Chris. Yes, pretty excited about both where we are from a block trading perspective, and obviously very excited about the launch, the pending launch in the US. I've been talking about our high touch solution for quite some time, so it was great to see it launched in December of last year.\nWhat we did is targeted EM and then Eurobonds first, largely because of the pre-trade analytics that we have in both those markets from a great inventory of dealer axes. We also have pre-trade analytics that we call Smart Dealer Select, and then here in the US we have AI Dealer Select tools. It was really when we looked at and added up all the pre-trade analytics, we were very excited about what we were seeing in EM in particular.\nObviously the clients in EM have been asking for a block solution for some time. It was really the right market to launch in. We have seen, you know, in the fourth quarter we did see our EM block market share increase, blocks in EM increase by about 22%. As I mentioned in our opening remarks, the key ingredient to trading blocks. Just taking a step back and look, we spent a lot of time looking at the electronic market and what the clients want solved.\nThe big challenge for block trading is information leakage. In our bond market, you have to present your interest in an RFQ to get a price back. When you're trading a block, you do not want to share that information broadly because of the impact it can have on the market.\nThat makes all-to-all less attractive for a block. We've seen that over the years around our block market share for all-to-all. In a liquid market, clients choose all-to-all quite regularly, and we see that in our block trading stats in our all-to-all market. What a client wants to do is target a specific dealer with a block, and they want a short list of dealers that they want to target so they reduce that information leakage. The most important point, and this is what we're seeing, the success in our tool is they want to know that that dealer has a high likelihood to respond and execute at a fair price. More information than just whether a dealer is axed or showing a price or an indicative price is a key ingredient.\nData matters when it comes to block trading. On an electronic platform, there's more data that we can present. As we present the pre-trade analytics, we're seeing in our block trading tool very high hit rates relative to the traditional RFQ. We're seeing about a 90% hit rate in our Eurobond targeted block trading tool based on our axes and our smart dealer selection. That's an exceptionally high hit rate, where in traditional RFQ it's closer to 60% to 70% hit rate. You know, it's still early days. We have about 65 active clients using our block trading tool. More importantly, we launched it in December. We've just done, as of yesterday, over $1.2 billion in volume in our targeted block trade solution.\nStill early days, but very excited about, one, the volumes that are going through, but more importantly, the experience that the clients are having in that tool. What our clients are asking for is what we call one click trading. They want to see a price, they want to share their information with a small list of dealers, and they want to know that they'll get a response, high likelihood of a response.\nThat's really the feedback that we're getting with that block trading tool. We will be launching here in the US in US high grade and US high yield, the block solution, what I'll call an enhanced block solution at the beginning of Q2. We will have that very direct to dealer solution where you can one click with a dealer, getting to a second part of your question.\nSorry, this is a long-winded answer because it's an exciting topic for us. The second part of your question is about how dealers perceive this and what's the reception from dealers. The dealers have been very supportive of us putting them in comp with a shorter list for clients. That's an important ingredient because dealers pay a price of broad dissemination of an inquiry, like in all-to-all, it's called the winner's curse.\nThe whole market knows that you've just taken a position. When it comes to being a counterparty for a block, they like to know that there's a shorter list or even one, their own, on that targeted inquiry. They tend to price aggressively based on the number of people that are seeing that inquiry. That's an important component. It's actually dealer friendly, this block trading solution.\nThe feedback from dealers has been positive, and the feedback from clients has been very positive.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks.\nI wanted to just follow up on.\nA lot of your prepared remarks around kind of goals this year and improving market share. I assume your first answer fit some of this. What gives you confidence in terms.\nOf the ability to grow share in.\nHigh grade and you are rolling out products, but curious if you think the protocols you have today are what is going to drive that or what is.\nStill on the come.\nDo you think that is going to be the driver of that increased market share?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks, Dan. First, I'll start from a macro market perspective. The market itself is quite favorable to the fixed income market broadly where yields currently stand. Inflows into fixed income funds are generally positive, and they continue to be positive here just in January. From a macro perspective, the market is still fairly attractive. The new issue market is quite robust. We saw a heavy new issue market in January, and most forecasts predict a strong new issue market throughout the year of 2025.\nThe other pieces of the puzzle, turnover in the market continues to be at high rates of turnover similar to what we saw in 2024. The velocity of the market, and I think in IG in particular, is largely driven by electronic trading, portfolio trading solutions. The growth of electronic RFQ continues to drive that velocity of trading.\nThe other piece is a very robust entry from systematic funds into the market, both as takers of liquidity, but also as alternative liquidity providers. That's a key ingredient to our growth and overall growth of the velocity of trading in the bond market. The factors that are a struggle for our model, our RFQ model with an all-to-all solution, have been very low volatility and very tight spreads. All-to-all is a great provider of alternative liquidity in high volume.\nThe key for our growth rates in 2025 is offering multiple protocols that are appropriate in multiple types of market environments. As you think about it, we are the largest liquidity solution, alternative liquidity solution, electronic alternative liquidity solution in the US Credit market. Our platform provides an electronic RFQ for small sizes.\nWe have an exceptionally strong automation solution for what I'd call no touch trading. Our all-to-all market solves both no touch and low touch trading. We're now near the edges of completing our PT solution. I think I used in my prepared remarks feature complete in Q1 for portfolio trading. That doesn't mean there won't be an endless supply of new analytics and new functionality that clients will ask for in PT, but we have sizable feature rollout in Q1. We just had a release in January. We have another release in February, just next week. We just see ourselves as having a highly competitive offering in portfolio trading in Q1.\nThe other area of growth that we're very excited about, and I just talked about it with Chris Allen's question, our block trading solution is finally launching in US High Grade where it's quite appropriate. What's exciting about that is we're targeting what I call the next 50% of the market. If you really think about it, that tool targets a bigger portion of the market than all of electronic trading in the high grade market today.\nThat's just a huge opportunity for us to solve. While it's still early days, the evidence that we're seeing on our block trading tool in both EM and EU is quite exciting around our launch in High Grade. Look, January was not. That was a disappointing market share for us in January. When we look at the rest of the year, we're quite excited about the schedule.\nAs you can see in our prepared remarks, we're quite regimented about dates and being committed to those dates of execution and delivery in 2025. We're quite confident about our rollout strategy across the US corporate market. The last piece that we are introducing new products in continuously in 2025 is the dealer business. The dealer to dealer business in US high grade is about 30% of the market, 29% to be exact, in January.\nThat's a sizable portion of the business. We expect that portion of the business to continue to grow as dealers turn over inventory at a much higher rate in the market to come. As we mentioned in the remarks, we already have a robust dealer RFQ platform that in fact saw market share gains both in high grade and high yield in January.\nWe're rolling out Midex, or a mid-market matching solution, in Q2, and we're rolling out a new front end, Expro, for dealers starting in Q2 and rolling out throughout Q3. We have a number of product deliveries rolling out through the first half of 2025. Each of those product deliveries we intend to have market share impact as a result.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThanks for taking the question.\nChris, you kind of touched on what.\nI wanted to ask you about, which was sort of a higher level look at the market in terms of where there's room left to electronify. I'll kind of ask it anyway. You've always said historically that the key competitor is the phone. I guess as you think about the block market, I think that's largely unelectronified. I'm curious, where else do you think there is low hanging fruit, parts of the market that are electronified, but maybe not all the way.\nHow important or how would you describe sort of what's necessary in terms of either. Is it either a matter of competition? Is it a matter of increasing electronification? How do you think about which of those two is sort of more important as you think about growing your share over the next few years? Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYeah, great question. One that we spent a lot of time on. If you think about our investment in 2024, we made a strategic decision to continue to invest in our high touch block solution. While we knew we were facing competition in portfolio trading, as we laid out in the TAM presentation, obviously the block part of the market is by far the largest part that is not electronic. It's really phone and ID that we see the blocks flowing through. When you look at the workflow over ID or phone, it's very inefficient.\nOur clients continuously are looking for better ways to trade blocks, but in what I call in a replicated fashion to phone and chat. They do not want information leakage over the electronic platform. That's really what we perfected in our targeted block trading solution.\nThe other areas of opportunity is really around the retail space, and it's across US corporates and across really the whole fixed income market. You know, we have a platform that is targeting the private bank market called Axess IQ. It continues to deliver volumes and growth month over month, and obviously year-over-year. We are encouraged that we have now tapped into the private bank space in the US that was largely targeting European private banks and Asia-Pacific private banks. We are seeing healthy growth from the retail market.\nI think with the rates being so attractive more broadly, you're going to continue to see higher levels of activity in the retail space and then other areas. Really, I think the biggest area of electronic opportunity, electronic evolution, is really in emerging markets.\nYou know, it's hard to get the true denominator in emerging markets, the full total market size. It's equivalent to the total size of US investment grade and US high yield. It's a sizable market. By our estimates, we're only looking at under 5% is electronically penetrated. There's a huge opportunity within the EM market. The most important ingredient to all these electronic solutions is really around data. You can't really electronify a market absent the data.\nAs we grow our footprint across the market, our data footprint and our data intelligence becomes that much more valuable. That's the most important ingredient. The more you touch, the better your data becomes. We're rolling out data products in the same pace in which we're rolling out these new protocols.\nWhen you really see the complete offering, by mid this year, we are going to be touching the largest trade sizes, portfolio trades, and those are complicated with lots of line items. The next largest, which is block trades, we'll have protocol for that. We'll have our current highly liquid, low touch, all-to-all protocol, and then full automation suite, both auto RFQ, but more importantly, algos that replicate multiple trades through RFQ and other ways to trade. It will be a complete offering in 2025. We spent the full year of 2024 investing and building out the ability to deliver all these products in 2025.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, Market Axess Holdings\n\nBen, it's Rich. Just one thing I wanted to add to Chris's remarks on this, and you know, he highlighted all of the areas where electronic trading is, let's say, not as well penetrated, like the block area, for example. One thing we definitely believe in is that even in the odd lot space, let's say the smaller size trades, this is going to continue to grow this segment.\nJust like what has happened in equities with all of the electronic trading adoption, and the systematic liquidity providers that are out there are enabling new strategies for people to get in and out of bonds a lot more easily. It's going to lead to more turnover in that size range, is our view. We believe we've got the right solutions to capture that flow. You know, we expect it to keep growing.\nI mean, we were just commenting before the call. We've seen a couple of TRACE days of $44 billion in high grade, which is well above the running averages. There's a likelihood of increasing activity that's going on in the sweet spot, which means more volume for us to capture.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHi, good morning everyone.\nMaybe if I could just ask a question.\nBigger picture question on the high yield business. January market share near 12%. I think two years ago you were in the kind of 17% to 18% range. I know there's been a number of changes with the market. There's been cyclical headwinds, maybe some structural headwinds as well. If you look at market share by client type in high yield, just trying to understand where you're seeing good progress over the past two years, which client segments are still seeing some good growth, and then where have you seen the most pullback or share migrate away.\nClients just pull back from the marketplace as we're trying to think about the growth trajectory and share from here.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat question. High yield in 2024, the market itself from a macro perspective certainly saw challenges for end investors. Very attractive market, spreads were tight, volatility was low. For ETF market makers, anyone trading ETF arbitrage, that's a very difficult market to trade in, particularly as the borrow rate went up sizably in 2024.\nBeing able to put on an arbitrage across the high yield market became quite difficult. What we saw in 2024 and still in January is the ETF players, those that were trading high yield on an ETF arb, really exit the market. We saw some trading pods at some of the hedge funds closed down. We still see, we continue to see systematics coming into high yield because they want to make the investment to be there.\nMost systematics that we talk to that are investing in the high yield product and high yield trading continue to bet that volatility will return to the high yield market. Certainly, if you have any credit challenges through high yield, we see individual issuer volatility snap back. They're really predicting that there will be volume eventually back in high yield and that spread will widen out.\nThey'll have opportunity for the arbitrage, they'll have opportunity for just straight dealer solutions. When it comes to high yield and the traditional buy side from a macro perspective, high yield is still very attractive. That rate environment is very attractive. We continue to see inflows into the high yield funds, and really, portfolio trading is picking up in high yield. We've seen it come up to about 8% of the high yield market.\nWe recently launched our benchmark portfolio trading tool, which we tend to see more benchmark trades in high yield. You know, we did pick up portfolio trading market share. It did increase in January, which was encouraging. Not to talk about high touch block trading again, but we do hear from our clients that they're very sensitive to information leakage in high yield. In particular, the block trade sizes are smaller.\nThey're probably around $3 million is considered a block trade in a more liquid high yield bond. The block trading solution will be welcomed by most high yield traders just because it's targeting either a single dealer or a small list of dealers. If the hit rates continue at those high levels, that's one of the biggest challenges in high yield, just maintaining a high hit rate based on your inquiries.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning everybody. Thank you for taking the question as well. Lots of great color. Really appreciate the TAM analysis as well. I know it's going to be a hard question to answer, but I guess we'll try anyway. Twenty twenty-four big build out year, twenty twenty-five you expect to see the benefits of that.\nHow would you define success in terms of market share accomplishments in 2025? When it comes to high grade and high yield within the US, I guess what are the top one or two protocols that you're pushing forward? You named a lot of things that you think will help you recoup some of that market share, and then ultimately the implications on fee per million, all else constant. I know that the mix and macro could impact that.\nWe're just trying to get a sense what the revenue implication from these efforts could ultimately be, given that things like portfolio trading, et cetera, come with a much lower fee per million. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nOkay, let me simplify your question. You want us to predict our market share and our overall revenue for 2025. Thanks, Alex. What I will do is let me go through the protocols individually because each one certainly could have sizable impacts on share, and obviously sizable impacts on revenue. Obviously, I'll start with portfolio trading because it's obviously been a very focused area of ours and certainly continues to focus in Q1.\nIt has sizable market share impacts, and we've seen this and we've predicted this in the last quarter call. You can see swings of market share for platforms that offer portfolio trading. We see it in our own market. There are sizable portfolio trades that come to market in January. We saw actually very low level of what we call mega portfolio trades, anything of a billion plus in size.\nThere was just a smaller number of those mega PTs in the market, whereas in December there was a lot more of those mega trade. From a share perspective, not a revenue perspective because we showed you the TAM around PT, you can really move and swing market share around based on portfolio trading tools, and we're very excited where we think we'll be just in Q1 with the next few releases on our portfolio trading tool.\nMoving to the block side, I spent a lot of time talking about high touch and blocks, but that has a sizable impact on share and obviously revenue. It has a very attractive fee schedule. It's not like a PT. It is certainly more consistent with traditional RFQ fee schedule, but it does have larger trade sizes, so fee capture is quite attractive. Again, it doesn't involve all-to-all sorts of.\nIt has a slightly different fee capture to an all-to-all. To the extent there's higher levels of volatility, and certainly we've seen momentary spikes of volatility with the announcements coming fast and furious out of the new administration. To the extent there is volatility, we would expect our all-to-all platform to pick up rapidly, similar to what we saw just this week with the spike in activity around tariff news that came out over the weekend. All-to-all is really a great protocol for smaller sizes, for automation, for traditional RFQ.\nWe obviously have the largest RFQ network in US high grade and US high yield for that all-to-all platform. Again, with volatility spiking, we can see a share movement around that all-to-all platform. The last piece is obviously automation.\nWe continue to see clients ask for more sophisticated levels of automation. Just in 2024, our automation volume grew by 29% year over year, and in the fourth quarter is up 21%. We continue to see that demand in January. We continue to grow our automation volume. It grew 23% year-over-year in January. That automation suite is in high demand. One of the areas that is a sweet spot is in the clients that are offering large SMA solutions.\nThey're getting smaller trade sizes through that SMA channel of their business, and they're adopting automation quite rapidly. Our automation suite is just touching 245 active clients recently. That's out of our over 2,000 clients around the globe. The penetration across our client base is still low relative to the global client base, but the demand for automation continues to grow.\nIf you follow the projections for SMA growth alone, it's projected to grow up to $5 trillion from the, call it, current $2 trillion. That's obviously a great area of growth for us in the fixed income markets. As those grow, the demand for automation will grow. I covered all of our protocols. The nice thing is we feel like we're going to be in a great spot in terms of offering multiple protocols to our clients, all designed for different elements of the market, and all designed for different environments to trade through in the market.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nAlex, let me take the fee per million part of your question. If you think about the four key protocols that Chris talked about, there are potential puts and takes in terms of fee per million there. Right. This is about driving share, driving revenue, and thinking about the future. Chris talked about portfolio trading, he talked about blocks, we know that those come in at a bit lower fees per million. Then he talked about Open Trading and automation, which we know come in at a bit higher fees per million. Right. So there's puts and takes there. Let's take a step back and think about, for instance, what the largest driver in the change of fees per million was just in January. We know that in high grade that's duration, and it was duration.\nIf you think about it, right, we saw in January that weighted average years to maturity was at 8.28 years versus a little over 9 last year. That was also down from, call it, 8.9, almost 9 in December. That was a pretty big driver of what happened. We also saw yields go up in this past January to over 5%. If you think about that, that's another headwind that we saw in the duration calculation. Now let's think about how quickly trading behavior can change and what that could mean for duration. We know that can happen, and we've actually even seen it already in just the first few days of February. Now, the first few days of February does not make a year, needless to say.\nI think we have to really keep in mind how much duration does impact these types of things. When you think about these per million, you think about duration and high grade, this is obviously a key component. If I take a step back, I know it's, you know, really people are trying to model this and I get it and I know how important it is. You know, the average fees per million across most of our credit products really has been quite stable in terms of our beat card over the past few years. I just want to remind us of that. There are all these puts and takes that we've talked about.\nIf you think about the puts and takes, and I just mentioned a few of them, I'll go through them again just because I know there's a lot here, you know, you've got the growth of PT. Even if you look just what happened year over year, that 200 basis points that Rich talked about, we know that has a negative impact on fees per million, right. You also know that, you know, if you think about, and I talked about this on, I think it was our last call when I looked back over, call it a five year time period and I said, okay, what was sort of the average of fees per million over that time period? It was about $173 per million.\nWe know that, for instance, Chris just talked about high yield, and we were asked, well, you know, what's going on in the high yield space? We know that that also has a significant benefit and tailwind fees per million. If we see our ETF market maker clients get more active, you know, that could be a real benefit as well. If you think about that as a benefit possibility, if you think about if we see changes in duration in high grade as another benefit possibility, if you see more volume pickup, and again, you know, we've got to see how this all works out, that could create additional open trading, which is more of a premium product in terms of how you think about fees per million.\nYou sort of have to think about all these different factors that go into fees per million. We do know that you also have to look at the macro environment. I would also say with Gutta's, see that the Fed is and what's happening there in terms of the rate environment that's changing day by day. Obviously, that also impacts trading activity. If you have sort of a more longer or, call it, elongated, if you think about how the curve is moving, that will take. If you think about how people look at their trading activity in the rate environment, whether or not they'll go out longer on the curve, really they're going to look at what's happening in the rate environment. All of these types of things we have to take into effect.\nThat's kind of the puts and takes that I would say to keep in mind. I hope that is helpful when you think about fees per million in general.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmidt with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Schmidt\n\nAnalyst in Financial Service and Technology, William Blair\n\nHi, good morning. Portfolio trading as a percent of industry, high grade and high yield activity, it's been around 10% for the last probably six months at least. What do you think is driving that pause, and can you continue to drive share gains there even if it stays at these levels?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nFirst, from a macro perspective, if you look at volatility, if you look at spread and spread volatility in the fixing of fixed income market, it's been quite attractive to get a portfolio trade done at an attractive price. We have seen in the past, again we haven't seen a lot of volatility, but it becomes more difficult to trade a large portfolio in higher levels of volume.\nAt these levels of volume, I think the 10% range is quite an attractive range for portfolio trades. There also has been a number of portfolio trading counterparties that have moved in and out of the market. Profitability for the dealer around portfolio trading has been up and down, and in low volume, it's probably a little bit more attractive. In higher volume, it becomes more difficult to manage that large inventory that you're taking down in a portfolio trade.\nIt is a capital intensive trade for a dealer. They obviously, we obviously see large banks that have the capital are highly engaged in portfolio trading. It is a tool that the buy side finds attractive to move flows, and it will be around, it's not going anywhere. I think the market environment and capital willingness will really dictate where portfolio trading moves in the market from quarter to quarter, from year to year, because it is a trading tool that will be around for a long time.\nWith regard to our share in portfolio trading, we continue to grow our portfolio trading. Just in investment grade last year, we obviously grew overall notional portfolio trading by 80%. We are encouraged with our performance, but not where we need to be. We are excited about what's happening with new features rolling out this quarter.\nWe do think it will have an impact on our competitiveness in the portfolio trading space. Portfolio trades are getting bigger, not smaller. The number of line items that we're seeing, over 1,000 line items, is becoming a common place for portfolio trades. We expect that market to continue to move in and around that 10% at these levels of volatility. You could see it move up certainly into the teens, but we expect it to be around that part of the market for some time to come. It is a very valuable tool for the buy side to move in and out of flow quite quickly and aggressively.\nThe prices that we're seeing in the market are relatively attractive for the end investor. Where the buy side is getting executed in that market, that could change if volatility comes into the market, obviously.\nThat's why we're so focused on having multiple protocols across our platform. If you're sitting at our trade desk, you can trade a PT trade, a block trade, the low touch list, or trade fully automated. That's the key ingredient that we're targeting in 2025. Jeff.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, Market Axess Holdings",
    "content2": "It's Rich. I'll just add to that. I mean, there's no question about the convenience of the, the PT trade and easy way to move, you know, a lot of line items. One thing about it, it's a pretty concentrated market in terms of the liquidity. You're talking about, you know, it's fairly dominated by, you know, six to eight, maybe kind of 10 firms. That makes it not being really unique liquidity. We're really confident in our ability in terms of, in terms of share, whatever the percentage of the market it's going to be. Maybe I'll take the under on it a little bit there. In terms of grabbing market share, it's the same liquidity on the different venues.\nAs we continue to increase our capabilities and build in the analytics, and build all the features that our clients are looking for, we feel that that's pretty easy volume to move. It's quite different than the in comp business where, you know, Open Trading in that area, that represents, you know, let's say 35% was the Q4 number, and that comes from over 1,000 unique liquidity providers. That's not easily replicated in other places, which makes the volume stickier, keeping it with us. We feel really confident about our ability to get increased share of the existing whatever percent of the market PT is going to be.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, thank you.\nYour next question comes from the line of Ellie Abboud with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEllie Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can you speak to your motivation behind.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nAcquiring the rest of RFQ-Machine and walk us through the materiality of the financial impact there, and then bigger picture, to what extent is it a priority for you to become more cross asset? Is that something you feel like clients are demanding?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks for the question, Ellie. Yeah, we're exceptionally excited about RFQ Hub and the prospects for RFQ Hub. It is a multi-asset platform, so there's obviously ETFs. We're very focused on the ETF market and the opportunity for block trading in ETFs through RFQ. That is a sizable market both here in the US, as well as in Europe and throughout Asia Pacific. It is also a derivative platform. It offers futures, equity derivatives, complex swaps, and other derivatives. That's really where the platform started out first, particularly in the European OTC market. It's an exciting platform to have cross assets traded on the platform. It's a very flexible market, so we can add product quite easily.\nWe think the important ingredient about having and where we see synergies is really being able to offer our large client base, fixed income client base, access to fixed income ETFs side by side. That is an important component. If you look at the growth of the portfolio trading market, every PT is really correlated to an ETF.\nClients have a choice of trading directly the underlying bond in a PT or trading an ETF. It's really dependent on where that ETF NAV is trading in real time relative to the underlying portfolio. There are choices that we can offer clients just through data and analytics around trading the PT itself or trading the ETF, which is correlated ETFs. Fixed income ETFs are a great way for a portfolio manager to get instant exposure to the bond market.\nThey're highly liquid and can be traded in block form. It's just another tool in our fixed income protocol solutions that we want to offer our clients. We're excited about that transaction. We already own 42% of RFQ-Machine through our partnership with Virtu. We have a number of the dealers invested in that platform as well. There's still continuous dealer support in the platform, and it's bringing all those alternative products into the MarketAxess suite. Really, the key synergy is our ability to redistribute what is a very successful small platform to our huge client network and our international presence across the institutional marketplace.\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYou guys probably know this, but you can see the equity and earnings of unconsolidated affiliate right on our consolidated statement of operations. That's really the RFQ-Machine current that Chris just talked about in terms of the ownership. That will obviously get consolidated into operating results once we bring that on. That's another way that you can look at it and think about sort of opportunity there.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Xifaras with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Xifaras\n\nTrading Manager, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning.\nThanks for taking the question.\nJust hoping to touch on the rates.\nPlatform for a moment. The volumes are up very nicely there.\nOn a year-on-year basis, but still a smaller contributor to revenues today. Can you just talk about some.\nOf the initiatives across your rates platform that you have in mind to further scale this part of the business, talk about some of your ambitions here, how you see this contributing over time.\nMaybe you could also update us.\nOn the net spotting tool.\nWhat's been sort of the uptake from customers?\nI know you've had this for a bit. Just how do you see that contributing?\nAs well to the broader platform?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat, thanks for asking about rates. It's certainly a product that we love, and certainly we've seen growth in 2024 and a number of exciting things happening in that rate space. First, I do think we have to recognize that in the rates market, it's really largely driven by electronic RFQ to the buy side. It's been that way, traditional RFQ, typically RFQ to five dealers for many years. When it comes to innovation to the client side, we haven't seen a lot of innovation in terms of interesting protocols or new tools. The rates RFQ platforms in the market have also enjoyed low levels of volatility.\nWe've seen spikes of volatility, but the clients that we talk to in the rate space are quite concerned that they don't have direct electronic access to alternative liquidity because when that market turns volatile, it becomes a much more challenging market to trade. Yet the alternative liquidity providers tend to provide more liquidity in those moments of volatility. We've seen that on our platform and just traditional all-to-all in corporate.\nA key ingredient, we think, to the rates market is making sure there's a healthy interaction between clients, large dealers, and ultimately all-to-all liquidity in times of need. Where we've been mostly innovative in our rate space is offering clients algo solutions that provide the client the ability to trade large size orders but in smaller size without market impact.\nReally being both passive liquidity providers or using smaller size orders to take liquidity through a systematic algorithm. I'm excited that we're launching our Algos just this month on Pragma. We're migrating our Algo solution onto our Pragma platform in the rates market, which just gives us great tooling for clients, and very interesting controls around the Algo suite of products that we can offer.\nThe other piece is our net hedging for rates has been in our corporate bond market for quite some time. We launched that a number of years ago. It continues to get bigger. We continue to see more and more clients adopt the net hedging solution. Again, it is client adopted. We don't just turn it on for all clients. It's a very powerful way for us to actually provide large banks with liquidity in rates.\nWe offer net hedging and we offer hedging for dealers. Overall, the rates complex that you saw continues to grow and continues to grow here in January. We're excited about rates. We do plan on launching in 2025 our RFQ solution, which the client community is much more familiar with. We want to have a hybrid offering where we're offering both electronic algorithmic solutions, as well as traditional RFQ solutions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Your last question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nResearch Analyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question.\nI think most of my questions have been.\nChris, thanks so much for the detail and color. A lot of really useful stuff I heard today.\nI just wanted to refer to slide.\nNineteen, the bottom left and the relationship between fee per million and duration, which we know is obviously very sensitive.\nI was just wondering if you could.\nJust talk about what kind of scenarios or what kind of macro conditions we.\nWould need to see for the fee.\nPer million to go, or at least the duration to go below the lows that we saw in 23 September 2023 and thus take fee per million below where we are today. Just kind of curious as to what, you know, I guess how you're thinking about are we, was the January number just like a bottom or is there still plenty of room for that to drop if conditions continue down this path?\n\nIlene Fiszel Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure.\nThanks for the question, Simon. I mean, it's always hard to call something a bottom or a top, particularly when you're dealing with trading behavior and when you're talking about a rate environment and you're talking about central banks making changes to economic policy. I don't think I want to go there, but I think what we need to look at and think about is, you know, where do we see the rate environment and how do we see trading behavior. Right now we know that the most recent, I think if we look at CME Watch, Fed Watch, right, the most recent call for rate cuts is, I want to say, one to two. Just a little while ago, it wasn't so long ago that we saw three to four.\nWhen you saw three to four as what people were calling for, you see folks wanting to trade out further on the curve. That's pretty normal behavior if you see that type of steepening. Now we've seen a bit of a bear steepener, and it's been quite unusual. What you saw most recently, some would call it a bear steepener, and that's not what we would expect in a rate cutting cycle. Having said that, as I said most recently, with sort of different outcomes in terms of economic policy decisions, things changing quite rapidly, you're also seeing, we saw just in the last few days, as I said before, change in behavior on duration.\nJust honestly, it went from, you know, quite quickly from, call it, eight years of weighted average years to maturity to nine. Now, I can't tell you it's staying there, but I can tell you that we saw a quite quick change in behavior. You have to look at things like all the normal things you would think of bond traders looking at, what's happening with inflation, what's happening in those numbers. How are we seeing what the Fed is saying there in terms of where the rate environment is going to come out? All of these things matter. What do we think is going to happen in terms of will there be a soft landing, will it take longer for the Fed to come down in rates? I mean, all of these things matter.\nAgain, we really have to see what's going to happen in the environment. We have to see where the yields are going to turn out as well. Because as you know, I mean, we've talked about this sensitivity before. When you see a one year increase on the platform in weighted average years to maturity, that can be worth about $15 for us in high grade. If you see yields come in 100 basis points, that can be worth $3 to $5.\nRight.\nAll of this is, you know, we've got to see what happens in the macro environment.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSimon, I would just add in our client to dealer space, as Eileen pointed out, there's lots of factors to go into figuring out what that C per million will come out. Really, the good news is from the client perspective, we spend more time focused on functionality, features, data, and analytics and really don't get concerns from clients around fee pressure.\nFrom a broader market perspective, it's really about delivering functionality to clients that they need to help them trade. Our fees are ultimately small, small features of the overall spread and cost of trading. That fee pressure dialogue is just not present. We don't see fees as a weapon or a tool in the competitive marketplace. We really see rolling out functionality, new data, and analytics is really the way to move share around.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. That ends our question and answer session. I would like to turn it back to Chris Concannon for closing remarks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks everyone for joining us. As you heard in both our prepared remarks and our Q&A, we are laser focused on execution and delivery. We spent 2024 building product, and now we're rolling out specific dates, specific timelines on delivering that product. We're excited about 2025, and we're excited about the product rollout that we put out in the public on this call. Thank you, and look forward to talking to you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain.\nThe company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023. I would also direct you to read the forward looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Turning to slide three of my strategic update, we delivered 10% total revenue growth, including the benefit of the Pragma acquisition, and diluted earnings per share was $1.72. We continued to execute our strategy this quarter and delivered solid growth in commission revenue across most credit products, with strong revenue growth in our international product areas. We continue to be disciplined around our expense management, with total operating expenses increasing 12%, including the impact of Pragma.\nWe released our July trading metrics yesterday, which reflected continued solid growth in our credit complex across most product areas. While our US Credit estimated market share continues to disappoint, we believe that our core RFQ business, underpinned by our differentiated liquidity and Open Trading, reflects our continued leadership in the institutional client to dealer E-trading space. We have a clear strategy to return to market share growth through our global rollout of X-Pro.\nWe are also pleased that we are continuing to grow our market share in the global credit E-trading space outside of US Credit. I would like to welcome Ilene to her first earnings call as CFO. In the short time that she has been here, she has already made a significant impact on the business and more broadly. We have made several key hires recently, including a new Head of US Sales, a new Head of Global Emerging Markets, and a new Head of Client Solutions, all great hires that significantly enhance the already deep bench strength at MarketAxess.\nWe have always guided investors to look at long-term trends and not read too much into the month-to-month gyrations in our estimated market share as we saw in July. Slide four lays out our strategic priorities to grow market share. The fastest growing segments of US high grade trades year to date have been portfolio trading and dealer to dealer trading, up 94% and 31%, respectively. Client to dealer trading is only up 13%. Our estimated share in the dealer to dealer segment is down slightly, and we are allocating more resources to attack this segment with expanded dealer trading solutions.\nWhile our client to dealer segment performs much better in periods of volatility, as we have seen over the last few days, we have a clear strategy to reignite growth in our client to dealer business by capturing more share in portfolio trading and larger trade sizes. This strategy will be executed through our modernized, easy to navigate user interface, X-Pro, which we have been rolling out in stages across products and protocols for our clients. X-Pro is enabled by our proprietary pre-trade data and analytics designed to help traders achieve better trading outcomes.\nFurthermore, X-Pro is built on cloud-based technology, so it is easy to make changes and introduce new features and functionality in a matter of weeks. With X-Pro, we are enhancing our portfolio trading solution, giving clients access to our full suite of automation and Algo tools to improve workflows, and building out our High Touch strategy to attack larger trade sizes with unique AI-powered data. As you can see on the slide, we have already completed a number of important steps in our X-Pro rollout over the last several quarters.\nThe next step for our High Touch strategy is to enhance our PT offering with the launch of our global multiproduct portfolio trading solution. We are also launching our AI Dealer Selection tool, which is a smart counterparty selection tool that predicts which counterparty is most likely to win a trade. Last, we are rounding out our custom Algos with the launch of our new Take Algo, which will be available to both clients and dealers.\nOur announcement yesterday with ICE is a great example of how we are connecting to external platforms to aggregate available liquidity, leveraging the deep liquidity across both platforms. We are opening up our network for clients in order to provide them with the tools and trading options they need to achieve their trading objectives. Our goal is to create an interoperable marketplace that provides our clients access to robust liquidity through protocol-agnostic solutions. slide five highlights the multiple cylinders that drive our growth across regions and across products.\nWhile our US credit volumes have not been where we would like, we truly are a multidimensional growth story as the largest global network for e trading. Emerging markets is a perfect example of this multidimensional growth story, with growth across all regions as shown on this slide. Slide six provides more detail on the strength of our expanding emerging markets franchise.\nOur emerging markets commission revenue increased 22%, with EM TRACE-eligible estimated market share of 26%, and we are seeing strong growth in emerging markets trading activity across regions, with record LATAM and APAC emerging markets trading volume up 27% and 35%, respectively. Over the past year, we have experienced a significant expansion of activity across local markets trading. Local markets are the largest opportunity in EM from an addressable market perspective and involve larger trade sizes because these markets are mostly rates focused.\nThe top five local currencies represented 58% of local markets trading volume on a constant currency basis, down from 63%, reflecting the increasing breadth of local currencies traded on the platform. One of our fastest growing protocols is Request for Market, or RFM, which is perfectly suited for local markets trading where our clients are trading in larger sizes with limited trading data. We generated record local markets RFM activity in the quarter, up 45%, which also drove our growth in block trading in local markets. We are very excited about the emerging markets opportunity ahead of us, which we believe is still in very early stages of electronification.\nSlide seven highlights our strategic priorities that will drive our future success. We are focused on growing our fixed income trading revenue, enhancing our client network experience, delivering innovative technology and data solutions, and driving a high performance team culture. It is important to note that our use of AI is a key ingredient across these strategic priorities in our data business. For example, AI powers CP+, enabling our automation and Algo solutions. In addition, AI also helps to power our Algo platform, which was part of our Pragma acquisition.\nOur AI-enabled tradability data, designed to provide investors with indicative market depth, is integral to our portfolio trading tool that helps clients make portfolio selection decisions. Finally, our AI-driven dealer selection tool is a key component of our high-touch strategy that targets block size trading with dealers. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our markets.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Chris. On slide nine, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies, products, and protocols. We generated strong growth in international client trade volume and trade count in the second quarter. Trade volume was up 12% versus last year, with a three-year CAGR of 12%. Trade count was up 14% versus last year, with a three-year CAGR of 22%. A key driver of this strength was strong growth in emerging markets trading, ADV up 23% year-over-year, driven by a 26% increase in hard currency and a 17% increase in local currency trading ADVs.\nWe are also seeing strong contributions from growing client segments, including hedge funds, systematic funds, dealer-initiated flow, and private banks. We generated $230 billion in trading volume, up 25% from these important client segments, which now represent 26% of our total credit trading volume, up from 24%. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds, with record estimated market share of 7.4%, up from 5.4% in the prior year. We expect the soon-to-be-available additional liquidity from ICE TMC to support further market share growth.\nWe now have the top 10 largest municipal dealers signed up for tax-exempt and taxable trading on our platform. Slide 10 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Open Trading ADV was $4 billion, and share of total credit volume was 34%, in line with the prior year. Open Trading generated strong growth in trade count, up 18% from the prior year. Hedge fund trade activity has continued to expand on our platform, with ADV of $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 28% from the prior year.\nA record 204 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 5% increase from the prior year. Lower volatility and lower price dispersion in the market continues to reduce the price improvement opportunity in Open Trading, as shown on the lower left of this slide. Open Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the US credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on slide 11.\nWe experienced another quarter of strong growth in automation trade volume and record trade count, with three-year CAGRs of 29% and 39%, respectively, and a record 248 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 10% of our total credit volume and a record 27% of total credit trade count. There were 10 million Algo responses from dealers, an increase of 38% year-over-year. Now let me turn the call over to Ilene to review our financial performance.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Rich, and thank you, Chris, for those kind remarks. I could not be more excited about the opportunity ahead for MarketAxess. Turning to our results on slide 13, we provide a summary of our second quarter financials. We delivered revenue of $198 million, up 10% from the prior year. These results include $8 million from the Pragma acquisition. Looking at each of our revenue lines in turn, this was the second highest level of quarterly commission revenue generation, with only Q1 2024 being higher for commission revenue. Record information services revenue of $13 million was up 8%.\nThe increase was driven by new contracts, as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+ post-trade services. Revenue of $10 million was up 10%. The largest driver of other income was an increase of interest income due to the favorable interest rate environment, which contributed $6 million of interest income across our investment portfolio and cash holdings, up from $5 million. This was partially offset by a $1 million net foreign currency transaction loss. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, and we reported diluted earnings per share of $1.72.\nOn slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue was $172 million, representing an increase of $13 million, or 8%, for the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to solid growth across emerging markets of 22%, US high grade of 4%, and Eurobonds up 11%. Growth across these product areas was partially offset by lower estimated market share in high yield. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product and protocol mix, specifically lower high yield activity and increased portfolio trading.\nThe decline in fixed distribution fees was driven principally by the consolidation of two global bank trading desk operations and migrations to variable fee plans, partially offset by the addition of new dealer fixed fee plans. Turning to slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Second quarter operating expenses of $116 million included $8 million from Pragma. We are well underway in integrating the high performing Pragma technologists into the DNA of our organization, and we are leveraging their expertise to drive many of our strategic priorities that Chris highlighted earlier.\nBased on the timing of expenses through the first half of the year and the incremental cost we are expecting in the back half of the year, we now expect our full year 2024 expenses to come in slightly below the low end of the previously stated range, $480 to 500 million. On slide 16, we provide an update on our capital management and cash flow. Today, we are announcing that our Board has approved a new share repurchase program of $200 million. This is in addition to the $50 million that remains under our existing share repurchase program, for a total current aggregate outstanding authorization of $250 million.\nWe repurchased 243,000 shares for a total of $50 million year to date through July 2024. The new board authorization reflects the Board's confidence in the performance and outlook of the company and is a clear indicator of the company's willingness to repurchase shares more opportunistically, going beyond just offsetting annual dilution from stock-based compensation. During the trailing 12 months, as of Q2 2024, we paid out approximately 59% of our net income through quarterly dividends and share rep. We had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities.\nThe balance sheet continues to be strong with cash, cash equivalents, and corporate bond and US Treasury investments totaling $559 million. As of 30 June 2024, we generated $298 million in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, an increase of about 21% over last quarter. We believe we are striking the right balance of investing to drive future growth while at the same time being disciplined stewards of capital. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Ilene. In summary, on slide 17, we continued to execute our growth strategy and delivered solid financial performance. In the second quarter, we have seen an increase in market volumes, and the velocity of trading is trending up. These factors, combined with the increased potential for rate cuts in 2024, and the recent increase in volatility, are all indicators of an improving macro backdrop for us. We are continuing the rollout of X-Pro by extending the platform to our global client base, and across most products, we are executing our plan to grow market share.\nOur client franchise continues to expand, and our strong geographic, product, and protocol diversification continues to drive growth. Last, we are well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the coming quarters. Now, we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time we will take your questions. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are dialed in and listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute. When asking your question, we kindly ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nYeah, morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I want to dig in a little bit on the ICE field. Just provide any color, just in terms of how it came about, any color on the benefits of connecting to what is largely a retail-oriented liquidity pool on the other side. Chris, you referred to connecting to other liquidity pools of your Algo Suite. Is that necessary to really flourish? How any update just in terms of the opportunity to connect there, is that really a possibility moving forward?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks, Chris. First, yeah, we're very excited about the ICE announcement. Just a little bit of backdrop. We have a long-standing relationship with ICE around data. We purchase data from ICE, and we sell some data to ICE separately. With the recent acquisition of Pragma, Pragma had an existing technology relationship with the NYSE owned by ICE. Again, just a very strong relationship there. Really, the design of this partnership came out of the request of clients, clients that see liquidity in both our destination in RFQ, but also on the ICE platform. You have two leading platforms that are connecting their liquidity to the benefit of clients.\nIt's a very exciting, really, response to client needs. As you mentioned, it is a shift in strategy. Here at MarketAxess, we are opening up our network to external destinations, which is a unique shift in strategy. We have said in the opening remarks and on prior calls that we are protocol agnostic. We want to find the right protocols both internally and externally for our clients' needs, and that's really what we're answering here. We are leveraging our institutional distribution, and we see the benefits of ICE's very strong retail and private client distribution.\nPutting those two liquidity pools together is really an important benefit for both our clients, as well as ICE's strong distribution. Rich, do you want to add to the.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, yeah, thanks, Chris. We're really excited about this one because it's complementary liquidity pools. It's a great way for us to bring some of that more odd lot liquidity—that's a specialty for TMC—to our institutional clients. As Chris said, we heard from our clients that they love our institutional workflow, the ability to RFQ and do lists, and have it processed very efficiently back into their systems. They wanted to get the odd lot and what we call micro lot liquidity, especially under 100 bonds in size, that TMC is really a specialist in.\nThis allows us to bring it all together for our clients through Open Trading, so they don't have to do anything different, they don't have to go anywhere else. They just put their inquiries into our system, their orders, the way they always have. Now they get access to this expanded liquidity pool. It's a great combination. It'll be interesting in corporates as well. I mean, that's of course a much stronger area for us. As we have introduced investment grade trading on price, which is very attractive to private banks, this is another area where some of that retail liquidity can flow through to our institutional clients.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nChris, just to respond to the second half of your question, around Algo solutions and accessing additional liquidity destinations, with the acquisition of Pragma, we now have the technology and the wherewithal to add to Algos both our internal destinations and internal protocols, as well as external. This does open up that opportunity to have available for our clients a variety of protocols, and a variety of both internal and external destinations through the Algo technology.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThanks, guys, I got back in the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You touched on a little bit in your opening remarks, but in the last few days, we've seen spreads widen. Yield curve dynamics look like they're becoming a little more favorable for you guys. Could you maybe just talk about what you've seen over the last few days in terms of client engagement, protocol utilization, and any expectations you have about, you know, whether this is sustainable and how it's expected to impact you. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Well, I'll start by saying when you walk through the desert and you see an oasis of volatility, you're suddenly very excited. Three days is still a little bit too early to predict a trend. We have seen certainly positive trends across the platform during the three days, so we are excited about that. You know, there's obviously we've seen positive activity among certain participants, particularly our ETF market makers. We've seen their activities pick up. If you look at just the overall activity of the fixed income ETFs in the market, you know, you saw HYG go from an average of 30 million shares a day to over 100 million shares a day.\nCertainly positive trends. LQD also went from an average of, call it, 25 million shares a day to just over 50 million shares a day. Many of the positive attributes of volatility are playing out on our platform, and we're seeing the macro backdrop improve. I would say the question is, is this sustained volatility, or is it more short-term volatility that we've seen in spikes, volatility in the past? I am encouraged that these are economic events driving this volatility, and you tend to have more longer-term volatility play out versus something like a geopolitical-driven volatility event.\nCertainly, the rates backdrop is encouraging, and the overall macro environment is encouraging. Again, we're only seeing three days of this volatility. Rich, anything to add?\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, caveat the comment also with three days and of course, you know, we looked closely yesterday about what was going on and when you see the market getting that choppy, you know, that's where the relative importance of liquidity versus workflow, you know, starts to tip the balance. Unsurprisingly, you know, when we looked at, you know, say Open Trading numbers for yesterday, just to give some color on a day like yesterday, we see, you know, Open Trading up around 50% of liquidity provision and incomp activity, IG and high yield. That's well above averages that we typically see.\nI'm not going to say that that's sustainable, you know, throughout a month, but it is indicative about what happens when you get into a higher volume environment, and our clients start to think a lot more about how do I get the best pricing on this trade, how do I make sure I get responses for what I need to trade versus, you know, am I in the most efficient workflow in doing a PT, for example. It doesn't mean PTs go away, obviously, but on a relative basis you see this shift back to a protocol where the pricing matters a lot more than in calm waters.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nDirector and Senior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGreat, thanks for the call. That's it for me.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Was hoping you could expand on the rollout of X-Pro and how behavior has changed as you've been rolling us out selectively to certain subsets of clients. Just curious as to what the change in behavior, increase in velocity, and or activity has been post adoption.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, sure. We're pretty excited about the rollout of X-Pro again. We started this over a year ago, really targeting our most active traders among our largest clients, where we saw a high ticket count and they saw they had a need for the benefit of the new technology and the workflow that it presents. We're now seeing over 60% of the trade activity from our largest clients coming through X-Pro, so a very successful rollout across just traditional RFQ. The second phase of the X-Pro rollout was really targeting portfolio trading starting in the third quarter of last year.\nI'm happy to report that X-Pro is seeing, just in the second quarter, about 56% of the portfolio trades came through X-Pro. Again, an encouraging stat. Overall, our portfolio trading volume is up in the second quarter and continues certainly here into July. The X-Pro rollout is now headed to Europe. We're launching what we call our Global PT solution, which allows clients to trade global product across the platform. It's exciting to finally have X-Pro in Europe and available in EM, where we're also seeing growing demand for portfolio trading across both the Euro market, as well as the EM market.\nStill early days for the global rollout of X-Pro, but very encouraging signs of what X-Pro is capable of. More importantly, the development cycle around the new tech is quite rapid, certainly more rapid than our legacy platform, and we're able to deliver new tech and new functionality in a much more rapid delivery, particularly given that it's cloud-based technology with, obviously, additional capacity. The turnaround for development is quite high, which allows us to address clients' needs at a much more rapid pace. All the benefits of X-Pro that we have predicted are playing out as we roll out across the globe.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHey, good morning. Maybe just a question on the concept of moving into larger trade sizes. You have two newer initiatives here with Adaptive Auto-X, which may help chopping up those blocks into smaller trade sizes, and then the high touch offering that you've been speaking about for the past quarter or so, I guess, what do you see as the bigger opportunity for helping move that block market electronic between those two initiatives near term? How does that compare to how you view the block market evolving over the long run?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. On the block market, first of all, just to put it into context, over 40% of the TRACE market is greater than $5 million in trade size. It's the largest segment of the market that is still largely non-electronic, and solving the transition from phone and chat to an electronic solution is our goal as we set out to roll out new tech and new products for our clients. There is actually an acceptance of moving blocks to an electronic form, provided they replicate the current phone-based market. Protecting from information leakage is probably the key ingredient that we hear from our clients.\nOur high touch solution that we're rolling out in X-Pro, really the first leg of high touch was portfolio trading with the additional pre-trade analytics that we embedded in our portfolio trading solution, but also carrying those pre-trade analytics into our high touch solution for block trade sizes. It's a much more targeted solution where you can target one or several dealers, and what we do is we enrich the platform with unique, proprietary data.\nTwo key data elements that I point out are, one is our AI-based dealer selection tool, which really is looking at dealer activity on our platform, dealer acts information, and helping a trader decide who is more likely to not only respond but win your request for price. The other piece of the puzzle is a new data product called CP Inquiry, which is really designed for both the size and the direction that the trader is trading. It gives real-time price information and predicts price for both your direction as well as your size.\nIt's a critical ingredient to traders that are trading block size liquidity and in need of block size liquidity. Those elements are rolling out in X-Pro in the third quarter. We're excited about that new entry to attack that 40% market. That is what I'd say is underserved by the electronic solutions. Separately, and similar in the target, is our Algo launches, and we're now up to about 40 clients using our Adaptive Auto X Algo solution.\nYou are correct, it is designed to not only help clients trade without crossing spread, but also seek liquidity in a more quiet, less market impact method by slicing your sizes down to smaller trade sizes that is out in the market, and as you suggest, it does target that block market rich. Anything you want to add?\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Kyle, I was just going to add to this because you asked which one. It's really important that we pursue both of these strategies, and I think what clients gravitate to is going to be a function of what's going on in the market. If the markets are relatively calm and the dealers are flush with capital, and they're making markets in large size and taking down risk, then our high touch solutions through X-Pro, where we're giving advice on where a client should go with those orders, is a great way to trade it.\nIf we end up in a much choppier market, and we've seen this time and again in the past where the dealers have tended to back off in terms of liquidity, positioning, and risk positioning, I should say. That's a great opportunity then for clients to use our Algo solutions, and it makes it very easy for them to leave a resting order in the market and wait till others, you know, other clients and other risk takers in the market come to them, whether that's through responding to RFQs or someone engaging directly with that party.\nBoth solutions are being pursued, and we're kind of positioning ourselves to be successful with this regardless of what the market conditions are.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. Ilene, welcome to the call. I wanted to go back to the ICE partnership again, a little bit unusual, so I was hoping again, maybe a little more details around it. Can you maybe talk about sort of the goals that you think this could achieve for both of your combined platforms and how economics will be split either in terms of revenue share or however else is structured? I guess, bigger picture, Munis is still a fairly small part of the market, but are you seeing a push from clients asking you to break down the silos with any other larger liquidity pools, particularly in corporate bonds? Thanks.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, thanks, Alex. It's Rich. This was really about putting out the liquidity to make sure that clients stay with us and keep their orders here. As I mentioned earlier, they like the workflow. It's very effective for an institutional investor to come in. The request we were getting is like, well, we don't want to have to go to another platform to get liquidity, especially on the smallest trades. That's where ICE TMC comes in. Now, they can just come to MarketAxess and they can get all of their trades done. For us, it was very attractive in being able to keep clients on our platform, regardless of the size that they're looking to trade.\nYou know, with regard to the economics, it's pretty straightforward. Each of our platforms, we make money on the trades, Open Trading, transaction fees, and ICE has their fee model for when they're trading. You know, the respective platforms are able to collect the revenue themselves. There's not a payment going one way or the other. It's taken out of a markup, and best price wins. If the level that comes back net of the fees coming across from TMC into MarketAxess, then that will be at the top of the stack, and that's where the investor will trade.\nOtherwise, it might be coming directly from one of our liquidity providers on the system. It's pretty straightforward when it comes to the economics. The last part was about you asked about connecting to other venues. I'd say we're always open to connecting when there's unique liquidity available that we can bring to our clients. That's really the driver for this. Is it going to be additive to the platform? If there's another venue that has the same liquidity sources that we already have, then there's not really much to add in that way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Just one for Ilene. Welcome to the call. Just wondering how you're sort of thinking about balancing growth and margins. It sounds like there's a lot of growth initiatives at the same time. You're trending towards the low end of your target range for OpEx. You're buying back more shares opportunistically. How are you thinking about the priorities there, and any longer term philosophical thoughts on growth versus margin expansion? Thank you.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks so much for the question, Benjamin. We really look to strike the right balance between everything that you're saying. Obviously, growth is incredibly important to us, and you've seen us really invest for growth. You've seen that over the course of the last two years. I think you're starting to see some of the success from those investments and some of that success. Actually, you know, these are not mutually exclusive in terms of concepts.\nIf you think about what happened with expenses, for instance, to your point this quarter, you know, I would put those into two different categories, two different buckets of success. One of them is that we've seen some efficiencies coming through from some of those investments, and you can really see that with a good example is the Pragma acquisition. That's something that we did for both growth and efficiency and really being able to leverage that technology. If we go into sort of expenses again, I'm happy to kind of go into more detail here. I'm sure some folks have some questions about this as well.\nIf you look at sort of, Chris also talked about some really important hires. That have not yet come on and they're not yet in our run rate from an expense perspective, we expect, you know, if you think about sort of other things to drive growth in the back half of the year, that we would see maybe another $10 million in timing of expenses that are not in the current run rate. That includes things like marketing expense, T and E, you know, things like that. Those are, you know, as well as some more technology expense. You can see in the way I'm answering this that these are not mutually exclusive concepts.\nYou can run a disciplined, efficient organization while you are investing and driving growth. I think that's really our focus and our plan.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nDirector and Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nGot it. That's helpful. I'll just jump back in the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt with William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Schmitt\n\nFinancial Services and Technology Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nGood morning. Emerging market volumes continue to be a real bright spot. You know, what's your growth outlook for EM over the next three to five years since electronic penetration is still fairly low there, and is the opportunity, it seems, to be in local currency volumes?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, great question. Obviously, we had a lot of focus on the EM market opportunity in our opening remarks. This is one of the largest markets outside the US credit market, and a market that we are fully engaged in and continue to see signs of growth across our platform and across regions. In particular, we've been adding local markets to our platform, and as you mentioned, seeing sizable growth in that local market arena. In fact, our overall local market revenue was up 22% in the quarter. You know, we're still seeing engagement from our clients across the local markets.\nThere's been changes in the index, the large indexes that are followed by many of our investors. One key ingredient is India being added to the index. We do see that broad EM market still being a very attractive asset across the broader investment arena, and having access to all those local markets is a key ingredient for our platform. One driver that we've seen is growth of portfolio trading across the EM market.\nNot at the levels that we see in high grade right now, but certainly there's higher demand for access to portfolio liquidity in that EM market, and certainly we're seeing some benefits across our portfolio trading tool in EM. The other area that we're seeing growth is in block size liquidity on the platform. We saw a record of block trading in EM on the platform, largely driven from the local markets and the rates nature of those local markets. Again, some very positive factors playing out in that EM market and obviously still highly in demand across our global investors.\n\nJeff Schmitt\n\nFinancial Services and Technology Research Analyst, William Blair\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and welcome, Ilene, to the call as well. Maybe just to go back to the ICE agreement, can you just talk about how we think about market share in the space? Does this change that dynamic in terms of how you're thinking about your overall liquidity pool within the confines of looking at market share? I realize that the revenue will happen where it gets executed. Does that change your reporting in any way in terms of something coming through, say, MarketAxess and getting executed at ICE or vice versa?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks for the question. It's an area that I've spent many a year in. You know, when it comes to routing and both external and internal liquidity, we'll be very transparent around both our market share. It's really based on where the trade reports flow from. Certainly, you have two leading liquidity pools, particularly in munis. We hit a record 8.5% of the muni market in July. We're very excited about the levels of liquidity that we're hitting on our own platform. We also have seen the rise of ICE bonds and the growth that they've seen in the retail segment of the market.\nWe think connecting those two leading liquidity pools really solves a need for clients, which is access to liquidity just more broadly across the market. The structure of this is unique in the bond market, but it's a structure that we've seen in other markets play out quite successfully. When I look at our client needs and where areas of resources are being dedicated, it's largely being dedicated to collection of assets and not really technology solutions for trading assets. We're helping solve those resource needs.\nLarge institutional investors are able to access our platform, and now will be able to access both our platform and another leading pool of liquidity through the ICE Bonds relationship. It's really solving client needs, which is the focus. Obviously, we'll be very transparent on where transactions take place and who's the beneficiary of that revenue getting executed.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nYeah, that's great color. Maybe just on the pricing. Realize a lot of this is due to the mix, certainly between high yield and investment grade. As portfolio trading, or as you're more successful in portfolio trading going forward, do you expect that to be a headwind on pricing, and also the high touch strategy? In contrast, within X-Pro, do you view that as a counter to potential pricing pressure from more portfolio trading?\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nHey Brian, it's Ilene. Nice to talk to you. Let me start on that. Chris might want to come in with some of his fees as well. I would say the first thing to think about when you look at the fee capture and fees per million is overall, how is pricing, what is it looking like, and how are we seeing our fee cards? They've really been stable, so we're not seeing moves or changes really in terms of the overall fee pricing mechanism. It really is protocol and product mix, which you commented on. We do know that, you know, the portfolio trading, obviously we were really quite happy to see our share at 17.2% in July. Obviously, you know, that had some impact.\nOne of the other things I would note, though, is that, you know, our muni business, we also saw good share there as well, and we saw, you know, increasing share there. We had some dealers come on that were part of the muni brokers acquisition, and they're on some legacy fee plans. There are different puts and takes here. I think we also have to remember how this model works in terms of fees as well. If you think of high grade, for instance, and you think of duration, I think we talked a little bit, just, you know, both Rich and Chris have talked about the environment, and obviously it's early days, and we need to see how this all plays out in the macro.\nYou know, I'm sure I don't have to tell you, I know how closely you follow what's going on in the macro. We've seen, for instance, if you think about the curve, we're at a point right now where we see just yesterday a normalizing, albeit for a moment, of twos and tens, and we're seeing really the least inverted relationship over the, I'd call it, last, what, two years in terms of the steepening possibility for steepening of the curve. When you mix that with, if you think about what we're seeing in the rate environment, the forward curve now, you know, as of yesterday was pricing in four or even five rate cuts.\nWe know that just, you know, a few weeks ago, that certainly wasn't what we were seeing in the forward. When you put those macro factors together, we are going to have to see how this all plays out. When you put those together and you think about duration for us, we know, for instance, that those are positive signals for us in terms of how our pricing works there for, you know, high grade. If we remind about the sensitivities there, every one year increase in weighted average years to maturity traded on the platform is a benefit of approximately, call it, $15 in high grade. Then there's also the sensitivity to yields.\nIf we think about the yield curve, the first 100 basis points was lower, seeing a benefit to high grade fee capture of approximately $3 to 5 per million. When you put those together, you know, depending on what goes on, that's $15 to 20 in high grade that you can see in terms of fee capture. I think there's lots of puts and takes here to think about in terms of the model. I would just say overall, keeping in mind that we have not seen differences to the stability of our fee cards. I don't know if you wanted to add anything on top of that.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Brian, I'll just add on the high touch solution that we're rolling out, it is targeting obviously larger trade sizes that come with our traditional capture. There are embedded caps to certain trade fees. What's exciting about that opportunity is because it's direct to dealer and much more targeted to a dealer, we don't have variable costs associated with clearing that trade. It scales from a margin perspective quite attractively at the traditional capture rate that we enjoy on the platform. The variable costs aren't there, so the margin for those trades are technically higher just given the size of the trade, the capture, and the underlying cost.\nIt's just a platform cost. There's no variable cost to it.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. That's great. Thank you both.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi everyone. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if you could. I'm just going back to the comments you're making, Chris, about the past three days. It's short term, but a lot of the things moving in the direction that you would hope to see. I was wondering if you could comment on what the similar dynamics would be. In, say, portfolio trading in terms of overall penetration in the market and the liquidity provided for that protocol in a period of heightened volatility, have you seen any sort of real change in dynamic there? That'd be useful. Thanks\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nAgain, it's three days, so I do want to caveat what we're seeing in just three days. I do think portfolio trading is a key tool adopted by our clients and will remain a tool for our clients to use both in times of high volume and low volume. It's really a question of cost as spreads gap out in this type of environment, both spreads in a single bond as well as a portfolio trade due. We've seen evidence of these gaps in spread. They do gap out in this environment. It just becomes a different trade from what it was just four days ago. We have seen, and it's again three days, but lower levels of PT activity.\nThat said, our clients are in when they have either capital inflows or capital outflows. Depending on the market environment, they may use portfolio trades to enter and exit more quickly in an environment like this where there's certainty of execution. Obviously, over the long period of time, we've seen portfolio trading, mid market trading, like those session based trading, those are harder to execute in heightened volatility versus the low volatility that we've been experiencing for literally the last several quarters, and tightened spreads over the last several quarters. Again, three days does not predict a trend.\nWhat we certainly thought would happen in higher volatility, we're seeing playing out in the market.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director, Redburn Atlantic\n\nGreat, thanks. I guess just to follow up, could you just give us a sense of sort of how you're thinking about the capital allocation going forward as you used your free cash flow, you've clearly got $250 million of buyback authorization here. How you think about putting that to work? Generally speaking, longer term, is there any change to how you're looking at the balance sheet, etc. Thanks.\n\nIlene Bieler\n\nCFO, MarketAxess",
    "content2": "Thanks so much for the question. I would say that if you think about capital optimization, and how we look at it, really driving value for our shareholders with capital optimization, you know, I don't know that I would say that there's a change necessarily. I would start by saying that the new authorization really does reflect, as I said in my comments, the board's confidence in the future performance of the company and our ability to generate cash as we continue to execute on the strategy that Chris and the team have been talking about.\nWe really are a pretty strong cash generative model, and that does allow us to continue to fund growth, to self-fund growth, to make investments, et cetera. Really what this is about is flexibility. There's no expiration on this authorization. It gives us the ability to opportunistically be in the market and buy back when it makes the most sense for our shareholders. In terms of, you know, we're going to obviously continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends, buybacks, opportunistically. If you think about kind of the overall hierarchy, you know, our focus continues to be to reinvest in the business.\nWe really want to drive that long-term opportunity that we see in the fixed income market. You know, we're going to continue to look at bolt-on acquisitions similar to Pragma that we've been talking about that allow us to take technology and leverage it across the tech stack, which is going to enhance our capabilities, add to efficiency. I would say it's really important.\nOne thing I would say about utilizing that cash and balance sheet in that way is that it's really important to do this with the expected amount of rigor and discipline, and that's really important. Third, we'll continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, and be opportunistic with that. That's really what this is about. We just have that additional flexibility now.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director, Redburn Atlantic\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning. I just had a question on information services. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate on some of your key initiatives to drive growth with the information services and technology services businesses that you have. I know in the past you've mentioned some opportunities around indexing and end of day pricing. Just curious where those initiatives stand. What are some of the steps you're looking to take over the next 12 to 24 months? As you sort of look at the contribution of revenues in those lines items today, I guess how do you think about that mix changing as you look out over the next three to five years? Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks, Michael. We're pretty excited about our information services business line. We're excited about the pipeline of product that we're bringing. First, we're bringing product to the platform to help traders determine how to trade, when to trade, and many times in the context of a portfolio trade mark, some of the portfolio construction, and what to trade. There's key ingredients of our data making its way first to the platform, and it's exclusive on our platform. We obviously have some very successful data products like our CP+ data across high grade, high yield, Eurobonds, and more importantly, EM.\nI do think our opportunities in the international sector are quite exciting, particularly those local markets that we've talked about today. Our CP+ for EM is in a backdrop of a market where there's no TRACE, no last sale. These are dark markets, generally broker-driven markets. Having a real-time feed is a very important component to being a dealer or being a client in that market. We do see a great opportunity for our real-time data feed across the international sector, certainly seeing opportunities as we offer that data feed in APAC, in LATAM, and throughout Europe.\nMany of the products that we're putting on the platform, like Tradability, AI Dealer Selection, CP Inquiry, are designed for both how traders engage the market, and that's why they're exclusively on our X-Pro platform. They can also help portfolio managers construct portfolios on any given day. We see an opportunity, a pipeline opportunity, not just at the trader level, but also at the portfolio construction level. Separately mentioned are index opportunities. Obviously, we announced a partnership with MSCI. We're excited about the indexes that we have crafted with MSCI as part of that partnership.\nWe think there's a bigger opportunity in that fixed income index market as more and more products, and more and more investors, move to passive strategies across the fixed income landscape and not just managed strategy. Finally, we haven't talked about it in a while, but the launch of CP+ for Munis is very exciting for us. Not only does it help power our automation suite in the Muni market, which is growing rapidly, but it's a new data product, a new real-time data product in the Muni market, and something that is certainly needed in that market. We see a really heightened opportunity as we roll out CP+ for Munis as well.\nStrong, strong product in the current mix and opportunities for growth, but very excited about the pipeline and the opportunity behind the pipeline of growth as well.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you're connecting to TMC specifically. I was wondering if there's an opportunity to grow this partnership with ICE, could you enable connectivity to ICE's other execution assets like BondPoint and NYSE Bonds as a next step or maybe is there a way to leverage your overlap in fixed income data?\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, hi Eli, it's Rich. Yeah, it's really up to our friends over at ICE. You know, we're connecting in right now. I believe that they have not combined their two retail entities. The other one was BondPoint. It's possible we could connect directly into that one as well. Ultimately, you know, I think that will be coming together, and we'll connect via the existing pipes that we have. It's definitely going to be something we're going to be doing again. It's not just for Munis, it's for corporates as well. If they've got the additional liquidity on their other venue, I'm sure that's one that will tee up in the near future.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nEli, I just add to those comments. I mean, we are excited about the ICE relationship, and more importantly, the retail opportunity that we see in the overall market. We see SMAs growing rapidly. They're at $2 trillion today, expected to go to $5 trillion. We're seeing a great deal of SMA activity on our platform because they traditionally come through the institutional execution areas of large investors, but they also execute on a platform like ICE.\nI think both parties coming together in this unique partnership leverages the growth of the overall retail market, whether it comes through traditional retail, or if it comes through SMA, like we're seeing on our platform. Yeah, a lot of excitement around this partnership and really what it says about our view of market and market structure going forward in the fixed income market.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Do you foresee any regulatory risks of the arrangement given the overlap in meeting execution?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nNo. In fact, these are two connectivity points where their liquidity is their liquidity. It's represented on our platform, and our liquidity will be represented on their platform as well. It's a way for our clients to benefit through a technical connection and a commercial relationship. We would not expect any regulatory concerns around how we structured the partnership.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back to Chris Concannon for closing remarks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you for joining us today. Obviously, we're excited about the macro backdrop in the market, recent volatility, and looking forward to update you at the next quarter. Thank you for joining us today.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Welcome to the MarketAxess Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 7 May 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rich Shiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on the performance of our markets this quarter. I will review the financial results. Before I turn the call over to Chris, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain.\nThe company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2023.\nI would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our Q1 results. Turning to slide 3 of my strategic update, we delivered 4% total revenue growth, including the benefit of our Pragma acquisition, and earnings per share was $1.92 US dollar. While we are not happy with recent trends in our estimated market share in US credit, we recognize the importance of being equally strong in the faster growing areas of the market, and we have a clear strategy to return to higher levels of share growth. We are attacking these faster growing areas of the market while maintaining and building on our leadership in the institutional investor RFQ market.\nOur strength in this segment of the market is underpinned by our leading global client franchise and the largest single source of liquidity in the credit markets, Open Trading. First, in the quarter, our global client franchise continued to expand.\nWe had a record 2,100 active client firms. Next, we delivered record commission revenues across several credit product areas. US high grade commission revenue grew 8%, and we delivered record levels of commission revenue in emerging markets, Eurobonds, and municipal bonds, helping to offset the impact of lower US high yield activity. The benefits of our geographic and product diversification continue to pay dividends. Non US credit revenue was a record $92 million US dollars in the quarter, representing a record 44% of total revenue.\nLast, we continue to be disciplined around our expense management, with total operating expenses increasing only 9%, including the impact of Pragma. We delivered these results against a market backdrop of historically low levels of credit spread volatility, which has created the ideal conditions for growth of portfolio trading and dealer centric protocols.\nThese low levels of volatility have also impacted ETF market participants and hedge funds, decreasing activity in our US high yield business. We believe, however, that our estimated share will recover with more normal levels of spread volatility due to the diversified liquidity on our platform. We were pleased to see an improvement in estimated high yield share in the back half of April. We are encouraged by the strong mutual calendar to the start of the year, as well as the increase in trading velocity. Strong new issuance is an indicator of healthy growth in our market, and increased trading velocity means that dealers are trading more with much smaller balance sheets.\nThis trend should only continue with significantly higher bond yields, making fixed income a very attractive asset class. This is a key attribute of our market today.\nAll our clients need to do more with less, and we are very well positioned to address this need. Slide 4 illustrates how portfolio trading and dealer-initiated trading significantly expanded the overall market in April. Since 2019, portfolio trading and dealer-initiated flow have grown at four-year CAGRs of 38% and 10%, respectively, compared to 2% for client-initiated flow.\nThe growth of these segments is closely linked because dealers typically recycle the risk from a portfolio trade. In the interdealer market for portfolio trading, we have made substantial investments in our PT solution, and the share gains we saw at the end of April indicate that we have designed a very competitive trading solution for our clients. We will continue to rapidly deploy enhancements to our platform, as we are still in the early stages of PT innovation for dealer-initiated flow.\nWe are now delivering the same trading automation tools to dealers and seeking liquidity that have been rapidly growing with investor clients. These tools improve dealers' trading efficiency and help solve their need to rapidly exit inventory risk. Approximately 30% of the liquidity we provide to dealers comes from our investor client firms. Accompanying the electronification of larger size portfolio trades is the explosion in ticket count, as shown on the right-hand side of this slide. X-Pro, our new platform designed to make trading more efficient, is now handling 55% of US credit trade count for our 22 largest clients.\nSlide 5 illustrates key trends in portfolio trading. The growth of PT is a very important step in the evolution of the market. Portfolio trading is a protocol of immediacy, which has helped accelerate the electronification of larger size trades.\nRepresenting approximately 10% of the high-grade and high-yield TRACE market in April, portfolio trading has also allowed traders to do more, more efficiently, and with a streamlined workflow. The impressive growth of portfolio trading shows us the sizable demand our clients have for immediacy and efficiency. With the average notional per line item of a PT trending lower, we believe we must address that demand for immediacy and efficiency in all products and across all types of market environments. This is a great trend for the market overall, and it is a strong indicator of future E-Trading demand for trades of all sizes.\nWe do believe that historically low credit spread volatility has created very supportive market conditions for the recent growth in portfolio trading. Slide 6 frames the US high-grade market opportunity.\nWhile portfolio trading and dealer-initiated trading have been growing faster, we are also continuing our investments in higher-margin, high-quality areas of the market. Our launch of credit algorithms and block trading solutions on X-Pro are targeting the more challenging parts of the market that have not migrated to electronic trading solutions. The client-initiated segment of the market, excluding PT, is an estimated $620 million US dollars revenue opportunity, representing approximately 58% of the total estimated e-trading opportunity in US high grade.\nAs trade sizes greater than $5 million US dollars are broken down into smaller trades, we believe that the higher fee per million, combined with an increase in velocity, can drive this revenue opportunity significantly higher. We believe that the market opportunity over the long term is actually moving into our sweet spot, not away from it.\nIn summary, we are attacking the higher growth areas like portfolio trading and dealer-initiated execution, while we are keeping our focus on building solutions for the largest, most attractive parts of the credit markets. Slide 7, we highlight the client toolkit.\nWe are building for the future.\nMarketAxess is a global network with a privileged position in the credit markets. The unique tools that we are building for traders are being delivered by X-Pro, giving traders a portal to access our powerful data and analytics, our automation and algorithmic trading tools, and the single largest source of liquidity in the credit market. We are an increasingly integrated ecosystem focused on making life easier for traders while solving for our clients. Need to do more with less. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our markets.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Chris. Slide 9 highlights the continued strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,118 active client firms trading on our platforms in the Q1, which included 1,619 client firms active in US credit, and a record 1,066 active international firms. Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 23% year-over-year and represented 18% of total credit volume, up from 16% in the prior year. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow.\nAs shown on slide 10, we experienced another quarter of record automation trade volume and count, with three-year CAGRs of 34% and 40%, respectively, and a record 231 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 10% of our total credit volume, and a record 25% of our total credit trades.\nThere were a record 11 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 50% year-over-year. On slide 11, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies and products, continuing the theme of strength in our international businesses. We generated record international client trade volume and trade count in the Q1. Trade volume was up 13% versus last year, with a 3-year CAGR of 10%. Trade count was up 10% versus last year, with a 3-year CAGR of 19%. A key driver of this strength was record total emerging markets trading volume, up 15% year-over-year, driven by a 28% increase in local currency trading volumes.\nOur LATAM and APAC clients generated record levels of emerging markets ADV in the quarter, up 11% and 55%, respectively.\nWe were pleased to see a strong increase in EM volumes in the Q1, and that strength has continued into April. Emerging markets continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for the company. Last week, we announced that Dan Burke has joined the company as Global Head of Emerging Markets. We're excited to have Dan's experienced leadership in this important and growing business. Access IQ, our front end for private banking clients, generated ADV of $140 million US dollars, an increase of 22%, and record trade count of 62,000, up 54% compared to the prior year.\nWe are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds, with record estimated market share of 6.5%, up from 5.7% in the prior year. Slide 12 provides an update on Open Trading.\nOur market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool, Open Trading, ADV was $4.4 billion US dollars, and share of total credit volume was 34%, down from 37% in the prior year. Hedge fund trade activity has continued to expand on our platform, with record ADV of $1.9 billion US dollars in the quarter, up 30% from the prior year. A total of 202 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 6% increase from the prior year.\nLower volatility and lower price dispersion in the market reduces the price improvement opportunity in OT, as shown on the lower left of this slide, and it has also impacted our high-yield product area, as shown in the chart on the lower right, as ETF market maker activity has declined. Open Trading continues to be the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the US credit markets, driven by our diverse liquidity pool.\nNow let me turn the call over to Steve to review our financial performance.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Rich. On slide 14, we provide a summary of our Q1 financials. We delivered revenue of $210 million US dollars, up 4% from the prior year. These results include $8 million US dollars from the Pragma acquisition. Foreign currency was a $1 million US dollars benefit in the quarter. Information services revenue of $12 million US dollars was up 8%, including a $200,000 US dollars benefit from currency fluctuations. The increase was driven by new contracts as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Post-trade services revenue of $11 million US dollars was up 8%, including a $200,000 US dollars benefit from currency fluctuations.\nThe favorable interest rate environment contributed $6 million US dollars of interest income, up from $4 million US dollars. The effective tax rate was 24.9%, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.92 US dollar per share. On slide 15, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture.\nTotal commission revenue increased $3 million US dollars, or 2%, in the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to stronger estimated market volume across several product areas, mostly offset by lower estimated market share in high yield on lower credit spread volatility. The reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix, specifically lower high yield activity. The decline in fixed distribution fees was driven principally by the consolidation of two global bank trading desk operations. On slide 16, we provide a summary of our operating expenses.\nQ1 operating expenses of $118 million US dollars included $8 million US dollars from Pragma and a $600,000 US dollars negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Based on the progression of expenses in the Q1, operating expenses for full year 2024 are tracking to the low end of the previously stated guidance range of $480 to 500 million US dollars.\nOn slide 17, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $513 million US dollars as of 31 March 2024, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities. We repurchased 47,000 shares in the quarter for a total of $10 million US dollars, and a total of $90 million US dollars remains on the current board authorization. During the trailing 12 months, we paid out approximately $110 million US dollars in quarterly dividends to our shareholders. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 US dollar per share based on the financial performance of the company.\nNow let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Steve. In summary, on slide 18, we continued to execute very well against our growth strategy in the Q1. The increase in new issuance, higher rates, and an increase in velocity of trading all point to a healthy and growing fixed income market. We are disappointed with our market share in US credit, and we've recognized the importance of being equally strong in the faster growing segments of the market. We have a clear strategy to attack these areas, leveraging X-Pro as our delivery mechanism for the retooling of our trading offering.\nWhile we continue to drive adoption of X-Pro with clients, we are maintaining our leadership position in the investor client e-trading space, and our focus continues to be on the largest, most attractive order flow in the credit markets, and building the client toolkit of the future to help our clients do more with less. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you have dialed in and would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. If you are called upon to ask a question or listening via loudspeaker on your device, please pick up your handset and ensure that your phone is not on mute when asking a question. We do request for today's session that you please limit to one question and one follow-up. Again, press star one to join the queue, and our first question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nYeah, morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on portfolio trading. You talked in the past about making roads into the traders who control portfolio trading, who are also the key market participants for block trading. I wonder if you could give us an update on what kind of progress you have made there, adding any new clients, and also the 40% share noted the last day of April. Was that due to one large trade, new clients turning on, or some other factors?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, Chris, thanks for the question. Obviously, we've had a great deal of focus on portfolio trading more recently. As you know, we recently launched our new platform X-Pro just last year, and obviously we launched X-Pro specifically for portfolio trading with an embedded portfolio trading solution just nine months ago. We've been ramping up features and functionality on that platform as well, and we've seen some of the benefits of that. More importantly, we do see that pre-trade analytics, particularly with our proprietary data, is a critical part of that strategy.\nProviding traders with those pre-trade analytics helps them with not only how to trade the portfolio, but also how to construct the portfolio and optimize that portfolio. That's been an area of positive feedback that we've been getting from the portfolio traders in the space. Again, remember, portfolio trading is quite concentrated.\nSomewhere between 30 to 40 traders in the US really drive the largest market share of PT trading, with the largest clients driving the largest share of PT trading. More recently, particularly in April, we saw benefits of the rollout of X-Pro for portfolio trading in April. X-Pro now makes up about 60% of the PT volume that we see on the platform. With regard to your question around that end of month statistic, end of month is a unique time for us, and the market is quite high volumes where people are repositioning their portfolio. You do tend to see a higher number of portfolios.\nIt was not one or two portfolios, it was a series of portfolios that we saw that day. Rich, anything to add on portfolio trading?\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nJust the chunky nature of it and you can have a lot of spikes up and down, Chris, with adoption on any given day. As Chris pointed out, it's a targeted group. It's a relatively small number of PTs that we're all after. We estimate about 20 to 40 per day of substantial size, call it $50 million US dollars and above, and we're all going after those. On the days where we can capture it and we had a great day on month end, you see a number like that 40%. That gives us a lot of confidence that we can carry that on throughout the entire month.\nClients are open to using different platforms, and with the liquidity being the same across, it's a matter of coming up with the best workflows and unique features that are going to attract the traders to our solution.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks. Just on my follow up, I just wanted to ask about X-Pro. You gave us the metric around the top 20 clients, but I'm wondering where you guys stand in rolling it out to your overall client base. Specifically, where are you in the process for signing up with dealers for dealer access up to X-Pro?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure.\nAgain, just to remind everyone, X-Pro is our new platform. It comes with new features and offerings. It really allows clients to trade bonds of any size or complexity, like things like portfolio trading. It also is a cockpit for traders to start their day. It is a unique offering from MarketAxess. We rolled out X-Pro for traditional RFQ last year. We were targeting our largest clients, and within our largest clients, what we call our power users. These are traders that trade higher volumes in ticket count. We've seen since that rollout very positive trends as a result of X-Pro use at the trader level.\nAnecdotally, we've seen somewhere around 20% increase in ticket handling, so there is great efficiency embedded in X-Pro currently with regard to the rollout.\nChris, only about 16% of our total US credit volume is going through X-Pro at this point. We still have a long way to go to accelerate the rollout of X-Pro. As I mentioned earlier, we only launched the PT solution on X-Pro just nine months ago and continue to add additional features, functionality, and obviously pre-trade analytics. We do have an important phase of X-Pro coming this summer. It's our first phase of X-Pro for what we call high touch or block trading. That's regarding your question around dealer content. We are onboarding dealer content as we speak. We're quite encouraged by the dealer feedback around providing content to our platform.\nRemember, our high touch solution or our block trading solution is very dealer friendly. It allows dealers to be in comp without all to all.\nIt allows them to price clients based on a smaller universe of competition. We are also adding to X-Pro what we call unique proprietary data AI Dealer Select, which helps cloud clients select the preferred dealer in a given CUSIP or a given bond. These are all proprietary solutions that we're seeing should be rolled out. Starting in late summer, we'll start seeing additional phases of our X-Pro rollout for what we're calling high touch or block trading solutions.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citi\n\nThanks [audio distortion]\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes, hey, good morning everyone. I know there's a lot of focus on portfolio trading, but if I look at your TAM chart, you clearly think that dealer-initiated opportunities is bigger. You know, maybe you can give us an update there. It's a very crowded space, and you obviously have admitted that you can allay to it. Just seeing where you stand today, any interrupts you've made, any feedback you've got, and how pricing may be a differentiator there in particular.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, hi Alex, it's Rich. You know, we feel really good about our dealer business. It's something that we've been in for a number of years, and we lead there with our flagship protocol, which is RFQ, and we've offered that to dealers for over a dozen years now. You know, its adoption rate is pretty wide. Where we have work to do is on single price auctions or matching protocols, which have become pretty attractive over the past several years in the market. That is a protocol where network effects really matter, and you need critical mass. We have a solution in the market, and now we're actively working on building up the adoption for it.\nWe're doing that in both London for the Eurobond market, and we're doing it here for investment grade and high yield markets.\nIt's an onboarding process and getting the adoption built up, and we're confident we'll be competitive in that space as well. We are working on delivering new tools for dealers, similar to the way that we're rolling out X-Pro for buy side traders. We're going to be doing similar for the sell side traders so that they can more productively access these protocols. It's a combination of traders who use it from a front end tool and also via APIs for the firms that have their own internal trading systems and they want to connect through there in a more efficient manner.\nInvestments in interfaces, investments in protocols, and then also tying those protocols together is something we're focused on so that someone can try. I'm going to be matching at a middle.\nIf I don't get that available, maybe I want to leave a resting order in an order book, or I ultimately want to tap in. I have to sell or have to buy, I'm going to hit the bid or lift the offer using RFQ. It's combining these pieces that we have right now, which are kind of operating independently. We believe that's going to be really attractive to the sell side traders.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nAlex, I'll just add as Rich was mentioning, some of the new protocols and offerings that we're providing the dealers. One important one, which only rolled out in December of last year, is our automation suite. It's quite a popular suite of solutions for our clients. We now provided that Automation Suite to dealers. It is now about between 17% to 20% of our dealer RFQ. It allows dealers to price quite effectively across the spread using an automated RFQ tool. That's well received among the dealers and continues to ramp up. We're seeing positive benefits in our dealer RFQ volumes as a result.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nAll right, very good. Maybe just super quick housekeeping question on FPM, maybe for the Q1 or April. Can you give us a little bit of a breakdown where we stand on the different product types, high yield versus high grade, Eurobonds, et cetera. Thanks.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, hi, Alex, it's Steve here. In terms of the fee per million, you know, in April, we've mostly seen, you know, pretty, pretty stable pricing across the products. What you've seen in April was the impact of higher PT, which definitely dampened it a bit. We were down overall about $2 US dollars per million. A lot of that was PT. I think that the Eurobonds piece was a little bit better if you think about it year-over-year. Last year, remember, we had those crossing trades which depressed the fee per million. It came back this year in April, back to more normal levels around $120 US dollars. Overall, I think pricing is pretty stable. It's just that PT increase in April was outsized.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nFair enough. I'll follow up. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just, you know, not to hammer on portfolio trading, but appreciate the disclosure around market share on the last day of April being 40%. I was hoping, you know, you could just maybe frame, help us frame that. Like how did that compare to the rest of the month and maybe where you've been year to date? Given that this is going to be a big focus area moving forward, is there anything you can give us in terms of guideposts for kind of measuring how you guys are performing from a market share standpoint in portfolio trading? Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, thanks, Patrick. Obviously we expected a focus on portfolio trading today. We've obviously been focused on portfolio trading for some time, particularly with rollout of new solutions to solve the portfolio trading market. We do think that portfolio trade is an important tool for our largest clients. Obviously it's a tool for immediacy and efficiency of trading in this credit environment where we're seeing high levels of demand for fixed income products, that that's a benefit to our client franchise, and we're seeing them convert that demand for fixed income into large portfolio trades. I think the month of April was what I'd call an unusual month for portfolio trading.\nWe saw a number of very large portfolio trades during the month, somewhere around $10 billion US dollars and $7 billion US dollars in size. Those are quite sizable portfolio trades that we haven't seen, almost record size.\nWe expect portfolio trading to continue to be a vibrant part of the credit market, and that's why we're so focused on delivering a solution. You know, as we mentioned, just a number of trades, a handful of trades, can swing market share in the PT market. It's such an important part of our clients' demand for immediacy that we're trying to deliver an enhanced solution through X-Pro to solve the PT. We do think that those pre-trade analytics are a critical part of our traders, and we get positive feedback. We've added things like tradability that help you really analyze your portfolio and make decisions around what should and shouldn't be in the portfolio.\nWe've added other portfolio construction tools as well, and we've also increased the line item capacity so our clients can trade very large line items.\nOver 2,000 line items is part of the demand we're seeing from the largest clients. We do see it as a critical toolkit in our client's toolkit, and we will continue to report. Obviously, we have our monthly reports where we share our PT volume regularly and the overall TRACE PT volume in the market. Hopefully, you could just look out for our monthly reports, and you'll see greater progress throughout the course of the year in our PT volume.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, thanks for that. You repurchased $10.1 million US dollars worth of shares this quarter. I think that was the first or the most significant repurchase you did since the middle of 2022. Can you just talk about that decision and maybe what we should expect in terms of the size and pace of buybacks from here? Thanks.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, hi Patrick, it's Steve here. You know, there's really been no change to our approach with capital. You know, I think we're still focused on the dividend, and our buyback activity is really still focused on just offsetting dilution. You know, I think that we basically front loaded some repurchases about two years ago. We almost put like two years of repurchases a couple of years ago. I think we'll be opportunistic going forward in terms of repurchases, but no change overall in terms of the philosophy for capital.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHi, good morning. Maybe just first on the high yield side, you know, the share has been a bit volatile month to month this year. I guess a question on April with the uptick in share, was that primarily from higher pure ETF market maker flow given some of the elevated high yield ETF volumes we saw in the month, but the systematic traders have remained disengaged, or are you really starting to see in April some of those systematic traders or hedge funds reengage in that market yet that you had called out earlier this year that had kind of pulled back?\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah.\nHi, Kyle. It's Rich. It's a combination. I mean, we were happy to see a little bit of a pickup back from March. 13.9 versus 12.7 from March. We've still got a way to come back, but we're seeing the signs that the market conditions are becoming more favorable. It's a combination of activity from both real money, and from the ETF community. It's definitely trending in the right way here.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nOkay. Maybe one more follow up on PT. You noted some of the added functionality there, but can you remind us of differences in fee structures in your PT offering versus your competitors? I recall there's maybe something you were evaluating in terms of changing the fee structure, the billing for the product. I guess, have any final decisions been made on that, and do you think that could make a difference in positioning the offering competitively in addition to what you're doing in terms of adding the functionality to the product?\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah.\nYeah, thanks, Kyle.\nIt's, you know, it's definitely a competitive space on, on PTs. You know, we've talked about it in the past that the PT fee capture is at a lower rate than in comp business, and substantially lower than, say, all-to-all Open Trading business. You know, there are different ways to, you know, levy the fees. We know there are competitors out there that are trying to make a name for themselves and break into this market, even going sometimes without any fees on it. We are shifting to a model where it's a levying of the fee on the dealer. It's consistent with the way others in the market are charging. We didn't want to have a fee model that was standing out in putting us in an adverse position.\nI'd say competitive on the fees, and consistent in the manner of charging fees with others who are levying fees on these trades.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nSorry, is that already in place? You said the move to bill the dealers, or.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nThat's going to come in place with our next major release, which is coming in the next few weeks.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nUnderstood, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Sticking with the topic of PT, was hoping you could just talk about what you think the normal steady state of this protocol is as a percentage of volume or where it could get to. I think you put out some numbers previously, but the market has continued to evolve. Was hoping to get your updated thoughts on kind of what you think that protocol can ultimately be on a consistent basis.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, I'll take that. We certainly are at fairly historically low levels of credit spreads and credit spread volatility. That certainly creates a ripe environment for not only portfolio trading but also the dealer to dealer mid market match solutions. We certainly see at these levels of volatility that we've witnessed here in 2024, and certainly at times during 2023, higher levels of PT and higher levels of mid market matching solutions. We, you know, as credit spread volatility can increase, we do see it impacting levels of PT. Certainly in April we had some spikes of volatility.\nDuring those periods, we saw slight decreases in PT during the trade day. We continue to see a high level of PT throughout the month of April as volatility declined.\nWe are not, certainly not predicting that these levels, historically low levels of credit spread volatility, will remain for a continued period of time. They typically go through cycles. We do think portfolio trading, that said, portfolio trading will be an important tool for our clients, and they will continue to remain at levels that we're seeing today. We don't expect massive growth of the PT market over time. We do think it'll probably stabilize at a certain level and be just another important part of the market ecosystem.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Dan, I'll just add to that. I mean it's definitely here to stay. It provides a lot of benefits to clients in terms of the workflow. You know, it's going to be interesting to see what happens when the market environment changes and volatility increases and the PT becomes a relatively more expensive trade, whether it's still going to maintain the kind of, you know, percent of the market. Right now we're seeing, you know, roughly around 10%.\nWhether that number goes down or stays the same, you know, I would not think that that's a number that's going to rise in a high volume environment when it becomes relatively more expensive, you know, versus doing trades in comp. Something to consider.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you. Just as a follow up on expenses, I know it's early in the year, but you're already tracking towards the low end of the guidance for this year. I guess first, what has changed since the initial guidance a couple months ago? As we think about the rest of the year and the factors that are going to take you below, lower than the low end, or back towards the midpoint or higher, what are those? Is that just volumes, is it market share, or what are the other factors?\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, hi Dan, it's Steve here. I think if you step back, we're exiting a period of some pretty substantial investments that we've made with X-Pro, our proprietary data adx. I think we've come out of that period in the Q4. We achieved some significant, you know, efficiencies coming out of the year. I think, you know, what's going on in the organization is that we're more disciplined as we look at the expense base coming out of that spending, and we're looking for opportunities to really be more efficient, you know, across the board, but at the same time ensure that we're really maximizing our investments for the future because we do have that, you know, huge runway. Runway.\nI think that as we went through the Q1, I think we saw some opportunities to achieve, you know, incremental efficiencies. I think that, you know, as we move through the year, you'll probably see a bit of a bump up in terms of incremental new hires given the normal seasonality. I think that, you know, the Q1 run rate in terms of comp is probably a pretty good place to be, $61 million US dollars or $62 million US dollars. That reflects the incremental hires that we should be making throughout the remainder of the year. Just remember that there is that seasonality in terms of our hiring through the year. I think we feel pretty good coming in at the end, at the bottom of the range right now.\nWe'll continue to monitor that and update you as we progress through the year.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nI would just remind you that 18% of our expenses are variable. That's the piece that can move up or down with volumes. That's an important component to how we think about our guidance. As we mentioned earlier in the call, we're tracking to the lower end of our guidance, and it's just too early to update where we think we'll end up being in the year.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director, Jefferies\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Jeff Schmitt from William Blair. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Schmitt\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGood morning. On X-Pro thinking, how does it execute portfolio trades differently than what you were doing sort of prior to its rollout? I guess importantly though, like how does it compare to competitors now? Do you have any edge there? Yeah.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nHi Jeff. It's Rich. From an execution perspective, it's consistent, and we have the back end of the trading system that's managing this. The real productivity gain and the difference maker is on the front end and how traders interact with our capabilities. Okay, think of X-Pro. It's a modern interface. It's designed to better handle large lists and be able to manipulate them more readily, which is something that was more challenging, let's say, to do in our legacy application. The back end is leveraging all of the capabilities that we have in terms of how we process trades and how we send them through post-trade and downstream to the parties.\nIt's that interaction at the front level, at the user interface that is really making a difference, and that is where we're going to be doing all of our new front-end development, in this new tool. We were saying earlier it's not just isolated to PTs, although that's where our major focus is at the moment. It's also going to be the front end that traders use for the high touch initiative, and it's already actively used today by traders who need to manage large lists, for example. We can do several hundred line items in comp, RFQ in comp, much more easily than we can do in the old interface.\nThat's going to be the area of significant investment for us, and we believe that's going to be well received by the traders and will lead to more business.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nJeff, I'd just add that X-Pro, both portfolio trading tool and X-Pro for RFQ, are all built in cloud-based technology. It's all new tech that we've rolled out here. It also allows us to make changes and introduce new features and functionality in a more rapid development environment. We've seen changes rolled out really from trader feedback back out into production within weeks rather than within quarters and months. It's a very powerful tool, not just from the proprietary data that we can embed in it and all the pre-trade functionality that we can offer a trader, but it also speeds up our delivery to market for any new features, functionality, or data that we're providing.\nThat makes it highly competitive for us in an already competitive environment.\n\nJeff Schmitt\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGreat. A question on your high-grade market share. Could you discuss how institutional RFQ share is trending? I mean, is that a part of into the drop at all? Thank you.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, on the share, I mean we did see a bit of a decline. We are, you know, upon analyzing that, it's definitely due to the pickup in portfolio trading that occurred. Also, on the dealer business, we attribute it mostly to those two factors, and hence the extra effort that we're making in both of those areas. Those are the two significant investment areas for us to regain share.\nWe think in terms of our, in comp, client to dealer RFQ business on very solid grounds with that, and Open Trading being the difference maker in terms of the liquidity pool and our ability to do all the in comp activity very efficiently for clients. It is largely due to the challenges in PT right now and dealer business, dealer-initiated business.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nI would just add that our high-grade market volumes did increase in Q1 by 18%. Our block trading ADV increased as well, and more importantly, our automation continues to grow within the high-grade market. That's one area where we're highly penetrated throughout that area, and we continue to see more automation ramping up. In Q1, automation was up 40%, and that automation volume is quite sticky. We see people moving into automation and remaining at those levels. Across the high-grade market, we've seen growth, we've seen records, and more importantly, we've seen sizable penetration with our automation solution.\n\nJeff Schmitt\n\nResearch Analyst, William Blair\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please ask your question.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, guys. Maybe just sticking with X-Pro, I think you quoted about 16% of your volume now is running through X-Pro, and it's accounting for 60% or nearly 60% of your portfolio trades. Maybe if you can just comment on where you ultimately want to get that to, where you think you can get X-Pro to in terms of your overall volume. To what extent is portfolio trading a big part of that process? If the market does shift back away from portfolio trading over time because of higher credit spread or volatility, how do you see that algorithm working within X-Pro of getting more of your volume on and having that expand your overall market share.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat question. Obviously, X-Pro is designed to replace our legacy user interface for our clients. We intend to put X-Pro in front of all traders and all clients globally. You'll see X-Pro rolling out in Europe and throughout the international client base this summer. We're excited to continue the rollout of X-Pro not just for traditional RFQ, but more importantly for portfolio trading. As I mentioned, we started that rollout for what we call power users. That's where we see the biggest benefit.\nThe workflow efficiency designed in X-Pro does help those users, and we do think that the portfolio trading tool is also a benefit. Rich mentioned some of the features and the benefits of longer, larger line item capacity on X-Pro. We do see the biggest opportunity for X-Pro is really this summer and the quarters ahead around the block trading solution.\nOne of the biggest feedbacks that we hear from our clients and traders are information leakage with regard to all to all. X-Pro allows our clients to easily engage dealers directly, either one on one or multi dealers in an RFQ that's being rolled out and should really, we're targeting the, call it, the $3 to 10 million US dollars size bucket, which is a very large part of the TRACE market here in the US. Really, X-Pro is designed to touch every trader, every client, and across all our products when we're done with the overall rollout. More importantly, as I mentioned, X-Pro does allow us to move at a quicker pace from a development and delivery standpoint.\nThat's the most exciting part about this new technology. As we roll out across the client base. Rich, anything to add?\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's great, actually. That leads into a second follow-up question on that, and that's the large block sizes. I think you quoted that last time at like 30% of the market is trade sizes over $5 million US dollars. That's obviously been the area where more has been done with voice over time, and it's been tougher to crack, I guess. What is your view on that part of the market electronifying over, say, the next, call it, three years or so as sort of the next leg of the electronification of the market?\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Brian, it's Rich. I mean, we think it's going to increase, and I've said before we're going to see a high penetration rate across all sizes. Some of that might just be trade processing, and you know, more efficient ways to do a bilateral trade with a known dealer, and that's fine.\nThat's part of what you know this portion of X-Pro is designed to do very efficiently, but we want to make sure that we've got a way to, when a trader puts their orders into our system, that they have a variety of ways that they can trade that, whether it's going to be recommending to them who the likely dealers are to engage, whether it's just processing a trade bilaterally with a trade that's been executed, maybe on the phone, let's say, or it might be engaging in Open Trading in some way with clients that we're able to identify who are likely to engage with that party on the trade.\nThink of it as a central point where that trader can access all of the tools that MarketAxess has available.\nThe different ways of trading across our variety of protocols, all from one place where they manage their order. That's the key part of it, is once their order is in X-Pro, they can kind of launch off in these different directions depending upon what's available, what's best recommended for that, how they want to operate, all from one point, which is a little bit different than the way our legacy system works, which is a bit more siloed in the capabilities and, you know, making the trader work a little harder to tap into the capabilities. With X-Pro, it's all central and available right from their order.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nBrian, I would just add that, you know, we hear regularly from our clients that they obviously want to do more with less. They're not hiring traders on their desks. That's a trend that we've seen. This area of the market is a fairly inefficient area from just a workflow perspective. You can imagine using phones and chat as not being the end result of this market evolution. What we're trying to do is replicate their experience on phone and chat, minimizing information leakage to just the right important dealers in that CUSIP. Both the data, the pre trade analytics, and the content where we're collecting and pumping through X-Pro will help those traders.\nOne, identifying the size of their order that the market can consume, and two, the best dealers to interact with for that specific order.\nWe're pretty excited about the opportunity to convert a sizable portion of what is today phone and chat market onto the electronic platform. It's definitely one thing we see from portfolio trading, and the demand for portfolio trading is the need for immediacy, certainty, and efficiency of workflow is high, at an all time high among our clients as they see more capital flowing into their own platforms. They are not, they are not hiring traders to solve that influx of capital.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's great. That's great color. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley",
    "content2": "Great. Thank you. I have a question on Pragma. Maybe changing topics away from PT. I was hoping you could update us on the progress there with Pragma. Maybe you can elaborate on the contribution in the business, how you see the growth path ahead, and strategically. Maybe you could update us on how you see this being strategically additive to the firm.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure.\nObviously, we closed on the Pragma transaction in the Q4, and we're quickly integrating Pragma into the broader MarketAxess technology framework. We're excited about some of the technology synergies that we're seeing. Obviously, Pragma has been a key ingredient to the launch of the first credit algo in the credit space. We're excited to see that algo and the demand and the feedback that we're getting from clients on the algo. More importantly, Pragma, we're seeing opportunities to use Pragma technology throughout our technology footprint. Right now, Pragma is consuming some of our automation suites.\nWhat we want to do, the goal of the current integration, is to have both algos and automation all be part of one suite of offering.\nYou can get basic auto RFQ, basic autoresponder, and a suite of algos all within the same API or the same suite of selection of products. Pretty excited about the integration of Pragma in automation. The next piece of integration that we see playing out is the Pragma EMS solution. It is able to maintain order state, control orders, and connect multiple destinations. Obviously, we're using the various protocols within MarketAxess, but we do see an opportunity for that EMS technology to be deployed further in the market.\nWe see further integration of Pragma. It's an important technology acquisition for us, and we're actually seeing higher benefits of the synergy of that technology. We also plan on using Pragma in our dealer-to-dealer business.\nWe think there's interesting solutions, not only automation that we're rolling out for dealers, but new protocols in that dealer suite of products as well, particularly around the mid matching solutions that we see in that market. Still early days for our excitement around the Pragma acquisition, but we definitely see it becoming a more important footprint in the overall technology footprint of MarketAxess.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, just a follow up question if I could, on emerging markets. Great to see the renewed strength, particularly in the local markets, particularly in April. Just curious what you're seeing there, maybe you can elaborate a bit more broadly on the EM initiatives that you have in any particular regions that you're particularly more focused on, and where do you see scope for more innovation ahead in EM?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure.\nOn the EM front, pretty excited about the growth that we've seen in EM in Q1. Obviously, we were seeing lower volumes in 2023, and we weren't expecting that to change. It did change, and obviously saw record volumes, record ADV, and obviously record commission revenue up almost 11% in Q1. One interesting area that we've seen growth, and it's really as a result of growth of protocol, is that our block trading ADV is up almost 34% year-over-year in the Q1. We're excited about that block trading growth, certainly a predictor of hopefully further block trading growth across all our products.\nThe other area of sizable growth was our local markets. Obviously, they are up 30% in Q1 year-over-year.\nThe local markets, obviously the bigger market opportunity in the EM market, close to 80% of the overall volume is estimated to be within the local markets, and then areas of excitement. Obviously, we've seen our APAC volumes grow year-over-year. APAC was up 33% in Q1, and APAC was up even further in April, almost up about 40%. Out of APAC, we're seeing APAC as a key driver of our emergency volume. Our local market volume in particular was up from APAC almost 60%. That international growth and our international expansion is reaping benefits across our EM market, particularly the APAC growth rates that we were seeing in Q1, and then that continued into April.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question, just one for me. You spoke extensively today and just over the last couple of quarters that the path towards more of sort of bridging the gap in IG with some of the market share is likely going to come from PT and dealer-initiated RFQ. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing and the fee per million in both of those? I think you kind of hit on the PT a little bit, just how does that compare to the kind of $150 US dollars, $160 US dollars that you're running at a credit right now, and do you expect that your initiative there to put more pricing pressure on that part of the market as a whole for other competitors as well? Thanks.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Alex. Hi, it's Rich. Yeah, I did mention about the fee capture in PT being lower with dealer business, which tends to be, it's an Open Trading, it's an all-to-all type of business where we're delivering more value. Our fee capture is relatively higher there. One of the things I should note is when we deliver liquidity to dealers, about 30% of the time that comes from buy side firms, not just other dealers. That's some of the most valuable connections that we can make and allows us to charge a relatively higher fee for that. I think the prospects for fee capture in the dealer-initiated side of the business is quite promising.\nWe should note, and it was pointed out during the prepared remarks, that we see plenty of opportunity for growth in the traditional client-to-dealer in comp business, leveraging Open Trading and being able to make those connections between clients directly with each other, and to other dealers and things. That remains also attractive from a fee capture perspective. The most challenging area, the lowest fee capture, is definitely on the PTs. It is very much a workflow solution and less about the benefits that we can deliver as a marketplace.\nIt's when we're operating as a marketplace and connecting, you know, the thousands of participants in it that gives us the opportunity for richer fee capture.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI got you, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Ben Budish from Barclays.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBen Budish\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nThanks for taking the question. I just wanted to double check on the dealer-initiated segments. I don't think you talked about how much of that of your business that comprises today. Can you maybe talk about that and where it's been in the past, and then looking forward, if you think about how much of that piece can electronify versus, you know, the broader market in IG, how do you think about the potential there versus, you know, client-to-dealer and some of the other trade types? Thank you.\n\nRich Shiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. Hi Ben, it's Rich again. No, we definitely feel strongly about our opportunities there. You could say, roughly speaking, it's about 30% of our RFQ activity is coming from dealers initiating on the RFQ side. That has room to grow. As I was just saying, it's a promising area of fee capture. That's right now using our RFQ protocols as we introduce our matching solutions in the market, which we know has been very attractive to firms, and also our order book live markets is another area that we think is going to be attractive to that user base. It's pretty significant.\n\nBen Budish\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nGot it. That was all for me, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Eli Abboud from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Can we have a little bit more of an update on Adaptive Auto-X? I think last quarter you mentioned that 13 clients were using it. How has penetration progressed, and what can you share about the early feedback? Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure.\nThanks, Eli. Yeah, we're pretty excited about the innovation of Adaptive Auto-X. As I mentioned earlier, the first client algorithm launched in the credit space. Right now, we have 25 clients live on Adaptive Auto X. There are about 30 clients approved, still waiting to be onboarded. There are more, obviously, in the pipeline. We also are excited about a new launch of an algo this summer, really a dynamic liquidity taking solution. The feedback has been quite positive, the feedback from clients. We have some very large clients waiting in the queue, in the pipeline. We've obviously been showing demos of the product to all our clients, and the feedback has been quite positive..\nAgain, it's still early days with this product rollout, but we're just seeing a healthy, healthy outcome in terms of execution quality, both in terms of avoidance of spread, as well as with some of the larger blocks being sliced into smaller sizes. We're also seeing better trade execution quality as a result of limiting market impact from executing larger block sizes. Again, early days with the product, but pretty exciting feedback, and obviously the demand is quite high given the size of the client onboarding that we're dealing with right now.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nGot it. You mentioned that block trading had a particularly strong quarter earlier. How much of this is attributable to this early progress on Adaptive Auto-X, or is it other technologies and protocols that are driving that progress so far?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nReally, the block trading that we're seeing, the success in, particularly in EM, we offer a request for market that has been an offering, a protocol that we launched quite some time ago, and that's really been driving some of our block trading experience here. As I mentioned, in EM, block trading was up 34%. The other areas, obviously in EM, is local markets. We're seeing larger block size in local markets as well. I also mentioned in investment grade, block size running through our current platform is where we're seeing an increase in block trading. We also mentioned that our intent is to roll out X-Pro for a high touch.\nAgain, that's targeting the block size market, and that's still to come in the coming quarters.\nA lot of opportunity around the block size solution, both from algorithms breaking down blocks as well as solving blocks for electronic trading by just reducing information leakage for those size trades.\n\nEli Abboud\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Bank of America\n\nAwesome. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the conference back over to Chris Concannon for closing remarks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat. Well, thank you for joining us today. We're exceptionally excited about the things that we're building and rolling out this summer, and we look forward to updating you on our progress at our next quarter call. Thanks, everyone, for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 31 January 2024. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Q4 and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on how we executed this quarter, and then I will review the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our Q4 and full year results. Our underlying revenue growth trends improved during the Q4 as we continue to execute our growth strategy. We delivered 11% revenue growth, including the benefit of our Pragma acquisition. Earnings per share was $1.84, an increase of 16%. US high-grade transaction revenue increased 14%, emerging markets increased 8%, and Eurobonds increased by 7%. With these improved results in the quarter, we delivered our 15th straight year of record annual revenue. Turning to my strategic update on slide 3, first, we are delivering innovation with the launch of our new trading platform, X-Pro, designed to address our US credit market share challenges by retooling the delivery of our trading offering.\nWe are pleased to see our portfolio trading clients increasingly leveraging our unique pre-trade analytics like Tradability, which are only available through X-Pro. 30% of our portfolio trades were executed on X-Pro in the Q4, up from 18% in the Q3. Next, we are enhancing our suite of automation tools with the addition of Pragma. We delivered new records across our automation suite of products in the quarter. Our automation products crossed a record $300 billion in volume for the full year in the Q4. Adaptive AutoX, our new client Algo solution, moved out of the pilot phase during the quarter with a total of 13 clients, including six of the largest. Early results show promising transaction cost savings. US high-grade and last, in terms of execution, our client franchise has never been stronger.\nWith a record 2,100 active firms, we delivered strong growth in our international businesses, portfolio trading, and municipals. We also generated record revenue in both our market data and post-trade businesses, as our investments to broaden our geographic and product footprint continue to pay off. Slide four summarizes how powerful data and content on our platform is helping traders achieve better trading outcomes. We want to capture the full spectrum of order flow in the market by helping traders manage their portfolio composition, protocol selection, and counterparty optimization. Our data is at the core of these new initiatives we are delivering through X-Pro. From growing portfolio trading market share to increasing our share of larger size trades, our proprietary data is what differentiates us from other market solutions.\nIn 2023, we had a record $390 million price responses from liquidity providers across our platform, which is growing at a three-year CAGR of 11%. This unique data set and the magnitude of this price information is what powers our proprietary data insights that we generate for clients on X-Pro. Slide five highlights our action plan for stronger market share growth in corporate bonds in 2024. Using US high grade as a case study, we've done a very good job of electronifying small-sized tickets, which has been the key value proposition of MarketAxess since our founding. While the history of electronification would indicate that the largest, most complicated block trades would be the last to adopt electronic solutions, our market has jumped right to the largest and most complicated trades, the portfolio trade.\nWhat is left in the middle is trade sizes $5 million or greater, which is the target market for the rollout of X-Pro. We have heard from our clients that they need better data and workflow solutions to manage this part of the market. In this environment, hiring more traders is not the answer. To help our clients manage protocol and counterparty selection for larger size trades, we have launched Tradability and AI Dealer Select. Tradability helps determine depth of market, while AI Dealer Select helps clients determine the right dealers to engage with Adaptive Auto-X. We are also helping clients manage larger size trades by leveraging our different trading protocols, including Open Trading, helping clients manage small and large size trades with pre-trade data and analytics. Growing our share of portfolio trading and enhancing our dealer-centric trading protocols like Dealer RFQ are key objectives for 2024.\nSlide six provides an update on market conditions in the Q4. ETF market maker ADV on our platform was up 68% from the Q3 as market conditions improved, but was still down 19% from the prior year. Since the Fed's pivot in early December, we have seen a pickup in duration, which has had a positive impact on our US high-grade fee capture. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on January activity with one final important trading day remaining in the month. January trends show solid low double-digit growth in US high-grade ADV year over year, with estimated market ADV up approximately 15%, indicating lower estimated market share. January is historically a lower market share month, given seasonally strong new issuance in January.\nOver $190 billion has been issued to date in January, making it the highest January on record. As a result, trading in newly issued bonds represented approximately 15% of the market, up from an average of 8%. US high-yield ADV is down approximately 30% from elevated levels in the prior year. The decline is driven by lower ETF market maker activity, increased focus on distressed names that do not lend themselves to electronic platforms, and an increased focus on a strong new issue calendar. By our long-only accounts, estimated market ADV is down approximately 9%, indicating significantly lower estimated market share. Portfolio trading is on track to be a record month with ADV of approximately $800 million, up approximately 160% from the prior year. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our market.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Chris. We made significant progress this quarter advancing our trading business. Slide eight highlights the strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,108 active client firms trading on our platforms in the Q4, which included a record 1,638 client firms active in US credit trading. Volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 37% year over year and represented 17% of total credit volume in the quarter, up from 14% in the prior year. On slide nine, we highlight the expansion of our trading business across geographies and products. Q4 growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count was 17% and 19%, respectively. This was driven by strong Eurobond trading volume, up 13%, and strong emerging local markets trading volume, up 26%.\nLocal currency ADV is growing at a three-year CAGR of 21%, and trade sizes $5 million and larger represent 60% of our trading volumes. AxessIQ, our front end for private banking clients, generated record ADV of $141 million, an increase of 67% compared to the prior year. We are also seeing strong product diversification in municipal bonds with record ADV of $539 million. These strong results were driven by record tax-exempt trading volume, up 14%. We had a record 369 active firms on our municipal bond platform, and we are continuing to integrate muni brokers with Open Trading to expand sources of liquidity for investors and dealers. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow as shown on slide 10.\nWe experienced record automation trade volume and count in the quarter, with three-year CAGRs of 39% and 49%, respectively, and a record 185 active automation client firms. Automation trade volume now represents 11% of our total credit volume and a record 25% of our total credit trades. There were a record 10 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 40% year over year. To share an example of client penetration, our largest automation client executes twice the automation volume of the next largest fund complex. The firm has made a significant investment in automation. We believe this is due in part to an increasing need to manage large inflows and smaller sized tickets. There were a record 2.2 million trades of $100,000 or greater in US credit on TRACE in the Q4, up 15% from the prior year and nearly double Q4 2021 levels.\nSlide 11 provides an update on Open Trading. Our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool, Open Trading, ADV was $4 billion, and share of total credit volume was 36%, down from 38% in the prior year, but up from 34% in Q3 2023. A record 202 hedge funds provided liquidity through Open Trading in the quarter, a 9% increase from the prior year. Open Trading is consistently the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the US credit markets. We delivered approximately $702 million in price improvement to our clients in 2023 on lower levels of credit spread volatility during the year. Lower volatility in high yield in mid 2023 had a negative impact on ETF market maker activity, as shown in the chart on the lower right.\nAs activity decreased, Open Trading share of high yield moved from 50+% at the end of 2022 to approximately 47% in the current quarter. Our launch of Open Trading in select local markets, including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and South Africa, is off to a strong start. We were pleased to see the uptick in EM market volumes in the Q4. Given the lower levels of growth over the last two years, emerging markets continues to be a very attractive growth opportunity for the company. Now let me turn the call over to Steve Davidson to review our financial performance.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Rich. On slide 13, we provide a summary of our Q4 financials. We delivered revenue of $197 million, up 11% from the prior year. These results include $8 million from the Pragma acquisition, of which $6 million is in commission revenues and $2 million is in the technology services revenue line. Foreign currency was a $2 million benefit in the quarter. Record information services revenue of $12 million was up 15%, including a $400,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. This strong performance was driven by new contracts, as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite, especially CP+. Record post-trade services revenue of $11 million was up 24%, including a $600,000 benefit from currency fluctuations. The favorable interest rate environment contributed $6 million of interest income, up from $3 million.\nThe effective tax rate was 16.9%, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.84 per share, up 16%. Earnings per share benefited from a lower effective tax rate driven by return to provision adjustments and the purchase of transferable tax credits by the company. On slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue increased $13 million, or 8%, in the quarter. The increase in credit commission revenue was due to stronger estimated market volume and higher fixed distribution fees, partially offset by lower estimated market share and lower average fee per million. The VIX of 15 in the quarter was a key driver of a decrease in ETF market maker activity, which negatively impacted our US high-yield market share.\nThe reduction in total credit fee capture from the prior year was driven principally by product mix, with lower high-yield volume and protocol mix driven by an increase in portfolio trading. On slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Q4 operating expenses of $120 million included $9 million from Pragma, $2 million in acquisition-related expenses and costs associated with efficiency initiatives, and a $2 million negative impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On slide 16, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid, with cash and investments totaling $586 million as of 31 December 2023, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities during the past 12 months. We paid out approximately $109 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.74 per share, an increase from $0.72 per share based on the financial performance of the company. On Slide 17, we provide you with our full year 2024 guidance. Revenue from Pragma is expected to grow in the mid single digits. Pragma's revenue was $8 million in Q4 2023. We expect total expenses to be in the range of $480 million to 500 million off a base of $438 million in 2023. This would imply a growth rate of 12% to the midpoint of the 2024 range. This includes the impact of Pragma, approximately $10 million in efficiency savings in 2024 from the actions taken in 2023, and $4 million in acquisition related expenses and costs related to the efficiency initiatives included in the 2023 base.\nWe expect the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Capital expenditures are expected in the range of $60 million to $65 million, of which roughly 80% relates to capitalized software development costs for the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Steve. In summary on slide 18, we continued to execute very well against our growth strategy in the Q4. The market backdrop improved through the Q4, supported by a potential pivot from the Federal Reserve in December. Our focus in 2024 is on growing corporate bond market share by leveraging X-Pro to retool the delivery of our full suite of products and services. X-Pro will be integral to bringing all our data, automation tools, and protocols together to address trades of all sizes and complexity. Our client network has never been stronger, with continued expansion across client segments, regions, and products. As we continue to execute and deliver on our key focus areas for 2024, we believe we are well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the quarters ahead. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, at this time I would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. Please limit to just one question. Your first question comes from Chris Allen with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nYeah, morning guys. I was hoping you could help us unpack the January commentary. Market share declined in high grade. No surprise there, given the issuance levels. High yield implied market share is about 13%, which is a fairly low level. Just trying to understand the share dynamics, maybe the traction you're seeing on X-Pro versus other protocols, and what's contributing to kind of the share declines, maybe a little bit more. The high yield on the high grade.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks, Chris. First, I want to remind everyone we have our monthly release coming out on Monday. You'll have all the details on Monday. We did want to provide some level of commentary because we obviously anticipated questions on the January results. Really, first, let's take a step back and take a look at the macro market. The macro market that was unfolding in December as a result of the Fed Pause has been very favorable for our market, but more importantly, the broader bond market. We started seeing behavioral changes that were positive in December from overall market volumes. Some of those same factors that we saw in December are continuing to 2024. It's an attractive rate environment. Bonds are great investments. Again, I know people are interested in Bitcoin, but bonds are much safer investments with great yield.\nWe're also seeing that in the numbers. If you're looking at reallocations that typically happen at the beginning of a year, we're seeing those reallocations play out into fixed income, both at the retail level, but also at the institutional level. The overall market backdrop is quite positive. We also see a very high demand for new issue in January, and that's really reflective of that market backdrop. We're seeing really a record January new issue closing in over $200 billion in new issue in the month of January. That too is a positive sign that issuers are coming to market in this higher yield environment and find it quite comfortable to be issuing debt in this overall market environment. All those are very positive for the bond market more broadly.\nAs a result, we're seeing high-grade market volumes up 20% year over year and up 40% from Q4, from December actually. Those are all very positive signs of the overall market environment. Our market share in a big new issue month is typically challenged, but we do end up seeing, and again today is month end, and so we do have a very large active day left in the month. We typically do see very strong month-end activity. When we see that high new issue activity in the month, people obviously moving out of those new issues and rebalancing happening, and a sizable index rebalance is also happening. We do think today will be a very strong day left in the month. That's why I don't want to speculate on results at this point.\nHigh grade market share has been stable throughout the month. We're seeing portfolio trading activity, we're seeing our typical long only clients being very active across the high grade market. A very stable market share month in high grade. High yield, as you mentioned Chris, is certainly a different story. The high yield market volumes are flat year over year. We are seeing investors not showing a big appetite for high yield. We have seen a high yield new issue this month, which is sizable for the month. Where we see really a decline in overall market activity is across the hedge fund and ETF market maker segment. It is a broad decline across that segment. We're not seeing or feeling any competitive pressures there. When we talk to those clients, they are indicating that the overall market environment for their models and their business has declined.\nIt's really a segment challenge. In the high yield market, you see that in the high yield ETF volumes are down 20% year over year. There just continues to be a thematic challenge within that high yield market. We saw that in the second and Q3 as well. We did see some pickup in the Q4 in high yield. Really, that high yield challenge continues. Other areas of our business, EM had a very challenging 2023. The investment thesis was not attractive relative to where yields were at high grade market share or even treasury market. The end market volumes were challenged. We're seeing a pickup. We saw a pickup in EM volumes in Q4, and we're actually seeing a positive trend continue into January in EM with market volumes up close to 10%.\nWe've even seen we're approaching a record in our APAC volumes. We're seeing, you know, positive activity across the international business in January. Hopefully that. That's a long-winded answer, Chris, to remind everyone that we do have a market volume release coming out on Monday.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director, Citigroup\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nAll right, our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes. Hey. Hello everyone. Just staying on market share, zooming out a little bit obviously. Thanks for that chart. I think that's new, that breaks down the TRACE volumes by kind of size of trades and where you focus, and obviously a lot of initiatives going on. When I think about your core business.",

I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThank you, Krista. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company. Rich Shiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on how we executed this quarter. Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGood morning. I'm very pleased to update you on the significant progress we made in the third quarter to enhance our franchise and drive long-term growth. First, in terms of the quarter, we generated revenue of $172 million. Earnings per share was $1.46 on net income of $55 million. Our quarterly results were impacted by unusually low levels of credit spread volatility during this seasonally slower summer period.\nWe are seeing some early positive signs of higher volatility in October. We are not happy with our growth rates in US Credit, but we believe we are taking the right steps to improve our growth rates in our business in the years ahead. Turning to my strategic update on Slide three, we continue to innovate through the launch of our new trading platform, X-Pro. X-Pro delivers our proprietary data for pre-trade analytics and protocol selection.\nWe specifically targeted portfolio trading solutions in X-Pro to address our US High Grade market share challenges. In low volatility market environments, protocols like portfolio trading become more prevalent, with portfolio trading rising to 7% of TRACE during the quarter. Activity on dealer centric protocols also increases in low volatility markets, and we are continuing to focus on growing our Mid-X and Dealer RFQ protocols.\nWe believe that we have a superior Dealer RFQ solution because of our comprehensive Open Trading liquidity. We are pleased to see our portfolio trading clients increasingly leveraging our unique pre-trade analytics like Tradability, only available through X-Pro. Thirty-five percent of our portfolio trades were executed on X-Pro in October month to date, up from 18% in the third quarter. We continue to deliver unique data and functionality enhancements to our portfolio trading offering in X-Pro.\nX-Pro integrates our real-time data, our pre-trade analytics, and our trading protocols into a simple trader cockpit that allows a user to seamlessly manage more line items and be more productive. Adaptive Auto-X, a fully automated trader solution, provides a suite of sophisticated AI-driven trading algorithms that integrate all of our trading protocols to programmatically improve execution outcomes while reducing market impact.\nExecution solutions like X-Pro and Adaptive Auto-X allow traders to fully leverage the power of MarketAxess, operating in a far more efficient manner while accessing the best possible liquidity and pricing available in the market. These products answer our clients' growing demand to help them do more with less. Although Adaptive Auto-X was still in pilot phase during the quarter, early results show promising transaction cost savings and reduced market impact in US High Grade.\nOur client franchise has never been stronger. With a record of over 2,000 active clients across 67 countries, we delivered strong growth in our international businesses and in municipals, as well as record data revenue, as our investments to broaden our geographical and product footprint pay off. We closed the acquisition of Pragma, we integrated the MuniBrokers Platform, and we rolled out Open Trading to several emerging local markets, further solidifying our global leadership and in emerging markets e-trading.\nSlide four illustrates how we are integrating our next-gen proprietary data with X-Pro to help traders do more with less. Our unique proprietary data helps clients with their portfolio construction objectives by leveraging liquidity scores, Tradability Data, and our soon to be launched Matchability Data. These data tools can help clients predict the price of a bond, the depth of the market, and the likelihood of finding another matching buyer or seller on the platform.\nOur data tools also help clients optimize their protocol selection across RFQ, Open Trading, portfolio trading, or automation. Last, with the launch of our AI Dealer Select data, we can now help inform our clients about their optimal dealer selection based on the bond they are trading. Slide five highlights the expansion of our addressable market. Acquisitions totaling approximately $360 million and significant organic investments in new products and protocols over the past several years have expanded our addressable market by an estimated $3 billion across credit, rates, data, and post-trade.\nWe believe that our acquisition of Pragma will be a key accelerant of our ability to capture this opportunity. While enhancing our technology footprint, an expanding market, higher trading velocity, new product expansion, and new protocols and workflows are all additional levers of growth that could enhance our addressable market. Slide six provides an update on market conditions since the end of the third quarter.\nVolatility has continued to move higher, which has benefited ETF US High Yield estimated share high yield ETF Market Maker Add On. Our platform is up 94% from the third quarter. With over $7 trillion in global corporate debt set to mature in the next three years, borrowers will have to refinance their debt at much higher rates, creating the potential for higher levels of turnover in the secondary markets.\nProposed new additional bank capital requirements could lead to further constraints on bank balance sheets for market making, highlighting the importance of a diverse liquidity pool like Open Trading. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on October. Current October trends show high grade estimated market share and market volumes slightly above September levels, while high yield estimated share and market volumes are both above September levels.\nWe have five important trading days remaining in the month, and both high grade and high yield market share normally show increases in the last week of the month. Additionally, global portfolio trading ADV in October is approximately $770 million, up 77% from Q3 levels. Now let me turn the call over to Rich to provide you with an update on our market.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks, Chris. We made significant progress this quarter advancing our trading business. Slide eight highlights the strong expansion of our client network. We had a record 2,093 active client firms trading on our platforms in the third quarter, which included a record 1,625 client firms active in US credit trading. Volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 35% year-over-year and represented 17% of total credit market volume in the quarter, up from 13% in the prior year period.\nA record 1,151 active client firms are trading three or more products on our platforms, reflecting the deep partnership that we have with our clients, and the power of our liquidity. We had a record 366 active firms on our municipal bond platform, and we are continuing to integrate MuniBrokers with Open Trading and to expand sources of liquidity for investors and dealers.\nOn slide nine, we highlight the growing international diversification of our trading business. Third quarter growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count was 15% and 21%, respectively. This was driven by strong Eurobond trading volume, up 18%, and emerging local markets trading volume, up 27%. The launch of enhancements like US High Grade trading on price has been very well received by our private bank clients, particularly in Europe. Trading volume on Axess IQ, our front end for private banking clients, increased 130% in Q3 compared to the prior year. Adoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown on slide 10. In the third quarter, there were a record 8 million Algo responses from dealers, an increase of 41% year-over-year, with a 3 year CAGR of 30%. Adoption of automated tools continues to increase with our investor clients.\nWe experienced record Auto-X trade volume and count in the quarter, with three-year CAGRs of 35% and 41%, respectively, and a record 167 active client firms. Auto-X trade volume now represents a record 11% of total credit volume, and trade count was a record 24% of total credit trades. With Adaptive Auto-X, our new suite of client algorithms, we are leveraging our new Open Trading protocols like Live Markets and autoresponder to reduce execution costs while increasing the liquidity across our platforms.\nHistorically, traders are responsible for selecting how to engage our comprehensive trading ecosystem. Now they have the ability to use a sophisticated AI-driven algorithm that helps make the decision on the size of the order, the protocol, the counterparty, and when to trade. Slide 11 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool.\nOpen Trading ADV is running at $3.8 billion compared to $3.2 billion in Q3, up 19%, reflecting some early positive signs of an increase in volatility. Open Trading share of total credit volume is running well above the 33% reported in the third quarter of 2023. We continued to expand available liquidity by increasing the number of alternative providers. A record 201 hedge funds provided liquidity on Open Trading in the quarter, a 13% increase from the prior year.\nOpen Trading is consistently the largest single source of secondary liquidity in the US Credit markets, while price improvement has ticked lower. We have delivered approximately $530 million in cost savings year to date in US High Grade no touch trades executed between Auto-X and a dealer. Algo represented 21% of trade count on Open Trading.\nWe recently announced the expansion of Open Trading to select emerging local markets, including Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and South Africa. This is a powerful next step in the evolution of our EM franchise, providing global dealers and institutional investors with access to unique onshore liquidity providers. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to review our financial performance.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThank you, Rich. On slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials for the quarter. We delivered revenue of $172 million, in line with prior year record information services. Revenue of $12 million was up 22%. This strong performance was driven by the healthy pipeline of new contracts, as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite.\nThe favorable interest rate environment contributed to $6.6 million of interest income, up from $1.4 million. The effective tax rate was 23.4%, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.46 per share. On slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fee capture. Total commission revenue decreased 2% in the quarter, but year-to-date is running 2% above prior year.\nThe decline in credit commission revenue was due to lower estimated US Credit market share and lower total credit fee capture, partially offset by revenue generated from strong international trading volumes. The lower levels of credit spread volatility during the quarter contributed to a decrease in ETF market maker activity, which had a US High Yield market share. the reduction in total credit fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of US High Grade bonds traded over our platforms, and a product mix shift in other US High Yield.\nOn slide 15, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Q3 operating expenses increased 10%, mainly driven by the continued investments in trading system enhancements and our data product offering. Approximately 42% of the increase in operating expenses is due to employee compensation and benefits, as we increased headcount 17% to support our revenue growth initiatives.\nThe 15% increase in depreciation and amortization expense was due to higher software development costs and acquired intangible amortization expense. Professional and consulting expenses related to M&A were $1.1 million during the quarter and $2.1 million year to date. Our operating expense growth rate would have been 7%. If you exclude the impact of foreign exchange and M&A, on slide 16, we provide you with our updated full year 2023 expense guidance.\nBased on the progression of operating expenses and the acquisition of Pragma, the company is refining its previously stated full year 2023 expense guidance range of $418 million to 446 million to a new range of $432 million to 438 million. Lower variable cost savings from incentive compensation expense and clearing costs was mostly offset by $12.5 million of incremental M&A related expenses. Excluding M&A related expenses, our core expense growth rate is expected to be approximately 8%.\nOur estimated Q4 direct operating expense for Pragma is $8.5 million, which includes acquired intangible amortization expense for modeling purposes. Pragma's third quarter 2023 total revenue was $6.9 million. On Slide 17, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid, with cash and investments totaling $553 million as of 30 September 2023, and we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities.\nOn 2 October 2023, we purchased Pragma for approximately $129 million, consisting of $81 million in cash and $48 million of stock. We continue to actively invest our cash to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters.\nDuring the past 12 months, we paid out approximately $108 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks, Chris. In summary on Slide 18, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We are pleased to see some early positive signs of increased volatility driving higher levels of ETF US High Yield and higher levels of Open Trading activity month to date. Our client franchise and network has never been stronger, with continued diversification across client segments, regions, and products.\nWe're making excellent progress with the rollout of X-Pro powered by our proprietary data, which is increasing trader efficiency while driving better trading outcomes. Portfolio trading on X-Pro is increasing as more clients leverage our enhanced functionality and Tradability Data. We are not happy with current growth rates in US Credit. As we continue to execute our strategy and the macro backdrop improves, we believe we will be well positioned to deliver higher levels of growth in the quarters ahead.\nFinally, I would like to welcome Carlos Hernandez back to our Board of Directors. Throughout his career at JPMorgan, Carlos has been forward thinking about electronic trading and market structure, and we are delighted to have him back on the board. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. We ask that you limit yourself to one question and then requeue. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nSenior VP of Regulatory Engagement, Citi\n\nYeah, morning guys. Getting a lot of questions myself just on kind of the October update. Maybe you can help clarify a couple of things. Can you give us some color just in terms of how much of high yield activity has historically been driven by ETFs, and then from a portfolio trading perspective, sounds like you're making nice advancements there, particularly into October. From an overall industry perspective, how is portfolio trading tracking in what is clearly a more volatile environment?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat and good morning, Chris, thanks for the question. Just with regard to the current activity, I think it's important to look at credit spread volatility. Obviously, we do see higher levels of VIX volatility in the market, which has been driving high yield ETF activity, but when it comes to credit spread volatility, it remains fairly unchanged from September.\nHigh Yield credit volatility is only slightly up, so we're encouraged by the increase in volatility. As I mentioned, high grade market share is running just slightly above September. We have the five remaining days in the month, which is a critical part of the month where volumes do increase, and High Yield, given that slight increase in volatility, is above September levels. With regard to portfolio trading, we are seeing our clients leveraging portfolio trading as a protocol.\nWe've seen that grow this year, certainly in the lower volume months that we saw in Q3. We continue to see demand for portfolio trading solutions, and we're continuing to enhance our X-Pro as we roll it out to users. We specifically built X-Pro to target portfolio trading and rolled that out in August. It is still very early days of our X-Pro for portfolio trading, and we're encouraged by where we stand today. As I mentioned, in the month of October, about 35% of our global PTs have been on X-Pro, and that's up from just Q3. Again, X-Pro right now is still early days as we roll out additional enhancements.\n\nChris Allen\n\nSenior VP of Regulatory Engagement, Citi\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nDirector, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on expenses. You mentioned in the guide that $8.5 million of that was related to Pragma. Just wondering if that is maybe a good quarterly run rate to assume in 2024 or whether there could potentially be some opportunity for expense synergies or reductions there going forward. Thanks.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYeah, this is Chris. It's a good run rate for 2024. We're still finalizing the purchase price accounting around that, but the current estimate is roughly $1.5 million. Of that, $8.5 million represents the acquired intangible amortization expense. I would expect that to be a decent run rate with modest growth, consistent with our core growth for planning a 2024 budget. We're still working through our budget process for 2024, but in terms of layering on top of your models, I would assume that's a good run rate for you.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nDirector, Piper Sandler\n\nAll right, thanks a lot.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYes. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just following up on the discussion about the operating environment. You made that comment in your September volume release, and you repeated it today, that the last week of September was the second best week ever for the company. Maybe you can just remind us what was so good in that week and how that environment has changed so far in October. We can kind of compare and contrast a little bit here.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure, Alex. Well, obviously we were pretty excited about that last week of September because we were coming off a quarter of fairly low volume and low volumes. The month was, if you recall, a very large new issue month, both in high grade and high yield. We typically see higher closing monthly, month end closing activity with regard to the new issue.\nThere is a higher level of turnover going into that month end of people repositioning some of that new issue bond activity. There was that. We did see that in September. In October, obviously new issue is slightly lower, but we typically, in the last five days of the month, the last four days of the month around month end, see higher levels of volume in the market, but also MarketAxess experiences slightly higher market share during those periods as well.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nChris, I'll just add to that, if you go to the market condition slides and you track the VIX in the upper right, the VIX was really suppressed for most of Q3, and we saw that return of volatility that Chris alluded to, which was a good tailwind for the high yield volume coming through the platform. We continue to see that into October.\nFrom a credit fee capture perspective, just reminding everybody that high yield is our highest fee capture product, so the more high yield volume that comes through, it will naturally elevate our fee capture beyond the bottoms that we experienced in the month of September, where that was trading at roughly $150 per million. You know what we're seeing so far in the month of October? It's closer to the $155 that we had seen for the entirety of Q3.\n\nAlex Kramm\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nExcellent. Thanks for that color.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nVP and Director, Barclays Capital\n\nHi. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on the prior question on Pragma. Chris, you said in your prepared remarks you think it's going to be a key accelerant of your ability to capture the expanded TAM. I wonder if you could expand on that. Maybe for Chris G., just in terms of modeling for next year, where are the revenues going to be reported, and how should we think about sort of the growth rate of the Q3 number you alluded to earlier? Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat. Thanks, Ben. Obviously, we're pretty excited about the addition of Pragma. We were able to announce and close quite quickly. Pragma is a technology company. That's how most people should think about it. We are enhancing our tech footprint with very new technology and obviously an algo-driven solution that Pragma brings to us.\nThey have an equity business as well as an FX Algo business, so two areas of interest. More importantly, they're helping us to enhance our algo offering, Adaptive Auto-X, which we launched this year. That technology is quite helpful. The other piece of Pragma that we are exploring, we find could be synergistic, is their EMS functionality. They have an EMS platform that they license to the NYSE, and it's quite attractive across multi-asset solutions. We are looking to leverage that EMS platform as well.\nWe do think given the excitement that we see from our clients around Adaptive Auto-X, and then given some of the excitement from our clients on unique order types that we've been rolling out in our rates platform, we do anticipate higher levels of demand for both automation and Algo solutions in both credit and rates growing in the years ahead. We're excited to have that kind of technology, that kind of expertise in house at MarketAxess as we see just the excitement around our first ever Algo in credit. Obviously, we're seeing levels of demand for algos in rates as well.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nOn the revenue projections, we're still working through, as I mentioned earlier, the budgeting process for 2024, but I called out the quarterly revenue is roughly around $7 million. There is that slight drag when you layer in the intangible amortization expense. The total baked $8.5 million. I think those two numbers are good numbers used for a run rate with a modest growth rate in each line item.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nVP and Director, Barclays Capital\n\nGot it. Very helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. You mentioned several times the ETF market maker being increased in activity. Can you disclose what percentage of volume they have historically been for you? More broadly, are you seeing other parts of the market or other participants starting to pick up in terms of activity as well? You've mentioned volatility. You mentioned ETF market makers. I was curious about the breadth of activity beyond those, or more specifics around that.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure. Dan. First, ETF market makers make up about 20% to 25% of that volume. More importantly, we've certainly seen systematic hedge funds that have been entering the credit market pick up in activity across both high grade and high yield, but particularly large presence in the US Credit market. The overall activity, while volumes are slightly up, is across all shapes and sizes of firms, both large investment managers, as well as ETF market makers and the hedge fund community.\nWe are seeing a pickup across all firms. We continue to see portfolio trading used as a solution across our largest clients. We're seeing more and more international clients using portfolio trading solutions as well. Again, multi protocol selection is definitely the theme. The other theme that's critically important is our clients are not adding traders.\nThey are consistently asking us to deliver technology solutions that solve workflow efficiencies for them because they are not adding traders. If you look at the theme of what we're rolling out from a technology perspective, it's really allowing traders to do more with less, consistently more with less. That's the feedback that we're getting from our clients.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just on X-Pro, if you can talk a little bit about the timing of the rollout. I think I want to say the last data point was 30 or so clients I believe are using it, if that's still a valid number or if you can talk about how you expect that to grow. In terms of the portfolio trading, I think you said 7%, Chris, was the share of TRACE and then I missed the comment on October. I know that increased a lot, but if you can just talk about, reiterate that, and what portion of portfolio trading share you have of that 7% now and how you expect that to improve from X-Pro.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYeah, hey Brian, it's Rich here. You can talk about the X-Pro adoption, and it's been going great. We've got it up now, over 100 firms active and 180 traders on it. As Chris noted earlier, we've been focused quite a bit on our most active PT, or portfolio trading, users because the productivity gains for them are particularly pronounced. It's also out there for those doing large lists, you know, tending to trade with a lot of small trades.\nX-Pro really is outstanding in that way because it's easier to manipulate large numbers in large lists, in large portfolios, things of that sort. We're going to continue with that emphasis. It's the big push on PT, our most active users with large numbers of tickets, and we expect, you know, this type of adoption to continue at this kind of pace. You know, it should be growing pretty rapidly.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nJust on the portfolio trading overall market, obviously 7% of TRACE for portfolio trading is above historical averages of closer to 5%. We are seeing higher levels of portfolio trading, which is typical in lower volatility environments. We did what I mentioned in my opening remarks. Portfolio trading ADV, global portfolio trading ADV for us in October was up 77%. Within the US, our market share is now just over 20% of the PT market.\nOur US portfolio trading volumes are up over 20% from our Q3 level. We continue to see more penetration. As Rich mentioned, we're leading with the X-Pro platform. It is a convenient tool for a portfolio trader given the number of line items you can manage, and all the free trading analytics that it delivers.\nOverall on X-Pro, the rollout, we're rolling out slowly and carefully because there's a great deal of training that we do with traders. We're only at 183 traders of over 10,000 traders, so it's still early days. Only 4% of our credit volume in the US is coming through X-Pro today, so still early days. One important trend that we've seen, we've targeted both portfolio traders as well as what we call our power users. We've actually, among our power users, seen a 20% increase in volume from those power users when comparing them on the old platform. It does deliver higher efficiencies to the individual trader when they are sitting in that trading tool.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's great color. Thank you so much.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director of Financials Research, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi all. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to take a step back again and just look at the broader environment, and I was just pondering over the idea of the credit spread volatility being low. When you look back historically, it looks like it's actually low quite a lot of the time, and you get these periods of significant spike.\nGiven that all-to-all trading really delivers its value during those periods of elevated credit spread volatility, I was just wondering how you think about the progression of auto trading and Open Trading penetration, and whether portfolio trading, because volatility tends to be below average for more of the time, where the portfolio trading could actually be quite a bit larger than 7% of the volumes that we see today. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure. Great question. Well, first, when it comes to all-to-all trading and Open Trading, there's a very important dynamic called the network effect that Open Trading delivers. We are seeing alternative liquidity providers entering the market globally across US Credit, Eurobonds, as well as EM. We continue to see new alternative liquidity providers entering the market.\nAlso, if you think about the dynamics and the enhancements that we're adding to our marketplace, we're allowing our client to be providers of liquidity. Adaptive Auto-X, our algo solution, and a key ingredient to that is allowing clients to quietly enter the market both on the passive side, meaning being a liquidity provider, as well as on the aggressive side. We are growing the all-to-all network across all our products. You can't look at it as a static offering today.\nIt continues to expand globally. It does have spikes of activity during higher volume, obviously, and we have seen those in the past. The one other important thing to mention when we're thinking out longer term, the regulatory landscape is constantly changing. Right now, we continue to hear from regulators globally on enhancing bank capital rules, and those proposals that are out there are tightening bank capital rules.\nWe heard from one very large bank recently in their earnings call mention that it could tighten capital rules by as much as 20%, which would obviously impact dealer liquidity in the US, in credit globally. The importance of alternative liquidity solutions will gain over time if those bank capital rules continue to tighten. Rich, do you want to add?\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYes, Simon, I was just going to add to that. It's about two things that our clients are looking for, and what PT delivers in particular is workflow efficiencies. It's quite similar to the workflow gains that came when list trading was first introduced over 20 years ago. It's much easier to do that collection of bonds all at one time.\nNow, add to that the guaranteed execution that typically comes with a PT to have it all done in one shot. What is missing is the other part that the investor clients are typically looking for, which is execution cost reduction and getting high quality execution from that. That's where the Open Trading comes in. You know, it is on us to work and come up with the solutions that combine those two things.\nYou know, just having PT, which works great in a low volatility environment, but when the market gets a lot choppier, it becomes a much more expensive trait. We know that our clients are looking for both of those characteristics, you know, from us. The focus is on trying to deliver both of those things simultaneously. With that, we think that's going to build our business and grow our market share.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nManaging Director of Financials Research, Redburn Atlantic\n\nGreat. Appreciate that answer. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, KBW\n\nHi, good morning. I'm going to try to squeeze in a two-part question on pricing. Historically, there hasn't been much or any transaction pricing pressure in the industry, and it seems like there's still a really wide and unique moat around Open Trading due to the two-year liquidity pool and that network effect you just mentioned in the prior question.\nWith respect to protocols where there may be somewhat less differentiation on liquidity, is pricing becoming even a small part of client decisions on where to trade for protocols like PT or standard RFQ trading? That's the first part of the question. The second part of that question really has to do with, do you think any of your clients are becoming sophisticated enough to RFQ out to all platforms where pricing may be already impacting where they execute orders? If the COVID price is the same across those platforms.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat. On pricing, obviously we don't see a lot of pricing pressure across our market globally. In fact, we've seen competitors like Bloomberg introducing pricing where they were free in the past. We have seen unique price increases across the competitive landscape in certain protocols.\nPricing, as you mentioned, certain protocols that are more workflow functionality and less unique to the liquidity that you're bringing together, we've seen fairly static pricing, so we haven't seen price competition hit there. Clients, if you think about this universe we operate in, it's largely a dealer pay model. The clients are less price sensitive and more focused on workflow solution, ultimately getting execution at higher levels, better pricing, better liquidity.\nWe do not see clients RFQing across multiple platforms with the same RFQ. In fact, that's problematic. If we see that type of behavior, we obviously need to control for that behavior because it creates really a request for price that ultimately fails on one platform and is not honored. We do regulate that. We do pay attention to that. I think our clients have been quite professional about that type of behavior. Rich, anything to add?\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYeah, hey, Kyle, just to add to Chris's comments on the fees and things that come up there, you know, we price our service commensurate with the value that's delivered with it. You know, you're aware that in the fee schedule, there's, you know, for example, high yield, where it's $0.03 to 0.06, or Open Trading, where we have our highest fees that we're charging, where we think we're delivering the most value to our clients.\nThe individual performance, what we call price improvement from Open Trading, that comes right now, we're at lows where it's just shy of 2 basis points in high grade, and it's about $0.28 in the last quarter in high yield. Those price improvements or execution cost savings, that's net of the fees that we charge.\nWhen it comes to the decision for where someone's going to trade, where you can get that type of performance, additional quality of execution, net of the fees that we're charging, it's a pretty easy decision about where to send the inquiries. If there's a competing platform where the actual transaction fee is a little bit smaller, we're talking about tenths of a basis point or, you know, a couple of cents, you know, compared to the performance that gets delivered when Open Trading wins.\nAs I noted before, we are, we're the largest liquidity provider on the platform in these products, then the decision is pretty straightforward for the investors. That's a message that we're, you know, continually, you know, reminding our clients about.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, KBW\n\nVery thorough. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you. Good morning. Wanted to ask on portfolio trading, you guys continue to show momentum there, growing volumes meaningfully. I was hoping you might be able to unpack how much of the portfolio trading volume is coming across in IG versus in high yield. Any notable differences that you're seeing? As you look out, is there one area where you see a bigger opportunity with portfolio trading?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nSure. First of all, we're seeing growing demand for portfolio trading. It's such a convenient workflow solution, particularly when our clients are getting large inflows. It's obviously a very easy way to get exposure quite quickly. The other method that we have seen clients use is just using outright fixed income ETFs to get that exposure and then unwinding the ETF and going into the underlying.\nWe do see portfolio trading globally. As I mentioned, we're seeing some of our global clients using portfolio trading, and many times they're trading a global list, not US High Yield credit list. we do see that offering growing over time, and obviously the tools that our clients are using. Remember when this portfolio trading was born, it was born on Excel spreadsheets. We've come a long way.\nWe think the real solution that our clients now are looking for is once they think they have a portfolio trade. Either they're buying a very large portfolio, they're selling a portfolio, or they're switching. They need to optimize that portfolio once they construct it, meaning they can truly impact the price of the portfolio by picking certain bonds in the portfolio, deselecting or adding bonds.\nOur tool helps them with that portfolio construction, and it does in fact optimize their pricing, which is quite helpful. It's really the pre-trade analytics that drives that portfolio construction and that bond selection once you load the overall portfolio trade that you intend on. To answer your question, the PT volumes are largely weighted towards investment grade, with about 70% in investment grade and only about 15% in high yield.\nMany times we see portfolios that cross both high grade and high yield. We would expect to see growing portfolios in Europe and in Asia as well, again using EM or across global bond lists as well. That's an offering that we recently put out, our global PT offering, because traders were asking for really a global list of bonds to trade as a portfolio.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nThanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask you guys a question around just the expense management philosophy and margin trajectory. When you look at the revenue backdrop, obviously it's been challenged. Chris, you mentioned you guys have been disappointed with how US credit has performed. Part of that is environmental, part of it is, the mix.\nAs you look at the expense growth, I think you suggested 8% core expense growth in 2023, excluding kind of some of the deal noise. Is that the appropriate run rate for the business if revenue growth will improve? Maybe somewhat, but doesn't necessarily get back to the levels it used to be. There are levers you could pull to get the company back to positive operating leverage, or that's really just going to be a function of mostly revenues and less selling expenses.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYes, Alex, as you know, we've made a lot of investments over the last three years. Chris alluded to the number of M&A activity, which contributed to the elevated levels of acquired intangibles, amortization expense. That provides for a little bit of noise. We've built the teams out where it's all come together this year from a core perspective, where we're rolling out X-Pro, we're rolling out the final suite of our automation tools with the Adaptive Auto-X solutions.\nWhere we stand today, we're thinking of the future, is that high single digit expense growth rate for the core business. Recognizing that roughly 17% to 18% of our operating expenses are variable, we'd experienced some savings due to the underperformance that we'd have seen this year where our variable expenses were more or less down roughly $12 million to 13 million from what we were planning for in the beginning of the year.\nThat more or less was offset by the $12.5 million of M&A related expenses. I would say that the levers are built into the model through the variable expenses. As we think about our expense philosophy internally, we're redirecting and reallocating resources to the top priorities where we think we're going to get near term revenue growth prospects.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nAlex, I would just mention we're laser focused on expenses right now. We're also in a critical period for the company where we are introducing new technology across our tech stack. That requires higher levels of investment, and that's what we've been doing. When you look at that expense growth, we are covering both the legacy platform and the new platform at the same time.\nObviously, acquisitions like Pragma enhance that technology footprint well. These models are designed to be highly leveraged, and I think, Alex, you cover a number of companies that have great operating leverage in their system. We look to grow that over time. One important point is that market data revenue—remember, data is just an output. It doesn't really cost anything more to produce other than the sophistication of the data that you're producing.\nWe see that data, our market data, as you saw in the quarter, grew over 20%. That will help us grow our operating margin as that data revenue piece continues to grow. Again, the data that we're rolling out now on X-Pro is not data for sale today, but could be for sale in the future. It's really designed to grow our market share across the various products that we are trading. We're going to be leveraging that data as a way to collect orders in the bond market. Over time, we'll be able to leverage that data into hard dollars as well.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGot it. Thanks for that.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nGood morning. Which innovations that you've been speaking to today potentially allow MarketAxess to better penetrate the block trade market?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nI'm sorry, Patrick, you broke up a little bit. What was the last part of that question?\n\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nWhich of the innovation that you are speaking about help you better penetrate the block trade market?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nOh, okay. Block trade. First, in EM, particularly around our local market growth, we are seeing higher levels of block activity. We have been growing our block market share there. We have rolled out Requests for Market, which is an important protocol that a number of clients have requested that tends to introduce the opportunity for higher block activity.\nWith the rollout of our X-Pro production platform, we are introducing what we call high touch solutions in November, in the fourth quarter, and obviously hopefully see an uptake in 2024. That high touch offering is really designed to attract larger order sizes that need to use pre-trade analytics to decide on protocol selection. One key ingredient to that is our AI Dealer Select data, which helps you select one to however many dealers you would choose. When you're managing a larger size order, you obviously want to reduce the market impact and the information leakage of that order.\nOur new offering in X-Pro would help you decide, number one, what protocol is there, levels of liquidity using things like Tradability to go into an all-to-all market where you're requesting price from the entire market, or if you're looking at lower levels of tradability, you may want to use a number of dealers, discrete dealers, and then if you choose to only use dealers, you would want to know which dealers you should select from. That offering is really targeted to launch in November, but really hopeful to see it on client desktops across Q1 2024.\n\nRich Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nYeah, hey Patrick, it's Rich. You know, one other thing we were talking about, adaptive and adaptive Auto-X, and it's, you know, again, still early days, just coming out of the pilot phase. Even from the small number of clients that we have in this initial phase, we're seeing larger orders coming from it. Remember, it gives the ability to tap into the different protocols that we have available.\nA common type of operation in the algo is to leave part of a block order resting in the order book, and then when other parties engage, being able to then work that order up to a larger size that gets completed. We call that multi party workup. We've seen some really encouraging early examples of that being used, where the initial trade starts out at 500 or a million or a couple of million.\nWe've had cases where it gets worked up to $15 million or 20 million. That's all done quietly without showing full size. Initially, people are concerned about that information leakage, and then quietly working that up to a larger size without the information leakage. We expect to see greater adoption of that as the adaptive Auto-X rollout expands.\n\nPatrick O’Shaughnessy\n\nManaging Director in Equity Research, Raymond James\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Allen from Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nHey chris.\n\nOperator\n\nChris, your line is open.\n\nChris Allen\n\nSenior VP of Regulatory Engagement, Citi\n\nSorry guys, I had it on mute. Just wanted to ask, were you guys in the hiring cycle with FTEs up 17% year-over-year, kind of at the end of that cycle, do you expect Pragma to basically afford any expense efficiency opportunities longer term?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings",
    "content2": "Sure. Obviously the hiring cycle was quite high over the last few years. Quite a competitive market that we entered into in 2022 and into Q1 2023 with the layoffs among the large investment banks and across the technology companies, that market dynamic has reduced. It's a much more friendly hiring environment. We are obviously focused on rolling out products, rolling out solutions, and Pragma brings with us probably around 50 technologists, which is a great add to the overall footprint of MarketAxess.\nWe just see going into 2024 we're quite comfortable with the hiring marketplace and obviously the addition of heads that we've already added to the overall footprint of MarketAxess. More importantly, we have a number of things that we're doing on the tech side, re-platforming our platform, rolling out X-Pro, and continuing to grow the overall automation solutions. We continue to see sizable investments in all those tech plants and all of those operations opportunities.\n\nChris Allen\n\nSenior VP of Regulatory Engagement, Citi\n\nThanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nWe have no further questions in the queue at this time. Chris Concannon, I will turn the call to you for closing remarks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings\n\nGreat. Well, thank you for joining us today. Obviously, we have a very important quarter ahead and are pretty excited about the levels of activity, and the number of things that we're rolling out in this quarter and the quarters ahead. Thank you for joining us. We'll talk to you in another quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 20 July 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Sarah. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Q2 2023 earnings conference call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with a strategic update on the company, and provide color on the market outlook. Rich Schiffman, Global Head of Trading Solutions, will update you on our market and how we executed this quarter. Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements.\nThese statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning. I'm very pleased to update you on the significant progress we made in Q2 to enhance our franchise and drive our long-term growth. First, in terms of the quarter, we generated revenue of $180 million. Year to date, we generated $383 million, 4% above prior year levels. Earnings per share was $1.59 on net income of $60 million. We were not immune to the impact of dramatically lower volatility in the quarter, which impacted trading platforms across fixed income and other asset classes after a very strong Q1.\nWhile our quarterly results will ebb and flow with volatility, we are confident that we have the right long-term strategy, and we have made substantial progress this quarter in creating the most comprehensive global fixed income market for the future. Turning to my strategic update, as you can see on slide three, we will now be providing quarterly updates based on three new focus areas, which is the framework through which we are managing our growth, and how we will communicate our results going forward.\nFirst, in terms of innovation, we have now developed and launched unique proprietary data solutions and embedded them in our platform that we believe will help our clients make better trading decisions that achieve better outcomes. We have also launched the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X, in the US Credit markets with eight live pilot clients and plans to increase the number significantly in the coming months.\nNext, in terms of integration, we successfully launched our new trading platform last quarter, which integrates our unique data products and our various trading protocols in a single platform. Contained in that new trading platform is our enhanced portfolio trading functionality with increased capacity for large portfolios, and accompanied by our proprietary data analytics that help our clients optimize their portfolios and protocol selections.\nLast, in terms of execution, we continue to expand our client franchise with record active clients, record traders, and record active clients trading three or more products. We continue to grow and set records across various products and new initiatives, and we delivered on our new trading platform an enhanced portfolio trading solution. We processed a record single day of trading activity on 31 May 2023. In summary, we continued to execute in the quarter despite the decrease in volatility, which dampened activity on our platform.\nThe initiatives we launched this quarter will be critical in addressing the recent challenges we have faced in growing our estimated market share in US High Grade. While we recognize that our High Grade market share can be uniquely impacted by volume and volatility in the ETF markets, we also have felt the impact of new protocols like portfolio trading slowing our market share growth. Slide four illustrates how we are innovating with unique proprietary data that powers our new platform, and our automation suite. We sit in a privileged position as a leader of the electronic global credit markets that generates powerful proprietary data.\nThis proprietary data helps inform our clients on what to trade, how to achieve their portfolio construction objectives by leveraging our liquidity scores, tradability data, and our new matchability data. Our unique data like CP Inquiry, CP+ Responder, and Tradability also informs clients how to trade and when to trade by recommending the right protocol to get their best price, how to size their trade, how to reduce their market impact, and informing them what to expect in terms of price outcome.\nLast, our newly released AI Dealer Direct data helps inform our clients who to trade with by leveraging artificial intelligence to determine the best counterparty for a specific trade. On slide five, our new trading platform will drive the gathering and directing of client orders to achieve better trading outcomes for clients. We are delivering high touch and low touch trading solutions through our new order-centric trading platform powered by our proprietary data and analytics.\nWe started our broad rollout in Q1 of this year, and early client feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We have transitioned over 30 of our top investor clients who are now using the platform daily.\nTurning to slide six, our unique data and insights are also powering the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X, designed to better link our liquidity pools. Our Adaptive Auto-X algorithms allow clients to build customized trading algorithms and enhance workflows to handle larger size trades. Adaptive Auto-X also leverages smart order routing, so we can seamlessly link our liquidity pools and help our clients achieve unique execution outcomes.\nSlide seven highlights the expanded addressable market that we have established compared to 2018. The product set that we had in 2018 gave us access to a total addressable market of approximately $4 billion in revenue. The investments that we have made over the last several years have expanded our total addressable market by $3 billion for a total addressable market today of $7 billion. We are continuing to invest to capture the tremendous opportunity before us while integrating the new initiatives we have acquired or built.\nSlide eight provides an update on market conditions and US Credit. As shown in the upper half of this slide, volatility in Q2 was down significantly from the prior year, impacting activity by select client segments on our platform. ETF market maker activity in Q2 was down 47% from the Q1, reflecting decreased opportunities to deploy arbitrage strategies. In the Q2, notional volumes in high-grade and high-yield ETFs decreased 19% and 33%, respectively, compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of reduced volatility on US credit.\nThe decrease in volatility was not unique to fixed income, with realized volatility on the S&P 500 down 52%, FX volatility down 12%, and commodities down 28%. Before I turn the call over to Rich Schiffman, I wanted to provide an update on market trends in July. With eight important trading days remaining in the month, US High Grade estimated market share is running consistent with mid June levels. US High Yield estimated market share, however, has rebounded and is now running above June levels and slightly below prior year July levels. Now let me turn the call over to Rich Schiffman to provide you with an update on our market.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Chris. Slide 10 highlights the strength of our growing client franchise. We had a record 2,083 active client firms trading on our market in Q2. As an example of our global strength and diversity, active international client firms represent 51% of total active firms, and the over 5,000 international investor and dealer traders represent over 40% of total active traders. Trading volume from hedge fund and private bank clients increased 36% year-over-year and represented 17% of total credit volume in the current quarter, up from 12% in the prior year period.\nA record 1,127 active client firms are trading three or more products on our market, which reflects the deep partnership that we have with our clients, and the power of our liquidity. Once clients make the investment to connect to our platform, they want to do more with us, leveraging the power of our market to achieve superior trading results. This reflects the stickiness of MarketAxess in the workflow of our clients.\nAdoption of our automation suite of products continues to grow, as shown here on slide 11. What Chris described earlier is playing out exactly as we had expected. Automation tools are only as good as the data that informs and powers the algorithm. Given the breadth of activity on our market, we believe our CP+ data is more accurate than that of our competitors. This is validated by CP+ sales growth over the last several quarters. In Q2, there were a record 7.4 million algo responses from dealers, an increase of 31% year-over-year, with a three-year CAGR of 28%.\nAdoption of automated tools continues to increase with our investor clients. Once again, we saw record Auto-X trade volume and count in the quarter, with three-year CAGRs of 32% and 43%, respectively, and a record 146 active client firms leveraging our automation tools. Of these active clients, 32% are top 100 clients in terms of total credit trading volume. Auto-X inquiry sizes are rising as clients become more comfortable with automation, and dealers are increasingly using their algos to handle larger size trades. It's common for us to see clients start out small and then raise their thresholds as they gain confidence in our services, responding to client interest.\nWe've been steadily raising the maximum automation size, which currently sits at $10 million. Auto-X trade volume now represents a record 10% of total credit volume, and trade count is a record 23% of total credit trades. We believe that Adaptive Auto-X, our new suite of investor client algorithms, will take our automation solutions to a new level by leveraging smart order routing to facilitate access to the entire MarketAxess ecosystem.\nSlide 12 provides an update on Open Trading, our market-leading all-to-all liquidity pool. Despite the dramatically lower credit spread volatility in the quarter, which reduced price improvement measures, we continue to expand available liquidity with new alternative providers. A record 195 hedge funds provided liquidity on Open Trading in the quarter, an 18% increase from the prior year. The increased alternative liquidity on Open Trading is being driven by better data, which allows hedge funds and systematic investors to deploy trading strategies they have developed in other asset classes.\nOne of the key drivers of our very strong increase in estimated market share for Eurobonds is the enhanced liquidity offered through Open Trading. We achieved record Eurobond trade volume in the quarter and a record 31% Eurobond Open Trading share. In US High Grade, no touch trades executed between Auto-X and a dealer algo represented 19% of trade count in high-grade on Open Trading, reflecting the increasing usage of automation tools in leveraging our unique liquidity pool.\nOn slide 13, we highlight the growing international diversification of our trading business. Q2 growth in international average daily trade volume and trade count increased 14% and 28%, respectively. This was driven by record Eurobond ADV up 30% and EM local markets volume up 11%. June month end was extremely strong for EM local trading, with a record of over $5 billion US dollar equivalent volume traded. This contributed to our second best day on the platform. It included two of our largest trades ever on our market, both around $300 million in size.\nFrom a regional perspective, LATAM generated record ADV in the quarter, and the second best quarter in terms of revenue. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to review our financial performance.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Rich. On slide 15, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials for the quarter. We delivered revenue of $180 million, down slightly from the prior year. Record information services revenue of $12 million was up 24%. This strong performance was driven by the healthy pipeline of new contracts signed, as we continue to experience strong adoption across our data product suite. Based on a year-to-date progression of information services revenue, we expect to achieve full-year revenue growth in the mid-teens. The effective tax rate was 24.2%, slightly lower than prior year, and we reported diluted EPS of $1.59 per share.\nExcluding the impact of foreign exchange losses and unrealized losses on US Treasury investments in the quarter and the impact of foreign exchange gains in the prior year quarter, all of which are included in other income, diluted EPS would have been down 3% versus the reported 11% decline.\nOn slide 16, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and fee capture. Total commission revenue decreased 3% in the quarter, and year to date is running 3% above prior year levels. Total credit commission revenue was impacted by the dramatically low levels of volatility in the quarter, which reduced trading activity, negatively impacting our trading volumes and estimated US Credit market share. This was partially offset by the revenue generated from strong market share gains in Eurobonds, Emerging Markets, and Munis.\nThe reduction in total credit fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of US high-grade bonds traded over our platform, product mix shift in other credit products, primarily in US High Yield, and client crossing activity in Eurobonds, which is executed at a lower fee capture rate. While US high-grade fee capture declined year-over year, duration has remained relatively stable over the last several months as reflected in the corporate bond duration index.\nOn slide 17, we provide a summary of our operating expenses. Q2 expenses increased 7%, driven principally by continued investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Employee compensation and benefits increased $3 million on a 17% increase in headcount as we continue to add technology and customer-facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Tech and communications expenses increased $3 million due to higher SaaS, data center, and cloud hosting expenses.\nOn slide 18 we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management. Our balance sheet continues to be solid with cash and investments totaling $506 million, and we had no outstanding debt as of 30 June 2023. We are actively investing our cash to take advantage of the favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters. During the past 12 months, we paid out approximately $107 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders.\nOur Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call back to Chris for his closing comments.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nIn summary, on slide 19, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We have launched unique proprietary data solutions and embedded them in our new platform, that we believe will help our clients make better trading decisions that achieve better outcomes. We have launched the first client algorithm, Adaptive Auto-X, in the US Credit markets. We successfully developed and launched our new trading platform, which integrates our unique data products and our various trading protocols in a single platform.\nWe continue to expand our global client franchise, and we believe that we are entering a new period of growth in fixed income with higher rates that we expect will make fixed income a very attractive asset class in the years ahead. Now we would be happy to open the line for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. If you have a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. Please limit your questions to one. If you would like to ask another question, we ask that you please press star one to rejoin the queue. One moment please for your first question. Your first question comes from the line of Chris Allen with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nMorning everyone. I wanted to ask about Adaptive Auto-X. Maybe you can give us a rough timeline in terms of expectations for a broader rollout of the platform. We know you have eight live clients, eight clients, and you had your first trade on it. Maybe you could provide a refresher just in terms of how you think that's going to impact client execution quality and the potential cost savings for clients, and how that translates into improved performance longer term.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat. Good morning, Chris. Thanks for that question. Obviously, Adaptive Auto-X is in early stages. As we mentioned, it's still in pilot, will remain in pilot through the remainder of the summer, and based on early indications, performance is quite, quite attractive, and as expected. The key thing about Adaptive is it allows a client to submit a larger parent order, which then breaks into what we call child orders, and those orders can be placed across various different protocols.\nThe other unique thing about Adaptive Auto-X is it is pegged to the market, meaning you can choose your relative price, and it will remain pegged to the market and reprice as the market moves throughout the morning or the day. As we mentioned, we have eight clients in pilot, with probably another three or four in the queue, all of various shapes and sizes. Some of them are quite large clients, traditional asset managers, and some are a number of smaller hedge funds. We're trying to do a broad cross section just to complete your question around the performance of Adaptive Auto-X and the goals.\nIt's really to allow clients to outsource their trading strategies into really a very sophisticated AI-driven algorithm. The unique thing about Adaptive Auto-X and at MarketAxess is that it takes advantage of our Open Trading solutions, both our Live Markets order book, as well as our all-to-all Open Trading solution in RFQ. It allows clients to actually not cross spread for some portion of their order, which is a substantial improvement in price given the size of spreads in our market. It's a very unique offering that leverages our competitive position in all-to-all trading.\nThat huge liquidity pool that we always talk about, Open Trading, Adaptive Auto-X is uniquely designed around that solution. You know, obviously we plan to roll that out over the course of the fall and into next year. The client feedback thus far has been very positive. We have a number of clients begging to be in the pilot, but we're trying to keep the pilot at this point small. The other important thing, we rolled out a number of new data products. There's one product in particular, when combined with Adaptive Auto-X, makes it a much more interesting opportunity, and that's called matchability.\nMatchability predicts the opportunity of a specific bond to find a matching buyer or seller on our platform. That combined with Adaptive Auto-X increases a client's likelihood of not crossing spread by being very careful about their bond selection when they're building their portfolio.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nChris, can I just add to this? Chris, it's Rich Schiffman here, and just to address the question about execution quality and building on what Chris just said here, it's really exciting to see what's going on in the pilot because this was an example of one of the trades where we had something that would have been a traditional RFQ and a liquidity taker, paying bid ask spread and getting quite competitive execution quality on our system. Because they used Adaptive Auto-X, they were able to leave their order resting in our order book live markets when then someone else came along and executed against them.\nAs Chris pointed out, crossing bid ask spread, it's tying together the different protocols that we have that historically have kind of sat by themselves. We left it up to traders on the system to have to go manually to each of the different protocols to take advantage of them. That was really the most exciting thing, seeing this work across the protocols. I think we had one execution that was done three different ways, both on live markets as a provider of liquidity, and then the remainder done as an RFQ, all done automatically through Adaptive Auto-X.\n\nChris Allen\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nHi, good morning. Just wondering if I could ask a question on recent trends in the High Grade business. It seemed that really from Q4 2021 through May of this year you had stabilized market share trends versus your largest US competitor, especially as you had fully rolled out a PT offering of your own. However, in June specifically we've again seen some share loss in US High Grade versus that peer. Just wondering what has driven that recently in High Grade, and are you hearing anything from clients that would suggest there is any pure customer switching occurring of kind of standard RFQ or even OT activity?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Happy to address, thanks for the question. Obviously, across our other competitive products, things like High Yield, EM, and Eurobonds, we continue to see share growth over the quarters, and certainly over the years, and those are products that are offered in a competitive environment as well. High Grade seems to be a unique area where we've bumped into our share growth challenges, and particularly around portfolio trading. As I mentioned in our opening remarks, we've certainly seen portfolio trading grow within the market. It's now somewhere between 5% and 6% of the overall market, and that has grown over the past couple of years.\nWe are hearing from clients that they are using portfolio trading for workflow solutions, so they are able to move large amounts of investment flows in and out of their portfolio through a very seamless one-time trade or one-price trade. We see portfolio trading happening direct with dealers, even over Excel spreadsheets. We see it happening in the competitive environment, and then obviously we're talking to our clients regularly on what are their needs for portfolio trading. On our platform, we are just now rolling out a number of enhancements to our portfolio trading platform.\nWe've rolled out on our new platform that we talked about earlier a brand new enhanced portfolio trading tool that expands the number of line items clients can trade. It also, more importantly, embeds our unique tradability data, which is an important data product that we rolled out that helps clients not only trade the portfolio and determine price of that portfolio, but clients are trying to figure out what should be in their portfolio before they do a portfolio trade. We see clients more often than not amending their portfolio, adjusting the line items in that portfolio to improve price or to choose the right protocol.\nThey are using our tradability data as a line by line solution to help them build that portfolio before making that portfolio trade and optimizing price. We are feeling very good and very positive about our new portfolio trading enhancements, and we have a number of enhancements that are rolling out in August and throughout the course of the fall.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nUnderstood.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nIt's Rich. I was just going to add a couple of things about it. Also, the current environment, which is pretty low volatility as Chris pointed out earlier. You know, there's not a big premium being paid to get the PTs done that way. There's no question there's been a bit of a shift in some of that activity. You know, we're picking up PT business also, maybe not growing as fast as the overall amount taking place. We are fully invested in it and making sure that we've got, you know, the most competitive product out there in the market, particularly around the usability in terms of the workflow, making sure it's very easy.\nThe work in our new trading platform is very much geared around the PT workflow and making sure that that goes smoothly, and in particular, longer term. This is one thing we're quite focused on, is looking for ways to morph PTs and traditional in comp list business so that we give traders at the point of execution, when they're going out, which is the better way to execute this trade. Should I go in comp list, should I go PT? It's going to vary depending upon, you know, what they're trading, what's going on in the market at that time. You know, PTs, it's a pretty concentrated business in terms of liquidity provision.\nI think there's maybe, you know, half a dozen or eight or so firms, you know, that are active in it, and it's quite concentrated with, you know, half that number, if that, and, you know, to forego all of the broad liquidity in the market from, you know, the over 1,000 liquidity providers that we have, you know, seems an unfortunate thing to do. That's kind of on our long-term roadmap with PT, is look for ways how we can bring that broad liquidity together with the benefits of the portfolio trading workflow.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThanks, Rich. Thanks, Chris.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Benjamin Budish with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBenjamin Budish\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi there. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to kind of follow back a little bit on Chris's question from earlier, just in terms of the kind of early reads from Adaptive Auto-X, and thinking about, Rich, some of your comments on Auto-X seeing the trade sizes increase. I guess, for Adaptive Auto-X, do you think this is going to be a quicker solution to seeing trade size increase or is it perhaps more like what you're seeing with your Auto-X product you expect traders to get more comfortable, and over time they start putting in larger and larger tickets? Any kind of early reads from the behavior you're seeing from your clients in pilot.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, thanks Benjamin for the question. I think we're going to see larger volumes coming through on it. It might not necessarily be reflected in larger tickets because part of what the benefit of Adaptive Auto-X is, is this ability to really easily break up a large inquiry or order into smaller pieces and get quality execution at an average price across those executions. I think it will be a tool for attracting these larger orders into the system, although the actual executions of them might happen in relatively smaller pieces.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Chris, earlier this month there was a, or maybe late last month there was a large liquidity provider market maker out there that was talking about wanting to become more involved in the US Credit market. Just wondering what your thoughts are on some of these larger players leaning into credit, maybe what it means for automation, and maybe what it means for your Adaptive Auto-X tool more specifically. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, great question. Obviously, from a macro perspective, it's quite positive that everyone is looking at the fixed income market as an attractive environment for the coming years with yields at these levels. Obviously, the Fed is contemplating another a quarter point rate hike next week, and if, obviously, if the Fed halts rate hikes next week, that's certainly going to be very positive for fixed income investing. Even BlackRock recently predicted a surge in fixed income investments once the Fed stopped raising rates. The overall macro environment is quite attractive for the fixed income market, and certainly credit in particular.\nThe new entrants of the most recent, I think there was a story in the FT about Citadel joining the credit markets as a liquidity provider. It's really a trend that we're seeing. Obviously, Citadel is a very large player across many different asset classes, and their entrance is a very important sign of things to come. We are also seeing other entrants, particularly out of the ETF market maker groups, entering the credit markets as well. We certainly offer a unique offering with all-to-all trading, where you can have a new entrant join the market and join a network of 2,000 clients around the globe.\nThe ability for that new entry to step into the market is quite powerful here, as they all are entering with a strong bend towards electronic trading. Obviously, Citadel is known for its electronic trading prowess, and the other ETF market makers and systematic hedge funds that we're seeing enter our market are all leveraging very advanced trading technology, which makes a very attractive outcome for things like our overall automation suite, including the Adaptive Auto-X launch.\n\nPatrick Moley\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nI'll hop back in the queue, thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Atlantic Equities\n\nHi everyone, thanks for taking my question. I just got a question about the data side and perhaps CP, just could you expand on the opportunities for monetizing your proprietary data set, which is significant and I think still quite early stage, and just how we should think about the size of that opportunity, the timing of that really flowing through into your business.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, great question. We love to talk about our data here at MarketAxess. Just to put it in perspective, the addressable market that I spoke about, about $1 billion of that addressable market is data revenue. We are very bullish on the opportunity in the data space. Our data revenues have been consistently growing as a result of the demand for CP+ and our real-time data. It's a strong data product in the US for US corporate bonds. Obviously, we think it's the benchmark for real-time trading of US corporate bonds.\nMore importantly, in Eurobonds and EM, we're seeing high demand, particularly in EM, which is a much more difficult market to trade. We see high demand for CP+ across those international markets. As we grow our footprint, our trading footprint, and we did grow our trading footprint both in Eurobonds and emerging, that data product becomes that much more valuable. We're certainly projecting very attractive growth rates for CP+ internationally, as well as here with regard to the proprietary data products. I named a number of them that are newly into production and being launched over the coming months and quarters.\nThey are all designed to really attract trading volume at this point. What we intend to do is embed them in our new trading platform, so our clients can only see that data when they load an order on our platform and engage our platform for trading. We believe it's a very carefully curated way of attracting more orders on the platform but also helping our clients determine how best to trade their orders given the size, and given the unique liquidity in the market. Things like tradability will predict the number of responses that you should get back on a given bond. CP Responder will actually predict the likelihood of winning an inquiry based on your unique price and size.\nCP Inquiry predicts the best price of an inquiry based on the client type, and the size and side of your bond. These are very unique, very proprietary data products that we're rolling out. Our latest AI Dealer Direct will actually help you select your dealer counterparty, which is very important when you're trading larger size orders in our market. All of these at the outset will be offered exclusively on the platform with lots of restrictions for use. We do believe over time we'll be able to monetize them into pure data feeds for our clients to use in their own proprietary platforms. Over time we're excited about the opportunity.\nRight now the focus of these data products is growing our market share across all our products.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Chris. First of all, I just wanted to clarify your comments around June. I think you said market share consistent with, I'm sorry, July comments, which I think you said were consistent with mid-June. Just curious if that's different than how the end of June ended up. As you think about the current environment, maybe it'd be helpful to think about just given how many macro factors have been impacting both market activity, as well as client behavior, what is maybe kind of the ideal backdrop for your products, your platforms, and protocols to perform?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. To be accurate, my comment around June levels were running consistent with mid June levels. Obviously, we can't predict the next eight days. I will remind you that there is a potential Fed rate hike next week, which, as you can imagine, can impact volatility quite dramatically. You know, more and more of volumes are moving into the month end close. We've seen that trend building over the last couple of years, and certainly it's reflective of the indexation of the fixed income market. Again, mid June levels is what I mentioned, and then just a macro market.\nWe're certainly excited about a potential end to rate hikes because what we've seen over the last quarter is really a lack of investment conviction among our clients. We heard that directly from our clients as we've gone out to talk to all our clients globally. Remember, we had a March banking crisis that left investors with a great deal of caution, particularly around bonds. A sizable portion of the bond market is from the banking sector. There is quite a great deal of concern around that crisis post the March crisis. Now our clients have really turned to watching Fed moves and the continuation of rate hikes.\nAs we mentioned earlier, any halt to the Fed rate hikes will leave investors much more attractive towards their potential fixed income investing. We're bullish about the market over the coming quarters and years. The other piece of information, we've spent the last six months going out talking to our clients, as you probably saw in many of their own earnings releases. They've been cutting costs as a result of the revenue challenges that they've had as a result of last year. Those cost cuts come in two important pieces. It comes in technology budgets have been cut, and headcounts have been cut.\nIf you can imagine the environment where rate hikes are halted and there's a surge in investing in fixed income assets, those clients are going to need to outsource their trading solutions and outsource their tech needs to deal with the workflow challenges that they're going to have, particularly the reduction of their traders that we've seen. We feel exceptionally well positioned around the current market environment, particularly if you see rate hikes halted and the need by all of our clients for technology solutions and better workflow solutions.\nThings like our new trading platform offer very seamless workflow solutions, as well as our whole automation suite, which by the way continues to grow quarter-over-quarter across High Grade, High Yield, EM, and Eurobonds. We're quite excited about the position we've put ourselves in given the potential for the inflows that could come into the fixed income environment.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nI was just going to add to that Chris, Daniel, it's also worth looking at the refunding calendar, and I don't have the exact number offhand, but I thought I heard something like next year it's over a trillion dollars of paper that needs to be refunded, and that's going to create a lot of activity in the market, which is definitely favorable for our platform.\n\nDaniel Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you could share your latest thoughts on the regulatory landscape. Is there anything in particular that you guys are watching that could be a helpful tailwind for the business or maybe a little bit of headwind side that we could see in the coming years. Specifically, just curious, the latest you're hearing on the proposal to cut the TRACE reporting time from 15 minutes to one minute and what sort of impact that might have. Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. From the regulatory side, and obviously we have a global footprint, so we are mindful of regulations across the globe. Here in the US, obviously we're still tracking the SEC's proposals around the treasury market. They're obviously very favorable towards all-to-all, and we continue to hear support for all-to-all in treasuries by regulators. T+1 is another proposal that we're tracking quite closely. Obviously, the requirement to move settlement to T+1 does have an impact on institutional straight-through processing, and many times that can be favorable to electronic trading more broadly and electronic processing. T+1 is one we look out for.\nWhile it's a lot of work for everybody, it's slightly favorable to the electronic solutions over the long term. The TRACE proposal moving to a one-minute reporting time. If you look at the market, the majority of the market is near that reporting time today. Obviously, manual reports take a little bit longer, but we would expect that to improve. Again, similar to T+1, straight through processing and electronic trading more broadly in Europe. We continue to hear from the regulators around what is an MTF, the perimeters of an MTF, and what needs to be in an MTF.\nIt's certainly having an impact on the regulatory environment where we see, you know, potential new entrants in alternative platforms that try to aggregate trading. It's very clear in Europe that MTF regulation is becoming more restrictive based on those trading perimeters. We operate in MTFs throughout Europe, so we're quite comfortable in that environment where you need to be an MTF to step into our space. But more broadly, we don't see any regulatory wins that have material detriment. Really, much more positive to support electronic trading across the globe.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. One thing I would just add to that, Michael, if there's any change in bank capital requirements to the tighter side, that's going to be a tailwind for electronic trading, certainly for all-to-all trading, because that liquidity has to get made up somewhere else. If it becomes harder for the banks to be providing it, it's going to open the door for a lot more activity and Open Trading.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOnce again, if you would like to ask a question, please press star one. Please continue to limit your questions to one. Your next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, good morning. Thanks for the question. A little bit of a bigger picture question for you guys and I appreciate all the discussions around some of the new initiatives. I guess when we look at slide 11 where you outline progress on Auto-X, CP+, algo trades, et cetera, they're all up and to the right. The High Yield,or High Grade rather market share has been relatively range bound as we talked about for the last couple of years. Are they just taking share of the back book, kind of like the legacy RFQ business, and that's kind of the change in client behavior that you're observing, but it doesn't really materialize in higher market share?\nWhat in your view will necessarily sort of change that? As you think about high-grade goals over the next couple of years, what could that look like on the back of these initiatives?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. First, obviously we continue to grow share, as I mentioned, across a number of our key products in the face of competition and High Grade in particular, we are generally impacted by, you know, a lower volatility, particularly around the ETF market, given how important we are to the ETF market makers and some of the systematic hedge funds that trade that ETF arb. We typically are more impacted than any competitors in that market with regard to High Grade portfolio trading. While we did grow our portfolio trading in High Grade somewhere around 13% year-over-year, it's really not as fast as the market has been growing.\nThe competitive impact in High Grade is largely around the growth of portfolio trading in High Grade. We do feel very comfortable about the launch of our enhanced portfolio trading platform and our embedded unique data attributes. That's what clients are asking us for. We've been out talking to clients that are portfolio traders, and obviously, as Rich mentioned, it's a very concentrated dealer market in the portfolio space, but it's certainly also concentrated among the number of traders that trade portfolio trades at the various client desks.\nI will tell you we are protocol agnostic. While we obviously have different rates for different protocols, we are delivering protocols that our clients are asking for, and we're delivering unique data to help them decide the appropriate protocol at the appropriate time. I do think the other patterns that we have recognized as lower volume, we do see higher levels of portfolio trading in the market because it's just easier to price a portfolio when the market isn't moving or gyrating. We've also identified that in Q2, given the lower volatility.\n\nRichard Schiffman\n\nGlobal Head of Trading Solutions, MarketAxess\n\nI trust the, maybe about automation, what that is going to do here? One thing we learned in the earliest days of the company is that when we make things easier, people trade more. All of this investment that we're making in automation, Adaptive Auto-X, and all these capabilities, one nice benefit from all this is the potential for increases in turnover and seeing more activity that way. We believe as this starts to take hold, we're going to see the benefits come from that, more activity taking place because it's just easier for people to trade.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Patrick O’Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. For clients who access your platform via the leading order management systems, to what extent do they have access to your entire suite of protocols, data solutions, workflow solutions, and algorithms?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, there's a number of leading sizable order management systems across the globe that we interact with. We certainly work closely with our partners at those order management systems to ensure that our various protocols, our various APIs, and our data is available. We've certainly worked closely with some of the largest. The nice thing about our design is when the OMS connects to us, they can move orders into our environment, and then within our environment, clients can move those orders across various different protocols, so they become available instantly in our environment to move them from protocol to protocol.\nAs we mentioned, the new platform that we've launched allows clients to load those orders directly from the OMS, and we're integrated to really all of the OMSs that are material in our market. Once they blow those orders onto our platform, they can manage them as high touch, low touch, and no touch, which is really delivering them into our automation suite. It allows a client to really have a centralized cockpit to decide how to trade their various order sizes. From that cockpit, they can deliver those orders into each of our protocols. All those protocols are instantly available.\nMore importantly, we embed that data that I spoke about earlier, that proprietary data, side by side with their orders so they can make logical decisions based on data that they've never seen before on what protocol, what dealers, and what automation solutions are available to them. That's really had an impact. In fact, as we were rolling out our new platform, we embedded it with a number of what we call power users, and we've seen those power users increase their overall activity levels from migrating from the old platform to the new platform.\nTo go back to your original question, the integration with the OMSs is quite complete, and the new platform is showing early signs of higher levels of activity given the seamless interactions that clients now have, and the number of line items they can manage on a single platform. The other piece of good news with regard to the OMSs is our Adaptive Auto-X solution has a number of unique characters in it. When it actually fills a larger size trade, it can fill it in a series of smaller size trades.\nAs Rich mentioned earlier, those interactions have all been integrated with all the leading OMS providers. We are able to access the clients on those platforms who can have easy access and seamless access to Adaptive Auto-X. Right now, we have within our pilot a number of clients that are spread out across the various OMSs that we interact with.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThat's very helpful, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is a follow-up from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for taking the follow up question on retail. I was hoping you could just maybe elaborate on how you're interfacing with retail demand. I know you guys are more of an institutional shop, but you do have connectivity to wealth platforms. You also get the benefit from the ETF side, so just any color there you can share and how you think about expanding that, how attractive do you view that end market? Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess",
    "content2": "Sure. Great question. Obviously, we have seen retail re-enter the fixed income market, and it's quite exciting to see fixed income assets as an attractive investment for retail. You see that in the TRACE numbers, as the average trade size in TRACE has dropped dramatically over the last two quarters and continues to thrive. We touch retail in a number of different ways. We recently launched our Axess IQ platform, which is designed specifically for private wealth firms, and we're seeing a great deal of success on that as we continue to onboard new clients on a regular basis, quarter each quarter.\nIt's hitting record volumes and tapping into a very important part of the retail private wealth sector. The other area that we see retail coming into our market is through the growth of SMA, separately managed accounts. To remind you, these managed accounts are managed by large institutional investors that are using our platform every day. Their tickets come in much smaller size, and part of the growth of our automation solution that you see quarter-over-quarter is really a reflection of the growth of SMA and the burden of managing small tickets within a large institutional player. Their demand for our automation is growing as the SMA assets are growing.\nCertainly, the forecasts by industry experts on SMA growth, particularly around the fixed income arena, is quite high for the years to come given where yields are. We think we're well positioned for supporting the retail market and quite excited about the potential growth of that SMA part of the industry.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour final question comes from the line of Rich Repetto. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nOh boy. Yeah, I'm a personal investor, and I'd like to ask what are your mid June volumes? Because you're comparing your July volumes to a number that's fictitious and non-disclosed. Just trying to figure out what your June volumes were, mid June volumes.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nOkay. Rich, are you with Repetto and Associates now?\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nThat's exactly it, yes.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nAll right, well, we'd appreciate if you go back to the golf course, enjoy your retirement, but it's a fair question. Rich, look, we are looking at our, you know, we can't predict the next eight days. We do want to give some color around the activity levels that we are seeing. As I mentioned, High Grade market share is running at our mid month June levels, and we're very excited about next week and month end. We're not going to forecast those High Grade market share numbers because July has a lot more involved given the Fed rate decision next week.\nThank you for your question, and I really appreciate your time today away from your very busy schedule.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nVery helpful. Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nAll right.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call to Chris Concannon.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you. Thanks, everyone, for your time today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thanks again.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press the pound key. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 26 April 2023. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Bo. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Chris Concannon, Chief Executive Officer, will provide you with an update on key business trends. Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Rick McVey, Founder and Executive Chairman, will provide an update on the market environment and the long-term opportunity ahead for the company. Before I turn the call over to Chris Concannon, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2022. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning. I'm very pleased to share with you our strong first quarter results on my first earnings call as CEO of MarketAxess. We continued to execute our growth strategy during the quarter and delivered record revenues, which increased 9%, or 11% on a constant currency basis. Earnings per share grew 15%, reflecting the continued improvement in our underlying revenue and earnings growth trends as shown on slide three. These strong results were broad based across products, protocols, and geographies, reflecting the powerful diversification of our model, driven by the investments we have made over the past several years.\nSpecifically, we delivered record levels of average daily trading volumes across nearly all products, the fourth consecutive quarter of strong estimated market share gains, record levels of commission revenue across US high yield, emerging markets, and Eurobonds, record levels of revenue and trading volume contribution from our international businesses, and record levels of volume from newer client segments, new initiatives, and record levels of automation. In summary, we had a very strong quarter with records across key products and protocols. The impact of the rapid rate rise in 2022 has now filtered into the broader market, resulting in the banking sector market dislocation in March. While we have seen a retracement in industry volumes over the last several weeks, we believe this is a temporary pause as the markets digest the events of March and their impact on the trajectory of rate hikes for the Federal Reserve.\nLastly, I could not be more pleased to have Nancy Altobello as our new Lead Independent Director of the Board, which was announced earlier this week. Nancy brings a wealth of audit, talent, management, diversity, and corporate culture experience to the role, and I'm looking forward to our continued collaboration and partnership. Slide four highlights the strength of our unique all-to-all solution, Open Trading. We were very pleased with the performance of Open Trading in March as liquidity became more challenging. In March, we saw daily highs of Open Trading share grow to 57% in high grade and 61% in high yield. For the quarter, we registered record Open Trading average daily volume of $4.5 billion US dollars, up 21%, with record US high grade share of 34%. We are executing approximately 13,000 trades per day in Open Trading and approximately 32,000 trades per day across total credit.\nOpen Trading also delivered total price improvement of $252 million US dollars, well in excess of our quarterly revenue. Slide five highlights our multi-dimensional growth across new products, new initiatives, new client segments, and geographies. First, in new products, we grew estimated municipal market share to a record 6.4% in the quarter with 376 active client firms trading. We have also recently integrated the MuniBrokers system with the MarketAxess pool of liquidity to provide clients with more trading options in US Treasuries. We continue to see client growth in our treasury offering with 250 active participants on the platform, up from 145 in the prior year. We have established a very strong pipeline of future growth cylinders with record volume across dealer RFQ, portfolio trading, our Diversity dealer initiative, and Axess IQ, our front end for private banks in Europe.\nWe are also seeing strong contributions to our growth from newer client segments, including hedge funds, systematic funds, dealer-initiated flow, and private banks. We generated a record $216 billion US dollars in trading volume from these important client segments, which now represent 25% of our total credit trading volume. Our estimated share of US high grade can fluctuate given various market factors, including the banking crisis, block trading activity, new issuance, and growth in client segments outside of our focus on institutional client flow. For example, we estimate that the dealer-to-dealer retail segments of TRACE grew 31% year-over-year and now represent a combined 28% of high grade TRACE, up from 25% in the prior year. Lastly, in emerging markets, we had record ADV this quarter, with local market volume growing 10% year-over-year to a record $71 billion US dollars in the quarter.\nSlide six shows the continued strong adoption of automation tools by our clients. Powered by CP+, automated trading increased to a record $69 billion US dollars in volume and a record 398,000 trades. Importantly, our automation tools have continued to grow through periods of significant market dislocation, which is a testament to the quality and accuracy of our CP+ data. Today, Auto-X represents 20% of total credit trade count and 8% of our total credit trading volume. At the core of our automation tools and workflow is CP+, our world-class algorithmic pricing engine, which was a key driver of our record data revenue in the quarter. With the recent launch of Adaptive Auto-X, which is currently in pilot, we are delivering an algo trading solution that automates trading across protocol and liquidity pool, while seeking to greatly improve their execution quality.\nBefore I turn the call over to Chris Gerosa, I wanted to provide an update on market trends. With three important trading days remaining in the month, market volumes are weaker in April, but US high grade estimated market share has improved from March and is running above first quarter levels. Now let me turn the call over to Chris for a review of our strong financial results.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. On slide eight, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials for the quarter. We delivered record revenue of $203 million US dollars, up 9%, driven by strong market share gains across most products. On a constant currency basis, revenues would have increased approximately 11%. Record information services revenue is up 12%, or 18% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The benefit of the contract signed in the fourth quarter and increased adoption of CP+, Axess All Prints, and TraX data was a positive driver of a strong year-over-year performance. First quarter post-trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $700,000 US dollars on the strengthening US dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 8%. The lower contribution from RFQ Hub was driven by a tax adjustment related to the 2022 financials.\nThe effective tax rate was 25% below the prior year period. On slide nine, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 10%. Our growth in total credit commission revenue was driven by record increases in estimated market share, and healthy increases in our trading volume, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across US high grade. The reduction in high grade fee capture from prior year was driven principally by the lower duration of US high grade bonds traded over our platform compared to the prior year. While US high grade fee capture declined year-over-year, duration has remained relatively stable over the last several months, as reflected in the Corporate Bond Duration index. On slide 10, we provide a summary of our operating expenses.\nFirst quarter expenses increased 10%, driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, expenses would have increased 12%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $5 million US dollars on a 12% increase in headcount, mainly in technology and customer-facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Tech and communications expenses increased $3 million US dollars due to higher subscription and data hosting expenses. Clearing costs were flat despite higher Open Trading volumes due to renegotiated clearing fees related to US Treasuries and the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Our marketing and G&A expenses increased principally due to increases in advertising, G&A costs, and higher office-related expenses that had been reduced in the prior year due to the pandemic. On slide 11, we provide an update on our balance sheet, cash flow, and capital management.\nOur balance sheet continues to be solid, with cash and investments totaling $440 million, and we had no outstanding debt at quarter end. We are prudently investing our cash to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment to continue to deliver strong net interest income in the coming quarters. We are a strong cash flow generator, as our trailing twelve-month free cash flow came in at $271 million US dollars. During the past twelve months, we paid out $107 million US dollars in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.72 US dollars based on the financial performance of the company. Now let me turn the call over to Rick to provide an update on market conditions and a long-term growth opportunity ahead of us.\n\nRick McVey\n\nFounder and Executive Chairman, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. Slide 13 provides an update on market conditions and US credit. As we have noted over the last several quarters, last year's rapid rate increases dramatically impacted investment grade index returns, and the higher rate environment is now beginning to flow through to the investment portfolios of banks. The distressed trading conditions in some parts of the bank and finance sector in March led to a short-term increase in TRACE volumes, with transactions in distressed bank names moving back to the phone due to the extreme volatility. We believe that the recent softness in corporate bond volumes reported at TRACE is likely to be temporary due to the uncertainty in the banking sector and the upcoming May Fed meeting.\nThe overriding theme in my view is the highest yield environment we have seen in over 13 years, and the opportunity for global investors to reallocate assets back into fixed income. That trend was apparent in the record high grade TRACE volumes in Q1, reflecting higher trading velocity. Market volumes in credit normally fall in April from March due to the holiday calendars, so part of what we are seeing currently is seasonal. Investment grade TRACE ticket count in Q1 grew 59%, and average trade sizes declined 25%. As fixed income becomes an investable asset class again and investors re-enter the market, both retail and institutional investors are seeing higher ticket count, leading to an essential need to embrace trading automation for efficiency. Lastly, all these positive market drivers are manifesting themselves in increased velocity of trading.\nTurnover was an annualized 74% in the first quarter in US high grade, up from 64% in the first quarter of 2022. Yields are at their highest level since 2009, and at that time high grade annual trading turnover was around 80%. Trading velocity is benefiting from higher yields, greater market participation, and the technology benefits of improved trading efficiency. Slide 14 illustrates the total revenue opportunity we have before us, which has expanded significantly in the last few years as we have invested to expand our product offering. The product set that we had in 2018 gave us access to a total addressable market of approximately $4 billion US dollars in revenue. Since 2018, we have diversified our products and protocols and expanded geographically. For example, we acquired unique capabilities in the US Treasury market. We complemented our organic growth in municipal bonds with MuniBrokers.\nWe have expanded into ETF share trading with our investment in RFQ Hub, and we accelerate our growth in post-trade data with the acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub. We have also increased our investment in data products, including our comprehensive real-time data product CP+, and our entry into the index space with both high grade and high yield indices. The investments that we have made over the last several years have expanded our total addressable market by $3 billion US dollars to a current estimate of $7 billion US dollars. We are in early stages of executing in many of these areas, and we feel more confident than ever in the long runway of growth opportunities still in front of us. In summary, on slide 15, we continue to execute well against our growth strategy.\nWe delivered the fourth consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong market share gains and improved market volumes. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering. We have a strong pipeline of new products, new trading protocols, and increased client diversification, driven by growth with hedge funds, private banks, and dealer-initiated order flow. Now we would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, Mr. McVey. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, if you do have any questions, simply press star one, and if you do find your question has been addressed, you can remove yourself from the queue by pressing the pound key. We'll take our first question this morning from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning, Chris, Rick, and Chris. First, congrats, Chris, for taking over the helm. I guess the first question is, first question is, you come from a long background of automation or other experience in other asset classes, and you talked about a lot of metrics here, that smaller trade sizes, increased velocity, you know, that point to this electronification. I guess one question is, this Adaptive Auto-X, you know, what kind of impact do you think, is that a key to, you know, further along the automation trend? Or what tools do you see besides Auto-X that are going to really spur that conversion?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, first, thanks for the question and thanks for the congrats, Rich. You've covered me for a long enough number of years that you probably already know my answer to the question. I'm quite bullish about electronification of the bond market. I'll start by mentioning we did have record volume and record revenue in our automation suite. You know, the first key ingredient to automation is data. Data is a key ingredient. If you have good data, you're going to have good automation. Second, if automation replicates what manual traders do identically or a similar replication, then you'll have, you know, have constant growth in automation, meaning people will adopt it to gain efficiencies. The key ingredient to what I call accelerated growth of automation is if it achieves better results than the human execution and does it efficiently.\nThat's really what we're targeting Adaptive Auto-X to do, which is achieve better results by automating the execution solution across protocols, across liquidity pools, and giving it unique data. Our automation, it's important to point out, our automation suite, which, you know, Adaptive Auto-X is just in pilot now and just launched just a couple weeks ago. Our overall automation suite grew 40% year-over-year, which is quite healthy growth to hit those records. More recently, we launched Auto-X in municipals, and we saw that grow quickly to 23% of total exempt trades, which is pretty impressive growth. My point is, Rich, that automation, when it starts to be adopted, can have pretty healthy growth rates even in the more challenging market that we saw in the first quarter.\nThe automation tools held up throughout the difficulties of March. With all that said, and all that growth, and all those records, when you really add up our total automation footprint in the US corporate bond market, it's just under 2% of the market. We have a really long way to go when it comes to automation. To put that in comparison, the FX market has seen algos, client algos, now achieve over 20% of the market. While we've still seen record volume and record growth in our automation suite, we're at the early stages of automating the full bond market.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it, got it. Chris, I think you guys addressed some of this, but we are seeing volumes now lighten up from, you know, mid-March, and you talked about, you know, seasonality of April and sort of reallocation I think is still going on. Can you just make investors a little bit? Has the outlook, the outlook for 2023 I thought super strong. Is that still the case, or is this just a momentary pause, or has anything changed the outlook for volumes, credit volumes for the year I would say?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat question. I mean, we couldn't be any more bullish about the bond market. Despite what I'll call momentary or temporary disruption in the market. Rich, bonds are cool again. We're seeing higher interest from our clients, as well as their clients, in terms of allocation of investment dollars towards the fixed income market. It's certainly a market that is providing better yield and better principal protection than the stock market. I would say we are in a risk off environment coming off the heels of the market disruption in the banking sector. We also are seeing a unique April month of holidays. I will tell you, my friends in the equities, the FX, the derivatives, and even the crypto market, they're all complaining about volumes. It's not unique to the fixed income market. It's really market wide that we're seeing this risk off environment.\nWe do have the Fed next week. I do think a lot of investors are sitting on the sideline waiting to see some of the Fed moves. We are going through earnings season as well. This week we are seeing higher levels of activity. It is encouraging now that all the vacation and spring breaks are over, we're seeing higher levels of activity. More importantly, we do see and expect higher new issue market in May. We are hearing more positive things around the new issue market in May.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it, got it. Lastly, most of the top-level managers in fixed income trading platforms are skilled golfers. I guess my question, Chris, what have you done to improve your golf skills?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThat's a very appropriate question, Rich. I would say my golf score is correlated to our revenue and market share. As our revenue and market share goes up, my golf score, my handicap, will continue to rise.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Chris Allen of Citi.\n\nChris Allen\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nYeah, morning guys. I won't comment on your golf game. I know how challenged it is just on the CP+ uptake showing up in the market data. Is that just a longer-term ongoing trend, or is that maybe an anticipation of Adaptive Auto-X launch? Maybe you could just give us some color just on what the feedback's been on the pilot phase there, and kind of expectations around when that we form when we launch the broader marketplace.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Your first question on market data or just CP+ generally?\n\nChris Allen\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nJust how that's kind of flowing through into market data, like what's driving that?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYes. Obviously, the growth in market data, as we mentioned, we saw record revenues in our market data in Q1, largely driven by the growth of CP+ across US high grade, high yield, EM, and Eurobonds. It's certainly becoming the benchmark of real-time pricing in the US corporate bond market. That's where we're seeing the demand for CP+. We're excited about that. CP+ is a key driver of our automation success. Again, record revenue and record volumes in our automation suite, driven by the superiority of CP+. It's a key ingredient as well to our Adaptive Auto-X, which allows clients to take advantage of all of our different protocols and also take advantage of providing liquidity based on CP+ pricing.\nIt's certainly a sign that our largest institutional clients are comfortable with the price point of CP+ and what it produces in terms of price of US bonds. Adaptive Auto-X is early days. I will tell you the excitement as we went out to talk to our largest clients across the US and Europe. They're all extremely excited about access to Adaptive Auto-X. We had to actually reduce the pilot because of overwhelming demand to get into the pilot. It's early days and something that we're super excited about.\n\nChris Allen\n\nAnalyst, Citi\n\nThanks, guys. I'll get back to the queue.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Kyle Voigt of KBW.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nHey, good morning. I like the addition of that chart on slide five that shows the volume growth from some of these newer user segments. I guess the one that I wanted to hone in on that saw record volume in the quarter was this hedge fund clients and growth there. Just wondering if you could provide a bit more color as to how that's ramped over the last couple years and where you're seeing a lot of the growth from, is that from systematic funds or is it from credit hedge funds? Also, if you could comment on whether you're continuing to see growth in the number of those hedge fund clients being onboarded onto the platform as we can try to think about whether this growth from this segment has momentum and is sustainable as we look ahead.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, no, it's an exciting area, Kyle, that we've spent a lot of time on. We have a team dedicated to our hedge fund segment, and particularly focused on the systematic fund complex. That's an area that's exciting to me because I've known these clients from my equity and FX days, and they're all ramping up and gearing up to take advantage of the current fixed income market structure. All-to-all is a key ingredient to them. They both cross the spread, but more importantly, they are providers of liquidity and see that as a huge opportunity to launch some of their trading strategies in the fixed income market.\nIn an environment where you only cross spread, it's very difficult for systematic hedge funds to engage their strategies in that market. Our all-to-all platform provides them with the ability to both provide liquidity, as well as cross spread at a much more reasonable cost. That's the key part of their trading strategy. I would say there's a healthy pipeline of new entry from the systematic fund group. I think we're still early days. We've seen some fund groups have substantial success in the US Credit market across both high yield and high grade, and they're certainly expanding that success into other product areas. I'd say it's a healthy pipeline, and we're still a long way off from a more mature entry of that segment.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThat's really helpful. If I can ask just a follow-up on the Muni business, just wondering if you could talk about the transition of the MuniBrokers business and what that means for revenues and revenue capture, revenue capture rates as we go through that transition, and then maybe provide some updated thoughts on the long-term potential revenue capture that you see for that Muni bond business. I think it was just under maybe $200 US dollars per million in the quarter. I recall that when you launched into the Muni space, I think the opportunity at that time felt like the fee capture rates could be closer to $400 US dollars or $500 US dollars per million.\nJust wondering maybe if we can get just an updated kind of view in terms of long term what the fee capture opportunity is, and then maybe what the market share opportunity is as you see it today too.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. First, on overall Muni, the Muni business is thriving. We did hit record market share in the Muni market, again, another record for the quarter. We're super excited about the integration of MuniBrokers. Our vision of the MuniBrokers acquisition was one, collection and acquisition of data to help us build our data products across all our products, but also it was the acquisition of more liquidity and more transaction volume. Not only the MuniBrokers business, but also integrating a large quantity of that business into our MarketAxess pool of liquidity. We've started that final step of integration and are very excited about the outcome so far. It's not a big bang integration. It's a multi-step integration over the course of the next quarter. With regard to capture, I'll let Chris jump in and answer the capture question.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nHey Kyle. Just a reminder, the MuniBrokers fee model was a subscription-based model and it ranged anywhere from $60 to 80 US dollars per million. Our plan is to convert that volume into Open Trading where we'll capture our Open Trading fee model, and reminding everyone this is a tax-exempt Muni product which typically ranges between $150 to 200 US dollars per million. We're looking to capture that latter fee card as we transition that volume into our platform.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to zone in a little bit on the high-yield business. Chris, I think you gave an update on high grade market share. I was wondering if you'd comment on high-yield as well in April. Bigger picture, we've seen just more volatility in the market share within high yield over the last six to nine months. Maybe you could just kind of comment, what is the bigger driver of market share shifts we've seen month-to-month, and sort of what do you think about the ideal environment for high-yield share to sort of accelerate on a more consistent basis?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. First of all, we obviously saw record volume and record volume revenue in our high-yield market in the first quarter. Again, a number of records in the first quarter. As we look at April, volumes in TRACE volumes are down substantially across both high grade and high-yield. It's a more challenging market. Overall, the high yield market I'm super excited about. We continue to make headway in the high yield market. Our OT penetration is a key ingredient in high yield. We saw 51% of our high yield volume be through Open Trading liquidity, which obviously is where we're gaining a great deal of market share. Overall, we see high yield participants enjoying that alternative liquidity, particularly when the market continues to get stressed.\nWhen there's volatility in a high yield market, Open Trading does spike, as I mentioned in my opening remarks. To the extent there's additional volatility, to the extent we see high grade bonds dropping into the high yield market, we'll continue to see that volatility throughout the course of the year. That volatility has historically led to higher market share for our Open Trading.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, gotcha. I guess the dynamic in March with decline in high yield market share was almost too much volatility. Is that kind of how you describe it?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, there was clear volatility in March throughout. More importantly, there's a number of distressed bonds that we don't trade in Open Trading during those times. Yeah, we saw substantial volatility in March, which also led to some of those spike market shares in our Open Trading solution.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thanks. Just maybe my follow-up was hoping you guys could hone in a little bit more on the retail trading opportunity. You see, maybe frame what kind of the retail trading contribution is in credit today across the platform, and maybe help delineate what the fee per million difference is there and how that could ultimately drive an improvement in a blended fee per million over time. Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, well, first, our primary business is the institutional credit business, the institutional fixed income business. That's our distribution channel and has been historically. We have seen a recent rise in retail in the market, an area that we haven't dedicated full resources to. We do see an opportunity in retail, and we've made headway with Axess IQ, our private bank offering in Europe. We're seeing higher demand for that offering. We've launched it into a client in Asia as well. We do see an opportunity in retail, particularly given where our execution quality sits in terms of the institutional market. If you look at the muni market, even high grade and high yield, the overall market trade size is declining from a historic level. We're seeing smaller trade sizes across our platform and across the TRACE market.\nWe do think we have a very viable retail offering given the quality price that we can deliver with an Open Trading trade execution, just higher quality price and being able to deliver at much smaller sizes than historically. We think there's a wonderful retail opportunity as retail reinvests in the fixed income market given the yields that this market's showing.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAwesome. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe just zone in a little bit on volatility in general. Thinking about obviously some of the more extreme trading in March. If we do have that type of environment off and on this year, how do you view the market share dynamic, or I should say really more like the behavior of trading across desks? Do you tend to see more usage of the phone, or is that more in distressed bonds like you alluded to, Chris? Can you talk about the education process, I guess, and the merits of the Open Trading platform and the price improvement that you can get in those types of environments, and is that sort of an uphill battle to try to gain share, or do you think it's really achievable?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nFirst, we thrive in volatile markets. We do. You know, if you look back at 2020, there was obviously records set across 2020. Our platform, our offering does thrive in volatile markets. More importantly, March was evidence of this. Our automation tools ran consistently throughout the disruption and volatility in March, which is a key differentiator from prior volatile times like 2020. We feel really good about the offering, we feel exceptionally good about the liquidity that is provided through our all-to-all during more volatile times. As I mentioned, our OT market share, Open Trading all-to-all market share, did spike upwards during the most volatile times of March, reflecting alternative liquidity providers stepping into the market when traditional providers are stepping back from that market.\nWe feel good if there's volatility in the market. We feel really good about our position in the market, particularly around the distressed bonds. That's a market where, and again, they're not frequent, but that's a market that does tend to go to the phone or go to chat when there's a distressed bond situation. Again, we do enjoy the benefits of volatility. If volatility comes back into the market, we would expect, you know, an offering that is, you know, quite comfortable for our clients.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Then a follow-up. Just going back to the slide where you showed the market, where you showed the growth in the new segments, not new segments, but growth in particularly hedge funds and systems strategies. Can you talk about your market share in those areas versus your overall market share, in other words? I guess if you continue to penetrate those markets, should we expect that to be a positive contributor to your market share going forward?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, first of all, the new entry, particularly the systematic fund complex, I think it actually has a benefit to our market share, but overall turnover in the market, these are new strategies that are being launched into the fixed income market that we haven't seen before. It's really new turnover and attractive to both us and our clients, our bank clients, and our liquidity providers to interact with that kind of liquidity. The new entry is a positive for not only the liquidity in the bond market, but also overall turnover and velocity of trading in the bond market. Obviously, the new entry takes full advantage of all-to-all. We're obviously favored given our all-to-all offering across all of our products, from high grade to high yield, munis, and even our treasury product is another place where we're seeing entry.\nSuper positive for the market, super positive for velocity and turnover in the fixed income market, but particularly positive for MarketAxess and our all-to-all offerings across all the products.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat, great. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.\n\nDaniel Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up, Chris, on some of your comments in your prepared remarks around the factors that impact your market share. Obviously, new issuance has always been something you've talked about, but I think there was also discussion around products or growth in areas that you don't, or parts of the market that you don't participate in. Maybe if you could expand upon what your true addressable market is within, you know, kind of high grade as we can think about what the factors or what your market share should look like based upon what you are currently in, and maybe what you plan to enter in, in terms of additional markets going forward.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. First, you know, I want to point out that we had first quarter record revenues and record volumes across most of our products. We certainly also had sizable growth in share in our US Corporate products as well. You know, High Yield grew over 3% in market share, and we had records in Open Trading ADV across US Corporate bonds as well. Overall growth and records across our US Corporate products is quite exciting. If we want to get granular and look at market share of High Grade, we saw across TRACE higher levels of retail. That's a client segment that we have not chased after or spent resources on. Retail clients do have connectivity to us, but the overall retail market did grow in investment grade bonds over the course of the first quarter, and that explains some of the lower average trade size in the TRACE market as well.\nQuite frankly, we're quite happy with record revenues and record volumes across our US Corporate market, and quite happy with our market share growth across the US Corporate market.\n\nDaniel Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Okay, I guess then just a separate question following up on the distribution fees were higher. You said there was some dealer, I think new dealers as well as upgrades from existing fee plans. Maybe as we think about that good run rate from here, is the upgrade cycle something that we should think about as ongoing? Any more color there would be helpful.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Dan, it was really a combination year-over-year and sequentially, both upgrades and new dealers signing on for fixed fee plans. As you point out, it's difficult to anticipate what that number or how it could change going forward. From a modeling perspective, we would recommend that we're looking at it as Q1 being the run rate, but also recognizing that there is risk to our fixed distribution fees. To the extent there's consolidation in the dealer sector, we could see fees dissipate, or alternatively, we could see new dealers come on board to offset that.\n\nDaniel Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Atlantic Equities\n\nHi, thanks for taking my question. I recall that I think it was last quarter you mentioned that you were looking at ways to, I guess, share in more of the value creation of Open Trading with your clients. I was wondering if you could just update us on your thoughts around that, how you'd expect to, I guess, implement such a strategy over time, and how meaningful that could be.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. First of all, Open Trading continues to set records. We had record revenue in Open Trading, and we obviously saw record spikes of Open Trading market share of our overall market. It also continues to deliver substantial cost savings to our clients, and as I mentioned in my opening remarks, cost savings that are actually higher than our total revenue. Very attractive to our client base. The other attractive piece that Open Trading delivers is the ability for clients to avoid crossing, spread, and reduce and improve their overall execution quality. That's an area of focus of ours as we encourage more clients to use Open Trading to provide other clients with liquidity.\nIt's a key ingredient to our treasury offering as well, where we're offering Open Trading or all-to-all in the treasury market for the first time and seeing a number of very large clients taking advantage of that offering. Exciting activities in our Open Trading offering in Treasuries, but also across Open Trading across all our products. It continues to be a driver of market share in munis, in our emerging markets, in high yield, and high grade. Super exciting activity in the quarter on our all-to-all Open Trading offering. We're continuing to see clients and client behavior change to take advantage of that.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Atlantic Equities\n\nOkay, thanks. Just secondarily, in terms of when we think about the comments about market share so far in April for US high grade being back above Q1 levels, I was wondering if you could perhaps put it in terms of the market share. If you adjust out the sort of distressed bonds that sort of distorted everything, has the market share been pretty stable after you adjust for that in March through to April, or has there been a pickup even relative to that sort of adjusted level?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nI appreciate the question. There are three important days left in the month. Obviously, it's month end. We certainly enjoy higher levels of activity around month end, and we'll be putting out our monthly volumes and market share next week. It's just a little bit too early to predict where our market share levels are going to end up. As I mentioned in the open remarks, we are seeing market share in high grade above Q1.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Atlantic Equities\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We go next now to Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just continuing with the theme just on April, maybe you could just comment a little bit of what you're seeing around pricing trends on the fee per million side so far in April. How does that sort of stack up versus the first quarter? If maybe you could elaborate on some of the moving pieces around the IG versus high yield fee capture in the first quarter.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, I'll take this one. I made comments in my prepared remarks that with respect to the high grade fee capture, we've seen stability, and it's very indicative of the Bloomberg Duration Index that's out there for everybody to monitor. There's a lot of factors that contribute to our fee capture. You have the product mix, you have the protocol mix across RFQ and Open Trading. It really depends month to month on what mix of product is coming through. I'll point to where we saw upside in historical quarters. We saw a heavier mix of high yield, which is our highest fee product in the product set. In this month, we're seeing elevated volumes with Eurobonds relative to the market volumes that we're seeing sequentially, which is one of the lower fee capture products.\nIt really bears down to what's the product mix because we're not seeing the same impact that we saw with the high grade duration compressing our fee capture year-over-year.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, great. Just a follow up question. As you guys have more and more success with Open Trading, that does, I believe, tie up more working capital for clearing of those trades just because you self clear. Maybe you could just remind us how much of the balance sheet resources are being used to support the clearing of customer trades. If Open Trading volumes were to, say, double, you know, how should we think about that translating into incremental trade balance sheet resources being used to help support that? How do you think about driving more balance sheet efficiency for that over time?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nYes. In the peak of March, we had enough capital resident within our two clearing and broker dealers to support the elevated trading volumes that we were seeing in light of it contributing to increased fails and increased deposit requirements. The $330 million US dollars of cash that you saw at the end of March, roughly $200 million US dollars of that was residing within the two clearing entities to support Open Trading. As we think about our balance sheet today, we feel very comfortable with the amount of capital resident in the company to support our business and not seen on the balance sheet.\nWe didn't have any outstanding debt at quarter end, but we do have access to $750 million US dollars of borrowing facilities, secured facilities at the holding company, and $250 million US dollars unsecured facility at the holding company, and $250 million US dollars secured at the broker dealers, which we have not had to borrow on of late. We do have the ability to secure additional funds if we need to.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nNow I would just point out a growth in Open Trading, and particularly a doubling of Open Trading, will produce additional cash to our balance sheet pretty dramatically given our current corporate margin. That's a healthy problem to have as you grow Open Trading to produce more cash into the balance sheet. Chris mentioned spikes in Open Trading. We have plenty of capital to support Open Trading spikes and Open Trading growth as it stands today.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI'm going now to Patrick O'Shaughnessy at Raymond James.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning. Can you provide an update on the current competitive dynamics in the recently issued component of the corporate bond market, and how much of total market volume does that segment represent?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThe competitive dynamic of corporate bond market?\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nThe recently issued component.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nPatrick, I'll jump in here. As you know, following us for a long time, those numbers ebb and flow with the calendar. The newly issued bonds and peak periods can get up to 12% to 13% of TRACE in the short-term, and they averaged something lower than that, probably more like 7%. It ebbs and flows with the calendar.\nQuite honestly, I don't think the dynamic has changed in terms of the competitive landscape around new issues.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGot it, thank you. Can you provide an update on what you're seeing in terms of client interest in your portfolio trading solution?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Our portfolio trading solution had record volume in Q1. It's grown substantially year-over-year. We have obviously been delivering numerous features and functionality to clients throughout the course of 2022, and even today we're constantly delivering functionality. The reception is in the numbers, given the records that we've seen in portfolio trading. I do think portfolio trading, particularly in March and part of the first quarter, is a little bit challenged to provide portfolio trading during more volatile times. Portfolio trading is an important part of the market and will continue to be here as a workflow solution for clients. We continue to deliver a high value tool for clients to manage their portfolio.\nI think the next step in portfolio trading is really building the analytics to decide what to portfolio and what not to put in your portfolio trading, which is really what we're hearing from our clients in terms of demand. They want to understand analytics around the portfolio to adjust their portfolio, either pull bonds out or put bonds in to improve the pricing of a portfolio. Certainly, very pleased with our performance in the portfolio trading landscape.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. It appears we have no further questions this morning. I would like to turn the conference back to the company.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you all for your time today, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude the MarketAxess First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Like to thank you all so much for joining us, and wish you all a great day. Goodbye.",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Fourth Quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company.\nChris Concannon, President and COO, will review key business trends, and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.\nNow, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter and full year results. We continue to execute our growth strategy and delivered the third consecutive quarter of record market share gains across nearly all our product areas, strong increases in trading volumes, and significant price improvement for clients through our unique all-to-all trading protocol, Open Trading. Our underlying revenue growth trends improved materially in the quarter despite near-term bond duration and FX revenue headwinds. We delivered 8% revenue growth, 10% adjusted for currency, EBITDA growth of 10%, and EPS growth of 15%. With this strong finish to the year, we delivered our 14th straight year of record annual revenue. Slide four highlights the key areas of our growth strategy. Our leadership position in global credit continues to expand beyond just US.\nHigh grade, with record estimated market share in high-yield and municipals, record share in eurobonds, and accelerating share gains of almost 300 basis points in emerging markets, reflecting our increasing global diversification. The deep pool of liquidity on our platform continues to expand, with a record of nearly 2,100 active client firms, and a record number of active traders. We have seen especially strong growth in our international business, with over 1,000 active client firms and nearly 6,000 active traders. As traditional sources of liquidity have become scarce, the importance of our all-to-all liquidity increases, and a record 38% of our credit volume was executed through Open Trading. This has been a key driver of our estimated market share gains, and a source of valuable price improvement for our clients. For the full year 2022, an astonishing 1,300 client firms provided liquidity on the MarketAxess platform.\nIn summary, the foundation of our business has never been better, with accelerating growth in trading volume, new market share records, increasing momentum in new product areas, and a substantial addressable market opportunity. With this strong financial performance as backdrop, earlier this month, we announced that Chris Concannon, a proven leader deeply experienced in electronic markets, will assume the CEO role in April. I will take on the new role of Executive Chairman. I would like to congratulate Chris on the promotion to CEO. It is well-deserved, and given his strengths in automation, eTrading protocols, data product delivery, and ETF, Chris is the right person to lead the company. Now is the right time to make this transition because we have never been in a better position.\nI am excited about my new role as Executive Chairman, where I will continue to work with Chris and our Board of Directors on long-term strategy, key client relationships, regulatory affairs, and investor communications. We will continue to invest actively in our business by developing new trading and data capabilities, adding new product areas, and expanding internationally. We believe we have an outstanding opportunity set for the next decade and beyond, and many reasons to believe the fixed-income market environment will be favorable for eTrading and data revenue growth. Slide five provides an update on market conditions and US credit. In 2022, the Fed raised the Fed Funds Rate a total of 425 basis points, making it the fastest rate hike cycle since 1980 to 1981.\nThis shock to the fixed-income markets, especially with the initial moves in the first half of the year, drove an unprecedented 14% decline in investment-grade indices for the year, the largest negative return I have seen in my career. Along with these price declines, duration declined approximately 20% from year-end 2021 levels to the lows in October, directly impacting high-grade fee capture for institutional client eTrading activity. With some measures of inflation and economic growth trending down, interest rates have moved lower in recent months, increasing bond index duration about 6% from the lows in October. Higher bond yields around the world compared to one year ago create a better fixed-income investing environment. We are already seeing the benefits of that, with TRACE investment-grade bond volumes up 23% in Q4 versus one year ago.\nInvestment-grade TRACE ticket count in Q4 grew a remarkable 93% as investors re-enter the market and use trading automation to find liquidity. TRACE average trade size is down 38% year-over-year, another trend that is favorable for MarketAxess. Smaller tickets require greater trading automation and, at the margin, add to high-grade fee capture. I expect market volumes in high-yield, emerging markets, and eurobonds to improve this year as well. We remain optimistic on growth in trading velocity due to the improved fixed-income investing environment, increase in trading automation, and growth in market participation due to all-to-all trading opportunities. Slide six shows the strong multi-year gains in estimated market share from the pre-pandemic period in 2019. This is the third consecutive quarter of top quartile market share gains for the company.\nIn Q4 2022, all but one of our primary products were in the top quartile of historical data for year-over-year quarterly growth versus the past 10 years. Strong market share gains across our global product set, combined with improving market volume and bond duration trends, position the company well for revenue growth in 2023. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris for more details on business trends.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Rick, and thank you for the kind remarks. The last several years have been an incredible experience leveraging your deep fixed-income market knowledge and working with you as a trusted partner and Executive. The track record that you have established is unparalleled, and I am deeply grateful to you and the Board for having the confidence to pass the COO reins to me for the next phase of the growth trajectory for MarketAxess.\nThis is truly an honor, so thank you for all your support. I'm looking forward to working with our clients, with you, and with the Board on our many strategic initiatives that we will continue to unlock shareholder value for years to come. The team that we have assembled here is world-class, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on the growth opportunities ahead. Slide eight illustrates some of those tremendous growth opportunities. As we begin 2023, the strength of our franchise in terms of product and geographic breadth has never been stronger. Our leadership in global credit is expanding, reflected in the strong market share gains that we achieved over the last several quarters. These gains only serve to reinforce the sizable revenue opportunity that we have ahead of us. We believe the product opportunities that we have are further enhanced by the current market conditions.\nHigher yields typically lead to higher velocity of trading, which will increase the demand for Electronic Trading solutions. January month-to-date has seen strong new issue activity, which reduces market share in the short term, but increases outstanding debt. Our total credit ADV month-to-date is showing solid double-digit growth year-over-year and sequentially. Slide nine provides an update on Open Trading. The diversity of our liquidity pool has made a significant difference in the quality of execution for our clients. We delivered price improvement of $945 million in Open Trading for the full year, well in excess of our annual revenue of $718 million. We believe that the price improvement opportunity we deliver to clients provides us with additional flexibility to fine-tune our pricing over time, particularly when we are delivering such high levels of execution quality to client transactions.\nOpen Trading is able to deliver these levels of price improvement because it increases market participation by bringing a multitude of investment banks, systematic and alternative funds, ETF market makers, and institutional investor clients into one unique pool of liquidity. This unique liquidity pool is good for market participants, and more recently, regulators have become more focused on these types of protocols that support liquidity and market resiliency. This is a particular focus in the rates space where we believe our all-to-all solution in US treasuries is very well-positioned, with a record 244 active client firms now on the Treasury platform, up from 192 in the prior year. Slide 10 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation and credit trading. Automation tools are critical to solving for the pain points facing our clients. Clients are facing increasing cost constraints and need to find more efficient workflow solutions.\nOur automation suite of tools will be critical to helping our clients solve for these cost pressures while delivering high-quality execution. Automated trading increased to a record $62 billion in volume and a record 383,000 no-touch trades, reflecting continued strong adoption. Today, Auto-X represents 20% of total trade count and 8% of our credit trading volume. We also saw increased adoption of our Auto-X Responder solution during the fourth quarter. Additionally, the use of dealer algorithms continues to grow across our platform. Clients are increasingly facing higher ticket counts and smaller trade sizes while trying to manage their technology costs. Our automation tools are increasingly in demand to help address these growing challenges. Lastly, in the first half of this year, we will have an initial launch of our Adaptive Auto-X solution, which will provide algorithmic workflows for clients to systematically access broader liquidity across multiple trading protocols.\nThis new service is expected to unlock additional cost savings for clients while simplifying client workflow. Slide 11 illustrates the growth we are continuing to drive in Portfolio Trading. The fourth quarter was another record for Portfolio Trading, with total volume of $31 billion, up 135% year-over-year. Estimated high-grade and high-yield Portfolio Trading market volumes have remained relatively flat at around 5% to 6% of secondary TRACE volume over the last several quarters. We believe approximately 65% to 70% of Portfolio Trading activity is currently using Electronic Trading venues, and based on that, we estimate that we had an estimated 31% share of the electronic Portfolio Trading market, up from 17% in the prior year. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris Gerosa to provide an update on our financials.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials.\nFor the quarter, we delivered revenue of $178 million, up 8%, which was our best fourth quarter ever, driven by record market share gains across most products. Excluding the impact of FX, revenue would have increased approximately 10%. These strong results include the negative impact of a 9% decline in total credit fee capture, driven principally by the lower duration of US high-grade bonds traded over the platform. Record information services revenue was up 9%, or 17%, excluding the impact of FX. The full-year effect of the contract signed in the fourth quarter is a positive driver as we move into 2023. Fourth quarter post-trade revenue included a negative impact of approximately $1.1 million on the strengthening US dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of FX, the year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 8%.\nThe increase in other income was principally due to higher interest income of $3.2 million, driven by higher rates. The effective tax rate was 25.4%, slightly below the prior year period, which included the negative impact of return to provision adjustments. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and fee capture. Total commission revenue increased 9%. Our growth in total credit commission revenue was driven by record increases in estimated market share, and healthy increases in our trading volume, but was partially offset by lower fee capture across US high-grade. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven principally by higher bond yields and slightly lower years-to-maturity of bonds traded on the platform. All else equal, and assuming the same level of trading volume, we estimate that the change in US high-grade duration lowered our fourth quarter commission revenue by approximately $10 million. While the US high-grade fee capture declined year-over-year and was down slightly from Q3 2022 levels.\nDuration did move higher intra-quarter, as reflected in the Corporate Bond Index duration, which is well below the lows set in October 2022. On Slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. Fourth quarter expenses increased 8%, driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of FX, expenses would have increased 12%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $3 million on an increase in headcount, mainly in technology and customer-facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. The increase in clearing fees was due to the strong increase in credit Open Trading volume. On Slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of 31 December 2022, our cash and investments were $515 million, and we had no outstanding debt.\nOur trailing 12-month free cash flow came in at $261 million. During the year, we paid out $106 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and for 2022, we repurchased 280,000 shares for a total of $88 million. $100 million remains on the outstanding repurchase authorization. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07, which was based on the financial performance of the company. On Slide 17, we have our 2023 guidance for expenses, the effective tax rate, and CapEx. We expect that total 2023 expenses will be in the range of $418 million to $446 million. Approximately 65% of the increase is due to our continued investments in trading system and personnel to support our product and geographical expansion.\nWe expect that the effective tax rate for full year 2023 will be in the range of 25% to 26%, and 2023 CapEx is expected to range from $52 million to $58 million, of which the majority relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. Our full-year expense and CapEx guidance is based on foreign currency exchange rates as of 31 December 2022. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We delivered record levels of market share, and enhanced our competitive position in the institutional client eTrading space, both in the US and on the international front. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering and achieve record growth in active clients.\nThe market is increasingly turning to our unique Open Trading solution for liquidity and significant price improvement. Market volumes have improved, and we are currently seeing positive trends in fee capture and FX. Lastly, the improved macro backdrop for fixed income markets is creating a very attractive operating environment for MarketAxess in 2023. I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one on your telephone keypad. The first question is from Rich Rapetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRich Rapetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning, Rick and Chris and Chris. First, Rick, congratulations on the transition to the Chairman role. It's very well-deserved, and we thank you very much for mentoring that proven leader in the new asset class, Mr. Concannon.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rich.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nI needed some extra mentoring, Rich.\n\nRich Rapetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nNo, you stuck with it, and congrats, Rick. You're very bullish on the outlook for volumes. US high-grade, I think, is already starting at a record level in January, and it appears that the stars are lining up. I guess my question, Rick, is there anything that we should be—how can this get derailed? The outlook on volumes, because we've seen it happen in commodity volumes when people expected energy, oil, but financial products generally have performed as expected, I guess. Is there anything that you're watching that could potentially be unexpected and impact volumes?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nNot currently, but of course, it's a full year ahead, and markets are full of surprises.\nI will say it's encouraging to see that the mutual fund outflows that took place most of 2022 have started to turn into inflows, which is opening up the new issue calendar for the high-grade market as we start the year. Who knows? The expectation right now is that we can have a soft landing, and the inflation numbers will continue to come down, but nothing is certain, and there is the possibility that we get a negative surprise on inflation, and the Fed has to continue to move rates higher in the near term. That's not the expectation right now. I will say, while the high-grade market is wide open, we are still not seeing anywhere near normal levels of activity in markets like high-yield, emerging markets, and even euros. It's a good sign that high-grade is leading the way.\nWe're having robust levels of new issue activity this month. What I would expect to happen is this improving environment will work its way into the high-yield and emerging markets as well. EM, in particular, volumes were greatly depressed in 2022 with some of the market challenges and FX challenges throughout the course of last year. There's a huge opportunity there that if the market environment does continue to improve and we have China reopening, EM market volumes may follow the path of high-grade and improve. They have not done that yet, but that would be something to watch, I think, in the quarters ahead.\n\nRich Rapetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Got it. I was just looking at the—this is for Chris Gerosa—the cash levels seem like they went up substantially, like over $150 million quarter-to-quarter, cash and cash equivalents. Any explanation or color behind that?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Rich, it's a seasonality effect with our clearing operations. We have to put capital into DTC to support our failed activity. At the end of September, you have elevated fails, which takes on some of the cash, and the seasonality impact as you get into December, there's less trading volume, lower fails, which results in more cash on the balance sheet that we don't have to hold at DTC.\n\nRich Rapetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Got it. One last thing, Rick, the seasonality here, usually—you mentioned the higher new issuance. I guess we can—I don't know whether it's braced, but people won't be—I guess, is it fair to expect that the market share numbers in January are likely to come down? They seasonally seem like they do that all the time because our issuance is low in December, then higher in January. Is it fair to assume that market share is likely to come down due to that seasonal effect?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThat is the normal, you're exactly right, Rich. That is the normal month-to-month seasonal pattern because new issue is at the lowest level in December and often the highest in January. We're taking a holistic view of our credit market opportunity, and the guidance that Chris gave in credit ADV month-to-date in January puts us at or around record credit ADV levels. We see robust trading activity when we look more broadly across all products that we're involved in in credit.\n\nRich Rapetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Thanks, guys, and looking forward to the transition.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Allen with Citi. Your line is open.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director of Exchanges, Brokers, and Asset Managers, Citi\n\nWanted to follow up a little bit on the high-grade side.\nBasically, the one pushback we're getting on the stock now is just that the market share in high-grade has been pretty static. If you kind of look at over the last three years, right around 20%, 22%. I was wondering if you could provide any color there, particularly in the context of recent quarters. You've seen the average trade size coming down, which should be helpful for your market share at high-grade. I'm just wondering if there's any dealer activity in terms of balancing share on the high-grade versus high-yield where you're seeing good gains there. There's some other factors at play.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Chris, I'm happy to take that one. I think the way to think about high-grade is we are seeing record levels of activity even in the fourth quarter in our Open Trading all-to-all solution.\nWe are seeing gains in terms of Open Trading hit 33% of our total volume in Q4. We are seeing gains there. We are also seeing gains in our Portfolio Trading solution in high-grade. We had a record volume in PT in high-grade of $17 billion, up close to over 90%. We are making gains. Obviously, direct dealer RFQ has been running flat for us. We also made gains in our dealer RFQ, sorry, was up 23%. When I look at high-grade and high-yield full US corporate credit, the overall activity from our clients is still positive, and you are obviously seeing those big gains in high-yield. Again, the high-yield gains are driven by our Open Trading volume, which ADV grew by 43% in Q4. Overall credit activity on the platform is showing signs of substantial growth, particularly driven by Open Trading.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director of Exchanges, Brokers, and Asset Managers, Citi\n\nGot it. I just wanted to ask, I mean, obviously, the environment looks like it's trending positively in a number of different areas, and I agree with Rick in terms of the opportunity to get better. When we think about things under your control, just automation tools have been a key focus for you. Where are we at in the rollout of products, capabilities around automation tools? Are there new things on the horizon? E-commerce or more just clocking and tackling around existing products? Where are you from a customer penetration, particularly on the buy side there?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Automation continues to be a driver of activity on the platform. It had nothing but records across the board in Q4, record volume of $62 billion in our Auto-X solution. Overall, trades on the platform with automation accounted for 20% of total trades on our platform.\nNot only did we see heightened growth in Q4, but overall, the year of 2022 saw record volumes of a total of $220 billion in automated volumes. As we look forward in 2023, we continue to hear from our largest clients around their cost controls that they are facing, particularly given the AUM performance of 2022. They are facing bigger and bigger tech challenges and looking to us to help outsource some of those challenges in workflow solutions like our automation tools. As I mentioned in our open remarks, we are launching in the first half of this year what we're calling Adaptive Auto-X, which is a true client algorithm which adapts to market conditions as it trades. It's a unique solution that's being rolled out for the first time in credit trading in the US.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nJust a couple of comments to add to Chris's point is that quantitative easing caused significant changes in client asset allocation over the last three or four years, and the net result was underweight fixed income because of the zero interest rate policies around the world. That has now changed. I think what you're seeing is the very beginning stages of people starting to reallocate into fixed income. You see it with the mutual fund inflows kicking off the year, the retail numbers are way up, the ETF assets are growing, and a lot of this is driving small tickets. Some of that retail money is coming into SMA accounts, some of it into ETFs, but all of it with just this massive growth in tickets. It's not an option to automate, it's a requirement.\nI think we're going to continue to invest in tools to help our clients with that. I would expect a very robust year of automation growth this year. On the institutional side, the other thing I would add, Chris, is that we are still seeing, as a result of the massive amount of trading opportunity that's now in our Open Trading order books, significant increases in market participants, both in market makers as well as systematic credit funds. All of this points to the fact that fixed income is a better investing and trading environment now than it was for years due to quantitative easing. That's one of the reasons that we're excited about 2023.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director of Exchanges, Brokers, and Asset Managers, Citi\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nHi. Good morning. Chris Concannon, you mentioned a comment about flexibility to fine-tune your pricing over time in relation to Open Trading, where you're adding the most value to clients. I guess, how much room do you think there might be to fine-tune that pricing over time, and how do you kind of balance potentially making pricing changes with maintaining pricing and trying to incentivize as much flow as possible to move in that direction?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, first of all, we're very careful about how we adjust pricing historically and over time. We do want to continue to deliver that high-value execution quality that you see in Open Trading. The value of Open Trading gets sizable across product.\nWe saw the value being delivered in high-yield in particular, which increased the demand for our high-yield Open Trading offering given the growth rates in high-yield and OT of over 40%, and the overall growth rate of our high-yield offering. I would say we're very careful about fine-tuning pricing, particularly around OT, but we're confident in the flexibility that we have given the sizable savings that we talked about in the opening remarks.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nTo be clear, were pricing adjustments made already, or are they planned for 2023?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nWe have not announced any pricing plans for 2023. We're quite comfortable with the current dynamic of our capture rate because as behaviors change, and we saw that the behaviors change, obviously, in 2022 to our detriment in capture and high-grade. As those behaviors change in 2023, we're confident that the pricing opportunity that we have in 2023 is quite positive given the behavioral changes that we're already seeing.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nOkay. Just for a follow-up, just taking a step back, if we were going to kind of rewind maybe five years ago and think about the opportunity that you had in high-grade and high-yield from a market share standpoint, I don't think anyone would have guessed that you would have effectively had the same market share in both as we sit here today. I guess the first part of the question is, just given the different liquidity dynamics in these two markets, do you still think that high-grade total electronic share will ultimately settle at a higher level than high-yield over the long term?\nJust to follow up on Chris Allen's earlier question, is there some level of market share where it just gets harder for a single player to gain incremental share? Is that playing into anything that's happening in high-grade at all? Obviously, the high-yield dynamics seem much different right now with the momentum there.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nFirst, on electronic share and electronic adoption across the fixed income market, I do see that we'll see differences in adoption across the various products that we offer. Obviously, investment-grade is seeing the highest adoption of Electronic Trading. High-yield is growing rapidly, particularly on our platform. If you look at emerging markets, the opportunity is one of the largest opportunities globally, but we're seeing higher adoption rates there, particularly in 2022, where we had record share in both TRACE and global EM market share, estimated market share.\nI think Munis is probably one of the most interesting products for electronic market shares. It's probably in the most need of electronic adoption, particularly given the size of the average ticket in Munis. We've seen we had a record year of adoption in Munis, both record market share and record ADV. I would say that we look at it holistically across the entire fixed income landscape, not just one product. Our clients don't trade just high-grade, they trade across the entire fixed income landscape. When we think about electronic adoption, it certainly can achieve, in my view, the 90% rate that we see in other asset classes because at one point in the electronic adoption evolution, you get to a point where you have to go all the way, not just a part of the way, and your workflows become fully automated and fully electronic.\nI predict very much higher levels of electronic adoption across high-grade, high-yield, emerging markets, and in particular, Munis. Obviously, we think we'll play a key role in that. When our clients are outsourcing trading solutions, they're not studying market share by product like we all do. They're studying that solution and the quality of execution that's being delivered on the other side. Hopefully, that answers your question.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nYeah.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nJust one add-on too, Kyle. I think with high-yield in particular, the liquidity challenges in the US credit markets were most pronounced in high-yield, and that plays right to our favor. What I think it's showing you is that when liquidity is challenging, Open Trading is significantly differentiated from any other way of conducting trades in the high-yield market or elsewhere.\nAnecdotally, you hear stories of challenges in inventory in the leveraged loan market, in the high-yield market that creates constraints around balance sheet for secondary trading. The high-yield market, I just think, is another data point that shows that we have a unique solution for liquidity through Open Trading that people are not able to find elsewhere. I think that just positions us great for market share gains for many years to come because of the investments that we have made there.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, KBW\n\nThanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nGood morning, Rick, Chris, and Chris. I had a quick question on RFQ-hub. Can you provide us an update on the build-out of that platform and how we should think about incremental future volume contributions from the ETF channel?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Happy to take that one. RFQ-hub, just a reminder, it is owned and operated by Virtu, and I don't want to jump ahead of their earnings call on activity levels for RFQ-hub. We are excited about what we've seen thus far from RFQ-hub and our investment in RFQ-hub and the year that it had in 2022, just in terms of client activity, client engagement, and the work we've been doing with the partners in RFQ-hub, both our dealer partners, and obviously our BlackRock as a key partner as well. We do think the demand for fixed income ETFs by our institutional clients is climbing. It's a wonderful vehicle for dealing with capital flows to get exposure to the overall credit market quickly and through a liquid instrument.\nWe're seeing heightened levels and heightened demand from our client base on fixed income ETFs and expect that to continue, particularly given the activities in 2023 and the attractiveness of the fixed income market as an investment vehicle going forward. We're very happy about the overall opportunity that the ETF market provides us through our investment in RFQ-hub.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nThank you. Just as a follow-up question, I wanted to circle back to the commentary around fee per million. You've said that in the deck, Corporate Bond Index duration is up 6% from the lows of October. Have you seen that trend continue into January with some of the new issues changes in the marketplace and some of the trading dynamics changing?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nNo, the index itself has been relatively stable to the exit rate that we saw in December.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nYep.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, everybody. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I had a bit of a market structure question for you guys. As you look at the accelerating shift from active bond mutual funds into ETFs, which again continues to accelerate here, even year-to-date, I think over 70% of flows into fixed income are going into ETFs. How do you think that impacts turnover rates for the credit markets? The reason why I ask is, naturally, that creates a secondary degree of liquidity in the kind of the ETF wrapper, but I wonder if that also impacts positively or negatively turnover in the underlying bonds, especially when the flows are so concentrated with the handful of players, particularly with BlackRock.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat question, Alex.\nWe obviously are well-positioned as we think about inflows into the fixed income market. As you point out, we're seeing inflows into the ETF fixed income market in particular. We're also seeing inflows into SMA products as well across the fixed income landscape. Both of those inflows, both ETFs and SMA products, leave us well-positioned for 2023 as we see continued attractiveness in the fixed income products as investment vehicles. In particular, around ETF inflows, it's a wonderful situation for us given our position with ETF market makers. Some of the largest ETF market makers are very strong clients of MarketAxess and, in particular, play a major role in our Open Trading offering. We feel like we're well-positioned to take advantage of inflows into the fixed income ETF market.\nIt also justifies our investment in RFQ-hub that we were talking earlier, and the attractiveness of having an ETF execution solution as a part of our overall offering. Again, turning to the SMA opportunity, these SMAs are growing. We saw growth in 2022 despite some of the challenges in the fixed income market. As we go into 2023, we'd expect the SMA account to grow as well. Those deliver very small tickets in terms of the workflow that comes through institutional clients, and that heightens the demand for automation solutions. We're excited about the overall market environment in fixed income as an investment vehicle, and the growth in AUM back into fixed income are coming into those two main products, where we think we're well-positioned.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nAlex, I would just add on to that too, is that while standalone, the turnover of an ETF portfolio is likely to be lower than an actively managed portfolio, that's only really part of the story because the ETF share liquidity is adding to the overall liquidity of the fixed income market, and giving dealers and investors another way to transfer risk quickly. I view it as very positive for overall liquidity and activity because of that tool as a way to quickly transfer risk. Don't forget, there are a whole group of industry participants that are now actively trading the shares versus the underlying bonds, which is additive to velocity.\nI think you have to take a holistic view as how the growth in ETFs is adding to the fixed income ecosystem in order to get a valid outlook in terms of what it means for velocity.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nYep, that all makes sense. My second question was just a quick follow-up, I think, to the last question around the fee capture rate. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to see positive trends in fee capture into January. Could you dissect that a bit between IG and the rest of the business? In other words, is this a function of a mix where maybe high-yield is quite active and that's what's driving your comments around positive fee capture, or are you actually starting to see an improvement in the underlying IG capture rate as well?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, no, I think it's the latter.\nIt's really the high-grade fee capture is directly impacted by the market conditions. When we talk about the developments, we're going back to October when Rick pointed out that the Corporate Bond Index duration was at a low, and we've seen a strong recovery going through November and December. I sized up the math of a year-over-year comparison, but when you look at the bond yield movement and years to maturity so far in January that we put on a chart relative to December, the high-grade fee capture is more or less at the same level we saw the exit rate as of December.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you. Good morning. Wanted to follow up on just the non-transactional revenue, just thinking about 2023, and as you think about info services and post-trade, what are the kind of good growth rates or appropriate growth rates to think about for the next 12 months or beyond?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Dan, great question. I'm glad you asked it because we mentioned in our prepared remarks that some of the data contracts that we signed were towards the back end of Q4. I mentioned in the last call that our target was to hit an FX-adjusted growth rate of 10%. We fell just short of that, and a lot of that was due to the timing of when we signed those contracts.\nThe good news for the 2023 outlook, we think that the growth rates will be in the 10% to 12% range for information services on a constant currency basis, and we hope to do better than that. With respect to the post-trade, that continues to be a mid-single-digit growth rate. We're not expecting any significant upside, as you've seen in the past due to the acquisition of Reg Reporting Hub.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nI'll just add, we're continuing to see demand for our CP+ products, particularly across high-grade, high-yield, and now EM, where CP+ provides a level of transparency that is hard to achieve with any other product out there on the market. We're also excitingly rolling out CP+ for treasuries, and my personal favorite, CP+ for Munis, a market that needs more real-time transparency.\nWe're excited for those two products to be out in the market during 2023. Some exciting new products where we're seeing a lot of the growth of our market data revenue in the suite of CP+ products.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat, that's helpful. Just on the expense guidance in the context of what you guys are characterizing as certainly an improving environment from a revenue perspective, the midpoint at 10%, maybe dissect that a little bit in terms of where those incremental dollars are going. If revenues come in maybe above what your base case is, is that just flow through to compensation, or are there other areas where you would spend more if the environment is constructive from a revenue perspective?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, our operating expenses, we've always talked about the fixed variable mix being 16% to 17% variable.\nWhat contributes to the variable expense, it's really three line items. It's our cash incentive bonus pool, we have some treasury licensing fees that are directly pegged to the treasury business, and we have our self-clearing line item. I'm happy to say that we've employed a very disciplined approach with the challenging operating environment in 2022. We're continuing to manage that disciplined approach in 2023, and we've had some success with lowering some variable fees directly correlated to the clearing business. I think as you see the Open Trading business grow, we're going to see operating leverage come through on that line item. Just to help size up the math, 16% to 17% of that total operating expense base is variable, with the balance being fixed.\nTo the question on which line items are that 10% being attributed to, compensation is going to be the biggest uplift year over year, which is around a mid-teens growth rate. You have your T&E resuming to more normalized levels, which is about a mid-teens growth rate. On the page, we put directly what the depreciation and amortization is: 10% of $40 million is $4 million. In the balance, Dan, across it is 1% to 2% across all the other line items on the income statement, with the exception of clearing that will be pegged to our growth and Open Trading. I hope it helps you dissect where you need to allocate that $40 million across the income statement.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nManaging Director and Research Analyst, Jefferies\n\nYep, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nI wanted to ask about the regulatory backdrop. Late last year, SEC put out a bunch of market structure reforms, largely geared towards the equity markets, but there were some aspects, I believe, including BestX, that do sort of rope in aspects of fixed income. I am just curious your views on that, how that might impact the markets in fixed income and the industry at large. More broadly on the regulatory backdrop, what are some of the key regulation proposals, proposals perhaps that are maybe on the horizon that you guys are tracking and that could be impactful for your business? I know in the past we've talked about all-to-all trading and rates as well as potential treasury clearing.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Thanks, Michael. I would say nothing meaningful in terms of what has come out from the SEC so far.\nI think I'm right in saying that a lot of the best execution revisions were focused on dealer obligations as fiduciary and agency trading, not quite as relevant around the world of fixed income. We do expect something much more material at some point during 2023, which is what I would view as long-overdue revisions to the fixed income Electronic Trading and ATS rules. Something that I was directly involved in promoting and supporting as part of FIMSAC at the SEC when the industry participants were helping the commission think through that. What I'm looking forward to is really a level playing field with standardized e-trading rules across the ATS community.\nThe staff continues to do their work on that, so we're not exactly sure what the timing will be, but I would expect that those fixed income ATS rules will be out sometime during calendar year 2023.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Just a follow-up question. Just curious your latest thoughts on M&A here, just given the rising cash balance, where that might be most additive to the platform, and how you think about enhancing connectivity to clients, including retail clients, now that fixed income, in particular retail fixed income, is becoming more in vogue?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nWe obviously look at the coming 2023 as an opportunity, given the repricing of many financial assets, a number of small companies. When we look at the marketplace, there is what I call a scarcity of assets. We're really talking about an M&A strategy that involves much smaller-size, bolt-on type of product offerings.\nThe fintech space has clearly been repriced, so there's an opportunity. There are a number of fintech providers in the market that will start facing capital challenges in the year ahead. With a very strong balance sheet, we feel well-positioned to take advantage of a repriced market with a number of fintech players that may be in need of capital. Excited about what's ahead, but again, there's nothing material out there given the scarcity of assets that we look at.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Just wanted to ask about execution quality and the price improvement that you're getting for your clients, in particular in regards to Portfolio Trading versus some of your more legacy protocols like list trading.\nI guess first of all, to what extent do you think the price improvement is better in some of the other protocols outside of Portfolio Trading and that will limit PT's share, or is that not really an issue and the clients are more focused on getting the trade execution done?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess",
    "content2": "It's a great question, Brian. I view Portfolio Trading as really a demand for liquidity and capital because these are very sizable trades that our clients are in need of. They're demanding higher levels of capital commitment from our dealer partners. I do think that Portfolio Trading done in comp or in dealer competition, which is what our electronic solution offers our clients, does result in a better execution quality across the full portfolio.\nWe also rolled out analytics and will continue to roll out analytics that help our clients judge how portfolios are being priced relative to either an individual or a list trade, however you want to call it. We think clients are being given all the proper tools to evaluate Portfolio Trading as a large block trade or as an individual list trade, where they get the participation of additional market participants. Right now, Portfolio Trading, we see it has grown. It has grown over the last couple of years. We do see that growth rate flattening at some point depending on market dynamics. More importantly, what we're seeing in the first quarter is obviously smaller trade sizes. The demand for more trading activity at smaller size is probably going to be a theme that we see in 2023.\nThat's where many of the other list trading and other alternative protocols that we offer come into demand. While we do see strength in Portfolio Trading, as inflows come in, many times our clients are using the Portfolio Trade as a way to get instant exposure, and they pay for that capital utilization from very large dealers.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. That's great color. Just, oh, yep. Go ahead.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nIf I could just add, one, we're really pleased with the growth in PT we've seen on MarketAxess and the ability to give clients their choice depending on the risk that they're trying to move. I will say, and we previewed this a year ago, that as volatility has picked up, don't forget the dealer side, it's become much more difficult to manage the risk of large portfolios from the dealer side.\nI think there have been two outcomes of that in 2022. One is that the growth rate of Portfolio Trading volume has slowed dramatically. If you look at the last 12 months, it's been right around 5.5% of secondary TRACE volume over the last year. It's been even slower than that in high yield, where the liquidity challenges are more severe. The growth rates of PT volume are down, but also we see greater concentration in terms of the dealers that are printing portfolio trades than we did a year ago. I think that's just the level of sophistication that's required to manage that risk is way up because of volatility.\nAll those factors weigh in in terms of the quality of the pricing that comes through in PT and, as a result, client behavior on where they think they're going to get best execution.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's very interesting. Thanks for that color. Just one follow-up on the ETF substitution. A number of questions were asked on that. Obviously, definitely improves velocity. How do you think about the nature of the client base that's using that in terms of, I guess, revenue capture? The punchline of the question is, does the greater velocity more than offset any diminution of revenue capture, or is the revenue capture pretty similar to your overall fixed income trading and investment grade?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, I'd start by thinking about the velocity first.\nI mean, when you think about ETF activities on the equity markets, fixed income ETF activities on the equity markets, there is a direct correlation to activity in Open Trading, but across the overall fixed income market. As you mentioned, velocity does increase with the level of inflows into fixed income ETFs. The other important point is, and it goes back to the levels of Electronic tTading in the fixed income market. As ETFs become a dominant product of choice by investors, the demand for Electronic Trading goes up because those ETF market makers need to hedge in an electronic capacity. They are executing electronically in the equity market. The transfer of that risk is best done in electronic form in the fixed income or the underlying market.\nWe do see a very strong connection between velocity in ETFs and velocity in Electronic Trading in the fixed income market. We also see a number of new participants in the ETF market that are leveraging our Open Trading solution from systematic hedge funds, alternative hedge funds, and the ETF market makers see huge benefits of leveraging a broader network in the fixed income market, a broader network than they typically have access to. Open Trading is certainly a wonderful tool for the average ETF market maker and any systematic hedge fund that's using ETFs as an investment vehicle.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's super helpful. Congrats to you, Chris, and Rick as well.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn it over to Mr. McVey for any closing remarks.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks for joining us this morning, and we look forward to updating you on business trends next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At that time, if you have a question, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again, press star one. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 19 October 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nSteve Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Brent. Good morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Q3 2022 earnings conference call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives. Chris DeRosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10K for the year ended 31 December 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nFormer Chairman and CEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our Q3 results. We continue to execute our growth strategy and delivered the second consecutive quarter of record market share gains across nearly all of our products, strong increases in trading volumes, and significant execution cost savings for clients through our unique all-to-all trading protocol, Open Trading. Our dealer and institutional investor clients are facing very challenging credit market trading conditions, and our focus is delivering value for them to help navigate through elevated market volatility. Through these challenging markets, our leadership position in global credit continues to expand beyond just US high grade, with record estimated market share in high yield and municipal bonds in the US, record share in euro bonds, and accelerating share gains in emerging markets. The breadth of our global market share gains continues to expand in this volatile market.\nEngagement of institutional investors and dealers on our platform continues to increase, with a record of nearly 2,000 active client firms, and a record number of active traders. We have seen especially strong growth in our international business, with nearly 1,000 client firms now active, including strong growth in Asia. As traditional sources of liquidity have become scarce, the importance of our diversified liquidity pool increases, and further enhances our leading market position. It is encouraging to see institutional clients and dealers leaning into MarketAxess across so many products during a period of challenging liquidity. We are also making excellent strides in developing new growth cylinders, with another record quarter in municipal bond trading volume, and a record quarter in portfolio trading volume. In US.\nTreasuries, there were 226 active client firms trading on the platform, up from 122 in the prior year, as we continue to gain traction with investors in our unique all-to-all Treasury solution. US corporate and emerging markets' debt outstanding in the market has been growing at three-year compound growth rates of approximately 4% and 9%, respectively, which, when combined with higher rates, sets a strong foundation for trading growth in the institutional client e-trading space. In summary, the breadth of our business has never been stronger, with accelerating growth in trading volume, new market share records, increasing momentum in new product areas, and a growing addressable market opportunity. Slide four provides an update on market conditions.\nJust one year ago, on our earnings call, we stated that central bank tapering would lead to more normalized yield levels and volatility in the bond markets around the world, and that is exactly what has happened. In a very short 10-month period, we have moved from massive central bank quantitative easing to the current state of central bank quantitative tightening due to the elevated levels of inflation. We have seen a rapid increase in yields around the world, and investment-grade bond indices are down a remarkable 22% year to date. While current trading conditions are extremely volatile, we believe higher bond yields create a better investing and trading environment. We maintain our view that bond trading velocity will grow in the years ahead due to growing bond market participation and increased adoption of trading automation.\nWhat we did not predict was a historically rapid rise in interest rates driving one of the steepest declines in corporate bond duration, dropping 18% year over year. This reduction in duration has had a negative impact on our high-grade fee capture, which is the only bond product that institutional investors trade in yield instead of price. At the same time, the US dollar index moved to 20-year highs in a short period of time. Despite these short-term revenue headwinds, our overall revenue growth trends have improved materially in the last few quarters, and we would expect both the duration and FX revenue headwinds to diminish in the future as market conditions stabilize. In the very early weeks of Q4, total credit and rates' average daily volume is running similar to September levels, and well above last October.\nSlide 5 shows the strong year-over-year increases in estimated market share and the magnitude of our share gains since the pre-pandemic period. This is the second consecutive quarter of top quartile market share gains as compared to our long-term average year-over-year share gains. All but one of our primary products were in the top quartile of historical data for year-over-year quarterly growth versus the past 10 years. We focus on the longer-term trends, and as illustrated on this slide, we have grown market share by almost 550 basis points per product since Q3 2019, which equates to an annual increase of approximately 180 basis points across products. These growth rates reflect the strength of our franchise and underpin our confidence in our ability to capture the market opportunity in front of us. Slide 6 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing.\nThe strong market share gains we delivered this quarter only serve to reinforce the sizable revenue and earnings opportunity that we have ahead of us. We have a unique position in large and growing global debt markets. We are leveraging our global client network and technology to grow share in existing products and add new product areas to the platform. As we grow market share, our data and content become even more valuable, which makes us even more excited about the many ways that we are pursuing the data and ETF opportunity. We believe we can capture this opportunity and deliver superior returns to our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris Concannon to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Rick. Slide 8 provides an update on Open Trading. The benefits of Open Trading are coming through in the form of significant increases in execution cost savings for our clients. The importance of all-to-all trading is clearly shown in the record percentage of our global trade volumes benefiting from price improvement. Open Trading price improvement generated $260 million in estimated transaction cost savings delivered to our clients in Q3, double the savings levels from one year ago. We believe that the market is moving in our direction because of the benefits of all-to-all trading. We are also innovating and bringing this model to the US Treasury and municipal bond space. One of the largest fixed income asset managers in the world, PIMCO, recently released a viewpoint piece suggesting that the entire US Treasury market would benefit from a shift to all-to-all trading. We agree with their view.\nA record 1,800 unique firms, or over 90% of our active client base, executed at least one trade through our Open Trading network during the quarter. This dynamic is clearly shown by the data, with record overall Open Trading penetration of 37% and record high-yield Open Trading penetration of 53%. Slide 9 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation in credit trading. Automated trading increased to $52 billion in volume and over 290,000 trades in Q3, reflecting continued strong adoption during a period of heightened volatility. This speaks to the increasing comfort that dealers and investor clients have using our tools, and their confidence in our CP+ data feed. Today, AutoX represents 18% of total trade count and 7% of our credit trading volume. We are also seeing record autoresponder trading volume, where our clients are optimizing their execution quality.\nAdditionally, the use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 6 million algo responses in Q3, up 33% from the same period last year. The impressive three-year CAGRs shown on this slide reflect the strong long-term growth of our trade automation suite. As the use of automation tools increases, we believe we will see an impact on trading velocity over time. Slide 10 illustrates our growth in portfolio trading. Q4 was another record for portfolio trading, with total volume of $25 billion. We delivered this strong performance through continued international diversification. Eurobonds portfolio trading volume doubled in the quarter, and EM portfolio trading volume was up over 20% sequentially. EMEA-based clients executed approximately 30% of our portfolio trading volume in the quarter.\nEstimated high-grade and high-yield portfolio trading market volumes have remained relatively flat at around 5% to 6% of secondary trading over the last several quarters. Slide 11 is an update on emerging markets, where we continue to see strong growth in local markets and market share. We achieved 8% growth in emerging markets trading volume during the quarter, 12% growth on a constant currency basis. Local markets trading volume of $60 billion increased 33% on a reported basis and 47% on a constant currency basis. We continue to onboard new clients with a record 1,376 active clients trading EM on the platform, and we traded in 28 of our 30 local markets. 80% of the emerging market opportunity is in local markets, which is a huge and growing market for us. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris Allen to provide an update on our financials.\nThank you, Chris. On Slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. Q4 revenue was $172 million, up 6%, driven by strong growth in trading volume and record market share gains, but was negatively impacted by the lower duration of US high-grade bonds traded and the strengthening US dollar. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, revenues would have increased approximately 9%. All else equal, and assuming the same level of trading volume, we estimate that the change in US high-grade duration lowered our Q4 revenue by approximately $8 million. Information services revenue is up 1%, or 10% excluding the impact of FX. We continue to expect our full year 2022 information services revenue growth rate to hit our historical growth levels of around 10% on a constant currency basis. Q4 post-trade revenue included the negative impact of approximately $1.7 million on a strengthening US.\nDollar compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of FX and one-time revenue activity in the quarter, the year-over-year growth rate would have been approximately 8%. The increase in other income was principally due to higher investment income of $1.3 million, as we are benefiting from a more attractive interest rate environment, and a $900,000 gain on our equity investment. We expect other income in the next few quarters to increase slightly, as we plan to benefit from higher investment yields on our cash and deposit balances. The effective tax rate was 24.8%, and we are reconfirming that we expect the full-year effective tax rate to be at the upper end of the previously stated range of 24% to 26%. On Slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 7%.\nOur growth in total credit and total rates commission revenue was driven by healthy increases in our trading volume and estimated market share, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across US high-grade. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven principally by higher bond yields. The weighted average years to maturity of bonds traded in US high-grade has remained stable year-over-year on the platform. On Slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. Q4 expenses increased 9%, driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Excluding the impact of FX, expenses would have increased 13%. Employee compensation and benefits increased $4 million on an increase in headcount, mainly in technology and customer-facing roles to support revenue growth initiatives. Technology and communications expense increased $4 million on higher software subscriptions, cloud hosting expense, and technology licensing fees.\nProfessional and consulting expenses decreased $3 million, driven by lower acquisition-related consulting expenses and lower recruiting fees. Given the progression of operating expenses and the impact of FX fluctuations year to date, we are refining our full year 2022 expense guidance range: $390 million to $398 million from the previously stated range of $385 million to $415 million. The new midpoint would imply 9% growth year-over-year. On Slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of 30 September, our cash and investments were $352 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $239 million. We are refining our full year 2022 CapEx guidance range of $58 million to $62 million to a range of $48 million to $52 million, mainly due to a transition from purchasing to leasing fixed assets and the FX impact on our international investments.\nDuring Q4, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, and year to date, we have repurchased 280,000 shares for a total of $88 million. $100 million remains on the outstanding repurchase authorization. Our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.70, which was based on the financial performance of the company. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nFormer Chairman and CEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy and are pulling all the levers within our control. We delivered record levels of market share and enhanced our competitive position in the institutional client e-trading space, both in the US and on the international front. Our global footprint continues to broaden and deepen as we diversify our product offering and achieve record growth in active clients.\nThe market is increasingly turning to our unique Open Trading solution for liquidity and significant price improvement, and the market opportunity before us continues to expand. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAt this time, I would like to remind everyone, in order to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of time, we request that you ask one question and one follow-up. Your first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies\n\nYeah, good morning, Rick, and Chris, and Chris. I guess the first question is on the market share gains in US high yields. It was some significant gains, you know, really starting probably last quarter. I guess, Rick, the question is, can you characterize what's driving that? Is it similar to the US high-grade market volatility and market share gains you saw early in the pandemic? Is it a similar situation of liquidity demand?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nIt certainly is, Rich. If you look at our high-grade and high-yield bid-ask indices, they are approximately double where we were a year ago and already at about 80% to 85% of where they were in March of 2020. The liquidity conditions are incredibly challenging, and as a result, clients are leaning on the all-to-all trading model that we have developed in high yield for diversified sources of liquidity and price improvement. It's obviously a completely different model that we run in all-to-all trading, and the consistency of delivering price improvement is what's driving high-yield clients and dealers to execute more of their volume with us on the platform.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies\n\nGot it. One follow-up, Rick. This is on the Treasury market and regulatory proposed changes to clearing, central clearing. If I had to sum up, and you correct me if I'm wrong, the proposed rules from the SEC would require central clearing of Treasuries from a wider audience, including proprietary traders and hedge funds. What do you see as the impact on, I guess, the Treasury marketplace, you know, if that was to occur? Do I have it correct, I guess, to sum up the proposal?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nChris, do you want to take the first cut at that?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. Rich, I have to say, you're reading the proposal like a lawyer. That was an accurate summary. The way we view the SEC's proposal is the policy goals of the proposal are sound. The market will benefit from centralizing clearing at DTC of Treasury activity because of the net settlement benefits that DTC provides, and the guaranteed settlement that DTC provides. Organizing the market to have more centralized clearing is favorable to the overall market. I think the key piece of the proposal is how we get there. There are steps the way the proposal is structured because it's really a rule change that supports the clearing agencies' proposed rule changes.\nThere are some benefits embedded in the customer protection rules that the SEC are proposing for clearing firms to allow them to have more favorable capital treatment if they're clearing on behalf of other broker-dealers, particularly the proprietary trading firms. I do think we're at least a year or two away from the final implementation of the clearing agency rules. Remember, the SEC has to approve the rules, and then the clearing agencies have to file their own rules to comply with the proposed rule. A few steps away. There's still obviously some discussion around the repo proposal that the SEC incorporated into the overall clearing proposal. Again, the policy benefits are sound. It's really the steps that we use to get to the final outcome.\nThere are some impacts, but I do think we are a ways away from the final implementation of the goals of the proposal.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies\n\nGot it. I'll take that lawyer comment as a positive. I'm usually suspect of any lawyers or those with lawyer degrees, Chris.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI always think highly of lawyers. Just try not to be around them as much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Chris Allen. Your line is open.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Citi\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I want to talk a little bit about fee per million, which has been obviously a bit of an overhang on the stock. I wonder if you could maybe give us some color just in terms of how fee per million progressed over the course of the quarter, specifically around high grade. You're starting to see some stability there. Any other dynamics, whether it's in EM that's going on local versus hard currencies? Also, what was the thought process on pulling back on the disclosure there in terms of breaking it out between the different products?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nHey, Chris. I'll get into the technical discussion of the sequential, or I should say it was stable, relatively speaking, for total credit. The charts that we provide in a deck, I mean, we provide the view of what the years to maturity and bond yields look like from a Q3 perspective. On slide 4 of the deck, there was some pressure on high-grade fee capture, given the movement in the years to maturity was down slightly and bond yields were up slightly. Just to remind you, the technical merits of that, it's every 100 basis point move in bond yields is around a $4 impact on fee capture, and every one year to maturity is around $14 to $15. There were movements, and there was slight pressure on high-grade fee capture, but relatively speaking, it was stable to the Q2 exit levels.\nWhat we're seeing so far in October is around the same. Of the $16 decline in total credit fee capture, roughly 60% of that was due to the duration impact from high grade, and the balance of the 40% was due to product and protocol mix. High grade was a bigger impact, but there were other variables that were contributing to that as well. That was a year-over-year comparison, Chris. I know you asked about the sequential, but I just wanted to hit the year-over-year decline. On the second half of your question, Chris, a couple of thoughts and responses there. One, in one way, we've increased transparency on fee capture because we have started to provide the total credit fee capture on a monthly basis rather than quarterly, so we think that will be well received by investors.\nSecondly, it's one of many examples where we were providing a lot more granularity on fee capture than the rest of the market. We think by going to total credit fee capture, we've aligned ourselves with what we see elsewhere in the industry. Thirdly, as we've said, the vast majority of the high-grade fee capture change was all due to the increase in rates and duration. There is a publicly available data point that I would point all of you to that will show you what's going on with duration in corporate bonds, and that's the corporate bond index duration. Anyone that wants to follow it more than monthly or try to dissect high grade versus other products, there is a way to do that with the public data on the corporate bond index.\nAll three of those factors drove the decision to shift to monthly and go to a full credit fee capture per million.\nChris, you mentioned EM, so I have to obviously answer that question as well. Our EM volume in the quarter is up about 7.7% over Q3 last year, and that's in the face of market volumes being down. As you mentioned, local market ADV is up 32% year-over-year. Obviously, super exciting for us to tap into that local market. It obviously has a slight impact on capture, as you noticed. Overall, EM volumes continue to grow, and we're super excited about that local market piece because it's up so large year-over-year.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Citi\n\nGot it. Appreciate the color there. I just wanted to follow up a little bit kind of on the environment. You gave some color just on high yield, just in terms of some liquidity challenges there, but maybe more so on high grade, where the commentary we've kind of heard is spreads are widening out. Why isn't trading activity better? Is it a function of clients waiting for a firmer picture of the economy? Are there other factors involved? Is there outflows impacting activity? I'm just trying to think about what's the potential catalyst ahead to improve the environment, specifically on the high-grade side.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah, you know, the high-grade market volumes are actually holding up reasonably well year to date, given the extreme volatility in the market and the challenges with liquidity. You actually see the market volume challenges more clearly in the international products, and a huge part of that is just the FX translation back into dollars in our reporting. There, in EM in particular, you have a risk-off environment. You clearly have had outflows in bond funds. I don't think most investors are used to these kinds of price changes in corporate bond, mutual funds, and ETFs. It's not anything I've ever seen in my career. In fact, in the last 20 years, if you look at the high-grade index, the worst year we've had was down about 4%, and here we are down 22% year to date. It has driven some outflows as well.\nI think all those factors are at work. We still feel very strongly that debt in the world is going to continue to grow as it has been, and we really feel that the increase in participation and automation over time will increase velocity, but there are a number of factors that are contributing to some challenges in the very near term on market volume growth.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Citi\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Gautam Salant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Salant\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nHey, good morning. One of the key differentiators of the MarketAxess platform is value-added data. Can you speak to recent enhancements to your data and analytics capabilities, and if there's been any pricing changes to your offering?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. On the data front, obviously, we have our premier product, CP+, and Axess IQ, two products that are obviously used by a large community of both dealers and clients. We continue to see high demand for both products, but particularly in CP+ because we've rolled out additional product for CP+. Not only do we have CP+ for US corporates, but we also have it for Eurobonds and emerging markets. We've now launched a CP+ for Treasuries and EGBs as well. We see growing demand as we grow market share, as well as as we roll out additional products. We're looking at future launches in municipals as an opportunity as well and working on that. The other area that has been growing interest from a data perspective by our clients are what I'll call portfolio construction data.\nThat's really how we help our clients to select the right bonds based on liquidity and activity in the market when they're constructing their portfolio. An example of this is used in our MarketAxess 400 index, where we select 400 bonds in the investment-grade space that are the most liquid bonds across our platform. We use that data to construct the investment-grade index, the MarketAxess 400. It's now been launched into an ETF, LQIG, in partnership with State Street. We're super excited about being able to take our data on our platform and to convert it into portfolio construction. We're seeing higher and higher demand from our clients around that unique data that they can use on a daily basis to help construct the most liquid portfolio, particularly given the liquidity challenges that we're seeing in the market in this time.\n\nGautam Salant\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Just as a follow-up, as you consider the narrowed expense range, excluding some of the FX benefits, where are expenses coming in below your initial estimates? Could you expect to see any of those expense benefits carry into next year?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah, the rationale behind tightening the range was really driven by the FX impact. We provide good disclosure in our 10Qs on the market risk liquidity section, where every 10% move in exchange rates, particularly around the sterling and the euro, is going to be around a $10 million impact on operating expenses. It's not as if we've pulled back the investment strategy. We're continuing to invest in the platform and changing our investment philosophy from leasing as compared to purchasing, but all that's doing is just shifting our spend across the income statement. The FX was a headwind for us, and we just felt it was appropriate to tighten the range for the investment community.\n\nGautam Salant\n\nAnalyst, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\n[Analyst]\n\nAnalyst\n\nHey, guys. This is Michael on for Alex. Maybe just following up on that, there was a meaningful step up in tech and communication spend this quarter, and I think the press release referenced enhancements of trading systems as well as higher subscription and licensing costs. Where are you guys making incremental investments, and should we still think about 10% to 12% over the next few years, and what extra investment are required to support that growth range? Thanks.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah, we called it out. It's around our cloud investing, licensing for our platforms that support our US Treasury business. IT security is a big investment area for us. As we think about the 2023 expense guidance, we're in the early days of our budget planning, but the preliminary outlook is that we're going to see around 10% year-over-year growth in operating expenses. That's assuming, of course, that we're looking at an exchange rate around today's levels, so that's subject to change depending on where the foreign currency markets take us. I would just say in terms of what's driving our desire to continue investing is what we see in client behavior and adoption of all the new products and protocols that we're delivering to the market.\nIn addition to our core business market share gains being well above average, we're really encouraged with the progress that we're making in municipal bonds and government bonds, and clearly now have a competitive offering in portfolio trading as well. We're super excited about the share gains that we see internationally, and how big the emerging markets and euro opportunity is. Our view is that we're getting all the right signals that our clients want to automate more of their fixed income trading around the world, and we have an opportunity to continue to do more with existing products, and also add additional products in the years ahead.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Citi\n\nGreat. That's helpful. Maybe shifting gears a little bit, can you help us understand how much of the high-yield revenue might be coming from ETF market makers specifically in the quarter, and maybe how that's changed versus 2021? Thanks.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nETF market makers are an important part of our overall market across all of our products, not just high yield. Our Open Trading, record Open Trading market share of penetration of 53%, is certainly reflective of seeing alternative liquidity providers stepping up and filling the gaps of liquidity in the market as other traditional liquidity providers are more challenged from a balance sheet perspective. We don't give out overall statistics on any one segment, particularly our ETF market makers, but they are a strong partner to us and strong partners in the liquidity that they provide to our clients. I would expect ETF market makers to continue to grow on the platform. If you look at the growth of the ETF market and the new product offerings being delivered to that market, we would expect higher correlations as more products come into market.\nWe would expect higher correlations of ETF market makers being part of our market. The other thing to point out is all of the large investment banks have sizable ETF market making presence, so there's really no way to discern what is ETF market making anymore and what is a separate type of investment bank, traditional client to dealer business. Everybody's in the ETF space, including some of our hedge fund clients. To try and triangulate what that really is, is quite difficult to do.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI just would remind you, you see in high yield that over half the volume is going through Open Trading. There are three main sources of that liquidity, and they are all growing. One is what we call the alternative market making community, and a lot of those are ETF market making participants. The second is just allowing more dealers to compete for order flow efficiently. Those are dealers anywhere in the world that have market making businesses that may not have counterparty relationships with clients that are utilizing our platform, but they can compete for order flow here. The third, and I think the most interesting long term, is that in environments like this, when liquidity is challenging, we're seeing more opportunistic investors leading with price and being the price and liquidity provider.\nAll three of those different segments are contributing to the diversification of liquidity that we see. The best example of that, as you point out, is in our high-yield marketplace.\n\nChris Allen\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Citi\n\nAll right. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies & Company Inc.\n\nThanks, appreciate the time. Just wanted to follow up again on high yield, just thinking about sustainability of some of the share gains and what you were just talking about with some of the momentum. Looking at the comparison to the beginning of the pandemic with high grade and the benefits your platform sees, then it normalizes as spreads come back to more normal territory, would you anticipate some normalization in your market share if and when kind of activity in the high yield kind of slows down and spreads tighten a bit?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI do think you see fluctuations depending on the liquidity conditions in the market, but the overall trend, and that's actually why we provided the three-year view on share. You can see even though we went through that extremely volatile period in 2020 with the spike up and then some reversion in 2021 when market conditions were very stable, when you look at three-year growth, the trend is pretty darn clear. I do think the direction of travel on share overall is positive, but in the short term, quarter to quarter, we will certainly see impact based on market conditions. Quite honestly, when I look out to 2023, my own expectation is that it's likely that volatility is going to remain high.\nThis is a very delicate balance for central banks around the world to try to control inflation without sending the economy into recession in a significant way. It sure looks to me like they're going to be dealing with that challenge all of next year. Our outlook on volatility is that it's likely to favor our model going into 2023.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies & Company Inc.\n\nOkay. Appreciate that. Just to follow up on capital return, it looks like buybacks were kind of halted this quarter after three quarters of relatively stable levels. Just curious on your outlook for share repurchases here.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah. Our capital management strategies around share repurchases has been to offset dilution from employee equity grants. We spent a lot of money this year, almost $90 million, repurchasing 280,000 shares, which essentially accomplished two years of offsetting equity dilution from the awards we give to the employees. What's different today, Dan, is we're in a much more attractive investment yielding environment. When we're thinking about deploying cash, returning value to our shareholders through higher returns on our cash balances is something that we think about as we think about our capital management strategy going forward.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies & Company Inc.\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Michael Siffris with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to circle back to some of the commentary around trading automation. I think you mentioned the automated trades are about 18% of trades, but 7% of volumes. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the initiatives to expand automated trading to larger trade sizes and expand usage across your customer base. Maybe you could talk about some of the hurdles and how you're working to overcome them.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nSure. I'm happy to answer that. Obviously, as we mentioned, automation continues to grow across the platform. If you take a step back and look at the macro challenges of our clients, particularly in 2022 with falling AUM, which obviously cuts their revenue, there's a need to outsource trading solutions. We're feeling that demand from our clients to help them solve automation solutions that they need for their trading. We're seeing that, obviously, in the growth with seeing record automation at $52 billion in the quarter, up 36% over the year. The demand continues. The areas where we're seeing heightened interest, it's really two areas. It's the basic workflow, small execution sizes continue to grow, and then also the no-touch region, which is really an API solution where there is no trader involved. The orders come in directly, and they're processed.\nI would say autoresponder, and I mentioned this in my remarks, autoresponder where clients are able to capture spread through an automated solution and be working in order in the market. That's where we're seeing heightened demand, particularly given the spread levels in this current market. They're all very comfortable with our data feed. It's controlled by CP+, and obviously, the adoption rates, even in this volatile market, have been high. The other exciting area of growth for us is in the muni space. In the quarter, we executed our first AutoX in municipal bonds, and we see heightened demand in that area. Again, very small ticket sizes in munis and a lot of workflow associated with the muni market. We're super excited about what we can do not only in high grade, high yield, eurobonds, and EM, but also in the muni space.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Just to follow up on the balance sheet side, $325 million cash position. How do you think about deploying that here, prioritizing maybe buybacks, or investing organically in the business, but also M&A? Where might that be helpful in terms of filling any gaps or accelerating growth in certain areas?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah. I'll just repeat the investment priorities: invest in a platform, potentially some opportunistic M&A, and return capital to the shareholders. Of that $350 million, when we think about cash, we also think about the investment line items. Round numbers, it's $350 million. Roughly $250 million is supporting our Open Trading business, and $100 million is balanced for our working capital investment needs. That $350 million today is earning around 3%, which is representative of Fed funds. As we are working through our capital management strategy for 2023 in connection with our budget, we're recognizing the opportunities we have on the investment yield front and balancing that with how we're going to return capital to our shareholders through dividend and repurchase programs.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nIf I just follow up just really quickly there, does that imply about $100 million of excess cash then, cash and investments?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah, as of 30 September.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equity. Your line is open.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nHi. Appreciate you taking my question here. I was wondering if we could circle back to the high-grade market and just help me understand sort of the market share trends. I mean, this is the one area where obviously the market share trends haven't been as robust as other segments for you. I am just wondering how to think about why that should be the case given the volatility we've seen of late. What's it going to take for that to really accelerate?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah. I think if you look at it, a lot of it is the market shock that investor clients have gone through this year with the significant drop in corporate bond price values and indices, and the outflows that they are experiencing. I do think if you still look at the institutional client space, we have a meaningful lead on our competitors there, but we have lots of interesting things going to add to what we've done so successfully around RFQ. The growth in portfolio trading is clearly very relevant to us. We have not historically been competitive in the D2D space. That's actually growing as dealers use electronic trading more to move inventory more quickly through the market. We have some ideas there that we think could be successful around how to compete more effectively in D2D.\nAs I said, the automation tools in our mind are likely to increase both usage and velocity for trading on the platform. It is a strong leadership position in the institutional space today, and we think we have many ideas to continue the market share gains in the years ahead.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThanks for that. Just as a follow-up, though, on the portfolio trading side, I know you said that the share of portfolio trading is sort of flatlined at about 5% to 6%, but actually, if you look at the numbers, it's still creeping higher. I was kind of expecting portfolio trading to maybe retract a bit from share of volumes in a higher volatility environment, given that it just becomes much harder and much riskier to price for participants there. Should we just expect that figure to keep creeping higher regardless of the volatility environment?\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nCreeping higher is, I think, a good explanation of the trends in portfolio trading this year. The growth rates in the prior two years were significantly higher. Some of the analyst expectations on growth were much higher than what we've observed this year. Yes, we think it's going to be used selectively for situations where large portfolios can be moved mostly through the dealer community. I think you will see that volatility does impact pricing in portfolio trading. It's becoming more concentrated too. When there was no volatility in the market, we observed more dealer market makers winning portfolio trades on MarketAxess a year ago than we do today, where that liquidity has become concentrated around three or four dealers that do portfolio trading very well. Yes, our expectation would be exactly that, that it will probably creep higher in the years ahead.\nWe think we have continued opportunities to continue to take share.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nThat's great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question is from the line of Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies\n\nYeah. I just have a follow-up on two follow-ups on questions that were asked earlier. Chris, on this treasury regulation, central clearing is good for a number of reasons, it also requires margin. I know it's not going to be until whenever you said it was another year plus down the road. Could it impact trading of these proprietary traders or hedge funds if they're required to put up margin in a centrally cleared environment?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThe way obviously they're trading today, they have favorable margin treatment as they're clearing outside of the central clearinghouse. Two things I would think would happen as you organize more volume in the central clearinghouse. Obviously, margin offsets do get created as you're netting down more of the activity that's cleared away. Also, the fees that are charged if you grow that clearing volume dramatically, and there's a sizable portion that clears outside the central clearinghouse. I would expect fees to be reflective of the overall volume coming into the central clearing. It's not clear that the margin impact will be dramatic for all of the proprietary traders.\nOne of the key elements, as I mentioned, is that we've seen a number of clearing firms, firms that clear on behalf of others, step out of the market over the years because of the challenges around capital treatment for that clearing of treasury business. They're really trying to create a benefit for those clearing firms. We'd see more clearing firms step in to clear on behalf of others, clear on behalf of those proprietary trading firms that you mentioned. There are solutions, and the SEC is well aware of some of the capital impacts for bringing that volume back into central clearing. Again, there's a lot more detail that has to be worked out both on the proposed rules, as well as when we see the clearing agencies actually draft their rules that comply with the SEC's rules.\nIt's a complicated step-by-step process, and there's a number of opportunities to create favorable capital treatment for the proprietary trading firms.\n\nSimon Clinch\n\nAnalyst, Redburn Atlantic\n\nGot it. Thank you, Chris. Rick, I guess this is the last question. I understand the pros and cons of the disclosures and comparing what your peers do and what you've done. I guess the question surrounds as market share in US high-grade has been more stagnant lately, as well as the pressure on the fee capture, that is US high-grade the more mature market? Is that any proxy for the way other credit markets can go over time and therefore investors don't have the disclosure? I think it's still pretty positive on the opportunities in US high-grade as well that you spoke about on the call. I guess it's positive on the market environment, the market opportunity, and our transparency.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI haven't had anyone challenge our view that we're the most transparent e-trading platform in the space in terms of the granularity of detail that we provide to analysts and investors. We think we've added some important information with the monthly disclosures, and we're happy to point you to the duration factors that you need to see shifts in duration that are impacting fee capture in that product. We continue to have a view that fixed income is going to follow other asset classes. I think the demands for automation with investors, Rich, are noticeably higher today than they were a year ago because of the drop in asset values across asset classes.\nOur expectation is that our investment in automation and the client's need for it will continue to drive the share levels across all fixed income product areas in electronic trading higher in the years ahead. I think when we look back five to 10 years from now, we're going to see it's landed in a similar place to other asset classes, with 70% to 80% of the volume taking place electronically.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nRich, I would just add, if you really think about the growth of MarketAxess today and in the years to come, it is breadth of product that we are growing. There's not one product. We're putting up records across our product categories, and we want our disclosure, which is, as Rick mentions, far more than most of the platforms in the space. We want that disclosure to recognize the breadth of product that we're offering, not just an investment-grade capture rate. We've made this adjustment. We've actually become more transparent on a monthly basis than most platforms in the space. If you look at the overall records across the product categories, we want to make sure our disclosure reflects that breadth of product, not just one category.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator",
    "content2": "Your next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe if we could just ask a question on the Eurobond business and the significant share gains there. Can you just give us an update on how much of that total market you estimate to be electronic? From a competitive perspective, we can obviously see your share and Tradeweb share. I guess the question is, do you believe that Bloomberg is still seeing a significant share in that market and how much electronic share is left on their platform? I'll ask my follow-up with this one: are you seeing Bloomberg do anything strategically to catch up in terms of investing in their offering or developing protocols in that market? Should this kind of continuation of seeding share, should investors expect that to continue near-term? Thank you.\n\nChris DeRosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah. Happy to comment. Of course, I think the environment has been favorable for us given the all-to-all trading benefits that we drive to Eurobonds and also EM for SAMEA market participants in a very challenging market environment. I think that is the core competitive advantage that we have that you see coming through in our Eurobond and EM market share. Unfortunately, Kyle, it's hard to get at the number of what the true electronic share is in Europe today because I believe I'm correct in saying that both of our competitors include pure processing volume in their e-trading numbers. When dealers get their reports, they're seeing the processing volume mixed in, and that's the way we see the public reports coming out. We've decided to stay true to providing only our fully electronic volume in Europe and elsewhere around the world.\nWhen we look at it, we think that the electronic share in Eurobonds is probably around 45% of the total market. There's plenty of room yet to grow. I think when you look closely at the trends and you include just the fully electronic volume, you'll see that we're not only gaining share on an absolute basis, we're gaining share from competitors.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nI would just mention there's a sizable opportunity in the Eurobond market in terms of electronic block trading. We continue to see, obviously, our record share. Average trade sizes are still small relative to the block market, but we are gaining block market share as well. I think there's a huge opportunity in the Eurobond market to increase the electronic trading of blocks. Obviously, the dealers are quite comfortable providing price for large-sized trades, and we think that opportunity is quite sizable in the Eurobond market.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Piper Sandler Companies\n\nThanks. If I could just squeeze in one more question. I know the call's running a little bit long here, but just in terms of the MIDEX protocol, I think that launched at the end of last year in the US, and there was some enthusiasm, I think, around what that uptake would be throughout this year given the kind of pure all-to-all nature of that protocol. I guess, are you still seeing good levels or high levels of client interest around utilizing that in the US? Maybe just kind of an update on the uptake there.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nCEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nYeah. I think the way we approach the dealer-to-dealer business, and MIDEX is really a dealer-to-dealer offering. We have that offering live in Europe, and we continue to see demand for it. In the US, we're seeing higher demand for our dealer RFQ platform, where dealers can come in and use Open Trading anonymously and request price from other dealers. We continue to see growth in the dealer-to-dealer business both globally in terms of MIDEX, as well as the dealer-to-dealer RFQ business across US and Eurobond market. I think the offerings that we are certainly growing is that dealer-to-dealer business. They look at things like live markets, RFQ, as well as a mid-market session-based trading.\nIn this environment with heightened volatility, those mid-market sessions are a little bit more difficult to manage because dealers are typically looking to move out of their inventory more rapidly than waiting around for a mid-market section. We see heightened demand for dealer RFQ over any of those mid-market solutions.\n\nRick McVey\n\nFormer Chairman and CEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nAgain, if you would like to ask a question, press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. There are no further questions at this time.

Earnings Conference Call. My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to your host, Mr. Stephen Davidson. You may begin.\n\nStephen C. Davidson\n\nHead of IR, IMAX Corporation\n\nThank you, Vanessa. Good morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company; Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives; and then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that by their nature are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.\nFor a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website.\nLet me now turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRichard Mitchell McVey\n\nChairman & CEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. We continue to execute our growth strategy in the second quarter and delivered strong results across our key operating metrics. Importantly, we have increased our leadership position in the global credit institutional e-trading space versus our primary competitors with strong market share momentum in corporate bonds and emerging markets.\nWe are now moving back into a much more favorable trading environment, and the investments we have made to expand our foundation for growth are paying off. We achieved record levels of estimated market share across both credit and rates, driving a new quarterly record for global credit trading volume.\nSpecifically, we delivered record quarterly market share in U.S. credit high-yield, emerging markets, Euro bonds and U.S. treasuries. We established a new record for global active clients and traders. The benefits of Open Trading, our differentiated liquidity pool, are coming through with the highest level of transaction cost savings for clients since the pandemic environment in 2020.\nBeyond our core business and protocols, we are making excellent strides in new product areas. We achieved another record quarter with $23 billion in total portfolio trading volume. Municipal bond trading ADV was a record $371 million, with a solid mix of tax exempt and taxable muni activity and a record 342 active client firms. And U.S. Treasuries achieved record market share this quarter with 160 active clients trading.\nWe also made several key announcements this quarter designed to enhance our data and ETF trading capabilities with the launch of an ETF on our MarketAxess investment-grade 400 Index, our strategic collaboration with MSCI, and our minority investment in Virtu Financial's RFQ-hub for ETF share and equity derivative trading.\nIn summary, strong growth in trading volume, broad-based market share gains and increasing momentum in new product areas, including U.S. Treasuries and municipal bonds, are driving significantly improved operating performance.\nSlide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Just 8 months ago, we predicted that an end to accommodative central bank policy and quantitative easing would drive a return to wider credit spreads and higher credit spread volatility. That is exactly what is happening today, and we are now in a much more favorable operating environment.\nThe median bid-ask spread in high-grade has moved from 2 basis points to 4 basis points in a very short period of time, and this has been accompanied by unusually large price movements in the market, with high-grade and high-yield bond indices down approximately 15% year-to-date.\nWhen liquidity is at a premium as it is today, more diverse sources of liquidity matter, and the price improvement opportunity over Open Trading becomes a key differentiator in the market. We believe that this is a key contributor to our broad-based market share gains across high-grade high-yield, emerging markets, dollar corporates and Eurobonds as reflected in our record composite corporate bond estimated market share of 20.2%, which is up from a pre-pandemic share of 15.6% in Q1 2020.\nOne thing we did not anticipate was the rapid change in the slope of the yield curve, which has inverted in just 9 months. Central Bank tightening has led to a substantial increase in short maturity yields and a reduction in average maturities traded, which has created a short-term headwind for a high-grade institutional fee capture. Over the last 30 years, the yield curve has only been inverted about 5% of the time. As a result, we expect the yield curve to return to normal when the Fed is comfortable the inflation numbers are trending lower.\nSlide 5 illustrates our expanding global client network. The depth and diversity of liquidity on our global platform is clearly shown by the addition of new active clients and traders globally. We set new records with 1,935 total active client firms, with record international active clients increasing to 982 on the platform driven primarily by strong growth in Asia.\nActive investor and dealer traders also increased to new records with over 11,000 active traders on the platform, including a record 5,300 total active international traders. Our large and growing institutional client network is our biggest asset and provides the foundation for long-term growth as we add more products and trading protocols to our global trading platform.\nSlide 6 illustrates how the improved macro backdrop and our diverse liquidity is delivering significant cost savings for our clients. Wider spreads have created an environment where the benefits of Open Trading are coming through in the form of a significant increase in transaction cost savings for our clients. Liquidity conditions and fixed income trading have become challenging once again, reminding all market participants of the importance of all-to-all trading liquidity.\nThe increased activity of our platform is clearly shown in the record levels of total credit and Open Trading executed trades. In the quarter, we delivered $238 million in estimated cost savings via Open Trading, which equates to an annual run rate savings of approximately $1 billion, well in excess of the total annual commission revenue we currently generate.\nThe combination of transaction cost savings and significant improvements in trading and post-trade efficiency creates a strong value proposition for our clients. We believe our substantial first-mover advantage in all-to-all trading will continue to differentiate MarketAxess from our competitors for many years to come.\nSlide 7 illustrates the strong year-over-year increases in estimated market share. The share gains that we achieved in the second quarter exceed the long-term average gains for the company. We believe this is the most compelling quarter we have ever had for meaningful and comprehensive market share gains across all products and regions. And 92% of our volume is conducted with institutional investor clients.\nAccording to the major global banks we recently surveyed, the MarketAxess lead in institutional client electronic credit trading has widened in all 3 geographic regions. To give you some historical perspective, all but one of our primary products were in the top quartile for year-over-year quarterly growth in estimated market share over the past 10 years, and high-grade was in the second quartile. In the long term, market share gains are the strongest contributor to shareholder value in our DCF model.\nSlide 8 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. The strong market share gains we delivered this quarter only serve to reinforce the sizable opportunity that we have before us in terms of top line growth potential. All else equal, 1 percentage point increase in market share across all our products generates approximately $50 million in incremental revenue annually.\nAnd the total revenue opportunity in front of us is substantial, with an estimated $9 billion revenue opportunity in the fixed income e-trading sector by 2031, assuming historical market growth rates. If you add some expectation for higher trading velocity in the years ahead as well as a growing data opportunity, the revenue opportunity is even larger.\nImportantly, with our financial model, we can capture this opportunity at very attractive returns with our current return on equity of approximately 25% and our current EBITDA margins north of 50%.\nNow let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.\n\nChristopher R. Concannon\n\nPresident, COO & Director, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThanks, Rick. Slide 10 provides an update on Open Trading and our protocol expansion. In the second quarter, over 38,000 orders and $21 billion in notional value was available daily through our Open Trading marketplace, an increase of 32% and 33%, respectively. A record 1,700 unique firms were active across our Open Trading network during the quarter with approximately 1,000 firms providing liquidity.\nThis diversity of participation continues to drive significant cost savings for our clients as credit spreads widened with a total (inaudible) savings delivered through Open Trading year-to-date. Live Markets rates, our innovative all-to-all solution in U.S. Treasuries, saw trading volume increase 57% year-over-year, with a strong increase in market share as well.\nWe continue to onboard clients and launch new rates products. Live Markets for credit saw total trading volume increase to $3.5 billion in the first half of the year, which is up 76% compared to the second half of 2021, with 71 -- 171 clients active on the platform. Given the recent liquidity challenges in the rate space, we believe that our all-to-all model is increasingly being viewed as a potential solution for liquidity challenges across both the credit and rates markets.\nMunicipal bonds also registered record ADV of $371 million. Excluding muni brokers, our organic muni volume grew 84% year-over-year. We continue to build liquidity on the platform with another major municipal bond firm coming online and beginning to trade in the coming days.\nSlide 7 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with automation and credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $57.6 billion in volume and over 305,000 trades, reflecting very strong adoption despite the increase in volatility.\nToday, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count and 8% of our credit trading volume. We also are seeing an increase in Auto-Responder trading volume and automated responses. Adoption in Europe has been particularly strong with Auto-X volume up 53% and trade count up 50%.\nAdditionally, the use of dealer algorithms continues to grow on the platform with approximately 5.7 million algo responses in the second quarter, up 23% from the same period last year. The impressive 3-year CAGR shown on this slide reflect the strong long-term growth we're experiencing across our trade automation suite.\nSlide 12 illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across products and protocols. The second quarter was a record for portfolio trading, with total PT volume of $23 billion, which represents an increase of 64% from Q1. We delivered this strong performance with estimated portfolio trading market volumes in high-grade and high-yield increasing only 9% sequentially, resulting in very strong estimated market share growth in the second quarter.\nEstimated high-grade and high-yield portfolio trading market volume represented approximately 6% of the total high-grade and high-yield TRACE market in Q2, up slightly from the first quarter. Estimated high-grade and high-yield portfolio trading market volumes have remained relatively flat as a percent of total TRACE over the last 4 quarters.\nIn the first half of the year, we had a record 96 active clients and we executed a record 534 trades, driving record portfolio trading volume of $37 billion. Through the first half of July, we have already registered $7.6 billion in portfolio trading volume and are currently trending to a new monthly record.\nSlide 13 is an update on emerging markets where we continue to see strong growth in local markets and overall market share. We achieved 13% growth in ADV in emerging markets during the second quarter, with record local markets trading volume driving record estimated market share.\nLocal markets trading volume of $68 billion represented a record 39% of total EM volume. The strong performance in local markets was driven in part by strength in EM trading volume across our APAC region. We also continue to onboard new clients with a record 1,370 active clients trading EM on the platform.\nSlide 14 outlines our data strategy. The 3 pillars of our data strategy are as follows: first, our goal is to create best-in-class front office trading and real-time data solutions that leverage CP+ and our trade automation capabilities.\nNext, we are creating data solutions that enhance the portfolio construction process like our recently announced collaboration with MSCI, which leverages our proprietary tradability data and liquidity scores. Last, we want to continue to develop new trading protocols and tradable products for our active and systematic clients like our recently launched MarketAxess 400 liquid bond index. We are in the early stages of implementing this strategy and the announcements that we made this past quarter will be a key catalyst for our success.\nNow let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.\n\nChristopher Neal Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. On Slide 16, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. Second quarter revenue was $182 million, up 3% from the prior year, including the impact of lower U.S. high-grade fee capture and foreign currency fluctuations.\nStrong growth in trading volume and market share gains across credit and rates was partially offset by a 10% decrease in total credit fee capture and lower information services and post-trade revenue. Information services revenue in the quarter were negatively impacted by $600,000 from a strengthening U.S. dollar from a year ago as well as lower data sales due to timing.\nConsidering the new data contract pipeline in the second half of the year, we expect our full year 2022 information services revenue growth rate to hit our historical levels around 10% on a constant currency basis.\nSecond quarter post-trade revenue included a negative impact of approximately $1.1 million on the strengthening U.S. dollar compared to the prior year quarter. Adjusting for currency fluctuations, combined information services and post-trade revenue would have increased approximately 3% from the second quarter of 2021.\nEBITDA was $105 million, and our EBITDA margin was 58%. The increase in other income was due to $5.5 million of foreign currency transaction gains, which benefited EPS by $0.11 per share in the quarter and a small gain from our investment in RFQ-hub. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, we expect other income in the remaining quarters of 2022 to net out to 0 due to estimated gains from RFQ-hub and improved investment yields on our cash balances.\nThe effective tax rate was 25.3% in the quarter compared to 21.8% in the prior year. Due to lower-than-expected excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation, we now expect the full year effective tax rate to be at the upper end of the previously stated guidance range of 24% to 26%.\nOn Slide 17, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total commission revenue increased 5%. Our growth in other credit and rates commission revenue was driven by healthy increases in our trading volume and estimated market share, but was partially offset by lower average fee capture across high-grade and other credit.\nThe lower high-grade fee capture was driven by a combination of higher bond yields and lower years to maturity, which accounted for approximately 85% of a $31 year-over-year decline. The decrease in other credit fee capture was driven principally by product mix shift as a result of the increase in EM local markets trading volume, which has a lower average fee capture as these are rates-focused markets. Higher distribution fees across high-grade and other credit helped offset the impact of lower average fee capture across credit.\nOn Slide 18, we provide you with our expense detail. Second quarter expenses increased 9%, driven principally by investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. Specifically, employee compensation and benefits increased $5 million on increase in headcount.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $2 million due to higher software development and acquired intangible amortization expense. Technology and communication expense increased $2 million on higher software subscriptions, market data and technology licensing fees.\nOn Slide 19, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of June 30, our cash and investments were $325 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $274 million. During the second quarter, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 179,000 shares for a total cost of $49 million. We have $100 million of capacity remaining on the existing repurchase program. Our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 based on the financial performance of the company.\nNow let me turn the call back to Rick.\n\nRichard Mitchell McVey\n\nChairman & CEO, MarketAxess Holdings Inc.\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute very well against our growth strategy. We hit on all cylinders this quarter across most operating metrics within our control, and we believe that high-grade fee capture is likely to move higher in the future as the yield curve returns to normal.\nThe record level of market share gains we registered this quarter are a clear indicator that the investments we have made to expand our growth cylinders and increase our product diversification are paying off. Our strong execution, broad-based market share gains, increasing momentum in new products and expansion of our global footprint are setting a very strong foundation for growth in the periods ahead.\nNow I would be happy to open the line for your questions.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, if you have a question, simply press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key at any time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 20 April 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Steve Davidson, Head of Investor Relations at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Davidson\n\nHead of Investor Relations, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Q1 2022 earnings conference call.\nFor the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiatives. Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results for the quarter. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain. The company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2021.\nI would also direct you to read the forward-looking statements disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our first quarter results. In the first quarter, we continued to execute our long-term growth strategy, and total revenue of $186 million was our second-highest quarter ever. EBITDA for the quarter was $106 million, and EBITDA margin was 57%. Trading volumes rebounded strongly as market conditions improved from prior quarters. Total average daily trading volume reached a record $38 billion. We achieved the second-highest level of average daily volume in total credit, and we delivered record US Treasury, emerging markets, and municipal bond average daily volume. Total active clients trading on the platform also reached a new all-time record for the quarter.\nThese strong business results are a clear sign that the investments we are making to expand our foundation for growth are paying off. Importantly, as spreads have widened, the benefits of our unique all-to-all liquidity came through, with total Open Trading estimated transaction cost savings rebounding to over $200 million for the quarter. Average transaction cost savings per trade through Open Trading were up approximately 60% from recent quarters. In our unique Live Markets all-to-all order book, we are continuing to gain traction across both rates and credit, with a new quarterly record ADV in US Treasuries of $25 billion, up 38% year over year, and record volumes and active clients in corporate bond Live Markets. Beyond our core business and protocols, we are making excellent strides in new product areas. We registered a record $14 billion in Portfolio Trading volume.\nEmerging market local market trading reached a new record of 22%. Municipal bond trading ADV was a record $288 million, which benefited from the integration of MuniBrokers. We launched our MarketAxess 400 index to create a highly tradable corporate bond index, as well as AXS All Prints, a real-time European fixed income trade tape. We believe our growing global product footprint, record numbers of institutional clients, and improving market conditions create a strong foundation for long-term growth. Slide 4 provides an update on market conditions. Credit spread and interest rate volatility have both increased over recent months, driving record trading activity on the platform. The first quarter saw high levels of investment-grade corporate bond issuance, which is likely to slow for the balance of the year.\nWhile we are only three weeks into the new quarter, estimated high grade, high yield, and emerging market market share are all tracking well above Q1 levels. Combined US high grade and high yield estimated market share is currently above 20%, up from 19.1% in Q1. When combined with share trends in euro bonds, munis, and US Treasuries, the breadth of our market share gains has never been better. Central bank monetary policy has shifted dramatically, with higher rates and the likely reduction of balance sheets to reduce inflationary pressures. We believe that higher bond yields and less central bank quantitative easing will support higher market volatility in the periods ahead. Higher bond market volatility is already driving increased demand for Open Trading liquidity in US Treasuries and credit versus prior quarters. This is coming through in market share trends, active client firms, and overall trading volumes.\nSlide 5 illustrates our expanding global client network. The increasing network effect on our platform is clearly illustrated by the addition of new clients globally. During the first quarter, we set new records with 1,913 active client firms globally, with over 1,000 firms integrated from their order management systems. Our increased investment internationally is paying off, with a new record 975 firms trading actively outside of the US, with notable traction in Asia. For the first quarter, a record 32% of our global credit trading volume came from clients outside the US. Additionally, the number of active institutional investor and dealer traders set a new record at approximately 11,200 traders. 92% of our trading volume continues to be with institutional investor clients, and the remaining 8% represents dealer-to-dealer trading volume.\nIn Europe, we now have nearly 1,000 client firms utilizing our post-trade regulatory reporting services, up from 440 firms at the end of 2020. Slide 6 illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. We have included this slide again this quarter because it reflects the enormous opportunity we have in front of us, and the expanded foundation we have established to diversify our business. Our broader product footprint and growing menu of protocols create multiple options for growth. We are in very early stages of electronification in most of these markets, and we estimate they conservatively represent a $9 billion revenue opportunity for our sector. We believe it is also likely that all-to-all trading and trading automation will lead to higher levels of overall bond trading velocity. We are excited about the many ways we are pursuing a larger data opportunity.\nThe launch of our MarketAxess 400 index and our real-time European fixed income trade tape are both examples of this investment. Finally, we continue to expand our post-trade business with additional clients and post-trade services. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments and new initiatives.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rick. Slide 8 provides an update on Open Trading and protocol expansion. Open Trading provides our clients with one of the deepest and broadest pools of liquidity for bonds. Open Trading is a unique competitive advantage that we leverage across all of our products and protocols. In the first quarter, over 36,000 orders and $20 billion in notional value was available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. A record 1,710 client counterparties were active across our Open Trading network.\nThis diversity of participation continues to drive cost savings for our clients as credit spreads widen. Clients saved an estimated $201 million in transaction costs during the quarter. Live Markets for credit had record trading volume in the first quarter, with record trade count already surpassing full year 2021 levels. We now have 1,200 bonds actively quoted daily across high grade and high yield. Our Live Markets for Treasuries reached record volume of $1.5 trillion during the quarter, an increase of 40% from last year, and a record 2 million trades, up 64%. We now have 20 of the 24 primary dealers active on our Live Markets Treasury platform. Our MiDEX protocol increased 72% in euro bonds and continues to build in US high grade and high yield after launching in the fourth quarter. Slide 9 highlights the increasing momentum we are seeing with trade automation.\nOur trade automation tools, powered by our Composite+ market data, are delivering workflow efficiencies, reducing our clients' cost of trading, and further embedding us in client workflows while delivering premium execution quality. With our trade automation tools, a large portion of our clients' order flow can be executed through a low-touch or no-touch solution, with the confidence that they are achieving best execution through a highly efficient trading technology. Trade automation on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $49.3 billion in volume and over 280,000 trades, reflecting increasing client adoption and higher levels of client penetration. Today, trade automation represents 18% of total trade count on MarketAxess, and 7% of our total volume. Trade automation has become a critical outsourced trading technology solution for some of our largest institutional clients.\nAdditionally, the use of dealer algorithms, partly supported by our powerful market data, is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 5.3 million algo responses in the first quarter, up 12% from the same period last year. Slide 10 illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across products, protocols, and revenue types. In the first quarter, we continued to see increasing contribution from our new protocols that I just touched on earlier, as well as from portfolio trading and our diversity dealer initiative. Trading volume from these new initiatives represented 12% of our total credit volumes in the first quarter. The month of March was particularly strong in terms of record client participation, and record number of portfolio trades. Our global platform is now generating market data that enhances and enables many of our global trading protocols.\nOur unique market position allows us to create proprietary market data solutions, such as our MarketAxess 400 index, our Composite+ Total Markets, and our recently launched European fixed income trade tape called AXS All Prints. Our information services and post-trade business have become an important part of our franchise, generating combined record revenue this quarter of approximately $20 million. As a result of our increased diversification, our recurring revenue, consisting of fixed distribution fees, information services, and post-trade business, hit a record $51 million, representing an increase of 9% year over year. Slide 11 is a deeper dive into emerging markets, which is one of our largest global opportunities. We achieved record revenue and ADV in emerging markets during the first quarter. The record quarter was highlighted by a record trading day on 31 March of over $8 billion, almost $1 billion above the previous single-day trading record.\nAs a reminder, emerging markets at MarketAxess is a combination of external debt trading in dollars, euros, and yen, and local markets trading across local currencies. We have close to 30 different marketplaces active on our trading system, and these local markets are now roughly 1/3 of our EM trading volume. We see a tremendous growth opportunity in many of these local markets across LATAM, SAMEA, and Asia, because they are principally rates markets in very early stages of electronification. We are not only experiencing exceptional growth in EM trading volume, but we are also onboarding new clients with a record 1,348 active clients trading EM on the platform. Clients are increasingly embracing our solution in local markets for larger-sized trades, which is reflective of the increasing adoption of our request for market protocol, where we saw an increase in trading volume of 48%.\nBlock trades account for approximately 75% of local market volumes, so we think we are well-positioned to capture this important segment of the market. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. On slide 13, we provide a summary of our quarterly financials. First quarter revenue of $186 million was down 5% but represented the second highest level of quarterly revenue. The 6% decline in commission revenue was mainly due to lower US high-grade fee capture, but was partially offset by higher distribution fees, and record US Treasury and municipal bond commission revenue. The combination of higher distribution fees, and record information and post-trade services revenue, increased our recurring revenue in the quarter to a record $51 million.\nTotal expenses increased 7%, driven principally by acquired intangible amortization expense, and investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. As we continue to invest, we delivered our third highest level of EBITDA of $106 million and an EBITDA margin of 57%. The increase in other net was due to two special items. First, a $1.6 million gain related to the remeasurement of the contingent liability associated with one of our recent acquisitions, and a $1.3 million foreign currency transaction gain, which when combined provided for net $0.06 per diluted share benefit in the quarter. For modeling purposes, we expect other net to be a drag of roughly $800,000 per quarter absent special items like those that flowed through this quarter. The effective tax rate was 28.4% in the first quarter, compared to 21% in the prior year.\nThe higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and the impact of a non-recurring $3.2 million tax charge, or $0.08 per diluted share, related to a settlement with New York State tax authorities to resolve the 2010 to 2014 audit cycle. Collectively, the net impact of the tax charge and gains recognized in other net provided for a $0.02 per share negative impact on earnings. We are reconfirming our full year 2022 effective tax guidance range of 24% to 26%, excluding this tax charge. We expect the remaining quarters of 2022 to be around the midpoint of the guidance range. On slide 14, we provide more detail on our commission revenue and our fees per million. Total variable transaction revenue was down 9%, driven principally by lower fee capture, partially offset by higher US.\nTreasury, municipal bond, euro bonds, and EM transaction revenue. The lower high-grade fee capture was driven by a larger percentage of shorter duration high-grade bonds traded on the platform, which represented approximately $22 of the $25 year-over-year decline. We have not changed our high-grade fee plan, and we have seen similar volatility in year-over-year high-grade fee capture in the past, such as the third quarter of 2020 when longer duration drove high-grade fees per million up $26 to $200 per million for the quarter. Based on our high-grade fee model, and all else being equal, we expect less variability in our fee capture, even if rates continue to rise from these current levels. As we enter the second quarter, we are seeing US high-grade fee capture stabilize around the first quarter of 2022 levels.\nOther credit commissions decreased 4%, mainly driven by a decline in average fees per million, which decreased 7%. The decrease in other credit fee capture was driven by two dealers migrating to a high-yield distribution fee plan and a makeshift in product trading volume. The increase in EM local markets trading volume had the effect of reducing fee capture, as EM local market bonds command lower average fees per million, given these are rates-focused markets. On slide 15, we provide you with our expense detail. First quarter expenses increased $6 million, or 7%, driven by higher acquired intangible amortization expense, and investments to enhance the trading system and our data product offering. If we exclude the impact of acquired intangible amortization expense, expenses would have increased 5%.\nCompensation and benefits are more or less flat to prior year, as we recorded higher levels of variable compensation expense during the first quarter of 2021. Depreciation and amortization expense increased $3.4 million due to higher software development and acquired intangible amortization expense. Our technology and communications expense increased $2.2 million on higher software subscription, market data, and technology licensing fees. On slide 16, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of 31 March 2021, our cash and investments were $400 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $278 million. During the first quarter, we paid out $26 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders, repurchased approximately 102,000 shares for a total cost of $39 million, and paid out year-end bonuses and related taxes of approximately $45 million.\nWe believe the current stock price level provides an opportunity to utilize excess cash to repurchase shares at a discount to their long-term value. Based on our financial results, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share. Now, let me turn the call back to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, we continue to execute well against our long-term growth strategy. The record volumes we registered this quarter are a clear sign that the investments we have made to expand our growth cylinders, and increase our product diversification, are paying off. New and innovative protocols that we have built are modernizing fixed income market structure and gaining momentum. Our strong execution, combined with the improving market conditions and global fixed income, set the stage for a promising period of growth ahead. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone, and to withdraw the question, press the hash or pound key. Your first question is from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\n\nRichard Repetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Good morning, Rick, and Chris, and Chris. Hello, Rich. You definitely came through with the excitement, I guess, on the improved market conditions. I'm just looking at what you've experienced in April. You said it's better, markedly improved, and better than I thought you said the first quarter average. Can you give us a little bit more detail and color? Because if you look at just the first quarter average, it was pretty close to March.\nGiven your sort of your excitement about it, could you sort of give us a hint about a better idea of the increase in market share you experienced, our experience in April to date?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Sure. I certainly gave a piece of that, Rich, in the prepared remarks, looking at combined high-grade and high-yield estimated share for April month to date at over 20% compared to the first quarter average of 19.1%. In addition to that, the reason that we're excited is when we look across our new and expanded product suite, we're seeing those share gains come through also in emerging markets, euro bonds, Treasuries, and municipal bonds. The momentum that we're seeing in share, combined with the market condition improvement, is what gets us more excited about growth in the periods ahead.\n\nRichard Repetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it.\nI guess just to follow up, sort of two follow-ups, but you are now pointing more towards overall credit market share, the combined. Is there a reason for that? I think we've looked at it as two separate buckets as you compete in each, but is there a reason to sort of look at it on a combined basis and just one?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThey're both part of the corporate bond market in the US. Given that we're just three weeks into the new quarter, we thought we would just give you a combined market share. Obviously, in a week and a half, we'll have all the details out on both high-grade and high-yield. High-grade is clearly the more important piece given the size of that market relative to high-yield. I think you can interpret that the share trends are positive in both. Got it.\n\nRichard Repetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nJust one detailed question. Is there any difference between the fee rate for the local markets and hard currency credit trading, the EM trading?\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. Each market, this is Chris Stewart. Each market has a different rate. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the EM local markets are more of a rate-focused product offering. You'll see those fee capture rates trend below $100 per million, which is one of the reasons why you saw the degradation in the fee capture quarter to quarter. Got it. Very helpful. We actually publish on our website the standard fee plan. If you wanted to get a flavor of each individual category, I would refer you to the website of MarketAxess.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nI think the important takeaway from Q1, Rich, is the point that Chris made earlier, that we have made no changes to our fee plans.\nIn high-grade, you had the combined change of higher rates overall and a flatter yield curve. That, not surprisingly, causes reduced duration. When duration goes down, high-grade fee capture goes down because institutional investors trade on corporate bond spreads to Treasuries, and our fee model is on yield, not price. That is the sole reason that the fee capture dropped in Q1, probably larger than some other prior periods because of the extent of the rate increase and the very rapid flattening of the yield curve. As Chris mentioned earlier, as we look forward, we don't see the same level of volatility in high-grade fee capture. None of this has come from any changes whatsoever in our fee models. I just got to ask one quick follow-up on that.\n\nRichard Repetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nWhy do you think that there wouldn't suppose we had rate changes going forward?\nAre you just assuming that the yield curve doesn't move as much or the farther-out duration interest rates don't move as much when you got the Fed expected to raise eight hikes this year?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, the sensitivity on duration is highest when rates are the lowest, which, of course, they were through the second half of last year. We've already gone through the most sensitive change in duration with the current interest rate increase that's gone through. As you know, the curve has completely flattened. Those two things have already occurred, which would suggest to us that we're not likely to see the same level of duration change in the periods ahead.\n\nRichard Repetto\n\nManaging Director, Piper Sandler\n\nUnderstood. Thank you very much, Rick.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nOh, great. Thanks. Good morning, folks.\nFirst question, maybe just to talk about portfolio trading. That's obviously still a sizable debate in the marketplace. Just if you can refresh us on your ambitions for your portfolio trading market share within the industry and your view of where you think portfolio trading could comprise as a percentage of the total market. Maybe just to talk about that versus list trading in terms of the cost savings, I think are still, if I'm right, the cost savings can still be better on list trading in a more volatile backdrop. Maybe you can just touch on that.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure.Happy to, Brian. First of all, in terms of the market environment around portfolio trading, a year ago, portfolio trading volumes and share were growing on a fairly steep curve.\nIf you look at the TRACE tape and what appears to be portfolio trading activity within TRACE, it has stabilized at about 5% secondary market share of TRACE for high-grade and high-yield combined over the last 10 months or so. It has kind of settled in at about 5% of the market, not showing the same levels of growth currently. I personally think in conversation with our dealer clients that one of the key reasons for that is with both rates and credit spread volatility up significantly, it is much harder for the dealers to manage the risk in portfolios than it was during much of last year when volatility was very low. You are seeing the market level stabilize. As we mentioned, we had a record quarter in PT. We continue to print with more clients.\nWe printed with all the dealers that we believe are active in portfolio trading. We continue to strive to be number one in portfolio trading as we are in other protocols in credit trading overall. It's an investment area for us. It's moving in the right direction. Still represents a relatively small part of secondary trading. I think if volatility remains high, that's likely to remain the case.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's good color. Just on the recurring revenue, you haven't talked about that as much, obviously, given the strong growth in the volume part of the business. If we look at that growth year over year, it looks to me, if I have my calculations right here based on the numbers you're quoting, it's about 9% on a year-over-year basis.\nMaybe just a thought of, or do you have thoughts on where you think that can grow over a two to three-year basis given the recently announced product innovation on the market data side with the 400 and the euro fixed income tape?\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nOn our recurring revenue, we obviously have three buckets there: our dealer distribution fees, our post-trade business, which has grown over the last year, and then obviously our data business, which we're pretty excited about, particularly given some of the new products that we've launched. CP+ and AXS All Prints continue to be the driver of growth within the data piece of the business.\nWe do have some very attractive, exciting new products like our European prints, which is a trade tape for Europe, as well as our CP+ Total Markets, which is just CP+ with very broad coverage across a broader set of bonds globally. Within CP+, we have a number of products at the product level. You obviously have the opportunity to launch a CP+ for Treasuries. We obviously have a growing CP+ for emerging markets, which is obviously a market that needs more transparency and is under great demand from our clients. We continue to see our opportunity in the information services space grow over time. As we add market share, we're actually adding more data to our offering.\nThose records that you're hearing about in the first quarter across our volume and across our products is growing our data opportunity as well.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nYou think there could be a compounding effect on that info services and post-trade services growth as you grow volume to the extent where you could even potentially grow that revenue stream faster than, obviously, volumes are dependent on volumes, but versus your transaction business?\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nIt does compound because as clients add more products or add more differential products, they're adding to their overall spend on the platform. We're careful about how fast we grow it because, obviously, we want to see more growth in volume and more dealer participation. We're being very cautious on how we grow that. Just a reminder, there's certain data products that will not be for sale for end users.\nThey won't be embedded in our automation solution. Products around how to trade a bond, when to trade a bond, who to trade a bond with, those are important products that will uniquely drive our trading automation tools and will only be for sale through those tools. There is some exclusive data that we will keep proprietary and not make available for sale.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nDirector, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. All right. That's great. Thanks so much for the color.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nHi. Good morning. I think there was an updated rollout of your Treasury Open Trading capabilities, or at least the integration of that offering towards the end of the quarter. Just wondering if you could talk about that a bit and the level of demand you're seeing from clients for an Open Trading solution in cash Treasuries.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. Great question, Kyle. Obviously, we had a record in the first quarter of $1.6 trillion, up 37%. Ironically, the rollout that you're referring to came at the end of the quarter. We recently integrated our Live Markets for rates with clients' OMS integration. It was a key integration. Prior to that, clients didn't have an easy way to move their orders from their OMS into that solution. That's now fully integrated at the end of the quarter. We've also introduced in our RFQ platform an Open Trading solution for Treasuries. Those two integrations are what clients have been asking for as we've been pitching them on our Treasury solution.\nI think they're both important because one is it's a combined offering of streaming prices, a true click-to-trade solution fully integrated with their OMS, and then an RFQ solution, both disclosed, and an open trading solution that right now doesn't exist in the Treasury market. Ironically, even though most people think the Treasury market is further advanced from electronification, the introduction of open trading is something that the Fed has called for in their research of the Treasury market. Obviously, a number of regulators are quite focused on our introduction of the open trading solution, which is now fully integrated and fully introduced as of this month. We're getting a great deal of excitement, certainly from some of the larger clients.\nFrom my vantage point, it's the first time a client, a large institutional client, can leave a resting order in an all-to-all market in Treasuries, ironically, something that didn't exist prior to this introduction. We're pretty excited about the opportunity in Treasuries, and really excited about the feedback we're getting from clients as we roll out the platform to individual clients.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nVery helpful, thanks for that, Chris. A follow-up on the high-grade fee capture. Can you just provide some details on where the average years to maturity of the high-grade bonds traded on the platform was in the first quarter? Also, provide some historical context on where that range has been historically and where it's gone down to on the low end in a flatter yield curve environment historically.\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Kyle, in the first quarter of 2022, the years to maturity was just under nine years, about 8.9. If you look back over the course of the last five years, it's gotten as low as 7.5 years back in 2018 and 2019. At that point in time, that's when you saw the last cycle of there being a flat yield curve. The fee capture was trading throughout 2018 at a range from $154 to $157, a relatively stable range. That's more or less where we are today. If you look back in time when the yield curve started to steepen again, you saw years to maturity extend, which extended the duration, and you saw the high-grade fee capture pick up accordingly.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nRight, which is essentially what's happening a bit right now.\nI guess if we see a continued flattening, I'm just wondering if there is a shift incrementally from what we saw in the first quarter towards the shorter years to maturity. Is there still that same level of sensitivity that you've given historically, which I think is something like in the range of $10 or $15 per million for every one-year change in that years to maturity, or is that sensitivity now also lower?\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, no, the sensitivity on years to maturity is more in the mid-teens for every one-year movement. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, what we're seeing in April is an extension of duration, which has been driven by a longer duration that we're seeing on a platform.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nManaging Director, KBW\n\nUnderstood. Okay, great. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Sean Horgan with Rosenblatt. Your line is open.\n\nSean Horgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Rosenblatt\n\nHey, guys.\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you could provide an update on Open Trading's competitive advantage in the current environment. Given volatility trends, I think the first quarter market share trends took some by surprise. Just trying to parse out what's competitive dynamics versus other factors.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, happy to take that. Chris might have some things to add as well. Yeah, a lot of flows in and out that impact market share. Certainly, March was an enormous new issue month in high grade that also may have very well masked some of the underlying trends, positive trends in our high-grade market share that seemed to be reversing here in April. There is economic logic when volatility and price dispersion grow. The cost savings that we deliver to clients also grow.\nIf you look at Q3 and Q4, where we had very little credit spread volatility, our quarterly transaction cost savings from Open Trading delivered to clients were around $125 or $130 million per quarter. You look at Q1, it jumped to $200 million. Clients see that trade by trade. They're seeing the price improvement that we're delivering. We are optimistic, as it has in the past, most notably in 2020, that it does change behavior. It's an advantage that we have that is not shared elsewhere in the marketplace because of the almost 10-year investment we have in all-to-all trading in credit that's now carrying us into rates. The price improvement is there. Certainly, early days in the second quarter, the market share trends are coming back our way as well.\nI also think that as dealers have a more difficult time pricing portfolios, portfolio trades, given the level of volatility, at the margin, there's a shift back to Open Trading bid and offer lists where the whole market is able to compete for that order flow and provide transaction cost savings in a market environment like we are in now.\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nRick, I'll just add the Open Trading market share did increase across our products. We are seeing it grow as a percent of overall market. In high yield, it obviously went up to 49% from 48% from the prior year. Munis saw the largest jump to 48.6% of our volume is done in Open Trading. Even Euro bonds had growth. EM is where you just have to parse through the numbers. Our EM local markets do not include an Open Trading offering currently.\nThat growth in local markets does skew our overall EM open trading. Excluding our local market volume, open trading grew in emerging markets as well. We are seeing that open trading value resurface in the market. The other area where we talked, Rick talked about a $200 million savings in open trading cost savings in Q1, where we're seeing even larger savings. We're seeing clients come into open trading and responding to other clients' RFQs. For the first time, they are using either auto responder or manually responding to other RFQs. We're seeing that behavior. That introduces sizable savings beyond just the cost savings of open trading's alternative liquidity providers. That behavior is something that we're working closely with clients to increase. In high yield alone, we saw client savings reach close to $600 per trade by just responding to other clients' RFQs.\nThose are sizable savings that clients can achieve. It's really a way for clients to use limit orders as opposed to crossing the market through a traditional RFQ. Those savings are there. They've obviously been growing in Q1, and we're seeing those same levels in April as well.\n\nSean Horgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Rosenblatt\n\nGreat, thanks for all that color. My next one, just on new issuance. We saw a pickup in March. I'm just curious, are you seeing that sort of follow-through benefit in market share already in April, or would you expect that to be maybe a further tailwind for the balance of the second quarter?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, all else equal, it's likely to benefit our share because of the patterns and practices on trading newly issued bonds in the first week. March was an outlier in terms of the size of new issuance, especially in high grade.\nApril has tapered off. It looks more like a normal April as we see things currently. The broadly held view is that corporates were front-loading more of their issuance this year because of their expectation that rates were likely to rise throughout the balance of the year. I do think that the expectation is that the overall levels of new issue activity will be lower in the remaining quarters of this year.\n\nSean Horgan\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Rosenblatt\n\nGot it. Thanks for the answers, and congrats on the results.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Gautam Sawant with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nGood morning, and thank you for taking my question. Can you please expand on MuniBrokers' progress, why the first-mover advantage in the muni market is important, and how the platform is currently positioned relative to competitors pursuing the same opportunity?\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Happy to help there.\nObviously, I continue to be excited about our Munis opportunity. Again, we had record volume in the first quarter, $7.7 billion. We continue to see clients coming to us and using us as a solution. The other interesting fact is we only had 275 active clients as of March, which is obviously up from just February. That's a small portion of our overall almost 2,000 clients globally. We do see a growth opportunity just in terms of client penetration and adding clients to our Muni network. Open Trading continues to be a viable tool for the Muni market, both in terms of some of the alternative liquidity providers that provide price in that market, but also allowing clients to participate directly in the Muni market. Our exempt Muni business grew to $1.5 billion, which is up 84% from Q1 2021.\nWe're seeing growth both in the taxable side as well as the tax-exempt side. We're seeing growth out of our dealer RFQ offering, which leverages Open Trading as well, grew close to 80% since Q1 2021. The MuniBrokers acquisition certainly adds close to 4% market share to our overall munis footprint. We see that both in terms of trading opportunities, but also in terms of the data opportunity that munis presents. There is really not a great real-time munis feed in that market. We see an opportunity to introduce better pricing, better transparency across the muni market. We're slowly integrating the MuniBrokers platform onto our Open Trading network as well to further integrate that acquisition.\nPretty happy with munis generally, and thus far, early days with the MuniBrokers acquisition, but pretty happy with the overall footprint of what we touch in the munis market.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you. MarketAxess currently has about $1 billion of the $30 billion TAM in EM local currency. What is the level of electronification in EM local specifically? I guess, can you expand on some of the capabilities that the platform has that's kind of driving the growth there and the competitive advantage?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, I'm happy to start. The EM local markets are at the earliest stages of electronification. I think what we've successfully built is a global network of clients and dealers to build a unique workflow and liquidity solution in EM local markets. It's driven today primarily by global investors.\nOur success in the regions that were mentioned in the prepared remarks is reflecting more adoption by local market participants within country. That's where the big opportunity still exists. We're in low single digits, we think, of the market opportunity in EM local. To have 30 markets available in one place with the workflow solution that we do, we think, is a huge advantage to both dealers and investors active in those markets. It's another example of where we think there's a tremendous amount of runway ahead in a market that we've been investing in for quite some time.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nI'll just add, the EM local market is a heavily brokered market, really, to achieve anonymity. We're obviously expanding our Open Trading solution across local markets. We see an opportunity to provide anonymity into that market and further electronify.\nAs Rick mentioned, it's a phone-based market, somewhat chat-based as well. Really, electronification of that market is early days. We see an exciting opportunity for Open Trading to introduce the anonymity that's really achieved through the phone and the brokers today. Exciting, large market, and a great opportunity for us.\n\nGautam Sawant\n\nVP of Equity Research, Credit Suisse\n\nGot it. Thank you for taking my questions.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Patrick O'Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Your line is open.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nEquity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nHi. Good morning. To what extent do you think your traction with newer trading protocols like Portfolio Trading, Live Markets, and MiDEX are incremental volume for MarketAxess versus cannibalizing RFQ volume?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nI think there's a growing menu and suite of solutions available to clients here than there has been in the past. We're super excited about Live Markets, obviously much further along already in Treasuries.\nI think order books have a real role to play in the future liquidity structure of fixed income. We are certainly in a great place to be the leader and provider of Live Markets. It's really interesting to see that a year ago, we only had one dedicated market maker in corporate bond Live Markets. We're at five now. We expect two or three more during this quarter. You're seeing dealers get excited about order books being really an important source of not only making markets for them, but also finding their own liquidity. If we can build that base in the most liquid end of the corporate bond market, it will have positive implications for the entire rest of the less liquid corporate bond market.\nIt's directly tied into what we're trying to do with the MarketAxess 400 index, as those most liquid bonds that we now have available in our order book are also part of that index. I see Live Markets as really a catalyst for greater velocity in the periods ahead. It's tough to say with portfolio trading. I think that some of it is potentially an alternative way for clients to transfer risk, and part of it is probably new opportunities that have been made available. Live Markets is where I would say, Patrick, we have the biggest opportunity to make a real difference in both credit and rates in terms of offering a new and live liquidity solution.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nPatrick, I'll just add what we've heard from clients, particularly the hedge fund clients, the opportunity to place orders on a live order book and not just request price or respond to RFQs in a more automated way using things like our automation tools. Those are exciting clients to actually trade credit like they've never traded before. They're seeing trade opportunities that didn't exist before. I really think there's higher velocity embedded in these new trading protocols that we're delivering, whether it's automation or Live Markets. It is giving a certain subset of the client population trading strategies that they just haven't deployed in the credit market before. Higher opportunity, lower costs of trading that introduces trades that they otherwise wouldn't make in the past.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nEquity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\nYour presentation today speaks to dealer renewals at higher fee levels with regards to your distribution fees. Are you guys starting to take pricing with your distribution fees?\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSay that again, Patrick. I'm not sure I followed that.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nEquity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nOne of the slides that Chris spoke to has some commentary. It was slide 14, increase in distribution fees due to higher unused monthly minimum commitment fees and dealer renewals at higher fee levels. I'm curious, does the dealer renewals at higher fee levels commentary suggest that you guys are exhibiting a little bit of pricing power with your distribution fees?\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. We made no changes to the fees, but there were certain dealers that were online. To your point, I guess we do have some pricing advantages with the attraction of trading on the distribution fee plan is a scale of them doing more business.\nThat pickup, we wanted to make the point that that increase in distribution fees didn't have anything to really do with the migration because that wasn't impacting our fee capture. It was all about the ratio. We're getting people to more standardized levels as we move forward.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nWe've used the distribution fee with dealers for a number of years, and it's very attractive to certain dealers given their overall volumes. As we attract more clients onto the platform, which is obviously happening with our record active client numbers, more dealers will opt into those standardized distribution fees to participate in that client flow. It's really reflective of the growth of the overall client base that we're adding, that dealers are opting into that more attractive dealer fee.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nEquity Analyst, Raymond James\n\nGot it. Thank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nYour line is open.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. I wanted to follow up again on market share. I think, Rick, in your prepared comments, you said the breadth of market share gains has never been better. I was hoping within high grade, you could talk about what gives you confidence on, I guess, sustainability of either market share gains. Obviously, the macro has changed, but we've seen some of that shift earlier in the year when market share didn't come with it. Maybe what's different about April and maybe as you think about going forward that, again, gives you confidence around additional share gains?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess",
    "content2": "Yeah. You know what gives me confidence is 20 years of history, Dan, is that we've gained a lot of share over that time.\nWe had an outsized market share gain year in 2020 and a little flatter year in 2021 when we had no volatility in our markets. Volatility is back. That's where the liquidity advantage that we've worked so hard to create versus our competitors comes in most strongly with our clients. It does drive their behavior. In April, we're starting to see spread levels move out. I think as people contemplate a higher probability of recession risk down the road, you're going to see more volatility in spreads. I think you're clearly going to see sustained volatility in rates. When that price dispersion grows every period in history, the Open Trading transaction fee advantages that we have drive our market share higher.\nI'm just looking at this grid saying I've never seen seven product areas moving higher in share at one time the way that we're seeing it right now. It's beyond just our core business, and we're seeing it in treasuries and munis coming through very clearly as well. A lot of work to create this broader footprint, but it does increase our addressable market. We've got a long history of growing market share. We don't think that there's any interruption in that long-term story. The early results as we start Q2 are gratifying in terms of seeing that the Open Trading price differential is really coming through for our clients, and they're trading a larger percentage of their business here.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nUnderstood. Thank you.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThe final thing is it's really hard to build, and many people have tried before unsuccessfully.\nI do think that the work that we're putting in and the success that we're seeing in order books is a big deal. I really think this could be a very attractive way to trade both Treasuries and the liquid end of the credit market. Slowly but surely, we're seeing client adoption get to a really interesting place around the Live Markets, order books, which obviously could be another catalyst for share gains.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nDan, I'll just add, if you look at the records that we're setting across not just our products, but also automation, which is largely driven by high-grade and high-yield activity, a record of $49 billion in the first quarter, which is up 36% from a year ago. Just in high-grade alone, our automation is 25% of trades done through automation on the platform. That's very sticky business.\nWe're not even fully penetrated across the client base that is using it. We don't have all the largest clients set up for automation. I see that opportunity as growing here dramatically over time. Autoresponder hit a record this quarter as well, and it's still lightly used by most of our largest clients. That's an opportunity to save sizable dollars using Open Trading through automation. When you look at the full automation of the bond market in the future, we're still in early innings of what really has to happen. If you compare the bond market to other asset classes and how automated their trading activity is across the same client base that we're working with, we have a long way to go.\nWe'll leverage not only our automation tools, but the liquidity that we deliver through a growing Open Trading solution across high-grade, high-yield, munis, Treasuries, all of the products that we offer here. Automation cuts across every one of those products, continues to grow, and continues to be in high demand from our largest clients.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nResearch Analyst, Jefferies\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just following up, Chris, on your point there on trading automation. I think you had mentioned around 25% of actual trades, but 7% or so of volumes, a little bit lower on the volume side. I guess if this is successful over time, where do you see that getting to in terms of the share of volume and the overall share of tickets?\nMaybe you could talk a little bit about the profile of the customers that have more fully engaged or adopted these automated protocols. How are you looking to expand that usage with the other clients that you have? Is this more coming from the dealers? How are you seeing that in terms of dealer uptake versus institutional clients?\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nGreat question. It's really in high demand from our largest institutional clients. Think very large money managers around the planet that have lots of trade tickets. They'd like to do that fully electronically, fully automated, either in what we call low-touch fashion or a no-touch fashion. No-touch just means they deliver it through an API to a set of pre-instructed commands for the automation to execute. What's interesting about our automation right now, it's primarily an auto RFQ solution.\nWe're really just mirroring the activity of either a manual electronic RFQ or a phone-based RFQ, where automation really starts to deliver sizable savings through things like autoresponder behaviors, trading at mid, or automation that leverages our Live Markets order book. Those are all things that we have in our plans over time. That's really exciting for what we can do with automation because of the savings it delivers. Not only is it a savings for clients to kind of reduce their cost of trading and simplify their trade desk, but it's also a savings in execution quality. In some of our large clients that rely on automation tools, we see close to 50% of their activity coming through automation. Those are sizable reductions in workflow for those clients.\nThose are the clients that are most focused on automating their trading and their trading tickets in the bond market. We do see an opportunity among some of the dealers that are not auto quoting that could rely on some of our auto quoting solutions. Right now, the primary client of automation here at MarketAxess is some of the largest money managers on the planet.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. Your next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Your line is open.\n\nChris Allen\n\nResearch Analyst, Compass Point\n\nMorning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Rick, I wanted to ask you, just you noted, obviously, volatility has improved. Credit spreads are widening. We've seen ETF activity and credit accelerating materially this past quarter. I think many would have expected industry activity to be even better than it has been.\nI'm wondering if you have any thoughts just in terms of maybe what's holding industry activity back. Are some of the large market participants sitting on cash right now? Any thoughts on that would be helpful.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, I think ETFs are an important part of the new liquidity model in fixed income overall. I view it as similar to the connection between S&P futures and underlying stock trading. They're complementary to each other and ultimately lead to growth in both sets over time. I think that's the way the story will play out with the growth in ETF activity as well. The fund flows were fairly benign during the first quarter, so I don't think you had a catalyst for money managers to transact created by fund flows. You did see modest declines in year-over-year activity, around 5% or so in high-grade or high-yield.\nI continue to be excited by what we see as the new risk transfer tools that are available in the market, the growth in all-to-all trading, and the growth in automation that Chris has been talking about. To me, that all leads to the prospects of higher velocity in the years ahead. Very long-term trends didn't come through as clearly as you might have expected in the first quarter. I still believe that that's the direction to travel with the new liquidity model that is developing for fixed income.\n\nChris Allen\n\nResearch Analyst, Compass Point\n\nOn the velocity, I think you guys are probably able to measure it much more dynamically than we are. When we kind of look at it, it's been actually declining. I'm just wondering, how have you guys perceived velocity trends in recent periods?\nHave you seen the impact of automation on your platform and continued electronification in terms of you taking share, other platforms taking share? Has there been any improvement in velocity from how you guys have seen it in recent years?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, if you look at the two or three years prior to 2021, yes. You had an unusually benign market environment for both rates and credit almost all of last year. You did see a modest decline in velocity last year. The big change, Chris, happened actually on the back of bank regulatory reform in 2012 and 2013. For obvious reasons, bank turnover went way down.\nI think what you're seeing now is the establishment of a brand new fixed income trading infrastructure that dealers are embracing, and clients are embracing as well, to create new ways to transfer risk that don't require as much balance sheet. We think we certainly feel like we're at the center of that with the automation and the all-to-all trading protocols that we're developing consistently, and the market is embracing. That's what leads to my optimism that we will see higher velocity in the periods ahead. Let's not forget, too, that all-to-all trading has brought a lot of new participants into the credit markets, and there are more coming. We are talking to lots of hedge funds in particular that are building up systematic credit trading strategies. I do think it's because of the ability to participate in all-to-all markets.\nWe saw that already on the market-making side with some significant new participants competing for order flow on the dealer side. I think there's more to come on the hedge fund and investor side as well. All that feeds into my view that you will see a long-term improvement in trading velocity.\n\nChris Allen\n\nResearch Analyst, Compass Point\n\nThanks, guys.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you have a question, simply press star one on your telephone. Next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in with a question here. Wanted to zone in a little bit on the high-yield markets and the dynamics there. It obviously feels like the environment broadly has improved. You mentioned that a number of times on the call today.\nYou published, I guess, a couple of things talking about March being a pretty robust volatility quarter for credit markets. I guess taking a step back, it just feels like MarketAxess participation in that higher volatility environment has been more muted recently in high yield than we've seen in the past. I was wondering why you think that is and if that's just too short-term and it's just been a couple of months and you expect generally to see much more uplift.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nIt's the latter, Alex. We're confident in our high-yield solution. We know from recent history in 2020 that when high-yield volatility picks up and people start to get more concerned about default risk and high yield, that all-to-all liquidity is incredibly valuable. We have almost 50% of our trades that have price improvement versus traditional methods of execution.\nWe remain highly confident that we have an important role to play in the high-yield markets and that we are super excited about this being the very beginning of what we expect to be a three or four-year period of higher volatility after a long period of significant quantitative easing that suppressed yields and volatility in the past. That is our view.\n\nChristopher Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nAlex, I'll just add the high-yield market volumes were down in Q1, yet we're seeing higher penetration of our Open Trading in high yield. People are finding that cost-savings value in our Open Trading solution in high yield and certainly benefiting from those savings. We are seeing that growth of our high yield through Open Trading. High yield, as I look at it, is just one part of a sizable story here at MarketAxess.\nIf you really look at this quarter more broadly, you see records. We mentioned many of these, but record total trading volume, record Treasury volume, record emerging market volume, record muni volume, record PT volume, record automation volume, record number of active clients, record MiDEX volume, our record diversity dealer volume, record on Live Markets. I have to add a record green bond trading in the quarter, $16 billion in green bonds. We planted a record number of trees, 82,000 trees in the quarter. High yield is important, but we have lots of products here at MarketAxess that are hitting records in that quarter, which, again, high yield and high-grade volumes, market volumes were down in the quarter.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nTotally.\nOver time, look, obviously, it'll be important to diversify the business away from high yield IG, which are obviously still the majority of the revenue base. My second question is around the dealer migration dynamic. You guys highlighted that in the press release and on the call as well. Sounds like a handful moved to a fixed distribution plan within other credit. Can you give us a sense of how much that impacted the fee per million in the other bucket? Just taking a step back, as industry volumes and volatility in credit pick up, should we expect more of that migration? How do you think that will impact the fee per million in the other credit bucket? Albeit, again, a lot of it is going to be mix dependent, but I guess maybe holding mix steady.\n\nChristopher Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah.\nThe dealer migration impact on the other credit is probably roughly about $3 per dealer move. You saw the nice pickup of the increase in the distribution fees. To my point earlier, it's a win-win for us because it's a sign that these high-yield dealers are going to trade more on a platform. They recognize the economies of scale being on that fixed distribution fee plan, and it increases our recurring revenue. As we look forward with other credit, we'd expect the mix shift in the products was impacted by an increased level of EM local market trading in the first quarter. As high-yield volume picks up, they command a much higher fee capture. We'd expect that to balance out as we look forward in the other credit fee capture.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nSuper. Very helpful. Thanks very much.\n\nOperator 4\n\nThank you.\nThis concludes our Q&A session for today. I will turn the call back to Rick McVey for his final remarks.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to catching up with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator 4\n\nWith that, we end our call for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for joining. You may now disconnect.",

Please continue to stand by. Thank you for your patience. Today's conference is scheduled to begin shortly. Please continue to stand by. Thank you for your patience. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, if you have a question, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key at any time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 26 January 2022.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDave Cresci\n\nInvestor Relations Manager, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and welcome to the MarketAxess Q4 2021 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiative. And then Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results and our full year 2022 guidance. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's belief regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain.\nThe company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning and thank you for joining us to review our Q4 and full year results. 2021 was an important year of investment and execution on the long-term growth strategy we outlined at our recent investor day. Importantly, we maintained a strong leadership position in the US credit institutional client e-trading space. The institutional client segment is the largest segment in global credit markets, and the highest quality order flow for banks and other market makers. Our international credit business shows strong momentum, reaching new highs in estimated market share for global emerging markets and Eurobonds.\nLarge banks report that MarketAxess is now the largest e-trading venue in emerging market debt trading in all regions around the world. Open Trading continues to be a key differentiator in our liquidity offering, and we have added new and valuable trading protocols in both credit and rates. Approximately 1,700 counterparty firms were active in Open Trading during the year, driving over $500 million in transaction cost savings. We are the only major fixed-income marketplace fully promoting all-to-all trading across all products and regions. Beyond our leadership in our core business, we made significant progress expanding our foundation for growth in new product areas.\nOur Portfolio Trading launch in May led to rapid adoption among approximately 68 large investor firms and 14 dealers. Portfolio Trading is a natural complement to our leadership in Bid and Offer List Trading, which sees over 1,000 bond basket inquiries per day. Our goal is to be the number one Portfolio Trading provider this year. US government bond volume on MarketAxess reached a new record of $4.1 trillion in 2021. Importantly, we are seeing growing large dealer and investor participation due to the launch of our all-to-all US Treasury Live Markets order book.\nClient onboarding is expected to accelerate this quarter. In Municipal Bond trading, the combination of our organic growth this year and the integration of the fully electronic volume from MuniBrokers creates the largest e-trading platform in the muni market, with plenty of runway ahead for growth. As we start 2022, our foundation for growth with global clients, a diversified product base, and a wide range of trading protocols is stronger than ever. Slide four highlights our full year results. For the full year, MarketAxess reported our 13th straight year of record revenues. 2021 credit trading conditions were unusually quiet following a robust year in 2020.\nTaken in the aggregate, our two-year compound growth rate for revenue was 17%, consistent with long-term averages. Operating income compound growth was 16% during the same period. Importantly, our investments in geographic and product diversification are paying off with 24% two-year compound revenue growth in product areas outside of our core US Corporate Bond business. Full year records in estimated market share were set in 2021 Emerging Markets, Eurobonds, and Municipal Bonds. The health of our business also comes through with a new record for active trading firms, as well as client firms trading three or more products.\nSlide five provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions in 2021 were challenging due to historically low credit spreads and low credit spread volatility. Low volatility reduces price dispersion and compresses bid-offer spreads. Total credit market volumes reported by TRACE and MarketAxess Post-Trade were down in all major product areas year-over-year as a result of the low volatility. Volatility in rates markets is showing improvement, driving increased activity in our Open Trading US Treasury marketplace. I believe that the extended period of central bank quantitative easing led to historically low interest rates and depressed volatility.\nThe combination of strong economic growth, and much higher inflation, is causing central banks to reduce bond purchases and prepare for rate increases. I believe this will lead to more normal levels of interest rates and bond market volatility in the quarters ahead. With four important trading days remaining in January, High-Grade and High-Yield estimated market share is running similar to Q1 last year, while TRACE market volumes are down about 17%. EM market share is running well above last year, with estimated market volumes down about 7%. Our US Treasury average daily volume is up approximately 35% from last January.\nSlide six illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. All of the major product areas trading on MarketAxess are in early stages of electronification. We believe that the trading efficiency and transaction cost savings available to dealers and investors will ultimately lead to electronic market share of over 50% in global fixed income. We have established a strong leadership position in US High-Grade, High-Yield, and Global Emerging Markets. We believe our competitive position is stronger than ever in Eurobonds and Municipal Bonds, and we now have a unique offering with compelling liquidity in US Treasuries.\nOpen Trading delivers additional all-to-all liquidity in global fixed income trading, and expands market participation. Trading automation and Open Trading provide the ingredients for higher trading velocity in the years ahead. We will continue to invest to capture this large opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rick. Slide seven provides an update on Open Trading and protocol expansion. Our all-to-all Open Trading solution continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy across all products. In Q4, over 29,000 orders and $15 billion in notional value were available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. A record of nearly 1,700 firms were active across our Open Trading network during the quarter. Dealers are increasingly seeking anonymous all-to-all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 27% in 2021 to $272 billion. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost savings opportunities, despite compressed credit market spreads.\nClients saved an estimated $128 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. Our investment in new protocols is also fueling growth. US Treasury volume executed over our Live Markets order book reached $1.2 trillion during the quarter. Early adopters of Live Markets for Treasuries report high-quality trade execution with unique order capabilities relative to incumbents. We also expanded our Live Markets order book to new credit markets with support for US High-Yield liquidity. Lastly, our Mid-X sessions protocol was recently expanded beyond Eurobonds to include support for US investment grade and US High-Yield bonds.\nSlide eight illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across markets, protocols, and services. Providing choice across markets, and trading protocols for all participants, is a key competitive advantage. Investing in new markets by offering innovative electronic trading solutions, and the development of robust data and post-trade services to complement the fixed income trading lifecycle, are critical to our long-term growth strategy. Following enhancements made to our Portfolio Trading functionality in 2021, we saw increased engagement that drove record volume of $13.1 billion in Q4.\nWe have seen significant traction with this functionality in a relatively short amount of time. Municipal Bond trading on MarketAxess grew 42% to $6.6 billion in the quarter. Additionally, $17.9 billion in volume was conducted through MuniBrokers in Q4. The integration of MuniBrokers into the MarketAxess trading system was completed in Q4 to combine our client-to-dealer network with dealer-to-dealer workflows using our Open Trading solution. The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year.\nOrganic post-trade revenue was up 18% as clients were onboarded for new SFTR services. Demand for intelligent market data solutions within fixed income continues to grow. Given our significant bond trading market share, and our expanded regulatory reporting services, we are in a unique position to offer differentiated data products. This includes the launching of our liquid index, the MarketAxess Investment Grade 400, and enhancements made to our AI-powered pricing engine, Composite+, with the launch of our CP+ Total Markets, which produces a price on over 250,000 bonds globally.\nSlide nine highlights the growing momentum of automation in credit trading. Automated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $44.4 billion in volume and over 242,000 trades. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count, and 7% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in Q4, up 18% from the same period last year. The growth of automation and algo pricing is also driving a steady increase in the average number of responses to any inquiry on the MarketAxess platform.\nIn Q4, there were, on average, 8.5 responses per inquiry. This demonstrates improved liquidity on the platform, and increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. On slide 12, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Q4 revenue was $165 million, down 4% from the prior year. A 6% decrease in credit trading volume and lower overall credit fee capture resulted in a 6% decline in commissions. Partially offsetting this decline in commission revenue was the 9% increase in information services revenue, and a 43% increase in post-trade services revenue. The $2.8 million increase in Q4 post-trade services revenue included $1.8 million of incremental revenue from the Reporting Hub acquisition. The sequential decrease in other net is due to foreign currency transaction gains that did not repeat in Q4.\nThe effective tax rate was 27.1% in Q4, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 22.8%. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and returns provision adjustments related to new state income tax filing requirements. Q4 EBITDA was $86.3 million, and diluted EPS was $1.37. On slide 13, we laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes, and fees per million. The 11% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower US credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture.\nThe decline in US High-Grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, which was driven by an increase in yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. The year-over-year increase in other credit distribution fees was due to the migration of certain dealers to a high yield fixed fee plan from an all-variable fee plan, and $1.2 million of subscription and license fees from the MuniBrokers acquisition.\nSlide 14 provides the expense detail. Q4 expenses were up 16% year-over-year and include an incremental $5 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and non-recurring integration costs associated with the Regulatory Reporting Hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition-related costs, expenses were up 10.1%. The increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher salary and benefit expense, as we continue to invest in talent to support our product and geographical expansion.\nThe $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense includes $1.8 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. The 25% year-over-year decline in clearing costs is due to lower Open Trading volume and transaction cost savings from our clearing model conversions. On slide 15, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of 31 December 2021, our cash and investments were $543 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $297 million.\nDuring Q4, we paid out $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 112,000 shares for a total cost of $45 million. We exhausted the $100 million repurchase program that was approved last year, and our Board of Directors authorized a new $150 million share repurchase program. During Q4, we did not have any borrowings on the $500 million revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility. Our Board of Directors approved the 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.70.\nOn slide 16, we have our 2022 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures, and the effective tax rate. We expect the total 2022 expenses will be in the range of $385 million to 415 million. Approximately 60% of the increase is due to our continued investment in the trading system and personnel to support our product and geographical expansion. 2022 capital expenditures are expected to range from $58 million to 62 million, of which roughly two-thirds relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements.\nWe expect that the effective tax rate for Q4 2022 will be in the range of 24% to 26%. The increase in the effective tax rate versus 2021 is driven by significantly lower estimated tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, 2021 was an important year of investment and execution to expand our growth cylinders and increase product diversification. Our competitive position remains strong in US credit and has improved materially in international product areas. Our investments have led to attractive ROI and free cash flow for our shareholders. We believe that the future will bring more normal fixed income market conditions with higher volatility and growing trading velocity.\nFinally, we would like to welcome Steve Davidson to MarketAxess as our Head of Investor Relations. Steve spent several years with us as a new public company beginning in 2005 and then worked with the New York Stock Exchange and MSCI. Steve and Dave Cresci will both be available to analysts and investors to provide the information and transparency you need from us. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYep. Good morning, guys. I'll welcome Steve as well because we know him from the past. He'll be helpful. First question is, I guess, for Rick and I guess the non-Concannon Chris on expenses. It's an 11% increase at the midpoint, similar to the 10% this past year. I guess the question is, if revenues were either significantly up and we get volatility and spreads widening, or if it was flat to down, if we get more of the same, how variable could the expense guidance be, I guess? How could you move expenses?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Rich, thank you for the question. If you notice, we did widen the goalposts in this year's guidance range from last year was around $20 million. This year, the goalposts are $30 million, recognizing that favorable or adverse market conditions can drive our variable expense up or down. If you look at the overall expense base, our variable expenses are roughly 18% to 20% of the total expense base. We recognize that in a year like last year, we saw variable expenses in the low end of the range, and that's what caused us to reset our guidance towards the end of the year.\nAs you look next year or this year into 2022, you need to keep in mind that 20% of that operating expense base is subject to market condition volatility.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. That's helpful. My follow-up would be for Chris Concannon. That would be slide nine, Chris. I just want to get an update. Does, on the new products that we rolled out, the all-to-all trading for munis and rates, I guess when you say client RFQ, is that the all, does that mean all-to-all trading is rolled out for those products?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rich. For munis, we have the full complement of both direct dealer disclosed RFQ as well as the all-to-all solution. In fact, in munis, all-to-all is quite a sizable part of the muni business. It's about 46% of our volume is all-to-all in munis. In our rate solution in US Treasuries, our current platform is an all-to-all platform. The live markets that we use in Treasuries is an all-to-all streaming price platform, and it's anonymous. That's the piece that we're seeing growth and had sizable growth in Q4. Our RFQ complement to that platform was rolled out in Q4. At the end of Q4, we plan to have all-to-all and disclosed RFQ for Treasuries this quarter.\nThat's being rolled out as we speak and worked on as we speak. We're pretty excited about an all-to-all solution for things like off-the-runs and even on-the-runs. We're pretty excited about the rollout coming this quarter.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, thank you. That's helpful.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rich.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the opportunities that you see for electronifying securitized markets. So ABS, non-agency RMBS, CLOs, among other products. Where do you see the industry today on that front in terms of electronifying? It seems pretty nascent days, I guess. How do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? Can you talk about some of the hurdles that you see for that part of the marketplace? How do you see potentially overcoming some of those hurdles?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. I'll start with that one, and thanks for the question. The level of electronification there today is extremely low. The hurdles are fragmentation, and generally lower levels of secondary turnover. As we talk to clients and dealers, they do believe that an Open Trading solution makes a lot of sense for those markets. It is on the list of potential future product expansion that we have here. What we've outlined today are the things that are live, that we're working on now, and we're excited about in terms of impact on revenue and earnings growth this year.\nClearly, the securitized markets are on the list, and I would have those in the bucket of potential product expansion that fits with the protocols that we run in credit.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a bit on the investment spend. I think you mentioned about 60% of the overall increase in the expense base for 2022 is coming from investments. I guess maybe you could just elaborate on what those investments are, how you're thinking about headcount growth into 2022, and maybe what are some of the items that did not make it on the investment list for this year that maybe could be on for 2023?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, that's a good question. The investments are 60%. It really comprises investing in our people, investing in the trading system enhancements, and as we expand not only the product and protocol offerings, but recognizing we're expanding our footprint in Asia and Europe. It's a combination of headcount, our software development, and system enhancement investments. With respect to any investments that we don't have on that roster, I don't think we're tabling anything until 2023. We're recognizing that there's an existing list of opportunities that we want to capitalize on, and they're all embedded in part of that investment agenda for 2022.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. The question's on the buyback authorization as well as the Q4 repurchase activity. I believe previously you guys had talked about mainly just offsetting dilution. Wondering about your kind of view going forward in terms of execution of that authorization, and maybe also just in the context of M&A and capital deployment, update us on your thoughts around inorganic opportunities as well.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYes, Dan. That's a good question. Our capital management strategy continues to remain the same. Our number one investment priority is to continue to invest in a trading platform. We continue to seek opportunistic M&A opportunities, and the balance of our capital management program focuses on returning capital to the shareholders, either in the form of dividends, and repurchase programs. During Q4, we recognized there was a dislocation in the share price. We did have the existing program, which had around roughly $80 million of capacity heading into Q4.\nWe employed that strategy to capitalize on the opportunity and accelerate the offsetting dilution from equity grants in the future. The fact that the Board approved the new $150 million plan is the ordinary course of business. It gives the management team flexibility to enter the market either opportunistically or to continue with our strategy to offset dilution from equity awards given to the employees.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, if you could update us on the outlook for the non-transactional revenues. At Investor Day, you talked a lot about the market size and the TAMs. Wondering, as you've kind of improved the product offering, we should see some acceleration as we think about 2022 versus the low double-digit numbers I believe you cited before for post-trade and information services.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nAgain, great question. On our information services, obviously, we're seeing double-digit growth in 2021. We're excited about the new products. CP+ and Axess All have been really the drivers in that growth engine in 2021. We're launching really two new products entering into 2022. Our total markets, our CP+ Total Markets, which really expands the overall coverage, and another product, Tradability, which really allows people to understand the true depth of the market and how to execute in the market. It's quite valuable in portfolio construction, sizing orders as you enter the market.\nReally critical information that we're launching here in 2022. Excited about the opportunities, continued growth in CP+, and then the new product Total Markets. Post-trade, obviously, you saw it grow year-over-year quite substantially given the increase in reg reporting, the closing of the transaction Regulatory Reporting Hub. We've integrated about 73% of the clients in 2021. Expect additional integrations throughout Q1. The great opportunity around our post-trade businesses, it is a resource of data for our information services business.\nA phenomenal resource of trade data across all of Europe, it gave us the opportunity in 2021 to launch our CP+ for European government bonds, where we have a small but growing footprint, but largely leveraged the value of that post-trade business. Pretty excited about 2022, the new products, and the growth of our really flagship product, CP+.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Also, welcome to Steve as well. Maybe just Chris or Rick, if we can zone in on portfolio trading. If my calculations are right, it looks like around 1% of your high-grade volumes in Q4. I guess correct me if I'm wrong on that. Maybe if you could share your view on expanding that. Obviously, we've seen traction this year from your main competitor.\nIf you can talk about how you see that market evolving for portfolio trading in 2022, given potentially higher volatility in corporate bonds, and then how you see that tracking versus your list trading business, and what kind of, I guess, market share would you like to get to in portfolio trading by the end of the year?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Good question. As I've said in the past, I do think the blend between portfolio trading and bid and offer list will be dependent on market volatility and market conditions. This year, we did see strong growth in portfolio trading during several quarters of very benign credit market conditions. It's important to keep it in context. The peak months, we estimate, were around 6% of TRACE secondary volume conducted through portfolio trades. It's kind of interesting because the tracker that we have on TRACE to identify portfolio trades is currently showing about 25 portfolio trades on average per day. We've already had 14 dealers involved.\nThere's a lot of competition in a low-vol market for a limited number of portfolio trades. Importantly, they're large in line items and large in volume. It's an important piece for us to offer. We are pleased with the progress we made since the May launch and the number of clients and dealers that are involved. If you look back at 2020, when volatility was very high, clearly, the added liquidity of Open Trading in Bid and Offer List was essential to the functioning of the market during the course of that higher volatility year.\nIt's kind of interesting because even in the last two months, with a very slight increase in volatility from the end of November through this week, we're seeing portfolio trading percentage of TRACE decline. That period has been closer to 4% or a little bit more of secondary trading in TRACE. We're starting to see that it gets more difficult for dealers to manage the risk in large portfolios when there is a pickup in volatility. As a result, we think that clients toggle back to bid and offer lists and use Open Trading in a deeper and broader pool of liquidity during those periods.\nOur belief, as I mentioned earlier, is it's unlikely that volatility in credit would be as low in 2022 as it was last year. It's highly unusual to have two years in a row like that. My belief is that the end of quantitative easing from central banks around the world is a big deal. They have been buying up a lot of the net supply in government bonds and even mortgages here. If market forces are at work to determine bond prices, I think it's likely to come with greater volatility. We're well aware of the appeal of portfolio trading to clients, and that's why we have been investing very actively in that solution.\nIn terms of my expectations, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are after being number one in portfolio trading as we are elsewhere in other protocols in global credit. We believe we're making the investments, and we have the client connectivity, dealer connectivity, and sales effort around that community to achieve that goal.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nBrian, I'll just add, on portfolio trading, we are seeing demand for, as Rick mentioned, a very long line item. We are up to 1,500 line items, and we're expanding that out even further this quarter. There is demand for very large line items, sizable trades, and it does go across high-grade, high-yield. We're now seeing portfolio trades in Eurobonds, which is helping our market share there, and even emerging market bonds. We're seeing a diversity of product in our solution, and our liquidity, the support of our dealer community, is certainly helping us support portfolio trading demands.\nWe're also seeing, at month-end, higher demand for portfolio trading as our clients try to move sizable portions of their portfolio. There is demand for portfolio trading at month-end. As Rick mentioned, we want to be number one in portfolio trading. We want to use our list trading and our portfolio trading as ways with analytics to compare what's the right trade for the client. Is it an individual list trade based on our unique proprietary pricing, or is it a portfolio trade? We think we can provide better analytics around both list trading and portfolio trading for clients to make the right decision at the individual bond level.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's super interesting. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing and the potential if we ease off of quantitative easing and move into a quantitative tightening type of environment, if we do get a pickup in the yield to maturity, what kind of impact that could have on the pricing? I know that tends to be a favorable impact.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. I'll start, and Chris can follow up on any specifics. The only product that has duration as a factor in our average pricing is US High-Grade. Higher rates, all else equal, reduces the duration of bonds and, as a result, reduces fee capture. The rest is dependent on the average maturity of bonds traded. Not surprising that as we enter into this new environment in 2022, where there are expectations of the Fed raising rates, we're seeing a slightly lower average years to maturity of the high-grade bonds traded on our platform. We're happy to follow up with it. The historical goalposts are pretty clear.\nOur personal view is that bring on the volatility, because we excel in more volatile markets. The offset in the benefit that we get with higher volatility and higher rates in market share and volume gains is well worth it, even if we get slightly lower duration of average bonds traded in high-grade.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nRight. Right. No, that makes sense. Yep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Apologies for phone issues earlier. I want to circle back on the commentary, Rick, you just made around capture rate and sort of pricing dynamics. It feels like most of the movement we've seen in capture rate has been really a function of the mix and not so much direct kind of pricing changes. As you continue to evolve the business, are you starting to see any changes in pricing from a more competitive perspective across all the kind of asset classes that you guys trade?\nMaybe what are the areas where you see that to be a little more pronounced than others? With respect to portfolio trading specifically, could you talk about how your offering and the pricing there compares to the competitors' offering in the same product?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. On the broader question, Alex, I think if you really look at the blended fee capture for our primary competitor here in the US, there's not a big difference in their average credit fee capture versus the MarketAxess average. The small difference is actually explained by the much larger high-yield and EM franchise that we have relative to that competitor, with higher fee capture in those product areas. There really aren't significant differences in the fee capture when you look at the blended rates that are being communicated publicly. With respect to PT, we think we're very competitive on pricing. Really, when markets get more volatile, our Open Trading cost savings go up.\nWe're delivering more value to the clients due to the transaction cost savings, which is why we've had a very long track record of maintaining our pricing. The last thing I'll say is that there's a new pricing scheme in our space as well, as you know, broadly communicated by dealers and investors, that Bloomberg has started to charge transaction fees. When we look outside the US, Bloomberg has been our biggest competitor. The fact that they've gone from zero transaction fees to now charging and doing something more comparable to what we've always done is actually a benefit to us on a competitive basis.\nWhat we are hearing from the large banks when we look at global EM in particular is our very significant share gains across the world in EM are partly because of the expansion of the electronic market, and partly because of a strengthening of our competitive position, especially vis-à-vis Bloomberg. We feel good about our pricing relative to the value we deliver back to our clients. Even in an incredibly benign year for credit trading, our transaction cost savings were very close to total transaction fees. We think that the value for money equation holds up very well, and the large banks, as you know, favor the fixed fee and markup models that we have here in the US. We think we're in a really good place around our fee models.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thanks for that. My follow-up is around the rates business. Obviously, given the pickup in rate volatility and the movement in rates we're seeing across the board, that should bode quite well for volume this year. What are some key kind of milestones you're hoping to achieve with that business this year, sort of legacy LiquidityEdge, maybe an update on where you guys stand with respect to net spotting and sort of integration with the rest of the business?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, Alex. On the rate solution, obviously, we look at that market. It's one of the largest markets that we're active in, and it still has a phone-based offering. We do see sizable share conducted on the phone, non-electronic. There are two large competitors in the space. From a pricing standpoint, on the last topic, we are very competitively priced against the competition. We feel good about our pricing position as we grow share in that market. We really have two offerings in that market: a live streaming order book offering, which has been growing, and that was a direct result of the LiquidityEdge transaction a number of years ago. The other offering is our traditional RFQ offering.\nThose two offerings are combined side to side, which makes it quite attractive for a client to decide if you're trading a more liquid product, you can trade it in real time on a live market. If you're trading a less liquid off-the-run product, you can trade it via traditional RFQ, which is really offered by the competition. We have quite sizable goals in that market, particularly given our offering is an all-to-all live order book with an all-to-all RFQ, supported by our all-to-all marketplace. We think we can grow that market over the course of 2022.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nJust to add on top of that as well, it's really interesting to us that as we start 2022, the majority of institutional investor Treasury electronic business is still conducted in an RFQ to 5 protocol, which is where both of the incumbents are with their investor offering. My belief is that the market is fully ready and welcomes an order book solution, and we think we are the right provider for that solution. We have 1,700 counterparties that can access the order book that Chris described. We have merged the two broker-dealers, so there's no additional documentation any longer for clients to access that pool.\nWe've made important post-trade STP solutions and average ticket pricing to help with investor activity. We have one more piece that will be completed this quarter in terms of order management connectivity to make it even easier to access. When you think about the Treasury market, the on-the-run cash market is trading one way. The US Treasury futures market has been trading in an exchange order book for decades. We think everything we hear from both dealers and investors is they welcome a new offering with an order book because of the additional flexibility, and the additional distribution through this very wide client network that we now have installed on MarketAxess.\nWe're super excited about it. We recognize that we have to have the RFQ offering as well, especially as you think about off-the-run Treasuries. Here again, we think Open Trading and order books have a role to play, and we're happy to be out in front providing that to a very large network of clients and dealers.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. All right. Perfect, guys. Thanks a lot for all the details.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe I can just ask a question about the Mid-X launch in the US. Just wondering if there's any numbers you can share in terms of the uptake of that Mid-X offering in Europe thus far to help us think about how meaningful this launch in the US could be for your 2022 growth. I also think that the Mid-X offering in the US is all-to-all from day one of the launch. I just want to confirm that, and I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to whether that's the kind of key differentiator for that protocol versus competitors that'll drive adoption.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Great question. Mid-X is, by definition, all-to-all. It leverages that all-to-all marketplace, so it's a fully anonymous part. Anyone can participate in that match. In our European or Eurobond Mid-X offering, we saw $3.2 billion in Q4 volume. Average trade sizes or max sessions are still quite sizable, close to $300 million. We continue to see demand for session-based trading in Europe. It is particularly dominated by dealers unloading inventory. It's truly a first-day dealer-to-dealer offering. Clients are still taking their time engaging the Mid-X solution. With regard to US High-Grade and US High-Yield, we see particular demand for our dealer RFQ.\nAgain, that's really a dealer solution for dealers to exit unwanted inventory using the traditional RFQ through the Open Trading network. Mid-X is just now launching here in the US. We're excited about offering a session-based solution to dealers here in the US as well. We continue to hear demand from our dealer community on a session-based solution for them to load large amounts of inventory looking for mid-market priced execution. We are using our premium CP+ mid-price, which is quite an attractive product compared to some of the competitor pricing dynamics. Pretty excited about Mid-X for high-grade and high-yield in 2022.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nI would just expand on that with one other piece. There's some interesting similarity between the market environment that seems to work well for sessions and the market environment that works well for portfolio trading because sessions depend on a relatively matched order book of buys and sells, and a lot of confidence in a model-driven mid-market price. Those two things decline when volatility picks up. If you look back at Q2 last year in 2020, when you had very high volatility, those protocols did not work as well.\nSessions-based, when we study the TRACE tape as we do very regularly, when we look at sessions-based volume within the TRACE tape, that too has declined in a material way since late November running right through this week. These protocols, the best position we can be in is exactly what we're doing, and that's to offer the whole range of protocols across our entire network, all supported by Open Trading. There will be times where the Open Trading RFQ is the dominant theme, and there will be other times where portfolio trading and matching sessions work well.\nWe're really pleased that our investments are putting us in a place where we've got the entire offering, and we can benefit from any of those environments.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThat's really helpful. I just had maybe a bigger picture question on Treasuries and Treasury market structure. Obviously, as you noted, it's still a very bifurcated market structure between the dealer-to-dealer space and the client-to-dealer space, and you're trying to kind of bridge that. I guess I just wanted some more clarity on two pieces. One, do you think there's going to be any real material regulatory change in terms of there's been a lot of talk about Treasury clearing? Do you think that's realistic to get some sort of proposal this year?\nI guess, what are the expectations there, and will that help kind of this transition to all-to-all whatsoever, or are you the solution and basically you don't think that that's going to have a big impact to the adoption of all-to-all in that Treasury space? Secondarily, just in terms of a lot of other platforms, I think, have tried to launch more all-to-all solutions in this space before or tried to open up some of the interdealer offerings to buy-side clients. It sounds like you're really encouraged by the uptake you're seeing, and it's kind of a ripe opportunity for these buy-side clients to be more engaged and actually use the platform. There's a lot of appetite for that.\nDo you think it's just the time has come for that, or is it just you're hearing more louder cries from the buy-side that they really need this? I'm just curious to get a better sense of what your clients are really talking to you about in terms of the desire for that all-to-all offering. Thank you.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Yeah, Kyle, two very different questions, but on the same topic. First, on regulatory focus, there is a lot of regulatory focus on the US Treasury market, as you know. In fact, I think as we speak, there's an SEC public call going on about ATS-G, which is the rulemaking that they're undertaking around a new category within ATS specific to the government bond market.\nI think the observation is that the fragmentation in the market has not worked particularly well at times of very high volatility, and there have been significant gaps in pricing and liquidity that are really important to US Treasury and to the functioning of all fixed-income markets because the US Treasury market is the benchmark for the entire world. We think that the regulatory focus will remain favorable to all-to-all trading solutions. Some of the thinking around that is that central clearing would be a good outcome to help to support all-to-all trading, as well as less risk in the settlement process for US Treasuries.\nWe obviously have been the most successful Open Trading platform without central clearing for corporate bonds, and we've been able to support that successfully with our own settlement solutions. Longer term, I think there's a lot of benefit to centralized clearing solutions, and there's a foundation at DTCC to be able to help to promote that down the road. We'll have to see how the regulators view that, but we do see some potential benefits of moving in that direction.\nI don't think you've ever seen a foundation like ours that already has success in Open Trading, has 350 or 400 dealers, and 1,700 clients all connected with order management system connectivity and counterparty authorization to trade through MarketAxess before in any of the other offerings. We have liquidity. We have a very broad client network that has the OMS connectivity, has the counterparty and settlement agreements already done, and we think that that's creating a really unique offering to complement the offering that's been out there for a long time.\nI think when you look at the others, they had the interdealer liquidity, but they really did not have the functionality or the OMS or the counterparty connections to the end clients at all. As we've seen, it takes a long time to build that up, and we've been at it. We're starting year 2022, so we have that network already built up. We're fully committed to all-to-all trading, and I think we are the obvious choice to promote this in a successful way.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Just one question from me. What's your view on why industry-wide credit trading volumes have been so tepid thus far in January, despite volatility picking up a bit? Trading volumes in other asset classes have been reasonably healthy. Related to that, how have TRACE volumes typically fared during periods of Fed rate hikes?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. I think that part of what's going on is the risk-off mentality. The reality, Patrick, is that the volatility that we've seen recently has been mostly focused on the rate space. We have price volatility in the corporate bond market, but we do not yet have much spread volatility. If you look, there's been a modest widening of credit spreads from where we were for the two or three quarters leading into the end of last year. My expectation is you're more likely to get both throughout this year, but credit spreads have been pretty stable so far.\nWe do notice from the Fed data that the dealer balance sheets are pretty low right now. They were going into year-end, as you would expect, but they remain low in the weekly data that we've seen pretty recently. I think there's certainly a chance that this is the calm before the storm, but I do think right now the volatility has been focused on the rate space more than it has credit spreads. I would expect that we'll see better turnover in credit products when we see better volatility in spreads.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGot it. I guess to follow up on that one, when you think back in periods where the Fed has been hiking, so 2015, 2016, was that generally a favorable environment as you guys were kind of looking at thinking about market share trends and industry-wide volumes, or what are the puts and takes as you kind of think about what might happen as the Fed potentially raises during 2022?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWe're happy to follow up with more specific data, which obviously has been public in our reporting for a long time. I can tell you there's a very clear correlation between the periods where we've done the best with market share, revenue growth, and volatility. I think it's a safe assumption, given how different the central bank environment could be over the next two years relative to where we've been, that the outcome of that could very well be better fixed-income market volatility. Those are the environments where we do the best.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nAll right. Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler",
    "content2": "Yeah. Hi, guys. Most of my follow-ups have been asked and answered, but excuse me, one quick one. I'm just trying to understand what's the driver when you say you're going to take the number one position in portfolio trading. What leaps you beyond the competitors? Is it the number of dealers signed up, or? I'm just trying to understand how you get to that position.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, so look, I think we're really encouraged by the last six months and how much of the PT share we've been able to attract onto the MarketAxess system. Rich, I think going back to my prepared remarks, we've been the leader in this space for a long time, and we've been going head-to-head with Tradeweb since 2002 when they launched their corporate bond offering, and we have successfully innovated and led that market for a long time. The reality is the client eyeballs, and the client mind share and attention, is largely on this system. As I mentioned, we do well over 1,000 bid and offer lists every day.\nThat compared to the 25 portfolio trades, now that we have a terrific technology solution for portfolio trades, it sits alongside those 1,200 or so bid and offer lists that clients are trading every day. We have primary sales focus on the credit trading desks. We have all 14 of the dealers that we know that are active in portfolio trading that are live on MarketAxess. We have the same liquidity pool of dealers. Those dealers just happen to do most of their client trading on MarketAxess, not any of our competitors. We think we have an incumbent position that's going to benefit.\nAs Chris mentioned earlier, getting that functionality so it's easy to toggle back and forth based on market conditions and the situation between bid and offer lists and portfolio trading is where we think clients want to be. We're encouraged by the last six months, and we think there's a lot more to come, and we're focused on taking the lead in the portfolio trading space.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Thank you. Very helpful, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. At that time, if you have a question, simply press star, then the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, press the pound key at any time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on 26 January 2022. I would now like to turn the call over to Dave Cresci, Investor Relations Manager at MarketAxess. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nDave Cresci\n\nInvestor Relations Manager, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning, and welcome to the MarketAxess Q4 2021 Conference Call. For the call, Rick McVey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, will provide a strategic update for the company. Chris Concannon, President and COO, will review the progress we are making on our growth initiative. Chris Gerosa, Chief Financial Officer, will walk you through the financial results and our full year 2022 guidance. Before I turn the call over to Rick, let me remind you that today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the company's beliefs regarding future events that, by their nature, are uncertain.\nThe company's actual results and financial condition may differ materially from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements. For a discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the company's future results, please see the description of risk factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended 31 December 2020. I would also direct you to read the forward-looking statement disclaimer in our quarterly earnings release, which was issued earlier this morning and is now available on our website. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us to review our Q4 and full year results. 2021 was an important year of investment and execution on the long-term growth strategy we outlined at our recent Investor Day. Importantly, we maintained a strong leadership position in the US credit institutional client e-trading space. The institutional client segment is the largest segment in global credit markets and the highest quality order flow for banks and other market makers. Our international credit business shows strong momentum, reaching new highs in estimated market share for global emerging markets and Eurobonds.\nLarge banks report that MarketAxess is now the largest e-trading venue in emerging market debt trading in all regions around the world. Open Trading continues to be a key differentiator in our liquidity offering, and we have added new and valuable trading protocols in both credit and rates. Approximately 1,700 counterparty firms were active in Open Trading during the year, driving over $500 million in transaction cost savings. We are the only major fixed-income marketplace fully promoting all-to-all trading across all products and regions. Beyond our leadership in our core business, we made significant progress expanding our foundation for growth in new product areas.\nOur portfolio trading launch in May led to rapid adoption among approximately 68 large investor firms and 14 dealers. Portfolio trading is a natural complement to our leadership in bid and offer list trading, which sees over 1,000 bond basket inquiries per day. Our goal is to be the number one portfolio trading provider this year. US government bond volume on MarketAxess reached a new record of $4.1 trillion in 2021. Importantly, we are seeing growing large dealer and investor participation due to the launch of our all-to-all US Treasury Live Markets order book.\nClient onboarding is expected to accelerate this quarter. In Municipal Bond trading, the combination of our organic growth this year and the integration of the fully electronic volume from MuniBrokers creates the largest e-trading platform in the muni market, with plenty of runway ahead for growth. As we start 2022, our foundation for growth with global clients, a diversified product base, and a wide range of trading protocols is stronger than ever. Slide four highlights our full year results. For the full year, MarketAxess reported our 13th straight year of record revenues. 2021 credit trading conditions were unusually quiet following a robust year in 2020.\nTaken in the aggregate, our two-year compound growth rate for revenue was 17%, consistent with long-term averages. Operating income compound growth was 16% during the same period. Importantly, our investments in geographic and product diversification are paying off with 24% two-year compound revenue growth in product areas outside of our core US Corporate Bond business. Full year records in estimated market share were set in 2021 Emerging Markets, Eurobonds, and Municipal Bonds. The health of our business also comes through with a new record for active trading firms, as well as client firms trading three or more products.\nSlide five provides an update on market conditions. Market conditions in 2021 were challenging due to historically low credit spreads and low credit spread volatility. Low volatility reduces price dispersion and compresses bid-offer spreads. Total credit market volumes reported by TRACE and MarketAxess Post-Trade were down in all major product areas year-over-year as a result of the low volatility. Volatility in rates markets is showing improvement, driving increased activity in our Open Trading US Treasury marketplace. I believe that the extended period of central bank quantitative easing led to historically low interest rates and depressed volatility.\nThe combination of strong economic growth, and much higher inflation, is causing central banks to reduce bond purchases and prepare for rate increases. I believe this will lead to more normal levels of interest rates and bond market volatility in the quarters ahead. With four important trading days remaining in January, High-Grade and High-Yield estimated market share is running similar to Q1 last year, while TRACE market volumes are down about 17%. EM market share is running well above last year, with estimated market volumes down about 7%. Our US Treasury average daily volume is up approximately 35% from last January.\nSlide six illustrates the tremendous growth opportunity that is driving our approach to investing. All of the major product areas trading on MarketAxess are in early stages of electronification. We believe that the trading efficiency and transaction cost savings available to dealers and investors will ultimately lead to electronic market share of over 50% in global fixed income. We have established a strong leadership position in US High-Grade, High-Yield, and Global Emerging Markets. We believe our competitive position is stronger than ever in Eurobonds, and Municipal Bonds, and we now have a unique offering with compelling liquidity in US Treasuries.\nOpen Trading delivers additional all-to-all liquidity in global fixed income trading, and expands market participation. Trading automation and Open Trading provide the ingredients for higher trading velocity in the years ahead. We will continue to invest to capture this large opportunity for our shareholders. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide more detail on the significant progress we are making with our investments in new initiatives.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rick. Slide seven provides an update on Open Trading and protocol expansion. Our all-to-all Open Trading solution continues to be a key driver of our growth strategy across all products. In Q4, over 29,000 orders and $15 billion in notional value were available daily through our Open Trading marketplace. A record of nearly 1,700 firms were active across our Open Trading network during the quarter. Dealers are increasingly seeking anonymous all-to-all liquidity. Dealer RFQ volume grew 27% in 2021 to $272 billion. The increased diversity of participation continues to drive cost savings opportunities, despite compressed credit market spreads.\nClients saved an estimated $128 million in transaction costs during the quarter due to price improvements in Open Trading. Our investment in new protocols is also fueling growth. US Treasury volume executed over our Live Markets order book reached $1.2 trillion during the quarter. Early adopters of Live Markets for Treasuries report high-quality trade execution with unique order capabilities relative to incumbents. We also expanded our Live Markets order book to new credit markets with support for US High-Yield liquidity. Lastly, our Mid-X sessions protocol was recently expanded beyond Eurobonds to include support for US investment grade and US High-Yield bonds.\nSlide eight illustrates the powerful diversification of our model across markets, protocols, and services. Providing choice across markets and trading protocols for all participants is a key competitive advantage. Investing in new markets by offering innovative electronic trading solutions, and the development of robust data and post-trade services to complement the fixed income trading lifecycle, are critical to our long-term growth strategy. Following enhancements made to our Portfolio Trading functionality in 2021, we saw increased engagement that drove record volume of $13.1 billion in Q4.\nWe have seen significant traction with this functionality in a relatively short amount of time. Municipal Bond trading on MarketAxess grew 42% to $6.6 billion in the quarter. Additionally, $17.9 billion in volume was conducted through MuniBrokers in Q4. The integration of MuniBrokers into the MarketAxess trading system was completed in Q4 to combine our client-to-dealer network with dealer-to-dealer workflows using our Open Trading solution. The acquisition of Regulatory Reporting Hub helped drive total post-trade services revenue to $9.4 million in the quarter, up 43% year-over-year.\nOrganic post-trade revenue was up 18% as clients were onboarded for new SFTR services. Demand for intelligent market data solutions within fixed income continues to grow. Given our significant bond trading market share, and our expanded regulatory reporting services, we are in a unique position to offer differentiated data products. This includes the launching of our liquid index, the MarketAxess Investment Grade 400, and enhancements made to our AI-powered pricing engine, Composite+, with the launch of our CP+ Total Markets, which produces a price on over 250,000 bonds globally.\nlide nine highlights the growing momentum of automation in credit trading.\nAutomated trading on MarketAxess reached new records in the quarter, growing to $44.4 billion in volume and over 242,000 trades. Today, Auto-X represents 19% of total trade count, and 7% of our total volume. The use of dealer algorithms is continuing to grow on the platform, with approximately 4.6 million algo responses in Q4, up 18% from the same period last year. The growth of automation and algo pricing is also driving a steady increase in the average number of responses to any inquiry on the MarketAxess platform. In Q4, there were, on average, 8.5 responses per inquiry.\nThis demonstrates improved liquidity on the platform, and increased engagement from our diverse investor and dealer community. Now, let me turn the call over to Chris to provide an update on our financials.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. On slide 12, we provide a summary of our quarterly earnings performance. Q4 revenue was $165 million, down 4% from the prior year. A 6% decrease in credit trading volume and lower overall credit fee capture resulted in a 6% decline in commissions. Partially offsetting this decline in commission revenue was the 9% increase in information services revenue, and a 43% increase in post-trade services revenue. The $2.8 million increase in Q4 post-trade services revenue included $1.8 million of incremental revenue from the Reporting Hub acquisition. The sequential decrease in other net is due to foreign currency transaction gains that did not repeat in Q4.\nThe effective tax rate was 27.1% in Q4, and our full year effective tax rate came in at 22.8%. The higher effective tax rate in the quarter was due to lower excess tax benefits and return provision adjustments related to new state income tax filing requirements. Q4 EBITDA was $86.3 million, and diluted EPS was $1.37. On slide 13, we laid out our commission revenue, trading volumes, and fees per million. The 11% decline in variable transaction fees was attributable to lower US credit trading volume and lower overall fee capture.\nThe decline in US High-Grade fees per million was mainly due to shorter duration, which was driven by an increase in yields and a decrease in the average years to maturity of bonds traded on the platform. The year-over-year increase in other credit distribution fees was due to the migration of certain dealers to a high yield fixed fee plan from an all-variable fee plan, and $1.2 million of subscription and license fees from the MuniBrokers acquisition.\nSlide 14 provides the expense detail. Q4 expenses were up 16% year-over-year and include an incremental $5 million of operating expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and non-recurring integration costs associated with the Regulatory Reporting Hub and MuniBrokers acquisitions. If we exclude these acquisition-related costs, expenses were up 10.1%. The increase in compensation and benefits reflects higher salary and benefit expense, as we continue to invest in talent to support our product and geographical expansion.\nThe $4 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense includes $1.8 million of acquired intangible amortization expense from acquisitions and higher software development costs as we continue to invest in trading system enhancements. The 25% year-over-year decline in clearing costs is due to lower Open Trading volume and transaction cost savings from our clearing model conversions. On slide 15, we provide an update on cash flow and capital management. As of 31 December 2021, our cash and investments were $543 million, and our trailing 12-month free cash flow was $297 million.\nDuring Q4, we paid out $25 million in quarterly dividends to our shareholders and repurchased approximately 112,000 shares for a total cost of $45 million. We exhausted the $100 million repurchase program that was approved last year, and our Board of Directors authorized a new $150 million share repurchase program. During Q4, we did not have any borrowings on the $500 million revolving credit facility or the $200 million secured facility. Our Board of Directors approved the 6% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.70. On slide 16, we have our 2022 guidance for expenses, capital expenditures, and the effective tax rate.\nWe expect the total 2022 expenses will be in the range of $385 million to 415 million. Approximately 60% of the increase is due to our continued investment in the trading system and personnel to support our product and geographical expansion. 2022 capital expenditures are expected to range from $58 million to 62 million, of which roughly two-thirds relates to capitalized software development costs resulting from the investments we are making in new protocols and trading platform enhancements. We expect that the effective tax rate for Q4 2022 will be in the range of 24% to 26%.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate versus 2021 is driven significantly lower estimated tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards. Now, let me turn the call over to Rick.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you, Chris. In summary, 2021 was an important year of investment and execution to expand our growth cylinders and increase product diversification. Our competitive position remains strong in US credit and has improved materially in international product areas. Our investments have led to attractive ROI and free cash flow for our shareholders. We believe that the future will bring more normal fixed income market conditions with higher volatility and growing trading velocity. Finally, we would like to welcome Steve Davidson to MarketAxess as our Head of Investor Relations.\nSteve spent several years with us as a new public company beginning in 2005 and then worked with the New York Stock Exchange and MSCI. Steve and Dave Cresci will both be available to analysts and investors to provide the information and transparency you need from us. Now, I would be happy to open the line for your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder, to ask a question, you will need to press star one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, press the pound key. We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah, good morning, guys. I'll welcome Steve as well because we know him from the past. He'll be helpful. First question is, I guess, for Rick and, I guess, the non-Concannon Chris, on expenses. It's an 11% increase at the midpoint, similar to the 10% this past year. I guess the question is, if revenues were either significantly up and we get volatility and spreads widening, or if it was flat to down, if we get more of the same, how variable could the expense guidance be, I guess? How could you move expense?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, Rich, thank you for the question. If you notice, we did widen the goalposts in this year's guidance range from last year was around $20 million. This year, the goalposts are $30 million, recognizing that favorable or adverse market conditions can drive our variable expense up or down. If you look at the overall expense base, our variable expenses are roughly 18% to 20% of the total expense base. We recognize that in a year like last year, we saw variable expenses in the low end of the range, and that's what caused us to reset our guidance towards the end of the year.\nAs you look next year or this year into 2022, you need to keep in mind that 20% of that operating expense base is subject to market condition volatility.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. That's helpful. My follow-up would be for Chris Concannon. That would be slide nine. Chris, I just want to get an update. Does, on the new products that we rolled out, be all-to-all trading for munis and rates? I guess when you say client RFQ, is that the—does that mean all-to-all trading is rolled out for those products?\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rich. For munis, we have the full complement of both direct dealer disclosed RFQ as well as the all-to-all solution. In fact, the munis all-to-all is quite a sizable part of the muni business. It's about 46% of our volume is all-to-all in munis. In our rate solution in US Treasuries, our current platform is an all-to-all platform. The live markets that we use in Treasuries is an all-to-all streaming price platform, and it's anonymous. That's the piece that we're seeing growth and had sizable growth in Q4. Our RFQ complement to that platform was rolled out in Q4. At the end of Q4, we plan to have all-to-all and disclosed RFQ for Treasuries this quarter.\nThat's being rolled out as we speak and worked on as we speak. We're pretty excited about an all-to-all solution for things like off-the-runs and even on-the-runs. We're pretty excited about the rollout coming this quarter.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nOkay, thank you. That's helpful.\n\nChris Concannon\n\nPresident and COO, MarketAxess\n\nThanks, Rich.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cyphers from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about the opportunities that you see for electronifying securitized markets. So ABS, non-agency RMBS, CLOs, among other products. Where do you see the industry today on that front in terms of electronifying? It seems pretty nascent days. I guess, how do you see that evolving over the next couple of years? Can you talk about some of the hurdles that you see for that part of the marketplace? How do you see potentially overcoming some of those hurdles?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. I'll start with that one, and thanks for the question. The level of electronification there today is extremely low. The hurdles are fragmentation and generally lower levels of secondary turnover. As we talk to clients and dealers, they do believe that an Open Trading solution makes a lot of sense for those markets. It is on the list of potential future product expansion that we have here. What we've outlined today are the things that are live, that we're working on now, and we're excited about in terms of impact on revenue and earnings growth this year.\nClearly, the securitized markets are on the list, and I would have those in the bucket of potential product expansion that fits with the protocols that we run in credit.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the expense side. I was hoping maybe you could elaborate a bit on the investment spend. I think you mentioned about 60% of the overall increase in the expense base for 2022 is coming from investments. I guess maybe you could just elaborate on what those investments are, how you're thinking about headcount growth into 2022, and maybe what are some of the items that did not make it on the investment list for this year that maybe could be on for 2023?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah, that's a good question. The investments of 60% really comprise investing in our people, investing in the trading system enhancements, and as we expand not only the product and protocol offerings, but recognizing we're expanding our footprint in Asia and Europe. It's a combination of headcount, our software development, and system enhancement investments. With respect to any investments that we don't have on that roster, I don't think we're tabling anything until 2023. We're recognizing that there's an existing list of opportunities that we want to capitalize on, and they're all embedded in part of that investment agenda for 2022.\n\nMichael Cyprys\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs, your line is now open. Please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nThanks. Good morning. The question's on the buyback authorization as well as the Q4 repurchase activity. I believe previously you guys had talked about mainly just offsetting dilution. Wondering about your kind of view going forward in terms of execution of that authorization, and maybe also just in the context of M&A and capital deployment, update us on your thoughts around inorganic opportunities as well.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nYes, Dan. Good question. Our capital management strategy continues to remain the same. Our number one investment priority is to continue to invest in a trading platform. We continue to seek opportunistic M&A opportunities, and the balance of our capital management program focuses on returning capital to the shareholders, either in the form of dividends, and repurchase programs. During Q4, we recognized there was a dislocation in the share price. We did have the existing program, which had around roughly $80 million of capacity heading into Q4.\nWe employed that strategy to capitalize on the opportunity and accelerate the offsetting dilution from equity grants in the future. The fact that the Board approved the new $150 million plan is the ordinary course of business. It gives the management team flexibility to enter the market either opportunistically or to continue with our strategy to offset dilution from equity awards given to the employees.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGot it. That's helpful. Just as a follow-up, if you could update us on the outlook for the non-transactional revenues. At Investor Day, you talked a lot about the market size and the TAMs. Wondering, as you've kind of improved the product offering, we should see some acceleration as we think about 2022 versus the low double-digit numbers I believe you cited before for post-trade and information services.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nDan, great question. On our information services, obviously, we're seeing double-digit growth in 2021. We're excited about the new products. CP+ and Axess All have been really the drivers in that growth engine in 2021. We're launching really two new products entering into 2022. Our total markets, our CP+ Total Markets, which really expands the overall coverage, and another product, Tradability, which really allows people to understand the true depth of the market and how to execute in the market. It's quite valuable in portfolio construction, sizing orders as you enter the market.\nReally critical information that we're launching here in 2022. Excited about the opportunities, continued growth in CP+, and then the new product Total Markets. Post-trade, obviously, you saw it grow year-over-year quite substantially given the increase in reg reporting, the closing of the transaction Regulatory Reporting Hub. We've integrated about 73% of the clients in 2021. Expect additional integrations throughout Q1. The great opportunity around our post-trade business is it is a resource of data for our information services business, a phenomenal resource of trade data across all of Europe.\nIt gave us the opportunity in 2021 to launch our CP+ for European government bonds, where we have a small but growing footprint, but largely leveraged the value of that post-trade business. Pretty excited about 2022, the new products, and the growth of our really flagship product, CP+.\n\nDan Fannon\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Also, welcome to Steve as well. Maybe just Chris or Rick, if we can zone in on portfolio trading. If my calculations are right, it looks like around 1% of your high-grade volumes in Q4. I guess correct me if I'm wrong on that. Maybe if you could share your view on expanding that. Obviously, we've seen traction this year from your main competitor.\nIf you can talk about how you see that market evolving for portfolio trading in 2022, given potentially higher volatility in corporate bonds, and then how you see that tracking versus your list trading business, and what kind of, I guess, market share would you like to get to in portfolio trading by the end of the year?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Good question. As I've said in the past, I do think the blend between portfolio trading and bid and offer list will be dependent on market volatility and market conditions. This year, we did see strong growth in portfolio trading during several quarters of very benign credit market conditions. It's important to keep it in context. The peak months we estimate were around 6% of TRACE secondary volume conducted through portfolio trades.\nIt's kind of interesting because the tracker that we have on TRACE to identify portfolio trades is currently showing about 25 portfolio trades on average per day. We've already had 14 dealers involved. There's a lot of competition in a low-vol market for a limited number of portfolio trades. Importantly, they're large in line items and large in volume. It's an important piece for us to offer. We are pleased with the progress we made since the May launch and the number of clients and dealers that are involved.\nIf you look back at 2020, when volatility was very high, clearly, the added liquidity of Open Trading in Bid and Offer List was essential to the functioning of the market during the course of that higher volatility year. It's kind of interesting because even in the last two months, with a very slight increase in volatility from the end of November through this week, we're seeing portfolio trading percentage of TRACE decline. That period has been closer to 4% or a little bit more of secondary trading in TRACE. We're starting to see that it gets more difficult for dealers to manage the risk in large portfolios when there is a pickup in volatility.\nAs a result, we think that clients toggle back to bid and offer lists and use Open Trading in a deeper and broader pool of liquidity during those periods. Our belief, as I mentioned earlier, is it's unlikely that volatility in credit would be as low in 2022 as it was last year. It's highly unusual to have two years in a row like that. My belief is that the end of quantitative easing from central banks around the world is a big deal. They have been buying up a lot of the net supply in government bonds and even mortgages here. If market forces are at work to determine bond prices, I think it's likely to come with greater volatility.\nWe're well aware of the appeal of portfolio trading to clients, and that's why we have been investing very actively in that solution. In terms of my expectations, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are after being number one in portfolio trading as we are elsewhere in other protocols in global credit. We believe we're making the investments, and we have the client connectivity, dealer connectivity, and sales effort around that community to achieve that goal.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nBrian, I'll just add, on portfolio trading, we are seeing demand for, as Rick mentioned, a very long line item. We are up to 1,500 line items. We're expanding that out even further this quarter. There is demand for very large line items, sizable trades, but it does go across high-grade, high-yield. We're now seeing portfolio trades in Eurobonds, which is helping our market share there, and even emerging market bonds. We're seeing a diversity of product in our solution, and our liquidity, the support of our dealer community, is certainly helping us support portfolio trading demands.\nWe're also seeing, at month-end, higher demand for portfolio trading as our clients try to move sizable portions of their portfolio. There is demand for portfolio trading at month-end. As Rick mentioned, we want to be number one in portfolio trading. We want to use our list trading and our portfolio trading as ways with analytics to compare what's the right trade for the client. Is it an individual list trade based on our unique proprietary pricing, or is it a portfolio trade? We think we can provide better analytics around both list trading and portfolio trading for clients to make the right decision at the individual bond level.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nThat's super interesting. Maybe just a follow-up on pricing and the potential if we ease off of quantitative easing and move into a quantitative tightening type of environment, if we do get a pickup in the yield to maturity, what kind of impact that could have on the pricing? I know that tends to be a favorable impact.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nYeah. I'll start, and Chris can follow up on any specifics. The only product that has duration as a factor in our average pricing is US High-Grade. Higher rates, all else equal, reduces the duration of bonds and, as a result, reduces fee capture. The rest is dependent on the average maturity of bonds traded. Not surprising that as we enter into this new environment in 2022, where there are expectations of the Fed raising rates, we're seeing a slightly lower average years to maturity of the high-grade bonds traded on our platform. We're happy to follow up with it. The historical goalposts are pretty clear.\nOur personal view is that bring on the volatility, because we excel in more volatile markets. The offset in the benefit that we get with higher volatility and higher rates in market share and volume gains is well worth it, even if we get slightly lower duration of average bonds traded in high-grade.\n\nBrian Bedell\n\nAnalyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nRight. Right. No, that makes sense. Yep. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Apologies for phone issues earlier. I want to circle back on the commentary, Rick, you just made around capture rate and capture rate and sort of pricing dynamics. It feels like most of the movement we've seen in capture rate has been really a function of the mix and not so much direct kind of pricing changes. As you continue to evolve the business, are you starting to see any changes in pricing from a more competitive perspective across all the kind of asset classes that you guys trade? Maybe what are the areas where you see that to be a little more pronounced than others?\nWith respect to portfolio trading specifically, could you talk about how your offering and the pricing there compares to the competitor's offering in the same product?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. On the broader question, Alex, I think if you really look at the blended fee capture for our primary competitor here in the US, there's not a big difference in their average credit fee capture versus the MarketAxess average. The small difference is actually explained by the much larger high-yield and EM franchise that we have relative to that competitor, with higher fee capture in those product areas. There really aren't significant differences in the fee capture when you look at the blended rates that are being communicated publicly. With respect to PT, we think we're very competitive on pricing.\nReally, when markets get more volatile, our Open Trading cost savings go up. We're delivering more value to the clients due to the transaction cost savings, which is why we've had a very long track record of maintaining our pricing. The last thing I'll say is that there's a new pricing scheme in our space as well, as you know, broadly communicated by dealers and investors, that Bloomberg has started to charge transaction fees. When we look outside the US, Bloomberg has been our biggest competitor.\nThe fact that they've gone from zero transaction fees to now charging and doing something more comparable to what we've always done is actually a benefit to us on a competitive basis. What we are hearing from the large banks when we look at global EM in particular is our very significant share gains across the world in EM are partly because of the expansion of the electronic market and partly because of a strengthening of our competitive position, especially vis-à-vis Bloomberg. We feel good about our pricing relative to the value we deliver back to our clients.\nEven in an incredibly benign year for credit trading, our transaction cost savings were very close to total transaction fees. We think that the value for money equation holds up very well. The large banks, as you know, favor the fixed fee and markup models that we have here in the US. We think we're in a really good place around our fee models.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat, thanks for that. My follow-up is around the rates business. Obviously, given the pickup in rate volatility and the moving rates we're seeing across the board, that should bode quite well for volume this year. What are some key kind of milestones you're hoping to achieve with that business this year, sort of legacy LiquidityEdge, maybe an update on where you guys stand with respect to net spotting and sort of integration with the rest of the business?\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure, Alex. On the rate solution, obviously, we look at that market. It's one of the largest markets that we're active in, and it still has a phone-based offering. We do see sizable share on the phone, conducted on the phone, non-electronic. There are two large competitors in the space. From a pricing standpoint, on the last topic, we are very competitively priced against the competition. We feel good about our pricing position as we grow share in that market.\nWe really have two offerings in that market: a live streaming order book offering, which has been growing, and that was a direct result of the LiquidityEdge transaction a number of years ago. The other offering is our traditional RFQ offering. Those two offerings are combined side to side, which makes it quite attractive for a client to decide if you're trading a more liquid product, you can trade it in real time on a live market. If you're trading a less liquid, off-the-run product, you can trade it via traditional RFQ, which is really offered by the competition.\nWe have quite sizable goals in that market, particularly given our offering is an all-to-all live order book with an all-to-all RFQ, supported by our all-to-all marketplace. We think we can grow that market over the course of 2022.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nJust add on top of that as well, it's really interesting to us that as we start 2022, the majority of institutional investor Treasury electronic business is still conducted in an RFQ to 5 protocol, which is where both of the incumbents are with their investor offering. My belief is that the market is fully ready and welcomes an order book solution, and we think we are the right provider for that solution. We have 1,700 counterparties that can access the order book that Chris described.\nWe have merged the two broker-dealers, so there's no additional documentation any longer for clients to access that pool. We've made important post-trade STP solutions and average ticket pricing to help with investor activity. We have one more piece that will be completed this quarter in terms of order management connectivity to make it even easier to access. When you think about the treasury market, the on-the-run cash market is trading one way. The US treasury futures market has been trading in an exchange order book for decades.\nWe think everything we hear from both dealers and investors is they welcome a new offering with an order book because of the additional flexibility, and the additional distribution through this very wide client network that we now have installed on MarketAxess. We're super excited about it. We recognize that we have to have the RFQ offering as well, especially as you think about off-the-run treasuries. Here again, we think Open Trading and order books have a role to play, and we're happy to be out in front providing that to a very large network of clients and dealers.\n\nAlex Blostein\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGreat. All right. Perfect, guys. Thanks a lot for holding the telephone.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nHi. Good morning. Maybe could you just ask a question about the Mid-X launch in the US? Just wondering if there's any numbers you can share in terms of the uptake of that Mid-X offering in Europe thus far to help us think about how meaningful this launch in the US could be for your 2022 growth. I also think that the Mid-X offering in the US is all-to-all from day one of the launch. I just want to confirm that, and I'm just curious to hear your thoughts as to whether that's the kind of key differentiator for that protocol versus competitors that'll drive adoption.\n\nChris Gerosa\n\nCFO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Great question. Mid-X is, by definition, all-to-all. It leverages that all-to-all marketplace, so it's a fully anonymous part. Anyone can participate in that match. In our European or Eurobond Mid-X offering, we saw $3.2 billion in Q4 volume. Sizes of average trade sizes or max sessions are still quite sizable, close to $300 million. We continue to see demand for session-based trading in Europe. It is particularly dominated by dealers unloading inventory. It's truly a first-day dealer-to-dealer offering. Clients are still taking their time engaging the Mid-X solution.\nWith regard to US High-Grade and US High-Yield, we see particular demand for our dealer RFQ. That's really a dealer solution for dealers to exit inventory, unwanted inventory using the traditional RFQ through the Open Trading network. Mid-X is just now launching here in the US. We're excited about offering a session-based solution to dealers here in the US as well. We continue to hear demand from our dealer community on a session-based solution for them to load large amounts of inventory looking for mid-market priced execution.\nWe are using our premium CP+ mid-price, which is quite an attractive product compared to some of the competitor pricing dynamics. Pretty excited about Mid-X for high-grade and high-yield in 2022.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nI would just expand on that with one other piece. There's some interesting similarity between the market environment that seems to work well for sessions and the market environment that works well for portfolio trading because sessions depend on a relatively matched order book of buys and sells, and a lot of confidence in a model-driven mid-market price. Those two things decline when volatility picks up. If you look back at Q2 last year in 2020, when you had very high volatility, those protocols did not work as well.\nSessions-based, when we study the TRACE tape as we do very regularly, when we look at sessions-based volume within the TRACE tape, that too has declined in a material way since late November running right through this week. These protocols, the best position we can be in is exactly what we're doing, and that's to offer the whole range of protocols across our entire network, all supported by Open Trading.\nThere will be times where the Open Trading RFQ is the dominant theme, and there will be other times where portfolio trading and matching sessions work well. We're really pleased that our investments are putting us in a place where we've got the entire offering, and we can benefit from any of those environments.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThat's really helpful. I just had maybe a bigger picture question on Treasuries and Treasury market structure. Obviously, as you noted, it's still a very bifurcated market structure between the dealer-to-dealer space and the client-to-dealer space, and you're trying to kind of bridge that. I guess I just wanted some more clarity on two pieces. One, do you think there's going to be any real material regulatory change in terms of there's been a lot of talk about Treasury clearing? Do you think that's realistic to get some sort of proposal this year?\nI guess, what are the expectations there, and will that help kind of this transition to all-to-all whatsoever, or are you the solution and basically you don't think that that's going to have a big impact to the adoption of all-to-all in that Treasury space? Secondarily, just in terms of a lot of other platforms, I think, have tried to launch more all-to-all solutions in this space before or tried to open up some of the inner dealer offerings to buy-side clients.\nIt sounds like you're really encouraged by the uptake you're seeing, and it's kind of a ripe opportunity for these buy-side clients to be more engaged and actually use the platform, and there's a lot of appetite for that. Do you think it's just the time has come for that, or is it just you're hearing more louder cries from the buy-side that they really need this? I'm just curious to get a better sense of what your clients are really talking to you about in terms of the desire for that all-to-all offering. Thank you.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nSure. Yeah, Kyle, two very different questions, but on the same topic. First, on regulatory focus, there is a lot of regulatory focus on the US Treasury market, as you know. In fact, I think as we speak, there's an SEC public call going on about ATS-G, which is the rulemaking that they're undertaking around a new category within ATS specific to the government bond market.\nI think the observation is that the fragmentation in the market has not worked particularly well at times of very high volatility, and there have been significant gaps in pricing and liquidity that are really important to US Treasury and to the functioning of all fixed income markets because the US Treasury market is the benchmark for the entire world. We think that the regulatory focus will remain favorable to all-to-all trading solutions. Some of the thinking around that is that central clearing would be a good outcome to help to support all-to-all trading, as well as less risk in the settlement process for US Treasuries.\nWe obviously have been the most successful Open Trading platform without central clearing for corporate bonds, and we've been able to support that successfully with our own settlement solutions. Longer term, I think there's a lot of benefit to centralized clearing solutions, and there's a foundation at DTCC to be able to help to promote that down the road. We'll have to see how the regulators view that, but we do see some potential benefits of moving in that direction.\nAs far as I don't think you've ever seen a foundation like ours that already has success in Open Trading, has 350 or 400 dealers, and 1,700 clients all connected with order management system connectivity and counterparty authorization to trade through MarketAxess before in any of the other offerings. We have liquidity. We have a very broad client network that has the OMS connectivity, has the counterparty and settlement agreements already done, and we think that that's creating a really unique offering to complement the offering that's been out there for a long time.\nI think when you look at the others, they had the inter-dealer liquidity, but they really did not have the functionality or the OMS or the counterparty connections to the end clients at all. As we've seen, it takes a long time to build that up, and we've been at it. We're starting year 2022, so we have that network already built up. We're fully committed to all-to-all trading, and I think we are the obvious choice to promote this in a successful way.\n\nKyle Voigt\n\nAnalyst, KBW\n\nThat's great. Thanks, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick O'Shaughnessy from Raymond James. Your line is now open.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nHey, good morning, guys. Just one question from me. What's your view on why industry-wide credit trading volumes have been so tepid thus far in January, despite volatility picking up a bit? Trading volumes in other asset classes have been reasonably healthy. Related to that, how have TRACE volumes typically fared during periods of Fed rate hikes?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess",
    "content3": "Yeah. I think that part of what's going on is the risk-off mentality. The reality, Patrick, is that the volatility that we've seen recently has been mostly focused on the rate space. We have price volatility in the corporate bond market, but we do not yet have much spread volatility. If you look, there's been a modest widening of credit spreads from where we were for the two or three quarters leading into the end of last year. My expectation is you're more likely to get both throughout this year, but credit spreads have been pretty stable so far. We do notice from the Fed data that the dealer balance sheets are pretty low right now.\nThey were going into year-end, as you would expect, but they remain low in the weekly data that we've seen pretty recently. I think there's certainly a chance that this is the calm before the storm, but I do think right now the volatility has been focused on the rate space more than it has credit spreads. I would expect that we'll see better turnover in credit products when we see better volatility in spreads.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nGot it. I guess to follow up on that one, when you think back in periods where the Fed has been hiking, so 2015, 2016, was that generally a favorable environment as you guys were kind of looking at thinking about market share trends and industry-wide volumes, or what are the puts and takes as you kind of think about what might happen as the Fed potentially raises during 2022?\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWe're happy to follow up with more specific data, which obviously has been public in our reporting for a long time. I can tell you there's a very clear correlation between the periods where we've done the best with market share, revenue growth, and volatility. I think it's a safe assumption, given how different the central bank environment could be over the next two years relative to where we've been, that the outcome of that could very well be better fixed income market volatility. Those are the environments where we do the best.\n\nPatrick O'Shaughnessy\n\nAnalyst, Raymond James\n\nAll right. Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nYeah. Hi, guys. Most of my follow-ups have been asked and answered, but excuse me, one quick one. I'm just trying to understand what's the driver when you say you're going to take the number one position in portfolio trading. What leaps you beyond the competitors? Is it the number of dealers signed up, or? I'm just trying to understand how you get to that position.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nWell, look, I think we're really encouraged by the last six months and how much of the PT share we've been able to attract onto the MarketAxess system. Rich, I think going back to my prepared remarks, we've been the leader in this space for a long time, and we've been going head-to-head with Tradeweb since 2002 when they launched their corporate bond offering, and we have successfully innovated and led that market for a long time. The reality is the client eyeballs, the client mind share, and attention is largely on this system. As I mentioned, we do well over 1,000 bid and offer lists every day.\nThat compared to the 25 portfolio trades, now that we have a terrific technology solution for portfolio trades, it sits alongside those 1,200 or so bid and offer lists that clients are trading every day. We have primary sales focus on the credit trading desks. We have all 14 of the dealers that we know that are active in portfolio trading that are live on MarketAxess. We have the same liquidity pool of dealers. Those dealers just happen to do most of their client trading on MarketAxess, not any of our competitors. We think we have an incumbent position that's going to benefit.\nAs Chris mentioned earlier, getting that functionality so it's easy to toggle back and forth based on market conditions and the situation between bid and offer lists and portfolio trading is where we think clients want to be. We're encouraged by the last six months, and we think there's a lot more to come, and we're focused on taking the lead in the portfolio trading space.\n\nRich Repetto\n\nAnalyst, Piper Sandler\n\nGot it. Thank you. Very helpful, Rick.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Rick McVey for closing remarks.\n\nRick McVey\n\nChairman and CEO, MarketAxess\n\nThank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to talking with you again next quarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Please go ahead.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. as we review our results for the third quarter of 2025. Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. .\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2025 earnings of $0.83 per share. With this solid quarter, we remain on track for strong 2025 results. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of the business is creating real value for our customers and stockholders.\nToday, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year at a range of $5.17 to $5.27 a share. Of course, this assumes normal weather through the remainder of 2025.\nIn addition, I'm excited to share our new 5-year capital plan. Let's start talking by talking about the economic growth that's driving the plan. We continue to see major business building a future in our region. Overall, our electric demand is expected to grow 3.4 gigawatts between 2026 and 2030, an increase of 1.6 gigawatts compared to the prior plan.\nMicrosoft is making good progress on its large data center complex in Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin. The company has stated that the first phase of that project is on track to go online next year.\nIn addition, Microsoft also recently announced plans for a second phase in Mount Pleasant that will be similar in size and power. Its projected investment is an incremental $4 billion on top of the original $3.3 billion investment. The economic development south of Milwaukee is supporting approximately 2.1 gigawatts of our overall 3.4 gigawatt demand growth.\nAnd as you recall, Vantage Data Centers has signed on to develop data center facilities on approximately 1,900 acres north of Milwaukee in Port Washington. Just last week, Vantage has announced that this campus named Lighthouse will be part of open AI and Oracle's partnership on the Stargate expansion. Vantage has reported that the site has the potential to reach 3.5 gigawatts of demand over time.\nRight now, we're focused on providing generation for an estimated 1.3 gigawatts of demand at the site in the next 5 years. The city of Port Washington approved Vantage is planned in August for the initial development on 670 acres. Vantage has stated that it expects to invest $15 billion in the project. The campus will feature 4 data centers and construction is planned to start this year. Vantage has announced that the facility could go online in late 2027 with this first phase of the project scheduled for completion in 2028.\nOf course, the growth of large customers is also fostering small commercial and residential development throughout our service territory. And Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 3.1% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. This significant economic development is driving our capital plan. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $36.5 billion in capital projects between 2026 and 2030, an increase of $8.5 billion above our previous 5-year plan. That's more than a 30% increase.\nWith this updated capital plan, we expect asset-based growth at an average rate of just over 11% a year. We expect that strong asset base growth to support our updated long-term projected earnings per share growth of 7% to 8% a year on a compound annual basis between 2026 and 2030, This is based on the midpoint of our 2025 guidance.\nFor the next few years, however, we expect to maintain our existing EPS growth rate of 6.5% to 7% on a compound basis and then accelerate starting in 2028 to the upper half of the new guidance range on a compound basis. As you are well aware, we're in the early stages of deploying the capital required to support the robust growth in our region, and it takes time to fully put the projects in service.\nThe increase in our plan is driven by investments in regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution in Wisconsin and the pipe retirement program in Illinois.\nLet me give you a few more details. Over the next 5 years, we'll utilize an all-of-the-above approach for generation to support the economic growth and reliability by investing in new natural gas, batteries and renewables. The key for reliability is dispatchable resources. Between 2026 and 2030, we expect to invest an incremental $3.4 billion in modern, efficient natural gas generation versus the prior plan. This includes combustion turbines, reciprocating internal combustion engines or race units and upgrades to existing facilities.\nWe also will continue to invest in renewable generation and battery storage increasing our projected investment by $2.5 billion over our prior plan.\nIn addition, American Transmission Company plans to continue to invest in our transmission capabilities to serve our region's economic growth, connect new generation and strengthen the system. Part of that new transmission is planned to serve customers and new data center needs.\nOur plan calls for us to invest approximately $4.1 billion in ATC projects between 2026 and 2030. This represents a $900 million increase from the previous plan. And to help assure reliability and support economic growth, we're continuing to invest in our electric and natural gas distribution networks with an additional $2 billion in the plan. This includes significant investment in our pipe retirement program in Chicago.\nRecall that the Illinois Commerce Commission directed us to review -- directed us to focus on retiring all cast iron and ductile iron pipe with a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035. We expect that over 1,000 miles of older pipe will need to be replaced.\nTurning to the regulatory front. I have just a few updates across our service areas. In Wisconsin, our proposed very large -- or BLC tariff remains with the Public Service Commission for a review. As we discussed earlier this year, this tariff is designed to meet the needs of our very large customers while protecting all of our other customers and investors.\nAs currently proposed, and in our testimony filed earlier this month, the tariff would provide for a fixed return on equity in an updated range of 10.48% to 10.98% and an equity ratio of 57%.\nThese financial terms have been agreed upon with the customers. The proposed terms of the agreements are 20 years for wind and solar and the depreciable lives for natural gas and battery storage assets. We worked with a very large customer in designing the tariff, including the financial parameters, and we believe the tariff is a key component to making Wisconsin a prime spot for data center investment.\nWe have a procedural schedule and provided our direct testimony earlier this month. A commission order is expected by early May of next year for customers to take service in June.\nAnd in Illinois, we are continuing to coordinate with the City of Chicago and our Pipe retirement program. As we are ramping up these efforts, we will continue to have regulatory reviews of the process. This includes the forecast in the general rate case proceeding, which we are planning to file in early 2026 for test year 2027. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nNow I'll turn it to Xia to provide you more details on the financial results and our financial plans.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Scott. Our third quarter 2025 earnings were $0.83 per share $0.01 over third quarter 2024 adjusted earnings. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.12 higher when compared to third quarter 24 adjusted earnings. Weather positively impacted earnings by about $0.01 relative to last year. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.03 favorable impact in the third quarter of 2025 and compared to a $0.02 favorable impact in 2024.\nRate-based growth contributed $0.15 more to earnings and timing of fuel expense tax and other items added another $0.07. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.06 from higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.05 from higher day-to-day O&M.\nIn terms of our weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, we saw a 1.8% increase compared to the third quarter of 2024. This was led by the large commercial and industrial segment, which grew 2.9%. The residential and small commercial and industrial segments grew 1.3% and 1.4%, respectively. Overall, we are slightly ahead of our annual electric sales growth forecast.\nLooking ahead, with the updated load growth, we now expect our annual electric sales growth to be between 6% and 7% for the period 2028 through 2030, that's up from the 4.5% to 5% we previously forecasted.\nTurning to American Transmission Company. Capital investment growth contributed an incremental $0.02 to Q3 earnings versus 2024. And at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings increased $0.01 in the third quarter of 25% from higher production tax credits.\nNext, you'll see that earnings from the Corporate and Other segment increased $0.11. This was largely driven by tax timing and higher interest expense.\nIn terms of common equity, we issued about $800 million through the first 9 months via our ATM program as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. This largely satisfied our common equity needs for this year.\nAs Scott noted, we're reaffirming our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.17 to $5.27 per share. This includes October weather and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\nGoing forward, with the updated capital plan, we expect our EPS growth to accelerate post 2027. Overall, based off the midpoint of the 25% guidance range, our long-term growth rate CAGR is expected to be 7% to 8% through 2030.\nNow let me comment on the financing plan that supports this growth and the new capital plan. As we have consistently guided you we expect any incremental capital will be funded with 50% equity content. When compared to the prior plan, we added $8.5 billion of capital and about $4 billion of incremental equity content equally split between incremental common equity and hybrid or icon securities.\nSo here are the details of the funding sources. Over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to be approximately $21 billion, funding more than half of our cash needs. Approximately $14 billion of the funding is expected to come from incremental debt, and the remaining cash is expected to be funded by approximately $5 billion of common equity.\nAs a reminder, the cadence of common equity is a function of capital expenditures. For 2026, we expect common equity issuances to be between $900 million to $1.1 billion.\nIn closing, as Scott discussed previously, the strong economic development and low growth in Wisconsin is the foundation of our new 5-year plan. With the asset base forecasted to grow at 11.3% a year on average, we expect to nearly double our asset base over the next 5 years.\nIt's important to note that the bespoke assets allocated to our very large customers, are projected to represent 14% of our total asset base by 2030. As a reminder, the tariff is designed so these customers pay their fair share are not being subsidized by other customers. We're very excited about our company's future and the investment opportunities ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Finally, a quick reminder about the dividend. As usual, I expect we'll provide our 2026 dividend plan and earnings guidance in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we're currently positioned well within that range. We expect to grow the dividend at a rate of 6.5% to 7% and consistent with our past practice.\nOverall, we're optimistic about our 5-year plan and the longer-term outlook. I think we're in the early stages of the growth cycle as we continue to see opportunities in economic development in our region, including data centers. We look forward to providing additional details on our plan in just over a week at the EEI conference.\nOperator, we are now ready for questions-and-answer portion of the call."

And it is now my pleasure to introduce Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2025. Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.76 a share for the second quarter of 2025. We remain on track to deliver another year of strong results in line with our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.17 to $5.27 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. We continue to target a 6.5% to 7% long-term compound annual earnings growth rate supported by a robust capital plan and strong economic growth in our region.\nIn Wisconsin, the unemployment rate stands at 3.2% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're continuing to see strong and significant economic development in our region, especially along the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago. Just last month, Yaskawa, one of the world's largest manufacturers of industrial products and robotics announced it's moving from the company's U.S. headquarters to Wisconsin and consolidating manufacturing operations here.\nThe company stated it plans to invest approximately $180 million to build this new campus, which is expected to create 700 jobs. Work continues on Microsoft's data center campus south of Milwaukee. We remain confident in our 5-year demand growth forecast of 1.8 gigawatts to serve the I-94 corridor. In addition, we're seeing progress for a large data center development just north of Milwaukee, Vantage Data centers signed on to develop approximately 1,900 acres. While the project is in the early stages, the site has the potential to reach 3.5 gigawatts of demand over time. As a reminder, this project is not included in our current demand forecast. These are just samples of the economic growth that we are seeing in our region. And just recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that ADP ranked Milwaukee second among metro areas in the U.S. for college graduates landing jobs.\nTurning to our capital plan. During the second quarter, we continued to move forward on major projects. As you know, it's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $28 billion in supporting economic growth and reliability. It's based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. Many of you have asked about the potential impact of the one big beautiful bill act. On the wind and solar front, we are actively working on completing the safe harboring of the renewable projects in our 5-year capital plan under the current treasury guidance.\nWe are awaiting further guidance from the Treasury department to reflect the executive order issued in early July. As these rules become available, we will, of course, continue to work with our developers to achieve safe harbor. Now let me give you an update on projects currently underway. In May, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin unanimously approved our applications to build modern, efficient, natural gas generation and storage. We have started construction on 1,100 megawatts of simple-cycle combustion turbines with an expected investment of $1.2 billion. These are located at our Oak Creek power plant site.\nAlso, near our existing Paris generation station, we plan to invest approximately $300 million for 128 megawatts of rice [indiscernible] generation. To support the Oak Creek site, just this month, we received verbal approval to build a 2 Bcf storage facility for liquefied natural gas. We expect the investment is approximately $456 million to complete this LNG facility by the end of 2027. These are critical projects are part of our all of the above approach to support reliable and affordable energy for our customers. To that end, we announced in June that we plan to extend the operating lives of unit 7 and 8 of our Oak Creek plant through 2026.\nThese are coal units that continue to provide essential capacity at times of high energy demand on the hottest and coldest days of the year. In addition, we expect it will be needed to meet tightened energy supply requirements in the Midwest power market. Progress continues on our renewable projects as well. In June, the battery portion of the Paris Solar Battery Park came online, providing 110 megawatts of storage. This is Wisconsin's first large-scale battery storage projects. As a reminder, we are the 90% owner.\nOverall, we are confident in our ability to execute on our capital plan. Now turning to the regulatory front. We currently have no active rate cases. In Wisconsin, our very large customer, or VLC tariff remains at the Public Service Commission for review. As we discussed last quarter, the tariff is designed to meet the needs of our very large load customers while protecting all of our other customers. The tariff would provide for a fixed return on equity of 10.48% and an equity ratio of 57%.\nThe terms of the agreement are 20 years for wind and solar and the depreciable lives for natural gas and battery storage assets. We work with our very large customers in designing the tariff, including the financial parameters, and we believe the tariff is a key component to help make Wisconsin a prime spot for data center investments. We expect a commission decision by the second quarter of next year. In Chicago, we are actively mapping out engineering and permitting plans and coordinating with the city for our pipe replacement program. Recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission directed us to focus on retiring all cast iron and ductile iron pipe with a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035.\nWe expect that approximately 1,100 miles of older pipe will be needed to be replaced. While planning is underway, our work continues. In fact, this April, we retired the oldest pipe in the system, a gas main that had been in service since 1861.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financials.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Scott. Our second quarter 2025 earnings of $0.76 per share reflects a $0.09 increase compared to the second quarter of 2024. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.16 higher versus the second quarter of 2024. Weather positively impacted quarter-over-quarter earnings by approximately $0.04. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 favorable impact in the second quarter of 2025 and compared to a $0.02 negative impact in the second quarter of 2024.\nRate-based growth contributed $0.12 more to earnings. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, tax and other items added another $0.07. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.05 from higher depreciation and amortization expense and $0.02 from higher day-to-day O&M. As shared before, we still expect for O&M expense to grow 8% to 10% for the full year when compared to actual O&M in 2024.\nAs a reminder, this year-over-year growth is largely driven by a few factors, including our continued focus on commission-approved vegetation management, new assets placed in service and measures we took last year to offset the mild weather impact. And let me also give you some color on our weather-normal retail electric delivery. Excluding the iron ore mine, compared to the second quarter of 2024, we saw a 1.1% growth in retail electric deliveries, led by the large commercial and industrial segment, which grew 1.9% quarter-over-quarter.\nThe residential and small commercial and industrial segments grew 0.4% and 1%, respectively, when compared to the second quarter of last year. Overall, we are on track for our annual growth forecast. Remember, we expect our annual electric sales growth to be 4.5% to 5% for the period 2027 through 2029.\nTurning to American Transmission Company, capital investment growth contributed an incremental $0.01 to Q2 earnings compared to 2024. And at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings decreased $0.03 in the second quarter of '25 compared to the second quarter of '24. Higher production tax credits were more than offset by other factors including a loss from storm damage recognized in the second quarter of 2025.\nNext, you'll see that earnings from the Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.03 driven by higher interest expense. In terms of common equity, we issued about $425 million through the first half of this year via our ATM program as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. We are on track to issue a total of $700 million to $800 million for this year. This is part of the $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion total common equity we expect to issue through 2029 to finance the capital investment.\nConsistent with what we shared before, as we refresh our capital plan this fall, we continue to expect any incremental capital will be funded with 50% equity content. Finally, let me comment on guidance. As Scott mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.17 to $5.27 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year.\nWe are also reaffirming our long-term EPS CAGR of 6.5% to 7%. For the third quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.74 to $0.80 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. We look forward to updating you in the fall as we refresh our capital and financing plan.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Finally, a quick reminder about the dividend. Our annualized dividend stands at $3.57 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're tracking in that range now and expect the dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Overall, we're optimistic about continued growth in our region and our company's future. .\nOperator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2025 earnings of $2.27 a share. We're off to a solid start to the year. We remain laser focused on reliability, financial discipline and customer satisfaction. And we're on track to deliver another year of strong results in line with our 2025 earnings guidance by $5.17 to $5.27 a share.\nThis, of course, assumes normal weather going forward. We continue to target 5% to 7% long-term compound annual growth rate, supported by a robust capital plan, driven by strong Epic growth in our region. In Wisconsin, the unemployment rate stands at 3.2%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're continuing to see significant economic development along the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago.\nMicrosoft is making good progress on this large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. Work has continued in the first phase of the project, and we have confidence in our 5-year forecast of 1.8 gigawatts of demand growth in Southeastern Wisconsin. As you recall from last quarter, just in the north of Milwaukee, Cloverleaf has announced plans to develop approximately 1,700 acres for another large data center campus.\nCloverleaf has projected at least 1 gigawatt of electric demand for this development. We have not incorporated any of this investment related to Cloverleaf in our capital plan just yet. So stay tuned for the updated capital plan on our third quarter earnings call. And there is other notable growth in Wisconsin.\nAs a reminder, Eli Lilly has announced a $3 billion end of its manufacturing facility in Wisconsin. And just recently, Uline announced another expansion in Southeast Wisconsin. The company plans to build a 1.2 million square foot warehouse and distribution facility. We're also off to a strong start on our current capital plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $28 billion dedicated to economic growth and reliability. As we've discussed, it's based on projects that are low risk and highly executable.\nOn the tariff front, we're evaluating the impacts of tariffs on our supply chain and capital plan. For our $28 billion capital plan, we estimate the tariff exposure is approximately 2% to 3% overall. As you can expect, we are actively engaged to mitigate efforts and mitigation efforts through our contracts and various suppliers.\nFortunately, we have diversity in our business mix, capital plan and supply chain that should help to mitigate the overall effects on our customers. Our company has successfully navigated past periods of uncertainty and challenges, and you can certainly expect us to aim to do the same for this current environment.\nNow let me give you a few updates on our projects. In early March, the Darien solar project went into service. This adds 225 megawatts of renewable generation to our regulated portfolio with an investment of approximately $427 million. And currently, we have 2 solar projects in construction phase, Cash Kanan, a 300-megawatt project in Southern Wisconsin and Renegade a 100-megawatt project in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\nWe expect both of these projects to be placed into service next year. In addition, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission has approved our purchase of 90% of the high noon solar and battery project for approximately $883 million. Construction is expected to be completed in 2027. Of course, we are closely monitoring the federal developments related to the inflation Reduction Act, and we're actively seeking to safe harbor the projects in our capital plan.\nAt WEC infrastructure, we closed on the Harden 3 solar projects in February. We invested at approximately $406 billion for 90% ownership of the project which has a total capacity of 250 megawatts. As a reminder, this project fulfills our 5-year planned investment at WEC Infrastructure. Overall, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on our capital plan.\nNow turning to the regulatory front. As a reminder, we currently have no active rate cases. In Wisconsin, at the end of March, we filed a new tariff proposal with the Public Service Commission to accommodate the economic growth we've discussed. The proposed very large customer, or VLC tariff, would meet the needs of our very large load customers while protecting all of our other customers.\nOur proposal would apply to customers with 500 megawatts or more of forecasted new load. The customer commits a subscribing to a portion of one or more dedicated generation resources. The terms of the agreements are 20 years for wind and solar and the depreciable lays for natural gas and battery storage assets.\nAs filed, the [indiscernible] for a fixed return on equity of 10.48% and an equity ratio of 57%. In addition, there are several other charges these customers are responsible for, administrative charges, energy charges, transmission charges and distribution charges. The proposed tariff is designed so that no cost to serve these very large customers would be subsidized by or shifted to other customers.\nWe work with these large customers in the design of the tariff to include the financial parameters. We believe this tariff is a key component to help make Wisconsin a prime spot for data center investments. We expect the decision by the commission by the second quarter of next year.\nIn Illinois, we received the Illinois Comverse Commission's decision on our safety modernization program in February. The commission lifted the pause on our work and directed Peoples Gas to focus on replacing all cast iron and ductaironpipe that is a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035.\nThe Commission also directed its staff to appoint a safety monitor to provide oversight by July of this year. Like other capital projects, our investments in pipe replacement will be reviewed in future rate proceedings. Under this pipe replacement program, approximately 1,100 miles of older pipe some dating back to the mid-1800s will need to be replaced.\nWe are currently developing engineering plans to execute the order. We will factor the updated pipeline replacement program capital into our fall update. Next up, Xia will provide more details on our financials.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Scott. Our first quarter 2025 earnings of $2.27 per share reflects a $0.30 increase compared to the first quarter of 2024. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.28 higher versus the first quarter of 2024. Weather positively impacted quarter-over-quarter earnings by approximately $0.18. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.01 positive impact in the first quarter of 2025 compared to a $0.17 negative impact in the first quarter of 2024.\nRecall that our 2024 winter was the warmest in Wisconsin history on record. Rate-based growth contributed $0.20 more to earnings. This was driven primarily by the Wisconsin rate review outcome that was effective on January 1, 2025. Tax and other items added another $0.04. These positive drivers were partially offset by a total of $0.14 from O&M expense, depreciation and amortization and timing of fuel expense.\nOur day-to-day O&M for the year is still expected to grow 8% to 10% when compared to actual O&M in 2024. As a reminder, this year-over-year growth is largely driven by a few factors. Our continued focus on commission-approved vegetation management, new assets coming online and measures we took last year to offset the mild weather impact. And let me give you some color on our weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine.\n[indiscernible] to last Q1 and adjusting for leap year, we saw 7% growth this quarter, led by the large commercial and industrial class, which grew 2.3% in the quarter. This is right in line with our forecast. Remember, we expect our weather-normal annual electric sales growth to reach 4.5% to 5% starting in 2027 and we're on track to reach that over the next couple of years.\nAt American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.02 compared to the first quarter of '24. $0.01 was related to continued capital investment and the other $0.01 is related to a modest gain from selling and interest has 15 transmission line in California in the first quarter of this year.\nTurning to our Energy Infrastructure segment. Earnings increased $0.05 in the first quarter of '25 compared to the first quarter of 2024, largely from higher production tax credits. Remember, we completed our investment in the Maple flats and Delilah solar projects in the fourth quarter of 2024 as well as the Hearten3 solar project this February.\nNext, you'll see that earnings from the Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.03. This was driven by higher interest expense, partially offset by favorable tax timing and other items. Finally, there was $0.02 of dilution primarily associated with our common equity issuances. We issued about $200 million in 2024 and about $140 million in Q1 this year.\nIncluding the Q1 issuances, as a reminder, we expect to raise a total of $700 million to $800 million of common equity in 2025 via our ATM program as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. This is a part of the $2.7 billion to $3.2 billion total common equity we expect to issue through 2029 to finance the capital investment.\nAs we refresh our capital plan this fall, we continue to expect any incremental capital will be funded with 50% equity content. Finally, let me comment on earnings guidance. As Scott mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2025 earnings guidance of $5. 17 and to $5.27 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. We are also reaffirming our long-term EPS CAGR of 6.5% to 7%. For the second quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.63 to $0.69 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Now as you may recall, our Board at its January meeting increased the dividend by 6.9%. This marks the 22nd consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. Overall, we're optimistic about continued growth in our region and our company's growth and future. Operator, we are now ready for question-and-answer portion of the call."

The company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the materials posted on its website for this conference call.\nAnd now it is my pleasure to introduce Scott Lauber, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2024. Here with me are Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2024 adjusted earnings of $4.88 a share. I am pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction to financial performance, to steady execution of our capital plan. In just a few minutes, Xia will provide more details on our financial results and outlook.\nFor 2025 earnings, recall that in early December, we provided our guidance in the range of $5.17 to $5.27 a share. We continue to target a 6.5% to 7% long-term compound annual growth rate. We have a robust capital plan driven by strong economic growth in our region.\nThe Wisconsin unemployment rate stands at 3%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. And as we discussed, there have been many exciting developments along the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago.\nIn December, less than a year after Eli Lilly acquired a facility in Pleasant Prairie, the pharmaceutical company announced plans for a $3 billion expansion. Eli Lilly predicts the expansion will add 750 highly skilled jobs in addition to 2,000 construction jobs to complete the project.\nMicrosoft is making good progress on its large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin. Work continues on the first phase of the project. Microsoft took a short pause on construction to evaluate the technical design of the second area. That pause was lifted and work has resumed. Microsoft is still reviewing designs for the third area.\nMicrosoft reports that the potential design changes have not affected plans to invest $3.3 billion in the project by the end of 2026, and we do not anticipate these changes will impact our capital plan or demand growth projections over the next 5 years. In fact, Microsoft purchased an additional 240 acres of land just last week for another data center development. We're delighted that Microsoft continues to expand its commitment to the Milwaukee region.\nAlso in January, Cloverleaf announced plans to develop approximately 1,700 acres in Port Washington, just north of Milwaukee, for another large data center campus. Cloverleaf projects that construction could start this fall. In the initial announcement, Cloverleaf expects the load to be 1 gigawatt. This development is very -- in the very early stages, but all of this load is incremental to our current plan. So we're off to a strong start to the year with great economic prospects.\nTo serve a growing economy, of course, we need to continue investing in our generation facility and infrastructure. Our $28 billion 5-year capital plan, which we updated in October, is the largest in our history. A balanced generation mix is a significant focus for our electric utilities. In the renewable area, over the next 5 years, we have 4,300 megawatts planned for our expected investment of $9.1 billion. We wrapped up 2024 by bringing the Paris Solar Park into service. With an investment of approximately $319 million, it has added 180 megawatts of solar capacity for our Wisconsin utility customers. Next up on our schedule, we expect the 225-megawatt Darian Solar Park to go into service later this year.\nNatural gas also continues to be a critical resource for reliable service. We expect the Wisconsin Commission to make rulings on several major project filings throughout the year. That includes 1,200 megawatts of efficient natural gas generation as well as 33-mile lateral and 2 Bcf of liquefied natural gas storage.\nTurning to our WEC Infrastructure business. The Delilah I and Maple Flats solar project went online at the end of last year. Between those 2 facilities, we invested approximately $890 million or 90% ownership of 550 megawatts of capacity. And we expect to close on the Harden 3 projects during the first quarter. We plan to invest approximately $407 million for 90% ownership interest of the project, which has a total capacity of 250 megawatts. As a reminder, this project fulfills our 5-year planned investment at WEC Infrastructure.\nRegarding transmission, as you saw in January, MISO announced capital investments on tranche 2.1. We expect ATC to be assigned approximately $2 billion of that tranche with an additional opportunity through the right of first refusal or competitive bid of up to $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. As you know, we own 60% of ATC. Overall, we have a lot of confidence in our ability to execute on our capital plan and continue our growth trajectory.\nNow turning to the regulatory front. I am pleased to report that we currently have no planned or active rate cases. As you know, the Wisconsin Commission finalized their written orders for test year 2025 and 2026. Consistent with prior disclosures, the commission maintained a 53% financial equity layer and a 9.8% return on equity for our Wisconsin utilities.\nIn Illinois, we remain actively engaged in 2 proceedings of note. One of these is evaluating the future of natural gas in Illinois. Currently, it's scheduled to extend into 2026. The other, a review of our Safety Modernization Program, is close to its conclusion. We made our final oral arguments before the Commerce Commission last week and expect a decision this quarter.\nNext up, Xia will provide more details on our financials.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Scott. Turning now to earnings. Our 2024 adjusted earnings were $4.88 per share, an increase of $0.25 per share over 2023 adjusted earnings. In 2024, we experienced the warmest winter on record. The estimated weather headwind was $0.25 per share when compared to normal conditions. We were able to offset this by implementing a variety of initiatives, such as O&M and fuel management as well as tax and financing activities. This focus on execution was key for delivering our adjusted EPS near the top end of the earnings guidance.\nNow let's take a closer look at our year-over-year variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of adjusted full year results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Weather decreased earnings year-over-year by an estimated $0.05 per share. This weather impact, along with a total of $0.38 negative impact related to increases in depreciation and amortization, day-to-day O&M and interest expense, were more than offset by $0.49 of total positive variances from rate base growth, fuel, tax and other. All in all, the utility operations grew $0.06 year-over-year.\nNow before I discuss earnings comparison at the other segments, let me briefly comment on O&M and sales. Remember that originally, we guided 2024 total company day-to-day O&M to be 6% to 7% higher compared to 2023 largely driven by assets that were placed in service and normal inflation. As you recall, several of the assets in WEC Infrastructure had a delayed in-service until the end of the year. This, in combination with the initiatives we took after the mild first quarter, helped us achieve an overall increase of 2% over 2023. That is considerably lower than the original guidance.\nRegarding our weather-normal sales for 2024, as you can see on Pages 13 and 14 in our earnings package, both retail electric and natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat year-over-year. For 2025, we're projecting weather-normal retail electric sales in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, to grow 0.7%; and retail gas sales in Wisconsin excluding power generation to grow 1.9% from the 2024 level.\nNow back to our earnings comparison. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2023. We recognized $0.05 in Q4 from the FERC order that resolved certain MISO ROE complaints and set the ROE at 10.48%. The remaining $0.02 improvement in ATC earnings was driven by continued capital investment.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment grew $0.13 in 2024 compared to 2023. $0.03 were driven by additional investment in our Power the Future plans, and the remaining $0.10 went to WEC Infrastructure.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased to $0.01. Higher interest expense was substantially offset by tax and other items. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.25 per share on an adjusted basis in 2024.\nNext, let's look at our earnings guidance. For the first quarter this year, we project to earn in the range of $2.13 per share to $2.23 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember, last year, we earned $1.97 per share in the first quarter. And as Scott stated, for the full year 2025, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $5.17 to $5.27 per share.\nFinally, some comments on financing. In 2024, we successfully executed over $4.5 billion of external funding, including almost $200 million of common equity. In 2025, consistent with previous disclosures, we expect to issue $700 million to $800 million of common equity via our ATM program as well as the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans. Including this, as a reminder, total common equity financing over the next 5 years is still expected to be between $2.7 billion and $3.2 billion.\nGoing forward, to support the region's strong economic growth and our capital investment, we continue to expect any incremental capital will be funded with 50% equity content. Overall, we are confident in our long-term EPS growth CAGR of 6.5% to 7%.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Now as you may have seen, our Board in its January meeting increased the dividend by 6.9% to an annualized $3.57 per share. This will mark the 22nd consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends. Overall, we are on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.\nOperator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. [Operator Instructions] In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted on wecenergygroup.com.

Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2024. Here with me today are Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2024 earnings of $0.67 per share.\nWe're firmly on track to meet the full year 2024 guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the balance of the year. We continue to see strong foundational growth in our regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 2.9%, continuing a long-running trend below the national average. The pipeline of economic activity is particularly strong in what we call the I-94 corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago.\nFor example, just last month, WestRock broke ground on a new facility at the former site of our retired power plants. WestRock is a leading company in paper and packaging solutions with 50,000 employees and 300 plants worldwide. The company called the cutting-edge facility, a super plant, stating it will be one of their largest and most advanced plants. And Microsoft is making good progress on the construction of a large data center complex in Southeast Wisconsin.\nIn May, Microsoft announced a broad investment package to strengthen our region as a hub for AI economic activity, innovation and job creation. These investments include a planned $3.3 billion to be spent in cloud computing and AI infrastructure between now and the end of 2026. Microsoft has stated that it expects to bring 2,300 construction jobs to the area by 2025 and 2,000 permanent jobs over time.\nThese developments highlight the strength and the potential of our local economy and underscores the need for the investments in our capital plan. During the second quarter, we continued to move forward on major projects in our capital plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth.\nAs we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. At the end of May, we closed on our second option at West Riverside Energy Center for $100 million. This adds 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. You'll recall that last year, we discussed several filings or last quarter, we discussed several filings for major projects to support economic growth and reliability in Wisconsin.\nThis includes approximately 1,200 megawatts of efficient natural gas generation at our Paris and Oak Creek sites, as well as 2 billion cubic foot liquified natural gas storage facility and a 33-mile gas lateral to serve Oak Creek site. In total, these projects combined represent $2.1 billion of investment. Our proposals were submitted to the Wisconsin Commission in April, and we expect the decision in approximately a year. Also under review, we filed an application in February to purchase a 90% ownership interest in high noon solar energy center in Southern Wisconsin.\nWith an expected investment of approximately $580 million the facility is expected to provide 300 megawatts of solar generation. We have asked the commission to make a decision before the end of the year. As a reminder, we expect these investments to earn AFUDC during the construction period after commission approval. And in our WEC Infrastructure segment, the Delilah One Solar project is now expected to go into service at the end of the year, delayed from June due to a weather event.\nWe plan to invest approximately $460 million for a 90% ownership interest in this project in Northeast Texas, and we still expect our Maple Flak Solar Project to be in service by the end of the year. As you recall, we're investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. We reallocated away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million in our 5-year capital plan.\nOverall, our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis. We're also on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan. And as usual, we expect to share the details with you in the fall. Now I have a few updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test year 2025 and 2026 on April 12.\nOur request focused on addressing 3 major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity, second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new generation and distribution projects; and lastly, continue the transition from coal generation to renewables and natural gas.\nCommission staff and intervener testimony is scheduled for August 21, we expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. We have smaller rate reviews and progress at Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. We also expect decisions on these reviews by the end of the year. And in Illinois, we've been engaged in 3 dockets. The Illinois Commerce Commission issued its decision on the first of these, a limited rehearing of the commission's rate order for Peoples Gas at the end of May.\nThe commission had agreed to reconsider our request to restore $145 million for safety modernization program in 2024. This is mostly related to emergency work unfinished projects and work driven by public entities like the city of Chicago. The commission granted $28.5 billion concentrating on what they deemed emergency work. We have appealed this decision to the Illinois Appellate Court along with other items in the rate order, including the commission's previous disallowance of investments in new service centers.\nWe are also actively involved in 2 remaining dockets. One is the review of the safety modernization program, staff and intervener rebuttal testimony are expected by August 21, and with a commission decision expected in the first quarter of 2025. The other docket is the evaluation of the future of natural gas in Illinois, which is expected to conclude in about a year.\nOf course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments. Across our business, we continue to make good progress towards our goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In May, we retired units 5 and 6 at our Oak Creek power plant. Together, those made up over 500 megawatts of coal-fired generation. Including these units since 2018, we've retired nearly 2,500 megawatts of older fossil fuel generation.\nFinally, a quick reminder about the dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're tracking in that range now and expect the dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth of our earnings per share. Now I'll turn it to Xia to provide you more details on our financial results and our guidance for the third quarter.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Scott. We earned $0.67 a share for the second quarter. While this was a decrease of $0.25 quarter-over-quarter, we exceeded our Q4 guidance -- Q2 guidance range of $0.60 to $0.64 a share driven by favorable O&M and financing compared to guidance. As Scott indicated, we are on track to meet our 2024 earnings guidance. As I reminded you on the last couple of calls with the redesign changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are now more concentrated in the first and 4 quarters when natural gas usage is the highest.\nThis earnings shift has impacted our second quarter and will impact our Q3 guidance, which I will discuss in a few minutes. Now let's look at our quarter-over-quarter variances. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Starting with our utility operations, earnings were $0.19 lower compared to the second quarter of 2023 as a result of higher O&M, fuel, depreciation and amortization, interest and other expenses.\nA couple of drivers for the day-to-day O&M variants are worth noting. One, we experienced higher storm costs in the current quarter compared to Q2 last year. And two, we benefited in Q2 last year from a land sale at a retired plant site in Wisconsin. Looking ahead, I now expect overall day-to-day O&M in 2024 to be 2% to 3% higher compared to 2023. This is a 4% improvement compared to our initial expectation due to our continued O&M savings initiatives that we expect to realize late this year.\nThe impact of weather was flat for the quarter. Compared to normal conditions, we estimate that weather had a $0.02 negative impact for the second quarter in both 2023 and 2024. Our [indiscernible] electric sales in Wisconsin are relatively flat quarter-over-quarter and are overall in line with our forecast.\nLooking at ATC, continued capital investments contributed an incremental $0.01 to Q2 earnings compared to 2023. And in our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings improved $0.02 in the second quarter of 24% compared to the second quarter of '23, driven partially by higher production tax credit at WEC infrastructure. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.09 as a result of the impact of tax timing and higher interest expense.\nNow turning to guidance. For the third quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.68 to $0.70 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, it also accounts for the shift in Illinois revenue recognition pattern. Our third quarter 2023 earnings were $1 a share. Once again, we are reaffirming our 2024 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year.\nBefore I turn back to Scott, let me quickly remind you that we continue to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans to issue common equity. Also, as we said before, we plan to set up an ATM program. Overall, we still project that our common equity issuance will be up to $200 million for 2024.\nPost 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital spending ratably with approximately $500 million expected per year in the current plan. We look forward to updating you in the fall as we refresh our capital and financing plan. With that, I'll turn it back to Scott.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Xia. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nLive from the [indiscernible]. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2024. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2024 earnings of $1.97 a share. Throughout the warmest winter in Wisconsin history, we remain laser-focused on financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction and we're confident that we can deliver another year of strong results in line with our guidance for 2024. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share for the full year. This, of course, assumes normal weather as always going forward.\nSwitching gears now. We're off to a strong start moving forward with our ESG progress plan. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $23.7 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. In the past few weeks alone, we filed with the Wisconsin Commission more than $2 billion of projects that are needed to meet customer demand across the region. In addition, just a few days ago, we announced that we plan to purchase a 90% ownership interest in the [ Delila 1 ] solar project. [ Delila ] is a 300-megawatt solar park in Northeast Texas. It will be the next addition to our WEC Infrastructure segment. We expect to close on [ Delala ] with an investment of $459 million when the project goes into service, and that's currently expected by the end of June.\nSince the beginning of the year, we also purchased an additional 10% interest in the Samson Solar project, now that's part of the Samson and [ Delala ] development in Northeast Texas. And we plan to increase our ownership in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center from 80% to 90%. And just as a reminder, Maple Flats is under development in South Central Illinois. It has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for all the energy it will produce. The project should be in service by the end of this year.\nSo to sum it up, with [ Delila ] with the increase in ownership of Samson and Maple Flats, we'll be investing an additional $560 million this year in our Infrastructure segment. As you recall, we're reallocating away from our operations in Illinois a total of $800 million over the 5-year period 2024 through 2028. These high-quality 0 carbon projects clearly go a long way toward achieving that goal. And each of these projects meets our strict financial criteria.\nOverall, the building blocks of our capital plan show even stronger growth in our regulated electric business. And our plan fully supports our long-term earnings growth rate which we project to be in the 6.5% to 7% range on a compound average annual basis.\nAnd now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. In fact, Wisconsin recently reached a new record for employment, more people working than at any other time in state history and that includes a record folks for the number of construction jobs. That's a great sign of the growth and the potential we're seeing, particularly in what we call the [ I-94 ] corridor.\nTo give you just one example of the new economic activity in the region. Just a few weeks ago, electronic components that are used in fiber broadband networks began rolling off the assembly line at a state-of-the-art facility developed by [ Sanmina ] Corporation. These components help form the backbone for high-speed Internet service.\nAnd we want to welcome [ Eli ] Lilly to our neighborhood. The Pharmaceutical giant is purchasing a new production facility, again, in the I-94 corridor. And speaking of growth, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead on the construction of a massive data center complex in the I-94 corridor south of Milwaukee. In fact, in the next few weeks, Microsoft is planning an event here in the Milwaukee area to discuss its plans for new investments in Wisconsin. So stay tuned.\nAnd looking broadly across the landscape, I can tell you that the number of prospects looking at expanding or locating in the Milwaukee 7 region is stronger literally than at any time in the past 2 decades. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. In Wisconsin, we filed new rate reviews for test years 2025 and 2026 on April 12. Our request focus on addressing 3 major areas of need. First, improving reliability and reducing outages from increased storm activity; second, supporting Wisconsin's economic growth and job creation through investments in new generation and distribution projects; and lastly, complying with the new EPA mission rules by continuing the transition from coal generation, renewables and natural gas.\nWe expect the decision by the end of the year with new rates effective January 1, 2025. Last month, we submitted filings to the Wisconsin Commission for significant developments to support our electric generation business. Our proposed projects include 2 new sources of natural gas generation. The first request is for approval to construct 1,100 megawatts of modern [ sipulcycle ] combustion turbines at our existing Oak Creek power plant site. The expected investment is $1.2 billion.\nTo support that generation, we are proposing to build a 33-mile lateral with an expected investment of approximately $180 million. This lateral would provide firm reliability of natural gas to the Oak Creek site for those units as well as our [ Power the Future ] units that we're converting to natural gas. And to help to share reliability, we are proposing a new storage facility at Oak Creek, with a planned investment of approximately $460 million. This facility would have the capacity to store 2 billion cubic feet a liquefied natural gas to support both our generation and our gas distribution system.\nIn addition, we requested approval to add 128 megawatts of state-of-the-art generation using reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, race units. We expect to invest approximately $280 million in that project near our Paris Generation Station. As a reminder, these investments are expected to earn AFUDC during the construction period.\nWe also have smaller rate reviews in progress at our 2 Michigan utilities. Michigan Gas Utilities and Upper Michigan Energy Resources. These applications are primarily driven by our capital investments supporting reliability and safety. And you recall our discussion last quarter on the recent developments in Illinois. There are 3 dockets we're actively engaged in at this time.\nFirst, the Illinois Commission granted us a limited rehearing focused on the request to restore $145 million for the safety modernization program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that was in progress and work driven by public entities like the City of Chicago. This limited rehearing is now underway, and we expect to receive a final commission order by June 1.\nThe other 2 outstanding dockets are expected to span at least a year, and we are actively involved. One is a full review of the safety modernization program and the other is an evaluation of the future of gas in Illinois. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nNow turning to our capital plan. We're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. Our Zona LNG storage facility is now in service, this additional 1 Bcf of storage will be necessary during the extreme weather events we see here in Wisconsin. Also, the Wisconsin Commission has approved our purchase of 100 megawatts of additional capacity at West Riverside Energy Center. We expect to invest approximately $100 million to add this capacity to our electric business in the second quarter.\nAt the same time, we're continuing the efforts to phase out older, less efficient coal generation. In fact, I'm happy to report that we're on track to retire Unit 5 and 6 of our Oak Creek power plant later this month. These changes support our goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It's a busy and strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable, and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much. Now as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7%. This marks, ladies and gentlemen, the 21st consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future. Next up, Xia will provide us with more details on our financial results for the quarter and our guidance for Q #2. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Gale. Our 2024 1st quarter earnings of $1.97 per share increased $0.36 per share compared to the first quarter of 2023. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Our earnings were $0.28 higher compared to the first quarter of 2023. Weather had an estimated $0.07 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. As noted earlier, this past winter was the warmest in Wisconsin history. The milder weather, along with $0.09 from higher depreciation and amortization, interest expense and day-to-day O&M expense were more than offset by the following positive variances.\nTiming of fuel expense was a $0.09 increase quarter-over-quarter. Our fuel was in a positive recovery position at the end of Q1 this year, compared to an under-recovered position at the end of Q1 last year. And rate base growth contributed $0.35 to earnings quarter-over-quarter. This includes the rate increases from Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan.\nOne thing to note, as I mentioned on our year-end call, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, base revenues are even more concentrated in the first and fourth quarters when natural gas usage is the highest and this earnings shift is a significant driver for the quarter. Looking ahead, we'll see the opposite shift in Q2 and Q3.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the Other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather normal sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. While weather was historically mild in the quarter, our weather-normal gas and electric deliveries were both relatively flat and overall in line with our forecast. However, on the electric side, our residential and small commercial and industrial segments are currently ahead of forecast.\nNow at our Energy Infrastructure segment, earnings increased $0.02 in the first quarter of '24 compared to the first quarter of '23. Production tax credits were higher quarter-over-quarter resulting from production at our Samsung and Sapphire Sky renewable generation projects, both of which were acquired in February 2023. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment rose $0.06, primarily driven by timing of tax.\nIn closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 24 earnings guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we're implementing a variety of initiatives. For example, we now expect our '24 day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than '23 versus our previous expectation of 6% to 7% higher. The lion's share of the reduction is expected to come in the second half of the year.\nFor the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.60 to $0.64 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the second quarter last year. While the Q2 guidance range is lower, if you combine Q1 actual and Q2 guidance, we expect to be $0.04 to $0.08 ahead of the first quarter of '23. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nGreat. Thank you, Xia. And now a final note. We did some quick math this morning. In today marks the 87th time that I've had the privilege of hosting an analyst call, starting back in the day at Brand X and then continuing through the past 21 years here at WEC. Together, we've covered a lot of history and a ton of progress.\nI can tell you that your thoughtful questions and your thorough analysis have helped us to build and sustain a premier company on a mission that truly matters. And for that, I'm grateful. Going forward on these calls, you'll be hearing from Scott and Xia, they are ready, and it's their time to shine. And operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast [Operator Instructions] In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nBefore the conference call begins, please note that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to, in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. This call also will include non-GAAP financial information. The company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the materials posted on its website for this conference call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for calendar year 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. .\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2023 adjusted earnings of $4.63 a share. This excludes a onetime noncash charge of $0.41 a share. You may recall that the Illinois Commerce Commission in November, allowed the construction costs for the modern service centers and facilities that we built in Illinois to improve employee safety and productivity. We firmly believe that the investments were necessary and prudent. And at the appropriate time, we will appeal the decision in court.\nDespite the setback in Illinois, I'm pleased to report that we delivered another year of solid results on virtually every meaningful measure, from customer satisfaction to financial performance, to steady execution of our capital plan. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics for 2023 in just a few moments.\nTurning to other regulatory matters. The Wisconsin Commission approved our limited reopener filings in December. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And in Illinois, a limited rehearing has been scheduled for a portion of our Safety Modernization Program. As a reminder, the Illinois Commerce Commission ordered a pause in that program for at least 1 year. We've been systematically replacing old leaking cast iron pipes under the streets of Chicago. This long-running project is approximately 38% complete today.\nWe had planned to invest approximately $265 million in these safety upgrades, during 2024. Given the commission's order, we will not be carrying out the program as envisioned. We honestly do not believe that stopping the work is in the best interest of our Chicago customers. But we will have another opportunity to make our case in the coming months through this limited rehearing.\nIn addition, the Illinois Commission will open a new docket this month to examine the future of gas, across the state of Illinois. This review is expected to take at least 1 year to complete. Switching gears now. Let's look at the investment needs of our broader enterprise. We continue to refine our ESG progress plan, our road map, if you will, for the period 2024 through 2028. As you'd expect, we're lowering our planned capital investment in Illinois. But the bigger picture is strong and growing.\nAnd today, we're increasing our 5-year plan by $300 million. What was a $23.4 billion plan, the largest in our company's history, is now a 5-year plan totaling $23.7 billion. The increase is focused on 2 categories, electric distribution to support the strong economic growth we're seeing in Wisconsin and WEC Energy projects that are in our due diligence pipeline. That's our WEC infrastructure projects. In fact, we're in the final stage now of getting another major project for our infrastructure portfolio, a 300-megawatt solar investment for approximately $460 million.\nClosing and Commercial operation could take place in the second quarter of this year. We'll keep you informed. Overall, the building blocks of our updated capital plan clearly support our long-term growth rate. Growth from our 5-year plan on a compound average annual basis, remains in the 6.5% to 7% range. As always, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2023 guidance.\nHowever, we expect earnings for 2024 to come in at or below the current consensus estimate. The reason is simple, as we redeploy capital, at least temporarily away from Illinois, the majority of the quality projects we're investing in, will not be in service for the full year 2024. So for this year, for 2024, we project earnings to be in the range of $4.80 to $4.90 a share, and Xia will provide you with more detail in just a moment or 2.\nOne final but important point about our capital plan. As a percentage of the total enterprise, our regulated Electric business will be larger 5 years from now than it is today. Economic development, reliability and decarbonization are driving that growth. We plan to continue our investment in the infrastructure segment as well. But 5 years from now, we expect the Infrastructure segment will be only 6% of our asset base.\nAnd now turning to the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.3%. That continues a long-running trend below the national average. And as we've discussed, we're seeing some really exciting developments here in the state. You've heard about Microsoft's plans in the Wisconsin Innovation Park south of Milwaukee. That investment continues to build. Microsoft has now purchased a total of 1,345 acres of property and construction is already underway on a major data center complex.\nOf course, Microsoft didn't alone, in what we call the I-94 Corridor, companies like HARIBO and Uline are expanding their footprints as well. For example, Uline just announced plans for a third office building in Pleasant Prairie. Uline expects to complete construction by 2025, creating additional space for more than 700 workers. Uline, in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials to businesses throughout North America.\nAnd just last week, WestRock, a Fortune200 company that produces sustainable paper and packaging materials, announced plans to build a 587,000 square foot manufacturing facility on the former site of our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. These developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our 5-year ESG progress plan. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our regulatory calendar, our capital plan and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some more updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The reopener filings address recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service in 2023 and also this year. These are renewable facilities, RICE generation and LNG reliability investments.\nThe return on equity and the equity layer were not up for consideration, as part of this proceeding. In the coming months, we plan to file a new rate reviews in Wisconsin for test years 2025 and 2026. You heard from Gale on the latest developments in Illinois. The commission has granted us a limited rehearing focused on our request to rescore $134 million of Safety Modernization Program in 2024. This mostly relates to emergency work, work that is in progress and work driven by public entities like the city of Chicago.\nWe expect the commission to issue an order by June 1. Now turning to our updated capital plan. We have identified $300 million of additional capital investment compared to the initial version of our 5-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes, which are summarized for your reference in the slides we provided for today's call.\nMost notably, we have included several new investments in our Energy Infrastructure portfolio. We're continuing to take advantage of production tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act, while providing solid returns through long-term offtake agreements. We expect these projects to add approximately $800 million to our plant, and we're already on our way. Just last month, we closed on an incremental 10% ownership of the Samson Solar Farm, now in operation in Northern Texas. We now own 90% of the farm for a total investment of $280 million. And as Gale mentioned, we have another major project, solar project in their sites.\nWe also plan to increase investment in Wisconsin by $300 million, to better support economic development and reliability in the state. Offsetting these incremental investments, you will see a $800 million decrease in our planned spending on the Illinois Gas Delivery system over the 5-year period. This is driven by the regulatory order we received in November.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulated projects in support of affordable, reliable and clean energy. We continue to work toward our ambitious goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the end of 2023, we achieved a 54% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation, compared to 2005. That puts us well on our way toward a 80% reduction in target by the end of 2030, as we build our portfolio of low and no carbon generation.\nAnd the progress continues. The final panels of the Badger Hollow Solar Park are now in service, completing the largest solar project in Wisconsin history. As you'll recall, our Wiscansin utilities own a total of 200 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. The facility's first phase went online in December 2021 and the second phase wrapped up at the end of 2023. In addition, our Bluff Creek LNG storage facility is now on surface. Liquefied natural gas provides a solution to meet peak customer demand for heating, as well as gas supply needed for power generation. This storage will be necessary during extreme weather events, like we experienced in mid-January.\nI'm also pleased to announce that we have been using renewable natural gas in our distribution system. This replaces a portion of the traditional natural gas we deliver to customers, while contributing to our methane reduction goal. Our latest pilot project with EPRI and CMBlu Energy is also underway. And as you'll recall, this is testing a long-duration battery made with environmentally friendly materials. We look forward to sharing the results across the industry later this year. It's a strong start to the year. Our capital plan is robust and highly executable and we continue to focus on the fundamentals of the business. With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much. Now as you may have seen, our Board at this January meeting raised the quarterly dividend to $0.835 a share. That's an increase of $0.05 a share or 7%. This will mark the 21st consecutive year that our shareholders will be rewarded with higher dividends. The increase is consistent with our policy of paying out 65% to 70% of our earnings in dividends and underscores our confidence in delivering a bright, sustainable future.\nOne other quick note on our track record of dividend growth. We learned last week that WEC Energy is being added to S&P's High Dividend Aristocrat Index. This index is made up exclusively of companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. Next up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results, our financing plan and our 2024 guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Excluding the $0.41 per share noncash impairment charge in Illinois, our 2023 adjusted earnings per share were $4.63. Our earnings package includes a year-over-year comparison of results on Page 16. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Weather had an estimated 24% negative impact year-over-year. In fact, January, February and December of 2023 were the warmest on record, over the past 133 years. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.33 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset during the year.\nRate-based growth contributed $0.75 of positive variance year-over-year. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin and Minnesota utilities, as well as the rate increase for Peoples Gas that was effective December 1, 2023. Additionally, fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.14. Lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.10 improvement and taxes and other items benefited earnings by $0.04.\nRemember, we originally guided our 2023 total company day-to-day O&M to be 3% to 5% higher than 2022. Throughout the year, we were able to manage to a much tighter range. Our actual 2023 total company day-to-day O&M was only [ 0.6% ] higher than 2022.\nTurning now to Sales. You'll see the details on Page 12 of the earnings package. On a weather-normal basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 1% in 2023. The decrease was driven by our large commercial and industrial sales, which were down 3.3%. Meanwhile, Residential and Small Commercial and Industrial sales increased 0.2%, which were ahead of our forecast. Our sales projections for 2024 can be found on Pages 12 and 13 of the earnings package.\nOverall, we're projecting relatively flat Electric sales year-over-year and 0.8% growth in Gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.03 compared to 2022. Recall that last year, we reported a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. This was partially offset by a $0.02 improvement in earnings related to additional capital investment.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in '23, compared to 2022. This was mainly driven by an increase in production tax credits, Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and other segment decreased $0.29, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. Overall, we improved our performance by $0.18 per share on an adjusted basis in 2023.\nNow Gale and Scott have laid out our refreshed 5-year capital plan. In light of the $300 million increase to our capital plan, we have revised our funding plan accordingly. Consistent with our previous message, we're funding this increase with an even split between debt and equity. As you can see on Page 21 of the earnings package, we now expect to issue between $1.95 billion and $2.35 billion of common equity over the next 5 years.\nAs you can see on the chart, over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 64% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 8% from issuance of common equity. We have turned on new equity to satisfy the dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans, and we also expect to use at-the-market programs. Our common equity issuance is still projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024.\nPost 2024, our equity issuances will be tied to our capital plan, ratably at approximately $500 million a year. Finally, let's look at our earnings guidance. As Gale stated, for the full year 2024, we're providing guidance of $4.80 to $4.90 per share. In developing this guidance range, we took into consideration the expected loss of earnings from lower rate base in Illinois and timing of several projects under development.\nNow let me briefly discuss our day-to-day nonfuel O&M expense expectations. We expect our 2024 O&M to be 6% to 7% higher. Approximately 5% of the increase is driven by assets that were included in recent rate cases, Projects in the Infrastructure segment and extraordinary storm costs in January. The remaining O&M increase of 1% to 2% is largely driven by inflation, offset by operating efficiencies.\nLooking at the bigger picture, our O&M projection for 2024 is well below our actual O&M expenditures 8 years ago in 2016. In terms of first quarter 2024 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.96 per share to $2 per share. This forecast takes into account January weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Recall that we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter last year. There are a couple of main drivers for the quarter.\nOne, weather was unfavorable by $0.10 in Q1 last year. Of course, we're assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter this year. Two, with the rate design changes at Peoples Gas, under the latest commission order, we now expect base revenues will be concentrated in the first and fourth quarter heating months, when natural gas usage is the highest.\nCorrespondingly, we expect lower contributions from Peoples Gas in Q2 and Q3. We'll provide you with more details as the year progresses. As a reminder, however, in Illinois, we have a decoupling mechanism in place that mitigates the weather impact. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nXia, thank you very much, operator. We're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nFrom Americas Heartland, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2023. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2023 earnings of $1 a share. We delivered another solid quarter of growth, and we remain on track for a strong 2023. Our focus on executing the fundamentals of our business is creating real value for our customers and our stockholders.\nToday, we're also reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year. The range is $4.56 to -- I'm sorry, $4.58 to $4.62 a share with an expectation of completing the year in the upper half of the range. As always, this assumes normal weather through the final quarter of 2023.\nSwitching gears now, our big news for the day is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2024 through 2028. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $23.4 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $3.3 billion above our previous 5-year plan. That's more than a 16% increase. Several factors are driving the investment outlined in our updated ESG progress plan. The first of these factors is the economic growth we're seeing in the Milwaukee region, particularly in what we call the I-94 corridor in the southeastern part of the state, between Milwaukee and the Illinois State line. From data centers to pharmaceuticals to microinverters for solar panels, from even more gummy bears to massive new distribution and fulfillment centers. And this growth is also spanning new commercial and residential development in the region.\nIn our new 5-year plan, we expect our asset base to grow at an average rate of 8.1% a year. And as we fund this growth with an appropriate financing package, we project our earnings per share will continue to rise at a compound annual rate of 6.5% to 7% a year. As we've been discussing with you, our plan will include growth equity in the form of programmatic equity, including our dividend reinvestment plan, employee benefit plans and at the market plans. There is no need for block equity in the 5-year plan, and we'll start in 2024 by issuing $100 million to $200 million of new equity. Xia will provide you with more details on the financing plan in just a few minutes.\nI'd also like to point out a few other quick highlights for you. Over the next 5 years, we'll continue to make great progress in transforming our power generation fleet and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. In the plan, for example, we're making a significant commitment to new solar, wind and battery storage as well as modern efficient natural gas generation and LNG storage. In addition, we'll be adapting to the new seasonal capacity rules being put in place by MISO, mid-continent independent system operator. American Transmission Company will be adding needed transmission capability and to help assure energy security for our customers will continue to harden our distribution networks. On the environmental front, our plan still calls for reducing CO2 emissions from our power generation fleet by 80% by the end of 2030. And I'm pleased to report that assuming timely regulatory approvals, we now project a complete exit from coal 3 years earlier by the end of 2032. So the future is bright. The investment opportunity is long, strong and highly executable, and Scott will provide you with some specifics in just a few minutes.\nAnd now a brief look at the regional economy. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin stands at 3.1% continuing a long-running trend below the national average. And as we look inside the numbers, we see an encouraging upward trend in Wisconsin's labor force participation of this year. As I mentioned, growing companies are investing and expanding in our region. Microsoft is now moving dirt and moving full speed ahead to develop its new data center complex in that I-94 corridor we mentioned south of Milwaukee. And [ Arbo ] officially opened the doors of its new confectionery plant in July. Fast forward to today, and [ Inherabo ] is already planning to double the size of its production capability, adding more capacity for gummy bears, new technology and additional employees. And also south of Milwaukee, [ Uli ], plans to open a 1 million square foot facility this year, [ Uline ] in case you're not familiar with the name, is the leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials for businesses throughout North America and even more expansion land by [ Uline ] for 2025.\nThese developments highlight the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and underscore the need for the investments we're outlining in our 5-year plan.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more specifics on our capital projects, our regulatory calendar and our operational highlights. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some of the specifics on our capital plan. As Gale noted, we have identified $3.3 billion of additional investments compared to our last 5-year plan. I'll walk you through the changes. Between 2024 and 2028, we plan to increase our investment in renewables by $1.4 billion. With that, we expect to invest in 3,800 megawatts of new renewable capacity.\nIn the plan is a $1 billion increase in Transmission investment. This is our share of the ATC plan. Renewable projects and regional growth are among the driving factors. To support reliable service for our customers, we expect to spend an additional $1.3 billion on natural gas generation over the 5-year plan. This includes both combustion turbines and reciprocating internal combustion engines or rice units. We also have planned to invest an additional $800 million in liquefied natural gas capacity which will be used for electric generation and for natural gas operations on the coldest days of the year. With these important investments for our utilities, we have reduced our planned investment in our Energy Infrastructure segment. We'll be happy to share more details with you at the upcoming EEI conference.\nNow moving on to the regulatory front. As you recall, we expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission before the end of the year under limited reopener filings. We also have an update on our rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. Recently, the administrative law judge and the case issued a proposed order largely consistent with staff's recommendation. The order recommends a 9.83% return on equity at both utilities, and we expect a final decision by the end of November.\nAnd moving to the other states, I'm pleased to report that both the Minnesota and Michigan commissions have recently approved settlements on our rate reviews. Meanwhile, we're making progress on a number of regulated capital projects. As you recall, we closed on our first option at the West Riverside Energy Center earlier this year adding 100 megawatts of efficient combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. Since our last call, we filed a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option. Pending regulatory approval, we expect to invest $100 million to add this capacity in 2024.\nElsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the [ Parisiarian ] solar battery parks. You may recall, we had solar panels waiting on final release from a bonded warehouse in Chicago. I'm happy to report that those panels are being cleared. The first 100 megawatts have been released and the trucks are rolling to our Badger Hollow II site. We expect all of our panels to be released and in our position by the end of this year. We are on track for Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year with the Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work is underway on the Dairy and solar facility, which is planned to go into service by the end of 2024. We'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nWith that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thanks very much. And now just a quick reminder about our dividend. Our dividend growth continues to stand in the top decile of our industry. In fact, we were recently named 1 of the 10 best dividend stocks in America by Morningstar. As usual, I expect our Board will assess our dividend plans for next year and our regularly scheduled meeting in December. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're positioned well within that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more information on our third quarter financials and a good bit of detail on our upcoming 5-year financing plan. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2023 third quarter earnings of $1 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers. Our earnings from utility operations were $0.18 above the third quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.01 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These unfavorable variances were more than offset in the quarter. Rate-based growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources.\nAdditionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.13 and lower day-to-day O&M resulted in a $0.02 improvement. Before I turn to earnings at the Other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, were down 0.8% quarter-over-quarter. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage was up 1.3% and is ahead of our forecast through the first 9 months of the year. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up [ 14% ] and are tracking our forecast for the year.\nRegarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings decreased $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2022. Recall that last year, we recorded a $0.05 pickup from a resolution of MISO ROE appeals. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment decreased $0.01 in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. This was mostly driven by lower wind production partially offset by tax credits from projects that we placed into service.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 largely due to higher interest expense. As Gale noted, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. This includes October weather and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\nNow turning to our financing plan. Gale and Scott have already discussed the new 5-year capital plan. I'll provide details related to our anticipated financing activities to support the plan. You can find this information on Page 22 of the earnings package. As you can see on the chart, over the next 5 years, we expect cash from operations to fund about 65% of our cash needs. About 28% of the funding is expected to come from debt and the remaining 7% from issuance of common equity. As Gale mentioned earlier, we expect to utilize dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans and asset market programs to tap into the equity market. Our common equity issuance is projected to be in the range of $100 million to $200 million for 2024 and $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion over the next 5-year plan.\nRecall, our equity ratios in our utilities are sicker, particularly at Wisconsin Electric. Supporting these sicker equity layers results in approximately $400 million of common equity raise. The remaining equity raise represents approximately 50% of incremental capital spend. As you know, our equity issuances post 2024 will be tied to our capital plan ratably at approximately $450 million a year. This financing plan not only supports our long-term earnings growth rate, but also helps maintain our targeted credit metrics.\nIn addition, I'll quickly address our upcoming holding company refinancing needs. Over the next 3 years, we have total maturities of about $2.8 billion. The $600 million that matures in 2024 carries a very low coupon. However, the remaining $2.2 billion scheduled to mature in 2026 has a weighted average coupon of just under 5%, which represents lower refinancing risk.\nIn closing, as shown on the last page of the earnings package, through our capital allocation, we expect the percent of assets invested in our regulated electric businesses to grow faster. At the same time, the percent of assets in gas distribution and in contracted renewables is expected to decline. We are very excited about the investment opportunities ahead of us.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nAll right, Xia, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and the company continues to perform at a very high level. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2023.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Lu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2023 earnings of $0.92 a share. After a down first quarter marked by 1 of the warmest winters on record, we delivered solid results in the second quarter and we're firmly on track for a strong 2023. Today, we're reaffirming our guidance for the year. The range is $4.58 to $4.62 a share. This, of course, assumes normal weather going forward.\nAs always, we're focused on the fundamentals of our business: Financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction. During the second quarter, we also continued to move forward on our major initiatives, including the investments outlined in our $20.1 billion ESG progress plan. As we've discussed, the plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. We expect to quadruple the amount of renewable generation for our regulated customers, add highly efficient gas field capacity to ensure reliability and continue to harden our delivery networks. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in just a moment.\nAs a reminder, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive growth in earnings per share of 6.5% to 7% a year. And as we've discussed, there is no need to issue equity for this $20.1 billion 5-year plan.\nNow over the past few months, many of you have asked about the trajectory of our next 5-year plan. Our updated plan will cover the period 2024 through 2028. Of course, if growth in demand for capacity and energy drives our next capital plan significantly higher, then we'll evaluate all our financing options. In addition to incremental debt and refinancing opportunities, our options could include accessing the equity market through our dividend reinvestment plans, employee benefit plans and at-the-market programs. I would stress that at this point, we do not see the need for any block equity offering.\nAgain, as a reminder, any equity need would be driven by growth and would support our long-term growth projections. As you would expect, we're on schedule with the development of our next 5-year plan, and as usual, we'll share the details with you in the fall.\nNow let's take a brief look, we'll switch gears and take a brief look at our regional economy. We're still seeing a very strong labor market in Wisconsin. In June, the state added 7,000 private sector jobs. The unemployment rate came in at 2.5%, well below the national average, and the labor force participation rate rose for the fourth straight month in Wisconsin to 65.3%. Very solid numbers.\nWe're also encouraged by the pipeline of economic activity in our region. Last quarter, you heard that Microsoft plans to make an initial investment of $1 billion to create a new data center campus. This new complex will be built south of Milwaukee, in the Wisconsin Innovation Park where [ Foxconn ] is located. Microsoft has purchased 315 acres in Area 3 of the park and is moving full speed ahead. In fact, earthwork at the site began just a few days ago. So along with American Transmission Company, we're working closely, in fact, on a weekly basis with Microsoft to determine the full extent of the energy infrastructure that will be needed to serve this development. We're excited about supporting Microsoft as the company moves forward with a major technology investment, and we'll update you as the planning proceeds.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments and on our operations. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale.\nI'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front. In May, we filed a limited reopener to set 2024 rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The filings address the recovery of capital investments for certain projects going into service this year and in 2024. These are renewable facilities, rice generation and LNG reliability investments. The projects have already been approved by the Wisconsin Commission. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration as part of this proceeding. We expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year.\nAnd as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. After 9 years without a base rate case at Peoples Gas, we're making these requests for 2024 to support our investments in critical infrastructure. In mid-July, the staff filed its [ rebump ] testimony, recommending a 9.83% return on equity and an equity layer of 50.83% for Peoples Gas. This was consistent with the initial recommendations from the staff. We expect a final decision by the end of the year.\nAnd moving to the other states, we are very pleased that we have reached a settlement agreement in our rate reviews at both Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. The Minnesota Commission is considering a settlement that would provide a 7.1% increase in base rates. As a quick reminder, that's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. And we're pleased to update you that in Michigan, we have reached a unanimous settlement, and the details will be made public later this week. We expect final commission approval by the end of the year.\nMeanwhile, we're continuing progress on a number of regulatory -- regulated capital projects. At the beginning of June, we closed on our first option of West Riverside Energy Center for $95 million. This adds 100-megawatt of efficient and combined cycle natural gas generation to our portfolio. As you recall, this plant is in operation and the purchase price was based on book value. And in the next few weeks, we plan to file a request to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity under our remaining option.\nWe also put 128 megawatts of new natural gas generation online last month. As you recall, we invested $170 million to build this generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The facility uses 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. Elsewhere in the state, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris and Darien Solar Battery Parks. The Badger Hollow II site has begun receiving panels using non-Chinese polysilicon. Also, we continue to work on securing custom release of panels from a bonded warehouse in Chicago, and we're still expecting Badger Hollow II to go into service late this year or early next year, with Paris Solar Park to follow. In addition, work has begun on the Darien solar facility, which is planned to go into service in 2024. We'll keep you posted and update on future developments.\nWith that, I'll turn you back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thanks very much.\nAs you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. We believe this continues to rack our dividend growth in the top decile of our industry. We're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and unveil our third quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Gale.\nOur 2023 2nd quarter earnings of $0.92 per share increased $0.01 per share compared to the second quarter of 2022. Our earnings package includes a [ consolidation ] of second quarter results on Page 15. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nOur earnings from utility operations were $0.04 above the second quarter of 2022. First, weather had an estimated $0.05 negative impact quarter-over-quarter. Higher depreciation and amortization expense and interest expense added another $0.09 of negative variance. These negative variances were more than offset in the quarter. [ Rates-based ] growth contributed $0.11 to earnings. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, timing of fuel expense improved our earnings by $0.05, and lower day-to-day O&M taxes and other items resulted in a $0.02 improvement.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the other segment, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales for the quarter. You can find this sales information on Page 11 of the earnings package. Retail electric deliveries in WIsconsin, excluding the iron ore mine, was down 0.6% on a weather-normal basis. This was driven by lower sales volumes to large commercial and industrial customers. Residential usage, again, on a weather-normal basis was flat quarter-over-quarter, which is in line with our forecast. Also, sales to our small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.4%, which is ahead of forecast.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the second quarter of '23 compared to the second quarter of '22. This was largely driven by higher production tax credits as a result of the acquisition of renewable projects.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.05, primarily driven by an increase in interest expense. This was partially offset by favorable rabbi trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M.\nOverall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.01 per share compared to last year and by $0.08 per share compared to the midpoint of our Q2 guidance.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities was relatively flat compared to the prior year, and total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion during the first half of 2023, an increase of more than $1 billion from the first half of 2022. This was primarily driven by acquisitions of generation projects in our regulated and infrastructure segment.\nNow, let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We're expecting a range of $0.88 to $0.90 per share. This accounts for July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.96 per share in the third quarter last year, which included a positive $0.02 from weather and a $0.05 pickup related to the resolution of a MISO ROE complaint. As Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. As a reminder, largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in Q4 to be materially better than Q4 of 2022.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nGreat, Xia. Thank you.\nOverall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nThank you very much. Live from the [ Heartland ]. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2023.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2023 earnings of $1.61 a share. Weather was a major factor in our lower results for the quarter. We saw one of the mildest winters in the history of the Upper Midwest. For example, it was the second warmest first quarter in Milwaukee since 1891, However, we're confident in our plan for the remainder of the year and we're reaffirming our guidance for 2023. As a reminder, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share for the full year. This assumes normal weather going forward. And as always, we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business, financial discipline, operating efficiency and customer satisfaction.\nSwitching gears now. The work on our ESG progress plan continues at a steady pace. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history, totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. The plan is based on projects that are low risk and highly executable. And as we look to the future, it's clear that the mega trend of decarbonization and the need for even greater reliability will drive investment plans that are long and strong. Scott will provide you with more detail on several specific projects in a moment. But I'm pleased to report that just since last December, the Wisconsin Commission has approved more than $1 billion of new capital investment by our companies.\nAs we've discussed, we project that our ESG progress plan will drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year from 2023 through 2027. We and we fully expect to fund our capital plan without any need for new equity.\nNow let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We have good news from the latest data in Wisconsin. In March, the unemployment rate came in at 2.5%. That's a record low for the state and well below the national average and we continue to see major developments in the area. Just a few weeks ago, in fact, Microsoft announced that it plans to create a new data center campus in our region with an initial investment of $1 billion. This data center complex will be built south of Milwaukee in the technology park that is also being developed by Foxconn. Microsoft will purchase a 315-acre parcel in Area 3 of the park. Local approvals have been received, and we expect Microsoft to close on the land purchase on or before the 31st of July.\nIn the meantime, Microsoft is moving full speed ahead with planning and design work. The decision by Microsoft underscores the strength and the potential of the Wisconsin economy and positions us very well for more growth in the technology sector.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nSenior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with a few updates on the regulatory front.\nNew rates have been in effect for our Wisconsin utilities since the start of the year. As expected, we're planning to file a limited reopener for 2024 later this quarter. The filing will address the recovery of capital investments for projects going into service this year and in 2024. The return on equity and the equity layer are all set and are not up for consideration, the request will be quite modest, and we expect a decision from the commission by the end of this year.\nAnd as you recall, we have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas. The next step will be for the commission staff and interveners to file their direct testimony on May 9. Hearings are scheduled for early August. After 9 years without a rate case at Peoples Gas, who are making these requests for 2024 to support our investment in key infrastructure and with lower natural gas prices, we project customer bills will be flat with 2022.\nWe also have rate reviews in progress at Minnesota Energy Resources and Michigan Gas Utilities. We filed in Minnesota last November and interim rates went into effect January 1. I'm pleased to announce that we received a settlement with parties that would result in a 7.1% increase in base rates. That's based on a 9.65% return on equity with an equity layer of 53%. This settlement is subject to commission approval, which we expect in the next several months.\nAnd in March, we filed for a base rate increase of 9.1% at Michigan Gas Utilities for 2024. This application is primarily driven by our capital investments supporting safety and reliability.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. Red Barn Wind Park went to service last month. The project is providing 82 megawatts of clean energy capacity to our Wisconsin customers. And as Gale noted, we received 3 significant approvals for the Wisconsin Commission since last December for the Dairy and Solar Battery Park, West Riverside Energy Center and [ Koshkonong Solar Battery Parks ]. We discussed the Dairy and approval last quarter. And as you recall, the solar park is planned to go in service in 2024.\nWest Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. In February, we received approval for our purchase of 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity for approximately $102 million. We expect to close this purchase by the end of the month. We have an option to purchase another 100 megawatts of Riverside capacity, and we plan to exercise that option later this year.\nWe also received approval for our purchase of Koshkonong Solar Battery Park with plans for 300 megawatts of solar capacity and 165 megawatts of battery storage. We will own 90% of the project with an expected investment of $585 million. We project the solar portion of this facility to go into service in 2025.\nWe also continue on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. While Badger Hollow has received some of the solar panels, the remaining panels for projects are currently in Chicago going through the customs process. Assuming timing release of the panels, we expect these solar parts to go into service late this year or early next year.\nFor the Paris and Koshkonong projects, we're evaluating the timing of the battery investments. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nOutside of utilities, we continue to make progress on zero carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. In February, we completed our acquisition of the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm, now in service in Illinois. As a reminder, that project offers 250 megawatts of capacity in total, and we own a 90% share. Also in February, we added an 80% ownership in the Samson 1 Solar Project located in Northeast Texas. The project has a capacity of 250 megawatts. As disclosed previously, Samson 1 suffered storm damage at the beginning of March, but we expect no significant bottom line impact for the property losses. The project is currently producing energy at about 70% level and improving every day as we continue to restore the site.\nWith that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nScott, thank you very much.\nNow as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more details on our financial results and our second quarter guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO\n\nThank you, Gale. Our 2023 first quarter earnings of $1.61 per share decreased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2022. Our earnings package include the comparison of first quarter results on Page 12. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, our earnings were $0.09 lower compared to the first quarter of '22. Rate-based growth contributed $0.22 to earnings, driven by continued investment in our ESG progress plan. This includes the base rate increase for our Wisconsin utilities as well as the interim rate increase for Minnesota Energy Resources, both of which were effective January 1, 2023. This favorable margin impact from rate base growth was more than offset by a number of factors.\nFirst, as Gale noted, we experienced one of the mildest winters in history which drove a $0.12 decrease in earnings compared to the first quarter of last year. Additionally, timing of fuel expense, depreciation and amortization interest, day-to-day O&M, taxes and other drove a combined $0.19 negative variance.\nBefore I turn to earnings at the other segments, let me briefly discuss our weather-normalized sales. You can find our sales information on Page 9 of the earnings package. I'd like to remind you that weather normalization is not a perfect science, extreme warm weather in the first quarter may not be fully reflected in our weather-normalized data. Having said that, Weather-normal retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding natural gas used for power generation, were down 1%. However, residential usage, again on a weather-normal basis, grew 0.9%. That was ahead of our forecast. Weather-normal retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine, were 1.9% lower. Residential usage was relatively flat compared to last year.\nNow at our Energy Infrastructure segment, Earnings were $0.01 lower in the first quarter of '23 compared to the first quarter of '22. Production tax credits were higher by $0.03 quarter-over-quarter resulting from acquisitions of renewable generation projects. This increase was largely offset by a pickup that we recorded in the first quarter last year from the resolution of market settlement in the Southwest Power Pool.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.08 primarily driven by an increase in interest expense and a pickup recorded in the first quarter '22 from our investment in a clean energy fund. These items were partially offset by favorable rabbi buy trust performance and some tax and other items. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $281 million. The mild winter and timing of recovery of commodity costs contributed to this decrease. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of '23, and $884 million increase from the first quarter of '22. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of the whitewater natural gas power generation facility in our Wisconsin segment, as well as the Sapphire Sky Wind Farm and Samson 1 solar facility in our Infrastructure segment.\nIn closing, as Gale mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share, assuming normal weather for the rest of the year. To offset the mild first quarter weather impact, we are implementing a variety of initiatives. As a result, we now expect our day-to-day O&M to be 2% to 3% higher than 2022 versus our previous expectation of 3% to 5% higher.\nI will also add that largely due to timing of O&M and fuel expense, we expect earnings in the second half of this year to be materially better than the second half of 2022. For the second quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.83 to $0.85 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.91 per share in the second quarter last year.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders.\nOperator, we're ready now for the Q&A portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team, who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2022 earnings of $4.45 a share. Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial metrics in just a few minutes, but I'm pleased to report to you that we delivered an exceptional year on virtually every meaningful measure, from employee safety and customer satisfaction to growth in earnings per share. Three major factors really shaped our strong results for 2022. Favorable weather, solid performance from our infrastructure and transmission segments, and steady execution of our capital plan as we pave the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable and clean.\nOn the regulatory front, as you may know, we saw balanced and credit supportive results from our Wisconsin rate reviews in December despite a little bit of noise in the process. New rates are now in effect for all of our Wisconsin utilities. And last month, on January 6, we filed rate requests with the Illinois Commerce Commission for our gas utilities in Illinois. I would point out that home heating bills in Chicago are currently below those of other major U.S. cities like New York, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia. And we expect that to continue with this filing. Scott will provide you with more detail in just a moment.\nTurning now to our ESG progress plan that we updated for you in November. It's the largest 5-year investment plan in our history totaling $20.1 billion for efficiency, sustainability and growth. We expect the plan to drive compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the period 2023 through 2027. A key part of the plan is a major commitment to renewable projects, both in our regulated business and in our infrastructure segment.\nIn fact, earlier this week, we announced that our infrastructure group will acquire an 80% ownership interest in Phase 1 of the Samson Solar Energy Center. Located in Northeast Texas, Samson 1 has a capacity of 250 megawatts. It entered commercial service in May of last year and has a long-term power purchase agreement with AT&T. Pending final regulatory approval, we plan to invest approximately $250 million for our portion of Samson 1. We expect to close the transaction late in the first quarter of this year. Samson 1, as you may know, is the first of 5 phases being developed by Invenergy. Overall, Samson is the largest solar project under construction in the United States today, and we're pleased to take part in Phase 1.\nNow as you know, one of our goals is to help shape the future of clean energy. And today, we're announcing an important pilot project with the Electric Power Research Institute and a company called CMBlu Energy. CMBlu is a German designer of long-duration battery storage, using common, low-cost, environmentally friendly materials. In simple English, it's a green battery. This 1 to 2-megawatt hour pilot project will be one of the first of its kind on the United States electric grid.\nOur plan is to test the durability of this battery system. We believe it can store energy for up to twice as long as the typical batteries in use today. We plan to launch the project at our Valley Power Plant near downtown Milwaukee in the fourth quarter of this year when temperatures turn cold. The results will be shared in early 2024 across the industry.\nAnd now let's switch gears and take a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 52,000 private sector jobs in 2022. And in December, the unemployment rate in the state dropped to 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We believe the current strength and remarkable diversity of the Wisconsin economy positions us well as we move forward in 2023.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start with some updates on the regulatory front. First, let's review where we stand for the Wisconsin Public Service Commission's written orders this past December. The commission authorized a return on equity of 9.8% and for all our Wisconsin utilities. It approved an increase in the equity component of our capital structure to 53%. We will also continue the earnings sharing mechanism to provide benefits to Wisconsin customers if our performance achieved our forecasts. And as Gale mentioned, we now have rate filings under review in Illinois for Peoples Gas and North Shore Gas.\nAt Peoples Gas, we are not seeking an extension of the automatic bill adjustment writer known as QIP, after it expires at the end of this year. We plan to return to the traditional ratemaking process to recover the cost of necessary infrastructure improvements. Our rate request would continue to support those key capital investments.\nPeoples Gas operates one of the oldest natural gas delivery networks in the United States. And as you may recall, an independent engineering study found that over 80% of the iron pipes in the system are approaching the end of their useful life. We are modernizing the system to ensure safety and reliability and to reduce methane emissions. With natural gas prices declining, we project customer bills will remain largely flat as the new rates take effect in 2024.\nYou may also recall, we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources last November. We are seeking an overall increase of 8.1%, primarily driven by capital investments. Interim rates went into effect January 1.\nMeanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of our regulatory capital projects. Our Red Barn Wind development is on track to come online within the next few months in Wisconsin with an expected investment of $160 million. This project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system.\nWork continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. We still expect the solar parks to go into service this year, assuming timely release of the panels. We also received regulatory approval for the -- our purchase of the Darien Solar-Battery Park with plans for 225 megawatts of solar capacity and 68 megawatts of battery storage. We expect this facility to go into service in 2024. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments.\nAnd just last month, with an investment of approximately $75 million, we closed our purchase of the Whitewater combined-cycle plan, a 236-megawatt facility. As a reminder, we previously received energy and capacity for this natural gas unit under a purchase power agreement.\nIn the natural gas business, we have been working to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. We signed another contract in January, which brings us to a planned total of 1 billion cubic feet of RNG that will enter our system annually. We expect RNG to flow this year, supporting our aggressive goals to reduce methane emissions.\nOutside our utilities, we continue to make good progress on zero-carbon projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment. The Thunderhead Wind farm in Nebraska is now in service. In addition, we expect to complete the acquisition of Sapphire Sky in Illinois in the coming weeks as commercial operations begins. And as Gale noted, we're excited about our plans to add the Samson 1 solar project in our Infrastructure segment before the end of the first quarter.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nRight, Scott, thank you very much. We're confident that we can deliver on our earnings guidance for 2023. As you recall, we're guiding to a range of $4.58 to $4.62 a share, the midpoint, $4.60 a share represents growth of 6.7% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And as we've discussed, we expect to fund our capital plan without any need to issue equity.\nAnd you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%. This marks the 20th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so you can expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2022 earnings of $4.45 per share increased $0.34 per share or 8.3% compared to 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2022 results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.19 compared to 2021. Weather drove a $0.04 increase in earnings compared to 2021. Rate-based growth contributed $0.41 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M expense resulted in a $0.02 improvement and achieved our goal for the year. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.12 of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to continued capital investment and a $0.12 increase in fuel expense, mainly driven by higher natural gas costs.\nIn terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.1%. Small commercial and industrial sales increased 0.5% while residential and large commercial and industrial sales stayed relatively flat. Overall, our sales mix was stronger than our forecast.\nOur sales projections for 2023 can be found on Pages 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, we are projecting relatively flat electric and gas sales year-over-year. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.07 compared to 2021. If you recall, $0.05 related to the resolution of historical appeals that we discussed on our third quarter earnings call. As previously discussed, beginning with the third quarter of 2022 and going forward, we are recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.14 in 2022 compared to 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits as a result of stronger wind production and the addition of our Jayhawk Wind farm that went into commercial operation at the end of 2021. In addition, recall that we recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution earlier in 2022 from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and lower gains recognized on our investment in the clean energy fund. Remember, rabbi trust performance is largely offset in O&M. Overall, we improved on our 2021 performance by $0.34 per share.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $28 million. And total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.7 billion in 2022, a $324 million increase as compared to 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nFinally, let's look at our earnings guidance. In terms of first quarter 2023 earnings guidance, we project to earn in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.72 per share. This forecast takes into account the fourth warmest January on record since the 1880s and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Remember, last year, we earned $1.79 per share in the first quarter, which included $0.02 of favorable weather, $0.03 from the Southwest Power Pool settlement and $0.03 from our investment in a clean energy fund.\nAnd for the full year 2023, we're reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.58 to $4.62 per share. We're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% share -- 7% a year over the next 5 years.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter 2022 earnings of $0.96 a share. The major factors shaped another solid quarter. Strong performance from our Infrastructure segment, an uptick from our ownership in American Transmission Company, plus a warm close to the summer in September.\nOf course, our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong and stable. And I will switch gears and provide you with some background on the Wisconsin rate settlements that we announced in October. As you recall, we filed rate reviews earlier this year with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin for all our Wisconsin utilities.\nAfter the commission staff completed its analysis, we reached agreements with multiple parties, including the Citizens Utility Board and the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. In fact, more parties supported these settlements than any other settlement we've reached over the years. Scott will provide you with more detail on the terms in just a moment, but I would simply say that we view this as a very positive step forward. The process, it's now in the home stretch, and we look forward to the commission's review, which we expect in December.\nOur other big news for the day is the rollout of our ESG progress plan for the period 2023 through 2027. As you may have seen from our announcement this morning, we expect to invest $20.1 billion with an ongoing focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth. This is the largest capital plan in our history, an increase of $2.4 billion.\nThat's more than 13.5% above our previous 5-year plan. Now as we look forward, I will describe our growth trajectory as long and strong. In fact, our plan will now support compound earnings growth of 6.5% to 7% a year over the next 5 years without any need to issue equity. And as you've come to expect from us, this projected earnings growth will be of very high quality.\nHighlights of the plan include a significant increase in renewable energy projects for our regulated utilities from roughly 2,400 megawatts of capacity in our previous plan to nearly 3,300 megawatts in this plan. And as we continue to decarbonize our system, it's important to point out that passage of the Inflation Reduction Act is a real true game changer for customer affordability.\nWe now project long-term customer savings of nearly $2 billion of our investment in renewables in this 5-year plan. That's nearly double of what we projected just a year ago. We've also dedicated more capital to hardening our networks, our electric distribution networks so that we can deliver a high level of reliability for our customers.\nAnd we've included in the new ESG progress plan an increase in transmission investment. Two major factors are driving this growth. Renewable projects that require transmission and the long-range planning process being conducted by MISO, the Midwest grid operator.\nAdd it all up, shake it all around, and we have what I really believe is a premium growth plan. The projects that are driving our growth are low risk and highly executable. They're paving the way for greater sustainability, paving the way for an energy future that's affordable, reliable and clean. And now before I turn it over to Scott, I'd like to cover a significant development in our infrastructure segment.\nJust yesterday, you may have seen the news that we will acquire an 80% interest in the Maple Flats Solar Energy Center. That's a 250-megawatt project being developed by Invenergy in South Central Illinois. We plan to invest approximately $360 million for 80% ownership of the project.\nMaple Flats has an offtake agreement with a Fortune 100 company for the sale of all of the energy it will produce. And under the Inflation Reduction Act, Maple Flats will qualify for production tax credits. The project, of course, meets all our financial criteria and will further diversify the renewable assets in the infrastructure segment of our business.\nAnd finally, a brief look at the regional economy. Wisconsin added 14,400 private sector jobs in September, and the unemployment rate in the state stands at 3.2%. That's well below the national average. We continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region and a wide range of developments is in the pipeline, so I would just say watch this space.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our regulatory developments, our operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand on the regulatory front. First, let's get back to the details in the rate review. Pending commission approval, a partial settlement agreements would bring several other changes beyond the base rates.\nWe've agreed to a common equity component of 53% for each of our Wisconsin utilities, consistent with our initial request. The settlement calls for the continuation of the revenue sharing mechanism that has been in place this year. The agreement also addresses the future cost recovery of the older units of our Oak Creek power plant. First, we've agreed to securitize $100 million of the book value of the plant's environmental controls. Second, after retirement, we would propose to levelize over 25 years, recovery of the remaining book value, which is approximately $400 million.\nWe agree with the settling parties that the commission should determine the return on equity for each utility, along with the allocation of revenue among customer classes. We expect the commission review by mid-December. In addition, today, we filed a rate review at one of our smaller utilities, Minnesota Energy Resources.\nWe are seeking an overall bill increase of 7.9%, primarily driven by capital investments. We expect interim rates will go into effect January 1. Meanwhile, we're making good progress on a number of regulatory capital projects. In Wisconsin, work continues on our new reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, as well as our liquefied natural gas storage facilities. As we've discussed, these projects are needed to support the reliability of our electric and natural gas systems. And our Red Barn Wind development continues to move forward in Southwestern Wisconsin. We now expect to come online early next year with an investment of $160 million, this project will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our system.\nWork continues on the Badger Hollow II Solar facility and the Paris Solar-Battery Park. We still expect these projects to go into service next year, with the battery storage anticipated in 2024. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any future developments. We're continuing to make strides in support of a low and no carbon generation.\nJust last month, we completed our pilot project, blending hydrogen and natural gas at one of our modern RICE units in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. This is a first-in-the-world test of its kind using this technology. As you'll recall, we partnered with the Electric Power Research Institute to lead this research.\nThe project mixed hydrogen and natural gas in a 25% to 75% blend. We are still evaluating the data. However, our initial findings indicate that all project measures met or exceeded our expectations. The units performed very well and efficiently. As expected, nitrogen oxide emissions increased our equipment was able to take these emissions out and, of course, carbon-dioxide emissions were reduced.\nOur research will help demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for potential generation on a larger scale in the future. We look forward to sharing the full results with our industry and the public early next year. And as we've discussed, we've been able and working on to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers.\nJust last month, we signed our fourth RNG contract contributing to our goal of net-zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flow in our system by early next year. Outside our utilities, we continue making good progress on projects in our WEC Infrastructure segment.\nI'm pleased to report we've completed the acquisition of the Thunderhead Wind Farm and expected to enter commercial operations later this year. And we expect Sapphire Sky Wind to go into service early next year. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment. And as Gale noted, we're excited to add our first solar project to this segment with Maple Flats. And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much. And as we head now into the final months of the year, we're narrowing our earnings guidance to a range of $4.38 to $4.40 a share, and we expect to reach the top end of that range. And a quick reminder about our dividend. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings.\nWe're positioned very well within that range, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share. Next up, Xia will provide you with more details on our third quarter financials. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 3rd quarter earnings of $0.96 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the third quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of third quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. Overall, earnings across our regulated businesses were down $0.03 when compared to the third quarter of 2021. While weather was favorable relative to normal, it negatively impacted earnings by an estimated $0.03 per share quarter-over-quarter.\nOutside of weather, earnings from our utility operations were flat quarter-over-quarter. Rate base growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This was fully offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, an increase in day-to-day O&M and the timing of fuel expense and other items.\nIn terms of sales, on a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.3%. Sales to our large commercial and industrial customers grew 2.1% compared to last Q3. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast. Regarding our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased to $0.05 compared to the third quarter of 2021.\nHigher earnings were mostly related to the resolution of historical appeals returning to the ROE used by MISO transmission owners. As of the third quarter and going forward, we're recording ATC earnings at a 10.38% return on equity.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.02 in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the third quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits from our Jayhawk Wind Farm that began commercial operation at the end of last year. Finally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment were flat quarter-over-quarter.\nOverall, we improved on our third quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $53 million. Recovery of natural gas costs drove this increase.\nAnd total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.1 billion for the first 9 months of 2022, a $316 million increase as compared with the first 9 months of 2021. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nLooking forward, as Gale outlined earlier, we're excited about our plan to invest $20.1 billion over the next 5 years in key infrastructure. This ESG progress plan supports 7.4% annual growth in our asset base. Pages 18, 19 and 20 of the earnings package provide a breakdown of the plan, which I will highlight here.\nAs we continue to make our energy transition over 70% of our capital plan is dedicated to sustainability, including $7.3 billion in renewable projects and another $7.3 billion in Grid and Fleet Reliability. Additionally, we dedicated $2.8 billion to electric and gas infrastructure to support customer growth.\nWe also plan to invest $2.7 billion in technology and modernization of our systems to further generate long-term operating efficiency. This robust capital plan supports a higher and narrowed EPS growth rate of 6.5% to 7% over the long term. As always, we're using the midpoint of this year's original guidance as our base.\nTo remind you, that number is $4.31 a share. With our strong economic development backdrop and our continued focus on efficiency, sustainability and growth, we see a long runway of investment ahead, even beyond the next 5 years. As Gale said before, this trajectory is long and strong.\nIn closing, I'd like to provide our earnings guidance. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting a range of $0.73 to $0.75 per share. As a reminder, we earned $0.71 per share in the fourth quarter last year. Also, let me reiterate our guidance for 2022. As Gale noted, the new range is $4.38 to $4.40 per share.\nOur expectation is that we'll reach the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you very much. And overall, folks, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. (Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.\nIn addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.\nAfter the presentation, the conference will open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.\nAnd now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman, and WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nHot town summer in the city. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of 2022.\nFirst, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2022 earnings of $0.91 a share. A warm start to the summer, solid results from our Infrastructure segment and continued execution of our capital plan were major factors that shaped yet another strong quarter.\nIn light of this strong performance, we're again raising our earnings guidance for 2022, this time by $0.02 a share, to a new range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share. We expect to reach the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.\nOur balance sheet and our cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without any need for new equity.\nDuring the quarter, we continued to move forward on major initiatives across the enterprise, including investments in our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan. Our focus remains on building and maintaining a highly reliable infrastructure, delivering energy that's affordable, reliable and clean. Scott will provide you with a project update in just a few moments.\nNow you may recall our recent announcement about an adjustment that we made to our schedule of power plant retirements. We plan to extend the operating lives of the 4 older units at our Oak Creek site. The retirement of units 5 and 6 will be delayed by a year until May 2024. Units 7 and 8 will be delayed for about 18 months until late in 2025. These coal-fueled units have a total rated capacity of 1,100 megawatts.\nWe based this decision on 2 critical factors: First, tight energy supply conditions in the Midwest power market; and expected delays in the delivery of solar panels and batteries, delays that will clearly affect the in-service dates of renewable projects that are now going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin.\nKeeping the older units at Oak Creek online a bit longer for capacity purposes makes great sense for our customers because we can avoid the need to purchase higher cost capacity in the MISO market.\nBut even with the extension of the Oak Creek units, we remain committed to our aggressive environmental goals. Across our generating fleet, we're still targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030. And by the end of 2030, we expect to use coal only as a backup fuel, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of 2035. The capital investments we plan fully support this transition.\nOf course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net zero carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. And as you know, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy, engaging in policy discussions and on the ground, carrying out innovative projects that can drive decarbonization of the economy.\nFor example, we've now finalized the test plans for blending hydrogen with natural gas at one of our modern gas field units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. We've teamed up with the Electric Power Research Institute for this leading-edge project. The field work will take place this fall and the results will be shared across our industry.\nSeparately, for our natural gas distribution business, we're making great progress in securing supplies of renewable natural gas. Scott will update us shortly, but as a reminder, our plan is to achieve net zero methane emissions from our gas distribution networks by the end of 2030.\nSwitching gears now. Let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.9%, well, of course, below the national average, and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Gulfstream Aerospace is expanding its operations at the Appleton Airport. That's in Wisconsin's Fox Valley, southwest of Green Bay. The company is planning to build a world-class facility for painting and finishing aircraft exteriors. This expansion is expected to open in the third quarter of 2023, and it could add 200 new jobs to Gulfstream's existing workforce in Wisconsin.\nAnd just last month, Komatsu Mining celebrated the official grand opening of its new headquarters here in Milwaukee. The campus is already hosting about 600 employees. It includes offices, a training center and state-of-the-art manufacturing space to build heavy mining equipment.\nDuring the second quarter, groundbreaking also took place for a major expansion of the Georgia-Pacific paper mill in Green Bay. Georgia-Pacific is investing $500 million in its new facility, which is expected to bring about 100 new jobs to the region.\nSo with a wide range of developments in the pipeline, we remain very optimistic about the long-term future of the regional economy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, we're making good progress on our capital plan. Construction is underway on a number of regulated projects. We have started work on the reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units, at our western site in Northern Wisconsin. These units are expected to provide 128 megawatts in of dispatchable capacity with an estimated cost of $170 million.\nAlso, work on our liquefied natural gas storage is underway. As you recall, the commission approved 2 LNG units in Southeastern Wisconsin. This $370 million investment will provide needed peaking capacity for our gas distribution business.\nOn the renewable front, we've deployed $155 million towards refurbishing projects at 2 of our regulated wind farms. When completed, these projects will enhance reliability and performance at these farms. These investments will qualify those sites for production tax credits for an additional 10 years.\nAlso, we expect our Red Barn Wind Park development in Southwestern Wisconsin to come online around the end of the year. It will provide about 80 megawatts of renewable energy to our Wisconsin Public Service customers.\nOn the solar and battery front, work continues on the Badger Hollow II solar facility and the Paris Solar Battery Park. We still expect these solar projects to go into service next year, supplying more clean energy to our Wisconsin customers. However, we've informed the Wisconsin Commission that the battery portion of the Paris project is expected to be delayed until 2024.\nAs you may recall, we have filed for approval of 2 other solar battery projects, Darien and Koshkonong. We initially plan to add these to our fleet in 2023 and 2024. We now project them to enter service in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nIn addition, we now expect the retirement of Columbia Energy Center to take place in 2026. As you know, Alliant Energy operates the Columbia facility, and we are a part owner. Of course, we'll keep you updated on any further developments.\nAs you recall, we filed a rate review last quarter with the Public Service Commission for our Wisconsin utilities. Our proposed rate increase would support important capital investments and grid hardening projects.\nRecently, we provided an update to our filing. We factored in the extended operating lives of the older Oak Creek units and the Columbia units. This update also reflects other variables, including higher interest rates and costs associated with the completion of our solar projects. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other rate reviews pending at this time.\nIn our gas business, we've discussed plans to bring high-quality renewable natural gas to our customers. The Wisconsin Commission recently approved our pilot project for this initiative. Just last month, we signed our third RNG contract, which will connect our distribution system to a large dairy farm in Northeast Wisconsin. The 3 contracts in place are projected to bring us 80% of the way toward our goal of net zero methane emissions. We plan to have RNG flowing in our system by the end of this year.\nOutside of our utilities, our WEC infrastructure segment was once again a positive driver for the quarter. The Thunderhead Wind Farm located in Nebraska will be the next project to go into service scheduled for later this year. We also expect the Sapphire Sky Wind project in Illinois to come online by year-end. Together, the 2 projects represent approximately $800 million of investment, keeping us well ahead of our 5-year capital plan.\nAs you know, MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has set out a long-range plan to address transmission needs across the Midwest. And last week, the MISO board approved the transmission projects for tranche 1. At this time, American Transmission Company estimates that its investment opportunity in tranche 1 is approximately $900 million. That's in today's dollars. Investment in these long-dated projects are expected to start as early as 2027.\nAnd with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much.\nNow as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this ranks us in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and therefore, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we are reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more details on our second quarter financials, and she'll touch on the likely impact of the reconciliation bill that appears to be headed for a vote in the U.S. Senate. We view the legislation as broadly positive for customers, for the energy transition and for our future investment opportunities. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 second quarter earnings of $0.91 per share increased $0.04 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of second quarter results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations. The impact of weather was flat quarter-over-quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, retail electric deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 0.30%, led by our small commercial and industrial customers. Overall, retail demand for electricity is tracking our forecast.\nAcross our regulated business, we grew our earnings by $0.05 compared to the second quarter of 2021. Rate-based growth contributed $0.09 to earnings. This is partially offset by $0.03 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase in day-to-day O&M.\nAt our investment in American Transmission Company, earnings increased $0.01 compared to the second quarter of 2021, driven by continued capital investment. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.04 in the second quarter of 2022 compared to the second quarter of 2021. This was mainly driven by production tax credits related to stronger wind production across our portfolio as well as our Jayhawk Wind Farm that went in commercial operation at the end of last year.\nFinally, you'll see that earnings at our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.06, primarily driven by rabbi trust performance and a gain last year on our investment in a clean energy fund that we recognized in the second quarter last year. Remember, rabbi trust is largely offset in O&M.\nOverall, we improved on our second quarter performance by $0.04 per share compared to last year.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $536 million. Cash earnings and a normal recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase. And total capital expenditures were $1 billion during the first half of 2022. As you can see, we have been executing well on our capital plan.\nBefore I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to give a bit of color on the recently proposed Inflation Reduction Act. I'll also provide our guidance for the third quarter.\nWe're still analyzing the details of the proposal. From what we understand now, we believe the proposal would provide additional benefits to our customers from investments in renewables.\nAn option to choose production tax credits for solar projects and the ability to transfer tax credits would provide more flexibility for future renewable investments. This would apply both at our utilities and at the WEC Infrastructure segment. So overall, we see benefits to customers, future investment opportunities and stronger credit metrics.\nNow let me give you the guidance for the third quarter. We are expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for weather and storm recovery costs in July, and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.92 per share in the third quarter last year, which included $0.05 of better-than-normal weather. And as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our full year guidance to a range of $4.36 to $4.40 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nFrom the home of the Defending MMA Champion, Milwaukee Bucks, good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of 2022. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nNow as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter 2022 earnings of $1.79 a share. Our results were largely driven by colder-than-normal weather, a strong economy and the performance of our Infrastructure segment. In light of this strong start to the year, we're raising our earnings guidance by $0.05 a share for 2022 to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 a share with an expectation of reaching the top end of this new range. This, of course, assumes normal weather for the remainder of 2022. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. And as we discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity.\nWe're also making good headway on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest 5-year capital plan in the company history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. Over the past few months, we've received regulatory approval for more than $1.1 billion of needed capital projects in Wisconsin. Scott will provide more detail in just a few minutes. And we're preparing the way for further progress ahead.\nAs you may have seen, our Wisconsin utilities filed rate reviews with the Public Service Commission for the 2-year period in 2023 and 2024. We provided you with details in the earnings packet that we released this morning, and Scott will cover the highlights in just a moment. But the request, ladies and gentlemen, is all about the investments we need to make to enhance reliability for customers and continue the largest clean energy transition in our history. I would add that even with this request, the typical electric bill for our residential customers will remain below the national average.\nSwitching gears now, many of you have asked about the solar panel investigation by the Department of Commerce. There clearly will be impacts across the industry. And at our companies, we may see some price increases and potential delays, particularly on the solar and battery projects that are still going through the regulatory approval process in Wisconsin. But the important point is that we do not expect the review by the Department of Commerce to have any material impact on our 5-year capital plan.\nIn summary, we're poised to continue our strong track record, delivering among the best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. We expect our ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.\nAcross our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by the end of 2025 and an 80% reduction by the year of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. By the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial, and we're aiming for a complete exit from coal by the end of year 2035. Our capital investments fully support this transition. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on the goal of net-zero carbon emissions from power generation on 2050.\nWe're also investing in our natural gas distribution business and developing sources of renewable natural gas. Our plan is to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. With those goals in mind, we're working to help shape the future of clean energy.\nHydrogen, for example, could be a key part of the solution in the decades ahead. So earlier this year, as you recall, we announced one of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our natural gas-powered units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Engineering specifications and testing protocols are now being developed, and we're on track for actual blending of hydrogen in the unit this fall. We look forward to sharing results across the industry.\nAnd now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 2.8%, of course, well below the national average. The state's economy recovered throughout 2021 with especially strong growth in the manufacturing sector, and we continue to see major investments from growing companies in our region. For example, Amazon is expanding its presence in Southeastern Wisconsin with plans to lease a 1 million square foot building that is now under development. This expansion could add 400 new jobs to Amazon's workforce, a workforce that is already 3,000 strong in the region.\nUline's workforce is also on the rise. Uline, as you may know, is one of the nation's largest suppliers of packaging and shipping materials. 700 employees joined Uline's workforce in Wisconsin last year, and Uline expects to add 300 more jobs this year. So we remain optimistic about not only the strength but the trajectory of the regional economy.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more information on our utility operations and our Infrastructure segment as well. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nAs Gale mentioned, across Wisconsin, we're making good progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. Work continues on our Badger Hollow II solar facility in the southwestern part of the state. We have a plan for delivery and acceptance of the panels, and we expect clearance from customs in a reasonable time frame, so we still project Badger Hollow II to be in service in the first half of 2023.\nAnd recently, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved our purchase of 90% of the Paris Solar-Battery Park. It's the largest investment of its kind in Wisconsin history. Located South of Milwaukee, this facility will host 200 megawatts of solar generation and 110 megawatts of battery storage, providing our customers with sunshine after sunset.\nRegarding the solar panels, we have a line of sight on production and delivery, and we still project commercial operation by mid-2023. The situation with battery production and delivery is more fluid, and we work with -- and we'll work through the details. We'll provide you with more information about potential delays in the battery installation of the Paris facility. And of course, we'll continue to examine our capacity situation in light of these developments. To put all this in perspective, it's worth noting that only 3% of our 5-year capital plan is devoted to renewables and battery storage in 2023.\nTurning to other important projects. The commission has approved our plans to build 128 megawatts of natural gas generation at our existing Weston power plant site in Northern Wisconsin. The new facility will use 7 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. These dispatchable units will support the retirement of older, less efficient coal generation. We expect this project to go into service in 2023.\nAs Gale noted, WEC Infrastructure was a positive driver for the quarter with the addition of Jayhawk, which entered commercial operation in mid-December. Thunderhead will be the next wind farm to go into service, and we now expect that in the fall of this year. As discussed before, we remain ahead of schedule in our 5-year capital investment plan for our Infrastructure business.\nTurning to gas distribution. Just last week, we signed another contract to use renewable natural gas, or RNG, from a local dairy farm. This new agreement brings us halfway to our net-zero methane goal for the end of 2030.\nNow I'll touch on the rate filings Gale mentioned. On April 28, we filed a rate review with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Our proposed plans would help us to continue to reduce emissions, strengthen key infrastructure and provide affordable power to customers. I'll discuss the request to set rates for We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. You can refer to Pages 14 and 15 of the earnings packet for more details.\nUnder our plans for the 2 utilities, the typical electric bill for residential customers would increase approximately $5 to $6 a month in 2023 or roughly 5% to 6%. Key drivers for our proposed increase include capital investments in renewables, battery storage, natural gas generation and LNG storage for our gas distribution system. Many of these projects have already been approved.\nIn addition, we are introducing grid hardening projects that are part of a 10-year plan to protect our system against severe weather. And the rate review includes other costs that have been authorized to recover in previous proceedings. In summary, this represents only the second time in 8 years we have asked for a base rate increase for We Energies. We expect final orders by the end of the year with new rates effective in January 2023. We have no other regulatory reviews pending across our companies.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thank you very much. As you may recall, our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in earnings per share. And today, we're reaffirming our projection of long-term earnings growth at 6% to 7% a year. Again, we do not see any need to issue new equity.\nNext up, Xia will provide more details on our first quarter numbers and our second quarter guidance. Xia, all yours.\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Our 2022 first quarter earnings of $1.79 per share increased $0.18 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021. Our earnings package includes a comparison of first quarter results on Page 13. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.13 compared to the first quarter of '21. First, rate base growth contributed $0.13 to earnings. As we continued to execute on our ESG progress plan, we grew our utility rate base by over 7% last year.\nNext, colder winter weather conditions drove a $0.05 increase in earnings when compared to the first quarter of last year. Also, continued economic recovery added $0.01, reflecting stronger weather normalized sales during the quarter. Overall, we saw a continued economic rebound in the first quarter of 2022.\nWeather normalized retail natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, were up 3.6% compared to the first quarter of '21. Residential natural gas sales were up 1.6% from the first quarter of '21, and commercial and industrial natural gas sales were up 6.8%. Additionally, weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 0.7% compared to the first quarter of '21. These positive drivers were partially offset by $0.04 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a $0.01 increase each in day-to-day O&M and fuel. Overall, we added $0.13 quarter-over-quarter from utility operations.\nEarnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in the first quarter of '22 compared to the first quarter of '21. Higher production tax credits, driven by strong wind production, added $0.03 in earnings. We also recognized a $0.03 earnings contribution in Q1 this year from the final resolution of market settlements in the Southwest Power Pool that were related to Storm [Erie].\nFinally, you'll see that earnings in our Corporate and Other segment decreased $0.01 when compared to the first quarter of '21. Unfavorable rabbi trust performance resulted in a $0.02 earnings reduction, this was partially offset by a pickup of $0.01 from our investment in Clean Energy Fund. In summary, we improved on our first quarter '21 performance by $0.18 per share.\nLooking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $682 million. Cash earnings and recovery of commodity costs contributed to this increase.\nTotal capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $384 million in the first quarter of '22, a $207 million decrease from 2021. This was primarily driven by spending on Jayhawk Wind Farm.\nIn closing, before I turn it back to Gale, I'd like to provide our guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we're expecting a range of $0.82 to $0.84 per share. This accounts for April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. As a reminder, we earned $0.87 per share in the second quarter last year, which included an estimated $0.03 from favorable weather.\nAnd as Gale mentioned earlier, we're raising our 2022 earnings guidance to a range of $4.34 to $4.38 per share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the new range. With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman of the Board, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the Q&A portion of the call."

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast.\n(Operator Instructions)\nBefore the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors refer to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.\nDuring the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com.\nA replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nWell, good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2021. First, I'd like to introduce, as always, the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, who's now our President and Chief Executive; Xia Liu, our Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.\nAs you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2021 earnings of $4.11 a share. This exceeded the upper end of our most recent guidance, which was $4.07 a share. Our positive results were driven by favorable weather, solid economic recovery in our region and our continued focus on operating efficiency. Our balance sheet and cash flows remain strong. And as we've discussed, this allows us to fund a highly executable capital plan without issuing equity. I would also note that the earnings we're reporting today are quality earnings with no adjustments. As you know, we've been very active in shaping the future of clean energy.\nLooking back on 2021, we set some of the most aggressive goals in our industry for reducing carbon emissions. Across our generating fleet, we're targeting a 60% reduction in carbon emissions by 2025 and an 80% reduction by the end of 2030, all from a 2005 baseline. In fact, by the end of 2030, we expect our use of coal for power generation will be immaterial and our plan calls for a complete exit from coal by the year 2035. Of course, for the longer term, we remain focused on achieving net 0 carbon emissions from power generation by 2050. Now we all recognize that advances in technology will be needed to decarbonize the economy by 2050. And hydrogen, of course, could be a key player, a key part of the solution in the decades ahead.\nTo that end, we announced last week 1 of the first hydrogen power pilot programs of its kind in the United States. We're joining with the Electric Power Research Institute to test hydrogen as a fuel source at one of our newer natural gas-powered units located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The project will be carried out this year, and the results will be shared across the industry to demonstrate how the use of hydrogen could materially reduce carbon emissions.\nSwitching gears now, we're driving forward on our $17.7 billion ESG progress plan, the largest 5-year plan in the company's history. The plan is focused on efficiency, sustainability and growth. One of the highlights is the planned investment in nearly 2,400 megawatts of renewable capacity over the next 5 years. These renewable projects will serve the customers of our regulated utilities here in Wisconsin. Overall, we expect the ESG progress plan to support average growth in our asset base of 7% a year driving earnings growth, dividend growth and dramatically improved environmental performance.\nIn summary, we believe we're poised to deliver among the very best risk-adjusted returns our industry has to offer. And now let's take a brief look at the regional economy. We saw a promising recovery throughout 2021 despite the prolonged pandemic. The latest available data show Wisconsin's unemployment rate down at 2.8%; folks, that's a record low and more than a full percentage point below the national average. Importantly, jobs in the manufacturing sectors across Wisconsin have returned to pre-pandemic levels. And major economic development projects are moving full steam ahead. (inaudible), the Gummy Beer Company is now recruiting workers at its brand new campus in Pleasant Prairie. Komatsu has begun relocating employees to its new state-of-the-art Milwaukee campus. Milwaukee Tools, Downtown office tower is set to begin operations this month, and we see more growth ahead. For example, ABB, a global industrial and technology company; and Saputo, a leading dairy products company have announced plans for major expansions in our region. And finally, you've heard the phrase are rising tide lift all boats. Well, I'm pleased to report that 1 of the most celebrated luxury boat makers in the world, Grand craft boats, is relocating its operations from Michigan to the Milwaukee region. You know, J. Lo, George Clooney, Robert Redford, they're among the high-profile clients of Grand Craft. So it will be interesting to see who shows up below deck at our next Analyst Day.\nBottom line, we remain optimistic about the strength of the regional economy and our outlook for long-term growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott for more details on our utility operations and our Infrastructure segment. Scott, all yours.\n\nScott J. Lauber\n\nPresident, CEO, President of We Energies & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gale. Looking back, we made significant progress in 2021. I'll start by covering some developments in Wisconsin. As Gale mentioned, we're continuing to make progress on the transition of our generation fleet and our ESG progress plan. I am pleased to report that our Badger Hollow One solar project is now providing energy to our customers. You'll recall that we own 100 megawatts of this project in Southwest Wisconsin. We have also made progress on the construction of Badger Hollow II. Currently, we expect an in-service state in the first quarter of 2023. This factors in a delay of approximately 3 months due to ongoing supply chain constraints. We do not expect a material change in the construction costs. In addition, the Public Service Commission has approved our plans to build 2 liquified natural gas storage facilities in the southeastern part of the state. Construction has started and we plan to bring the facilities into service in late 2023 and mid-2024.\nWe expect this project to save our customers approximately $200 million over time and help ensure reliability during Wisconsin's coldest winters. And we recently signed our first contract for renewable natural gas or RNG, for our gas distribution business. We'll be tapping into the output of one of our large local dairy farms. The gas applied each year will directly replace higher emission methane from natural gas that would have entered our pipes. This 1 contract alone represents 25% of our 2030 goal for methane reduction. The Wisconsin-based company, U.S. game, is planning to have RNG flowing to our distribution network by the end of this year. The commission also approved the development of Red Barn, a wind farm in Southwestern part of the state. We expect our Wisconsin Public Service utility to invest approximately $150 million in this project and for it to qualify for production tax credits.\nWhen complete, it will provide WPS with 82 megawatts of renewable capacity. And just this past Monday, we filed an application with the commission for approval to acquire a portion of the capacity from West Riverside Energy Center. West Riverside is a combined cycle natural gas plant owned by Alliant Energy. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service would acquire 100 megawatts for approximately $91 million. That's the first of 2 potential option exercises. We expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2023. Looking forward, we expect to file a rate review for our Wisconsin utilities by May. We have no other rate cases planned at this time.\nTurning now to our Infrastructure segment. The 190-megawatt Jayhawk wind farm located in Kansas, began service in December. We invested approximately $300 million in this project. Overall, we have brought 6 projects online in our Infrastructure segment, representing more than 1,000 megawatts of capacity. And as you'll recall, we expect the Thunderhead Wind farm to come online for the second quarter and the sapphire sky by the end of this year. Including these 2 projects, we plan to invest a total of $1.9 billion in this segment over the next 5 years, and we remain ahead of plan. And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nScott, thanks so much. We're confident that we can deliver our earnings guidance for 2022. We're guiding, as you know, in a range of $4.29 a share to $4.33 a share. The midpoint $4.31 represents growth of 7.5% from the midpoint of our original guidance last year. And you may have seen the announcement that our Board of Directors, at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.4%. We believe this increase will rank in the top decile of our industry. This also marks the 19th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.\nNext up, Xia will provide you with more detail on our financial results and our first quarter guidance. Xia?\n\nXia Liu\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gale. Turning now to earnings. Our 2021 results of $4.11 per share increased $0.32 or 8.4% compared to 2020. Our earnings package includes a comparison of 2021 results on Page 17. I'll walk through the significant drivers.\nStarting with our utility operations, we grew our earnings by $0.10 compared to 2020. First, weather added $0.04 mostly driven by colder winter weather conditions compared to 2020. Second, continued economic recovery drove a $0.09 increase in earnings. This reflected stronger weather normalized electric sales as well as the resumption of late payment and other charges.\nLet me give you some highlights on our weather-normalized retail sales. Overall, retail delivery of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% compared to 2020. We saw a continued economic rebound in 2021 in our service territories. Small commercial and industrial electric sales were up 4.4% from 2020, and large commercial and industrial sales, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 5.1%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin were relatively flat excluding gas used for power generation.\nLastly, rate relief and additional capital investment contributed $0.14 to earnings and lower day-to-day O&M drove a $0.03 improvement. These favorable factors were partially offset by $0.17 of higher depreciation and amortization expense and a net $0.03 reduction from fuel costs and other items. Overall, we added $0.10 year-over-year from utility operations.\nEarnings from our investment in American Transmission Company decreased $0.02 per share year-over-year. The positive impact of additional capital investment was more than offset by 2 factors: a 2020 (inaudible) quarter that benefited 2020 earnings and an impairment that we booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 on an investment outside of the ATC service territory. This substantially wrote off all of the goodwill on the project. Earnings at our Energy Infrastructure segment improved $0.06 in 2021.\nThis was mostly related to production tax credit from the Blooming Grove and Tatanka Ridge wind farms. Finally, we saw an $0.18 improvement in the Corporate and Other segment. Lower interest expense contributed $0.07 year-over-year. Also, we recognized a $0.04 gain from our investment in the fund devoted to clean energy infrastructure and technology development. The remaining positive variance related to improved (inaudible) Trust performance and some favorable tax and other items.\nIn summary, we improved on our 2020 earnings by $0.32 per share. Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $163 million. The increase in cash earnings was more than offset by working capital requirements, mostly related to higher natural gas prices. As we resume normal collection practices in the spring, we expect working capital to improve throughout the year. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.4 billion in 2021. This represents a $471 million decrease compared to 2020 due primarily to the timing of the in-service date of Thunderhead Wind Farm.\nTurning now to financing activities. We opportunistically refinanced over $450 million of holding company debt during the fourth quarter. This reduced the average interest rate of these notes from 4.5% to 2.2%. We continue to demonstrate our commitment to strong credit quality. Adjusting for the impact of voluntary pension contribution and the year-over-year increase in working capital, our FFO to debt was 15.7% in 2021.\nFinally, let's look at our guidance for sales and earnings. For weather-normalized sales in Wisconsin, we're expecting 0.5% growth this year in both our electric and natural gas businesses, continued growth after a very strong year. In terms of 2022 earnings guidance, last year, we earned $1.61 per share in the first quarter. We project first quarter 2022 earnings to be in the range of $1.68 per share to $1.70 per share.\nThis forecast assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. And as Gale stated, for the full year 2022, we are reaffirming our annual guidance of $4.29 to $4.33 per share.\nWith that, I'll turn it back to Gale.\n\nGale E. Klappa\n\nExecutive Chairman, WEC Energy Group, Inc.\n\nXia, thank you so much. Overall, we're on track and focused on providing value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're now ready to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call."

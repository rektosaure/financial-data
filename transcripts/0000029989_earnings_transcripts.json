My name is Tina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Omnicom Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nIt is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Greg Lundberg, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our website, omc.com, you will find a press release and a presentation covering the information we'll review today. An archived webcast will be available on today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I would like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we've included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements. These represent our present expectations and relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.\nWe will begin the call with an overview of our business from John then Phil will review our financial results, and after our prepared remarks, we'll open the line for your questions. I'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased to share our third quarter results. Organic growth was 2.6% for the quarter. For the first 9 months, organic growth is 3%, which is in line with our annual guidance. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was $551.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 16.1% for the quarter, up 10 basis points from last year.\nNon-GAAP adjusted net income per share was $2.24, up 10.3% versus the comparable amount in 2024. Our cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong.\nI'd like to provide you an update on our proposed acquisition of Interpublic. During the quarter, we secured antitrust clearance from all outstanding jurisdictions except the European Union. We submitted our filing yesterday, October 20, and expect this to be the final step in securing EU approval. As a result, we currently expect to close on the acquisition in late November. Our dedicated integration teams at both Omnicom and IPG have been working tirelessly to ensure we're ready to hit the ground running on day 1. We've made significant progress developing detailed plans to deliver a seamless transition for our teams and clients.\nOur integration team has also made progress as we prepare to launch OmniPlus our next-generation marketing operating system. This operating system unifies unparalleled data assets spanning campaign performance, consumer behaviors, demographic insights transaction intelligence and cultural and social indicators. These integrated data sources will be unified through Acxiom's real ID, the industry's most robust identity graph. The collective intelligence of OmniPlus will provide a unified intuitive experience for both clients and our internal teams. Our objective is clear: Empower our clients to accelerate brand growth, expand customer reach and deliver measurable business outcomes.\nA key part of our operating system is our generative AI layer, which is an genic entry point to OmniPlus. In the last earnings call, we talked about our agentic framework and how we have been rolling it out across our entire organization. It is now the fastest-growing platform in our company's history, and our teams continue to create intelligent agents and orchestrate them to deliver faster and better outcomes for our clients. We look forward to sharing more details at its official launch at CES 2026.\nThe result of our integration planning is we remain highly confident in exceeding the synergies we expected when we first announced the acquisition. We maintain an extremely disciplined approach to minimizing disruption to our day-to-day operations, ensuring our client teams remain focused and continue to deliver outstanding results. The commitment is reflected in the new business we won, including American Express, Porsche, Inter snack, White Castle, OpenAI, just to name a few. Similarly, Interpublic saw significant wins with Amgen, Bayer Entropic and Paramount. The level of support we're seeing from both new and existing clients reflects the tremendous value they expect to gain from the proposed combination.\nWe are building strong momentum as we approach the closing of the acquisition of Interpublic. I remain extremely excited about the prospects for our growth, for our people and our clients. As we approach and close the transaction, we'll keep you informed of our plans, including our leadership team, and organization structure, the combined company's strategic priorities, including its expanded capabilities, services and products, our progress on achieving the targeted synergies and our updated financial plans and capital allocation strategy.\nI will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. Let's begin with our revenue growth on Slide 3. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 2.6%. Additionally, the impact on revenue from foreign currency translation increased reported revenue by 1.4% as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to most currencies throughout the quarter. If rates stay where they are, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue in Q4 to be similar to Q3.\nThe net impact of acquisitions and dispositions on reported revenue was not significant, which is also our expectation for Q4 and for the full year 2025, excluding the IPG transaction.\nLet's now review our results in more detail, beginning with a summary of our income statement on Slide 4. We present our reported results on the left and we present non-GAAP adjusted numbers on the right. Adjusting for acquisition-related expenses and repositioning costs, our Q3 2025 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew 4.6% to $651 million, with a margin of 16.1%, up 10 basis points from Q3 of 2024.\nOur non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS grew 10.3% to $2.24 per share. Regarding the 2 adjustments made to operating expenses, the first reflects acquisition-related expenses related to both regulatory approval work and an acceleration in our integration planning work. The second reflects repositioning costs primarily related to severance as we prepare to integrate the pending acquisition of IPG. There were no adjustments to operating expenses in Q3 of 2024. Slide 5 shows a reconciliation of these items in detail.\nOperating expenses in the third quarter of 2025 include $38.6 million of repositioning costs and $60.8 million of acquisition-related costs. We continue to expect that our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2025 will be 10 basis points higher than our full year 2024 results of 15.5%. Net interest expense in the third quarter of 2025 increased due to a decline in interest income, primarily from lower interest rates on our cash investment balances, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in gross interest expense due to the issuance of $600 million of our 5.3% notes to replace the $750 million of our 3.65% notes, which were retired in Q4 of 2024. We estimate that net interest expense will increase by approximately $7 million in Q4 compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to lower interest income expected on cash investments.\nOur reported income tax rate was 27.2% in Q3 2025 compared to 26.8% in the prior year. The increased rate is primarily due to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition-related costs in 2025. On an adjusted basis, our Q3 '25 rate was 26%. For full year 2025, we expect the rate on an adjusted basis to be between 26.5% and 27%. Average diluted shares outstanding were down 2% from Q3 2024 due to net repurchase activity.\nLet's now turn to some key drivers of our performance, beginning on Slide 6 with organic revenue growth by discipline. Median advertising led our growth in the quarter with revenues up 9%. While creative continued to be impacted by lower levels of project work due to macroeconomic uncertainty, BD growth was strong across virtually all geographies. Precision Marketing growth was just under 1%. Solid growth in the U.S. was offset by declines in other markets, primarily in Europe.\nPublic relations declined 8%. Approximately $25 million or 80% of the decline results from no U.S. national election-related revenue in 2025 versus 2024, with the majority of the remaining reduction occurring in the U.K. We do expect similar declines in Q4 resulting from the difficult prior year comp to Q4 of '24, which included spend related to the U.S. national elections.\nHealth care was down $6.4 million or 2% organically. Both our U.S. and European agencies were down 2% organically as recent new business wins did not fully replace some spending declines in the quarter, on client products that are in the process of coming off patent protection. We continue to believe that our agencies in this discipline are well positioned to return to growth in the near future.\nBranding and retail commerce was again down 17% as market conditions continued to impact new rebranding projects, new brand launches and in-store retail commerce. Experience declined 18% on a difficult comp against the Summer Olympics in 2024 as we expected. And lastly, execution on support grew 2%, driven by growth in our merchandising business, which was partially offset by a reduction in spend in fuel marketing.\nTurning to organic revenue growth by geography on Slide 7. We saw mixed growth across our regions. Over half of our revenue is generated in the United States, which saw a 4.6% growth. U.K. growth was also solid at 3.7%, while Continental Europe, our second largest market, saw a decline of 3.1%. Although our non-euro markets delivered organic growth, it was offset by a decline in our events business related to the challenging comparison in Q3 of 2024, which, as we have said, included spend related to the Paris Olympics.\nSlide 8 is our revenue weighted by industry sector. Relative to 2024, year-to-date, 2025 was fairly stable. The only meaningful change was an increase in the relative percentage of total revenue driven by the auto category, reflecting year-on-year new business wins. Other categories were relatively stable.\nMoving on to expense detail on Slide 9. During the quarter, salary and related service costs, our largest expense, declined on a reported basis by 3.7% due to our continued efficiency initiatives, including automation initiatives and changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs grew in connection with growth in revenue, primarily in the media and advertising and execution and support disciplines. Third-party incidental costs, which are out-of-pocket costs build back to clients at our cost grew in connection with the growth in revenue. Occupancy and other costs decreased 1%, led by a decrease in general office and technology expenses. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the $61 million of IPG acquisition-related costs in the quarter. Excluding these costs, reported SG&A expenses decreased to 2.5% of revenue.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for our year-to-date free cash flow summary. The decline relative to last year was driven primarily by the reduction in net income resulting from the impact of both the acquisition-related costs and the repositioning costs. Our free cash flow definition excludes changes in operating capital. For the 9 months ended September 30, 2025, our change in operating capital improved $171 million or 11% compared to the same prior year period. On a last 12-month basis, it improved by $267 million. For the 9 months ended September 30, our primary uses of free cash flow included $414 million of cash to pay for dividends to common shareholders and another $57 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $111 million and remained higher than last year due to ongoing investments in our strategic technology platform initiatives. Total acquisition payments were $88 million, all of which represented earnout payments and the acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests.\nFinally, our share repurchase activity was $312 million, excluding proceeds from stock plans of $18 million. This included share repurchases of $89 million in Q3. We currently continue to expect to spend close to $600 million on share repurchases for the full year.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of Q3 2025, the book value of our outstanding debt was $6.3 billion, down from the same prior year period due primarily to the refinancing of our $750 million of 3.65% notes in Q4 of 2024, with the new issuance in Q3 of 2024 of $600 million, 5.3% notes due in 2034. Our $1.4 billion April 2026 notes are now classified as current on our balance sheet. We will address refinancing these notes in due course after the closing of IPG and the completion of the debt exchange.\nCash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.4 billion. We continue to maintain an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program. Slide 14 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended September 30, 2025.\nOmnicom's return on invested capital was 17%, and return on equity was 31%, both of which reflect our strong performance and our strong balance sheet. These year-over-year calculations were done on a reported basis and the reduction is driven by the impact of the IPG acquisition-related costs and the repositioning costs incurred in the 12 months ended September 30, 2025.\nIt is approaching 1 year since our public announcement of the IPG acquisition. But as you know, we've been working on planning for the integration for some time. With closing expected by the end of next month, -- our teams have been accelerating the final planning for the integration so that we're prepared to move forward as one on day 1. We're excited to be nearing this important milestone, so we can emerge as the most powerful team platform and portfolio in the industry.\nI'll now ask the operator to please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like you to turn the conference over to Investor Relations. You would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Lundberg, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may be begin.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our second quarter Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Chief Technology Officer. On our website you will find the press release and the presentation covering [Audio Gap] Non-GAAP growth was a solid 3% for the quarter, in line with our expectations.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3% for the quarter and flat to last year. Non-GAAP adjusted net income per share, which excludes the after-tax effect of the amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles, repositioning costs and acquisitions costs was $2.05, up 5.1% versus the comparable amount in 2024. Our cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong.\nDuring the first half, we used $223 million in cash to repurchase shares and are on track to repurchase $600 million in shares in 2025. After a solid first half of the year, we are maintaining our guidance for the full year 2025 organic growth to be 2.5% to 4.5% and adjusted EBITDA guidance to be 10 basis points higher than the 15.5% we achieved in 2024.\nTurning now to our key initiatives. I'd like to begin with an update on our proposed acquisition of Interpublic. In June, we reached a major milestone when we received antitrust approval to close the transaction in the United States bringing the total number of approved jurisdictions to 13 out of the 18 required for closing. We remain fully on track to complete the transaction in the second half of this year.\nAs we progress through the regulatory approval process, Philip and I have continued to speak with our clients and our people. The response has been overwhelmingly positive. There's a genuine sense of anticipation and excitement about the opportunities our combined company will create that has only intensified as we approach the closing. By combining our complementary strengths, the new Omnicom will be equipped with industry-leading resources to drive a bold era of growth for our people, delivering superior outcomes for our clients and generating significant long-term value for our shareholders.\nOmnicom and IPG have dedicated teams at both corporate levels, working closely with our merger consultants, leading the process to ensure a seamless and successful closing. Contrary to the early speculation that the transaction might distract our professional staff, our agencies remain fully focused on delivering exceptional service to our clients and securing new business.\nRecent wins include: Under Armour, Bimbo Global and Asda, just to name a few. We continue to refine our analysis and identification of synergies to achieve our $750 million run rate target following the closing. We are highly confident that we will achieve this level of synergies, and we continue to identify further opportunities beyond our target as we move forward with the valuation. We've also taken steps to align our existing portfolio, ensuring that we can immediately deliver the benefits of the combined company to our clients, particularly in relation to our operating platform strategy.\nTo that end, effective July 1, Omnicom reorganized our most advanced data and technology assets, Omni, Omni AI, ArtBot and the Flywheel Commerce Cloud into an end-to-end platform organization to drive our strategy forward. This move is designed to directly support our clients' marketing and commercial ambitions while accelerating our own growth trajectory.\nWith the proposed acquisition of IPG, our new platform will be significantly enhanced by the addition of Kinesso and Acxiom recognized as the world's highest fidelity data platform. as well as real ID, the most comprehensive customer identity solution available. These assets will enable us to deliver an even greater value and innovation to our clients.\nThe new platform organization will be led by Duncan Painter, whose experience in building well-established tech platforms across flywheel, EVS, Experian and Sky and makes him uniquely suited for this role. Our long-standing strategy has always been rooted in the belief that data and technology supercharge creativity. In today's world, especially with the rise of generative AI, breakthrough creativity is more valuable than ever. I'm proud to share that our agencies returned from this year's Cannes Line Festival of Creativity with two of the industry's highest honors.\nOMD Worldwide won Media Network of the Year and DDB Worldwide won Network of the Year. Our ability to excel in both creative and media underscores the strength of Omnicom's end-to-end capabilities and the outstanding work we deliver for our clients. The recognition also follows Omnicom being named -- most Effective Holding Company for the second consecutive year by the 2024 EFI Index demonstrating that our people and agencies continue to stay ahead of the curve, consistently delivering work that drives real business impact.\nLastly, I want to highlight a key addition to our leadership team. In May, we welcome Susan Catalano, our new Chief People Officer in the United States. Susan brings a wealth of experience in organizational redesign, talent operations and management and has successfully guided global organizations through transformational changes. Susan will play a key role in bringing Omnicom and Interpublic together, creating a world-class HR organization that attracts and develops the industry's best talent. In closing, we're pleased with our first half financial results, our progress on key strategic initiatives and the integration planning underway for Interpublic.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we remain confident in achieving our full year organic growth and margin targets. Our focus will remain on delivering for our clients and successfully completing the Interpublic transaction.\nNow I want to introduce and turn the call over to Paolo Yuvienco, our Chief Technology Officer, who is joining us today to explain how we are making generative AI accessible to all our colleagues and clients across the organization. Paolo?\n\nPaolo Yuvienco\n\nExecutive VP & Chief Technology Officer\n\nThanks, John. I want to now spend a few minutes on what we think is one of our most significant competitive differentiators, how we're deploying generative AI and agent capabilities through our omni platform and data assets to fundamentally reshape how we create value for clients. Back in 2022, we made the strategic decision to be an early adopter of generative AI recognizing the transformative potential ahead of many of our competitors and clients.\nInitially, our focus was on the obvious applications using generative AI for ideation in content creation and copy generation as well as distilling insights from audiences. While these delivered immediate productivity gains, they represented only the first phase of our AI strategy. What is driving the latest phase of our continuous transformation has been the development and deployment of our Agentic framework.\nOver the last year, we have been aggressively and systematically rolling out AI agents throughout our workflows, where we can deploy multiple AI agents that collaborate seamlessly to deliver comprehensive solutions rather than isolated AI tools addressing individual tasks, we can now orchestrate intelligent agents across campaign life cycles, simultaneously analyzing data, optimizing strategies and refining creative elements. This capability is powered by a proprietary data asset and institutional knowledge, democratizing access to our industry-leading consumer intelligence, encompassing behaviors, demographics, cultural insights and transactions.\nAdditionally, we are fine-tuning and grounding the market-leading foundational and frontier models, effectively encoding our strategic expertise into our scalable AI system. Most importantly, we are orchestrating complex multistage workflows that previously required extensive human resources. Examples of this cover the entire spectrum of our workforce.\nFor instance, our strategy and creative teams across all our agencies are incorporating synthetic audience agents that are grounded in the omni data sets allowing teams to conduct synthetic focus groups for ideation, personalized content creation and prelaunch testing and scoring of campaigns and assets.\nIn our health care group, the teams have been able to create a multi-agent reasoning engine that helps in recalibrating campaigns and assets at significantly greater speed when the market conditions change by simulating market scenarios, model stakeholder responses and synthesize its existing signals. Within our digital commerce group, the teams have crafted numerous agents that assist in new product launches helping to optimize strategies by surfacing actionable insights from sales trends, market data and competitor analysis. This all represents far more than operational efficiency, but those benefits are significant.\nWe are building differentiated capabilities through our data and technology stack. This positions Omnicom to capture value as the industry evolves and strengthens our long-term competitive positioning.\nNow I'm going to hand it back to John, but I'll be available for our Q&A session later on the call.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, Paolo. I hope that gives you a better sense of how we are embedding generative AI across the enterprise. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. In an uncertain market, our performance through the first half was solid, with organic revenue growth near the midpoint of our annual guidance, and our adjusted EBITDA margin levels flat. As we begin the second half, less uncertainty in the macro environment may allow marketers to normalize spending levels.\nAlthough it is still too early to say that the uncertainty in the macro environment has been eliminated. The larger parts of our business continue to perform very well. and we continue to invest in our technology platforms and tools that differentiate us in the marketplace. And at the corporate level, as John said, we are focused on planning for the integration of IPG and so we can hit the ground running.\nLet's now review our results in more detail, beginning with changes in revenue on Slide 3. Organic growth in the quarter was 3%. The impact on revenue from foreign currency translation increased reported revenue by 1.1% as the U.S. dollar weakened relative to most currencies throughout the quarter. If rates stay where they are, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue will approximate positive 1% for Q3 and positive 2% in Q4, which will result in a benefit from foreign exchange of approximately 1% for the full year 2025.\nThe net impact of acquisitions and dispositions on reported revenue was positive 0.1%. At this time, we expect the impact of acquisitions and dispositions completed to date will be minimal for the full year 2025.\nLet's now turn to Slide 4 for a summary of our income statement. This table shows our reported numbers on the left and non-GAAP adjusted numbers on the right. Adjusting for acquisition-related expenses and repositioning costs, our Q2 2025 non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew 3.7% to $613.8 million with a margin of 15.3%.\nAnd our non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS in grew 5.1% to $2.05. To highlight the 2 adjustments made to operating expenses. The first is an increase in Q2 of acquisition-related expenses related to both regulatory approval work and an acceleration of our integration planning work. The second relates to repositioning actions, primarily severance, we took to optimize Omnicom Advertising Group and Omnicom Production Group as well as to align our businesses and markets more broadly to recent changes in market conditions and client demand related to the challenging macro environment.\nPlease turn to Slide 5 for a reconciliation of these items in detail. Acquisition-related costs of $66 million in Q2 2025, increased from the $34 million we incurred in Q1 of 2025 and repositioning costs were $89 million during Q2 of '25. We continue to expect our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin for the year to be 10 basis points higher than our 2024 results of 15.5%.\nAs we get closer to closing the acquisition of IPG, we'll be evaluating ways to accelerate savings opportunities prior to the closing date. We continue to expect to achieve our cost savings target of $750 million.\nLet's now turn to Slide 8 and review organic revenue growth in more detail, beginning with our disciplines. Median advertising was up 8%, with solid growth in most geographies. Overall results were driven by strong growth in our media business and mix performance in advertising. Precision Marketing grew 5%, including strong performance in our digital, CRM and and experienced design agencies in the U.S., offset by mixed performance internationally. Public relations declined 9%, primarily in the U.S., due largely to weaker performance in our global networks and some reduction relative to the benefit in 2024 from national election spend. We expect to see a difficult comp for the rest of 2025.\nHealthcare revenues were down 5%, and this includes our having now cycled through a large prior period client loss as well as work winding down on brands that are close to loss of patent protection. We continue to expect improved performance as the year progresses. Branding and retail commerce was down 17%. Branding experienced continued pressure from uncertain market conditions impacting both new brand launches and rebranding projects as well as continued slow M&A activity while retail commerce in the quarter slowed.\nExperiential grew 3%, driven by good performance in the U.S., offset by a challenging comparison to last year with the Olympics as well as declines in the Middle East and China. Lastly, execution and support increased 1%, driven by strong growth in the U.S., offset by negative performance in the U.K. and Continental Europe.\nTurning to organic revenue growth by geography on Slide 9. We saw growth across all of our regions with the exception of the U.K., where strength in media and advertising was offset by other disciplines. Our largest market, the U.S., had organic growth of 3% and Asia Pacific also posted solid growth as well as Continental Europe, although mix by market.\nSlide 10 is our revenue by industry sector. Year-to-date, relative to 2024, there are various small changes in the categories we track. The auto category increased year-over-year, reflecting new business wins, which were offset by some client spend reductions.\nNow let's move down the income statement and look at our expenses on Slide 11. In the quarter, salary-related service costs, our largest expense, were down on a reported basis and as a percentage of revenue, driven by our continued efficiency initiatives and ongoing changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs grew in connection with the growth in revenue. primarily in the media and advertising discipline.\nThird-party incidental costs, which are out-of-pocket costs build back to clients at our cost also grew in connection with revenue growth. Occupancy and other costs increased just under 4%, but decreased as a percentage of revenue. These include office rent, other occupancy and general office expenses as well as technology expenses. SG&A expenses increased primarily due to the $66 million of IPG acquisition-related costs in the second quarter of 2025.\nExcluding these costs, reported SG&A expenses declined by 6%. Turning to Slide 12. You can see a presentation of our income statement that adjust for the items that are not part of our normal course operations. As I mentioned earlier, when excluding both the acquisition-related and repositioning costs from the second quarter of 2025.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew 4.1%, and the related margin was flat at 15.3%. Net interest expense in the second quarter of 2025 was flat, reflecting a decrease of $1 million to $40.7 million. We estimate that net interest expense will increase by approximately $4 million in Q3 and by $5 million in Q4.\nOur reported income tax rate was 30.2% in Q2 of 2025 compared to 26.4% in the prior year. The increased rate is primarily due to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition-related costs in 2025. On an adjusted basis, our Q2 2025 rate was 26.5%, up slightly from Q2 of '24, which was 26.3%. For full year 2025, we expect the rate on an adjusted basis to be between 26.5% and 27%.\nAverage diluted shares outstanding were down 1% from Q2 2024 due to net repurchase activity. Reported diluted earnings per share were down 21% on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. As discussed, it increased 5% to $2.05 per share. Now please turn to Slide 12 for a look at year-to-date free cash flow. The year-over-year decline was driven primarily by the reduction in net income resulting from the impact of both the acquisition-related costs and the repositioning costs.\nAs you know, our free cash flow definition excludes changes in operating capital. As you can see in the appendix on Slide 18, we had an improvement of approximately $250 million in the use of operating capital in the first 6 months of 2025 compared to last year. It's worth noting that on a 12-month basis, our change in operating capital is once again positive.\nRegarding our primary uses of free cash flow for the 6 months ended June 30, we used $277 million of cash to pay for dividends to common shareholders and another $34 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $72 million. As we've discussed, they are a bit higher than our historical average due to ongoing investments in our strategic technology platform initiatives.\nTotal acquisition payments were $48 million, including earn-out payments and the acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests. This is down significantly from last year, which included the acquisition of Flywheel, net of cash acquired.\nFinally, our share repurchase activity was $223 million, excluding proceeds from stock plans of $13 million. This included share repurchases of $142 million in Q2 and $81 million in Q1. We still expect repurchase activity of approximately $600 million in total for the year. Slide 13 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities.\nAt the end of Q2 2025, the book value of our outstanding debt was $6.3 billion, flat with the same prior year period. We have no maturities in '25. However, you will note that our $1.4 billion April 2026 maturities are now classified as current on our balance sheet. We will address these in due course.\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.3 billion. We continue to maintain an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program.\nSlide 14 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended June 30, 2025. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 18% and our return on equity is 34%, both of which reflect our strong performance and strong balance sheet. The year-over-year change is driven by the IPG related acquisition costs and the repositioning costs incurred in the 12 months ended June 30, 2025.\nI will now ask the operator to please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Lundberg, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our first quarter earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our website, omnicomgroup.com, you will find a press release and the presentation covering the information that we'll review today. An archived webcast will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements. These represent our present expectations, and relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2024 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results. And after our prepared remarks, we'll open the lines up for your questions. I'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our first quarter 2025 results. I'll begin by covering our results and then provide an update on the progress we are making towards closing our proposed acquisition of Interpublic. I'm pleased to report that we've had a good start to the year. Organic revenue growth in the first quarter was in line with our expectations of 3.4%, with strong growth in our Media & Advertising and Precision Marketing disciplines.\nAdjusted EBITA margin, which excludes amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles as well as IPG acquisition-related costs was 13.8% for the quarter. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the after-tax amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles as well as IPG acquisition-related costs was $1.70, up 1.8% versus the comparable number in Q1 2024.\nOur cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong and support our primary uses of cash: dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. For most of the first quarter, we were restricted from purchasing shares until after our shareholder vote on the acquisition of Interpublic on March 18. We expect to continue our share repurchases, consistent with our approach in prior years through the remainder of 2025.\nSince our last call, as you're all keenly aware, there has been increased volatility in the economy and the markets. We are assessing the implication of these events to determine how they will affect our clients and our business. As in past periods of uncertainty, our clients must continue to compete for share in a dynamic marketplace by: investing and leveraging the strength of their brands and increasing and actively expanding their connection with customers.\nInternally, our management teams are continuing to drive operational excellence, manage costs in line with revenue and monitor changes in the macro environment. Given the uncertainty of the current environment, we're expanding the range of full year 2025 organic growth to between 2.5% and 4.5% and maintaining our adjusted EBITA margin guidance to 10 basis points higher than the 15.5% we achieved in 2024. Nothing about the current environment impacts our confidence in our business and strategy or our ability to create new services and win new business.\nOn the technology front, AI is touching every aspect of how our people work. It augments our insights and creativity, increases the speed and volume of personalized content, raises the level of effectiveness in targeting customers, expands the knowledge of our talent, and makes our operations more efficient. All of this is driving transformative outcomes for our clients. Much of this is enabled by Omni AI, our open source platform that leverages the industry's leading generative AI models for text, graphics, video and audio trained for our agency-specific use cases in areas such as strategy, content and creative.\nThousands of our people use Omni AI, and we expect to add more users with the goal of having it on the desktop of every client-facing Omnicom employee by the end of the year. At this point, most advances are to provide state-of-the-art tools to our employees. We expect that as AI tools become more reliable and are deployed to more clients, that it will result in measurable efficiencies for our business. This work directly contributed to recent recognition. In March, we were named a leader in the Forrester Wave for Marketing, Creative and Content Services. Omnicom Precision Marketing Group and Omnicom Advertising Group were recognized for their strong strategic and current offering, respectively.\nThis evaluation followed Omnicom being named a leader across 2 other recent Forrester evaluations, Media and Commerce. Omnicom is the only company named a leader in Forrester Wave reports for content, commerce and media in 2024 and 2025. Several of our agency networks are also recognized for their outstanding performance during the quarter.\nOn AdAge's A-List, OMD was named Media Agency of the Year and GSD&M was recognized as an agency standout. TBWA was named to Fast Company's Most Innovative Company list for the sixth time. PHD won Adweek's Global Media Agency of the Year for the second consecutive year after successfully defending $4 billion in business while reengineering its strategy for an AI-powered future. I want to congratulate everybody on these achievements.\nTurning now to our proposed acquisition of Interpublic. We made progress throughout the quarter. In March, along with Interpublic, we received overwhelming support from our respective stockholders when they voted to approve the proposed transaction. This strong support confirms the immense opportunity of having complementary assets come together to create an unmatched portfolio of talent, services, products and platforms.\nWe also made progress on the regulatory approval front. In the last 5 weeks, we've received approval from 5 of the 18 jurisdictions under review. In the months ahead, we will continue to work on obtaining all the necessary regulatory approvals. We remain on track to close in the second half of 2025. We continue to develop plans for integrating our businesses with Interpublic. We have successfully organized our portfolio at Omnicom by aligning our agencies into marketing disciplines or practice areas, to strengthen our depth of expertise and capabilities and to enhance collaboration across the group. This structure provides a seamless path for bringing together our operations with Interpublic, adding deeper expertise and capabilities to each practice area following the closing of the acquisition.\nMoreover, across the board, our practice areas will be underpinned by the best-in-class tech and data platforms, including Acxiom, Omni, and Flywheel Commerce Cloud, a combination that will position us to thrive in an AI-driven future. Finally, we've made progress on our integration planning work, which will help us meet our targeted $750 million in run rate cost synergies following the closing of the proposed transaction. As I've discussed in February, we have clearly identified areas of synergy opportunity, and our integration planning is well underway to ensure we achieve our targets. We believe our multiyear plan and the successful acquisition of Interpublic will create significant shareholder value.\nIn closing, we had a good start to the year and are focusing on servicing our clients in these unsettled times and are on track to close the acquisition of Interpublic in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We delivered solid results this quarter, including organic revenue growth, growth in adjusted EBITA, and growth in non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS. We believe that the diversification of our portfolio of agencies across geographies, industries, and service offerings will help us in the uncertain environment ahead.\nLet's begin with a brief overview of our earnings for the quarter on Slide 3. Reported revenue grew 2%. Note, our total reported operating expenses include $33.8 million of IPG acquisition-related costs in the first quarter of 2025. At the bottom of this slide, the non-GAAP measures remove these IPG acquisition-related costs from adjusted EBITA, which was also up 2%, and the related margin was flat with last year at 13.8%.\nNow let's go into a more detailed review of our performance, beginning with changes in revenue on Slide 4. Organic growth in the quarter was 3.4%. The impact on revenue from foreign currency translation decreased reported revenue by 1.6%, a bit less than our original expectation for the quarter of 2.0% to 2.5%. And the current environment is difficult to forecast, the impact of FX rates on our future revenue for the rest of 2025.\nIf rates stay where they were at quarter end, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation on revenue will be negative 0.5% for Q2 2025, negative 1% for Q3, and flat in Q4, which would result in a negative 1% reduction for the full year 2025. The net impact of acquisitions and dispositions on reported revenue was negative 0.1%. At this time, we expect the impact of acquisitions and dispositions completed to date will be minimal for Q2 and for the full year 2025.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and review the quarterly organic revenue growth trends by discipline. First, however, I'd like to point out a change we made for 2025. In connection with the rollout of Omnicom Production and Omnicom Advertising Group, we've made some minor reclassifications of certain revenue related to changes in the agency groupings across our service discipline categories. You can find the revised revenue by discipline presentation with the reclassifications of the historical 2024 and 2023 numbers in the appendix on Slides 21 and 22.\nTurning to the quarter. Media & Advertising was up 7%, driven by strong growth in our media businesses across our geographies and mixed performance across our advertising agencies, which were down a bit. Precision Marketing grew 6%, driven primarily by strong performance in the U.S., partially offset by mixed performance in other geographies. Growth reflects strength from the benefits of new business wins in our CRM agencies that began late last year as well as continued good performance at Flywheel.\nPublic Relations declined 5% due to certain client delays and reductions from certain government clients. As the year progresses, we expect benefits from public affairs activity in our specialty agencies, and we expect a difficult comp for the rest of 2025 related to the benefit in 2024 from U.S. election-related spend. Execution and support grew 2%, driven by growth at our custom communications businesses, offset by declines at our merchandising business.\nExperiential declined 1%, driven by the Middle East and Asia Pacific, partially offset by strong growth in the U.S., Europe, and the U.K. We also expect a difficult comp in Q2 and Q3 related to the benefit in 2024 from Olympics-related spend. Healthcare revenues were down 3% as expected, slightly better than the decline in Q4 as our health group manages through some delays in client product launches and as they complete cycling on a client loss. We expect improved growth in the second half as the year progresses.\nBranding and retail commerce was down 10%, with most of the decline in our branding business, which was due to uncertain market conditions impacting both new brand launches and rebranding projects as well as the continued slowdown from M&A activity.\nTurning to organic revenue growth by geography on Slide 6. Our largest market, the U.S. had organic growth of 5%, and Latin America grew a strong 15%. Europe experienced growth but it was mixed by market. And Asia Pacific also posted growth, offset by declines in the U.K. and the Middle East and Africa. As we look at the global trade uncertainty, we expect our geographic diversification to provide balance to our results. The U.S. remains approximately half of our revenue, and it's worth noting that in fiscal year 2024, China was only 2% of our total revenue.\nSlide 7 is our revenue by industry sector for the quarter. There were no notable changes to discuss. Now let's move down the income statement and look at our expenses on Slide 8. In the quarter, salary-related service costs were down on both a reported and constant dollar basis, driven by our continued efficiency initiatives and ongoing changes in our global employee mix. Our Q1 2025 employee base is down from Q1 of 2024.\nThird-party service costs grew in connection with the growth in our revenue, primarily in the Media & Advertising discipline. Third-party incidental costs, which are out-of-pocket costs billed back to clients at our cost also grew in connection with revenue growth. Occupancy and other costs were flat. These include office rent, other occupancy, technology and general office expenses. SG&A expenses increased due to the $33.8 million of IPG acquisition-related costs in the first quarter of 2025. Excluding these costs, reported SG&A expenses declined by about 1%.\nPlease turn to Slide 9 to look at our income statement in more detail. Excluding the acquisition-related costs from the first quarter of 2025, non-GAAP adjusted EBITA grew 1.6%, and the related margin was flat at 13.8% compared to last year. Foreign exchange translation reduced EBITA by approximately 1.5%.\nMoving down the income statement. Net interest expense in the first quarter of 2025 increased $2.6 million to $29.4 million. This increase is the result of having a full quarter of interest expense in Q1 2025 from the debt we issued in early March 2024 in connection with the Flywheel acquisition. The increase in expense was partially offset by an increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances.\nOur income tax rate was 28.5% in Q1 of 2025 compared to 25.7% in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to the nondeductibility of certain acquisition-related costs in 2025. Excluding the tax impact on these costs, our Q1 2025 rate was up a bit from Q1 2024 at 26.7%. For full year '25, we expect the rate to be between 26.5% and 27%.\nAverage diluted shares outstanding were down 1% from Q1 of 2024 due primarily to repurchase activity last year. Reported diluted earnings per share was down 8.8% due to the after-tax acquisition-related costs. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share increased 2% to $1.70. The effects of foreign currency translation reduced diluted EPS by $0.02.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for a look at free cash flow for the first quarter. The year-over-year decline in the quarter was driven primarily by a reduction in net income, which includes the impact of the acquisition-related costs. However, for the 12 months ending March 31, 2025, our free cash flow increased 3.5%, driven primarily by improved operating income and net income. Our free cash flow definition excludes changes in working capital. Our working capital followed its normal seasonal pattern in the first quarter. And over time, we expect to trend back towards our historical annual level that's close to neutral.\nRegarding our primary uses of free cash flow for the 3 months ended March 31, we used $138 million of cash to pay for dividends to common shareholders and another $13 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $30 million. As expected, the spend was a bit higher this period, reflecting ongoing investments on our strategic technology platform initiatives. Total acquisition payments, which include earnout payments and the acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests were $4 million. As a reminder, in the first quarter of last year, we closed on the acquisition of Flywheel for $845 million, net of cash acquired.\nFinally, our share repurchase activity was $81 million, excluding proceeds from stock plans of $12 million. For full year 2025, we still expect to return to an annual repurchase level of approximately $600 million. And we resumed our activities subsequent to the successful March 18 stockholder vote on the IPG acquisition.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of Q1 2025, the book value of our outstanding debt was $6.1 billion, flat with the same prior year period. We have no maturities in 2025 and expect to address our April 2026 maturities after the expected closing of the IPG acquisition in the second half of 2025. We estimate that net interest expense will increase by $2 million to $5 million in Q2 compared to Q2 of 2024, and by $15 million to $20 million for the full year related to lower estimates of interest income in the second half.\nOur cash equivalents and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.4 billion. We continue to maintain an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program. We will assess our revolver capacity in connection with the closing of the proposed IPG acquisition.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended March 31, 2025. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 20%. Our return on equity was 37%, both of which reflect our strong performance and strong balance sheet. The year-over-year change is driven by the IPG acquisition-related costs incurred in the 12 months ended March 31, 2025. I will now ask the operator to please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

My name is Audra, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Omnicom Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions].\nAt this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Greg Lundberg, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H.

After our prepared remarks, we will open the line for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 results were very strong, and we are well positioned as we enter 2025. After I finish commenting on the quarter and the year, I'll provide you an update on the proposed acquisition of Interpublic. Organic growth was 5.2% for the quarter this was driven by a very strong performance in our 3 largest disciplines. Media & Advertising, Precision Marketing and Public Relations. Our strong finish to the year resulted in an organic growth of 5.2% for the full year, which exceeded the high end of our guidance. Adjusted EBITA margin for the fourth quarter was 16.7%. For the full year, adjusted EBITA margin was 15.5%, in line with our target. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $2.41, up 6.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\nIn 2024, our cash flow continued to be very strong. We generated almost $2 billion in free cash flow and returned over $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year, we continued to expand and deepen our capabilities. with the acquisition of Flywheel and the formation of 2 new strategic practice areas, Omnicom Production and Omnicom Advertising Group. Using our Omnicom Operating Platform, our teams across practice areas can connect these services leveraging high-fidelity data sets and custom AI tools to plan, create, target, optimize and attribute campaigns with a single workflow. We are the unrivaled leader in linking marketing to sales allow us to deliver measurable outcomes that drive substantial growth and ROI for our clients. Our success year after year also leads to our industry recognition.\nTBWA was recently named Adweek's 2024 Global Agency of the Year. COMvergence announced that Omnicom Media Group had the highest billing growth rate among all media groups in 2024. Wins like Amazon, Unilever and HP fueled over $7 billion in new business. Omnicom Media Group also ranked first in client retention rate through the year. Additionally, Omnicom's Media Group achieved the highest rating in Forrester's 2024 Media Management Services Wave, specifically emphasizing the group's transparent business practices. Finally, for the second year in a row, Omnicom was named Holding Company of the Year by MediaPost.\nI'm very pleased with our strategic progress and the financial results in 2024. We entered 2025 in a very strong position. given it's early in the year, we're exercising a level of caution on our outlook for 2025. As of now, we expect organic growth to be between 3.5% and 4.5% and adjusted EBITA margins to be 10 basis points higher than what we achieved in 2024. I want to express my gratitude to our people around the globe for helping us finish the year on a high note. Your unwavering dedication to delivering exceptional work to our clients, places Omnicom [indiscernible] agencies in an excellent position as we enter the new year.\nLet me now shift to the proposed acquisition of IPG and our progress since the announcement on December [ 29 ]. While we are incredibly excited about the combination of the 2 organizations, I want to emphasize that Omnicom and IPG continue to operate as independent businesses until the transaction is finalized. Omnicom's solid foundation and organizational structure positions us to seamlessly integrate IPG and into our group once the acquisition closes. Combined, our complementary cultures and businesses will create an unmatched suite of services and products for our clients, leading to significant revenue growth potential.\nAfter closing, we expect diluted earnings per share accretion, driven by strong revenues, expanding margins and a strong balance sheet. Our combined free cash flow will also be substantial and we expect to increase our historical capital allocations for dividends, share buybacks as well as investments necessary to maintain our leading position in technology, data and AI including the integration of Acxiom, Omni and the Flywheel platform.\nFor decades, Acxiom has established itself as the gold standard for managing clients' first-party data in some of the most highly regulated industries. Acxiom's client contracts are multiyear ranging from 4 to 6 years. Its clients include 7 of the top 10 retail banks, 9 of the top 10 credit card issues, and 3 of the top 5 pharmaceutical manufacturers and several automotive companies.\nWhen these leading first-party data management capabilities are integrated with Omni and Flywheel Commerce Cloud, we will provide the most accurate identity solution and comprehensive understanding of consumer behaviors and transactions on the buy side. This platform will drive the industry towards a high standard of metrics linking ad spend, sales and value-based outcomes.\nRegarding synergies, we're confident in our ability to achieve the projected $750 million in run rate cost savings. Importantly, these cost synergies will not impact employees dedicated to servicing our clients and generating revenues. Instead, they will arise from streamlining the holding company, middle office and regional positions as well as from eliminating duplicative overhead, back office and third-party expenses across our larger combined global footprint. The combined company will generate approximately 85% of its revenues from its top 10 markets with the remainder primarily distributed across an additional 40 markets worldwide. After closing, we plan to continue to support IPG's advertising brands on marketplace while aligning them with the current operating structure of Omnicom Advertising Group.\nMore specifically, in our top 10 global markets, agency brands will continue to be fully present in order to drive growth. The remaining markets will function under a single OAG leader who will manage the agency brands at a local level and report to a regional OAG lead. Similarly, it is our intention that IPG's other advertising and marketing services businesses will be aligned within our respective practice areas. This will enable us to combine and expand our talent, equipping them with dedicated technology and data tools in a single practice area to optimally deliver services and products to our clients.\nIn assessing talent, we will adopt and protest on selecting the best individuals across the organizations, irrespective of their current affiliate. With unified practice area leadership teams at a global, regional and country level, we will eliminate redundant roles, functions and back office operations, which we expect will generate [indiscernible] exceeding $130 million. Our larger portfolio of clients and businesses will enable us to combine our efforts and leverage a more centralized technology and data platform, significantly improving capital efficiency across a larger enterprise. Additionally, more resources will be available for future investments. We expect this will result in initial savings of approximately $25 million in administrative costs. The largest cost savings will result from merging 2 publicly traded companies. We will combine and streamline [indiscernible] leadership and operation teams across finance, accounting, IT, legal, real estate and HR.\nAdditionally, we will eliminate duplicative G&A costs. We expect to cut approximately 40% of the company's combined corporate expenses, resulting in compensation savings of around $200 million and G&A savings of about $110 million. Establishing a unified procurement organization to maximize benefits from third-party vendors in key areas such as IT software and infrastructure as well as duplicative third-party research and data is projected to save more than $150 million. Integrating our internal IT and shared service organizations will improve the way we deliver services to our employees and reinforce our infrastructure and platforms. We expect to realize synergies of approximately $70 million across these areas.\nAligning our real estate portfolio, following the closing will yield approximately $65 million in savings, which amounts to less than 10% of the combined total rent and occupancy costs. Not included in our synergy projections are the following 3 areas: revenue opportunities, near and offshoring and automation. We believe revenue growth opportunities are substantial from the combination. We will expand client opportunities on day 1 by offering our combined client base a broader suite of products and services. For example, the capabilities of Flywheel, Acxiom and our Precision Marketing Group, will be available to a much broader set of clients. Additionally, the combined company will drive greater product and service innovation creating new revenue streams. Following the closing, we will continue leveraging our [indiscernible] and offshore global centers of excellence to improve service delivery and lower labor costs.\nIn 2024, we established 4 State-of-the-art Centers of Excellence in India and expanded our nearshore operations in Latin America. We quickly scaled up teams for a Flywheel out of that acquisition and we are now ready to capitalize on a significantly larger opportunity with into public. Finally, Omnicom is making significant progress in utilizing automation by leveraging new processes, platforms and AI. We have a dedicated [ central ] team spearheading our automation initiatives and expect to expand our efforts in this area following the closing of the acquisition.\nAs a result, I'm quite comfortable with the $750 million in synergies targeted at the time of the announcement. We anticipate identifying even more savings once the companies are combined. Going forward, we plan to provide regular updates on our progress towards this target. Regarding our efforts to close the transaction, we are well into the shareholder approval and regulatory review process. Our proxy reflective last week and a shareholder vote to approve the transaction is set for March 18. We also initiated the process for antitrust approval in the U.S., and we're pleased with the progress we are making. The planning for regulatory approval in 17 other jurisdictions is progressing well. While predicting the exact timing is challenging, we still anticipate the deal closing in the second half of 2025.\nIn the coming months, we will provide further updates on our regulatory approvals. In the meantime, we're committed to maintaining our momentum. We are utilizing the time we have to plan for the integration and keeping it to a small slice team. This will eliminate distractions for our people and ensure our client-facing teams stay focused on their day-to-day roles.\nThank you for listening to our call, and I'll now turn it over to Phil.\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As you just heard, we had a strong quarter, and our financial performance positions us well for a solid 2025. Let's begin with a review of our performance in the fourth quarter, beginning with changes in our revenues on Slide 4.\nOrganic growth in the quarter was strong at 5.2%. The impact on revenue from foreign currency translation decreased reported revenue by 0.6%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will reduce revenue by 2% to 2.5% for Q1 2025 and 2% for the full year 2025. The net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue on reported revenue was positive 1.8%. At this time, we expect the impact of acquisition and disposition revenue will be flat for both Q1 and the full year 2025.\nFor the full year 2024, our organic revenue growth was 5.2%, slightly above our stated goal, achieving the higher end of our target of between 4% to 5%. John mentioned, our expected organic revenue growth in 2025 is a range of 3.5% to 4.5% based on current market conditions.\nLet's turn to Slide 5 and review the Q4 organic revenue growth trends by discipline that are informing our annual outlook. During the quarter, Media & Advertising was up 7% and primarily reflected growth across our Media business with growth in advertising in the low single digits. Growth in this discipline was particularly strong in the United States, our largest market. Precision Marketing growth of 9% was very strong and benefited from year-end project spend. Overall, this was led by double-digit growth in the U.S., partially offset by mixed performance in other geographies. We expect solid growth in 2025.\nPublic Relations grew 10%, also led by double-digit growth in the U.S. as a result of U.S. election spend, which was partially offset by softer performance internationally. This brought annual growth to approximately 4%. We have made that the benefit from election spend was approximately $25 million in Q4 and $50 million for the year.\nExperiential growth of 5% was solid, coming off good results from the Summer Olympics earlier this year, especially in Q2 and Q3 as well as Q1. We do not expect to see 2024 growth levels in '25, given it is not Olympic year. Execution & Support was up 2% reflecting continued good results in fuel marketing, offset by declines at our merchandising business. Healthcare revenues were down 4%. We're close to lapping a significant client loss and recent wins should start contributing to improved performance during the second half of 2025. Branding & Retail Commerce declined by 12%, resulting from reduced client spending in our [indiscernible] agencies and lower performance in retail commerce, some of which reflects budget allocation where clients move spend to retail media.\nTurning to organic revenue growth by geography on Slide 6. Our largest market in the U.S. had organic growth of 10%, finishing off the year on a strong note. Although several markets in Europe, the Middle East and Asia Pacific delivered strong growth, they were offset by negative performance in other markets within these regions. Our businesses in Latin America delivered strong growth driven by Media & Advertising.\nSlide 7 is our revenue by industry sector for the quarter and year-to-date. Overall, our portfolio remains stable as well as diversified. The only notable shift is a 2-point increase in consumer products for both the quarter and the year, driven by the Flywheel acquisition.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the quarter, salary-related service costs were flat, with growth from our acquisition of Flywheel offset by repositioning actions in the second quarter and our ongoing efforts to nearshore, offshore and increase productivity. Third-party service costs grew in connection with the growth in our revenue, especially in disciplines that have a higher level of these costs such as Media, Experiential and Fuel Marketing. Third-party incidental costs, which are out-of-pocket costs billed back to clients at our cost were up slightly. Occupancy and other costs, which include office rent, other occupancy, technology and general office expenses, increased primarily due to the Flywheel acquisition. SG&A expenses decreased due to general cost management. Included in the fourth quarters of both years are approximately $14.5 million of acquisition-related costs, the Flywheel in 2023 and the IPG transaction in 2024.\nPlease turn to Slide 9 and look at our income statement in more detail. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, reflect these acquisition costs related to IPG and Flywheel, respectively. We're moving them from both years. Fourth quarter non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6%, and EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year at 16.7%. For the full year 2024, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.5% compared to 15.6% in 2023, in line with our guidance for 2024, balancing ongoing cost savings initiatives with continued investments in technology platforms and tools for future growth as well as costs related to the integration of Flywheel.\nFor the full year 2025, on a stand-alone Omnicom basis, we expect adjusted EBITDA margin to improve by 10 basis points as we continue to balance cost savings initiatives, the strategic investment opportunities that we believe will continue to drive strong future revenue and EBITDA growth.\nMoving down the income statement. Interest expense in the fourth quarter of 2024 increased by $11.3 million to $38.1 million. The change was driven by a $12.4 million increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding debt primarily from the $600 million of euro bonds we issued in Q1 2024 in connection with the Flywheel acquisition, offset by a $1.1 million increase in interest income due to higher average cash balances. Our income tax rate of 26.4% in Q4 '24, was flat with the prior year. For the full year 2025, we expect the rate to be between 26.5% and 27%. Net income growth of 5.2% coupled with few diluted shares outstanding from our share repurchase activity drove a 6.1% lift in diluted earnings per share. On an adjusted basis, excluding after-tax amortization, Q4 2024 diluted earnings per share was up 6.6% to $2.41. Note that the negative impact of foreign exchange translation resulted in a reduction of $0.02 per share also on an adjusted basis for Q4, and $0.05 per share for the full year.\nNow please turn to Slide 10 for a look at free cash flow. For the year, our free cash flow grew 4.2%, driven primarily by improved operating income and net income. Free cash flow definition, like other peers, excludes changes in working capital. Full year 2024, our working capital improved once again by 50% to a use of $231 million, as you can see on Slide 18. We expect our strong performance will continue and bring us back over time toward our historically neutral annual level.\nRegarding our primary uses of free cash flow for full year 2024, we used $553 million in cash to pay for dividends to common shareholders and another $85 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders, both roughly the same level as 2023. Our capital expenditures were $141 million. Levels were higher in 2024, reflecting ongoing investments in Flywheel, our strategic technology platform initiatives and invest in our facilities. Total acquisition payments, which include earn-out payments and the acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests were $998 million, which primarily reflects the acquisition at the beginning of the year of Flywheel for $845 million, net of cash acquired and the late September acquisition of LeapPoint.\nFinally, our share repurchase activity was $371 million, excluding proceeds from stock plans of $102 million, which is in line with our expectation that repurchases will be lower than our recent historical average of approximately $600 million due to the Flywheel acquisition. For full year 2025, we expect to return to the $600 million repurchase level.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of 2024, book value of our outstanding debt was $6 billion up from the end of 2023. Changes during the year included the issuance of $600 million, 3.7% euro notes related to the Flywheel acquisition as well as the issuance of $600 million, 5.3% U.S. dollar notes which was used for most of the [indiscernible] $750 million, 3.65% U.S. dollar notes in November.\nLooking forward, we have no maturities in 2025 and expect to address our April 2026 maturities after the expected closing of the IPG acquisition in the second half of 2025. We estimate net interest expense to increase in Q1 of 2025 by approximately $7 million reflecting the full quarter impact of the euro notes we issued in February of 2024 and an expected increased pension-related interest expense. We also estimate that net interest expense will increase by $15 million to $20 million for the full year primarily related to lower estimates of interest income beyond Q1.\nCash equivalents and short-term investments at September 30 were $4.3 billion in line [indiscernible] at the end of 2023. We continue to maintain an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program. We will assess our revolving capacity in connection with the closing of the proposed IPG acquisition.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on [indiscernible] performance metrics for the 12 months ended December 31, 2024. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 25%. Return on equity was 38%, both of which consistently reflect our strong performance and a strong balance sheet.\nSlide 13 is a summary of the potential IPG acquisition, which highlights we believe are the very compelling merits of the transaction. As John discussed, we believe the combination will drive exceptional future growth opportunities.\nIn closing, 2024 was a very solid year for Omnicom. We delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2%, adjusted EBITDA growth of 6.1% and adjusted EPS growth of 5.5%. We made important investments in our platforms while maintaining our strong adjusted EBITDA margin level. Our free cash flow grew by over 4%, and we significantly reduced our use of operating capital. We executed 2 key financings closed on strategic acquisitions and announced the transformative acquisition of IPG.\nI will now ask the operator to please open up the lines for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to your host, Gregory Lundberg, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our website, omnicomgroup.com, you'll find a press release and the presentation covering the information that we're going to review today. An archived webcast will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we've included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2023 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials.\nWe will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. And after our prepared remarks, we will open the line for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to share our second quarter results. Organic growth was very strong at 5.2% for the quarter. The U.S. grew at 6.3%. Across our disputes, advertising and media as well as experiential all had outstanding performances.\nNon-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3% for the quarter, which excludes the effect of the severance costs related primarily to the formation of Omnicom production. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, which excludes the after-tax effect of the amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles and the severance costs I just discussed was $1.95, up 4.8% versus the comparable amount in 2023.\nOur cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong. We're pleased with our financial results for the quarter and the first half and are maintaining our full year organic revenue growth target of between 4% and 5%, and full year 2024 EBITDA margin target of close to flat with 2023. Phil will cover our results in more detail during his remarks.\nWe made progress across several areas throughout the quarter. We expanded our end-to-end generative AI solution, grew our e-commerce offerings, launched the new production practice area and secured numerous prominent client wins. Last year at Omnicom, we unveiled Omni 3.0, the next generation of Omni powered by Gen AI. We also announced first-mover collaborations with Adobe, Amazon, Getty, Google and Microsoft's OpenAI to gain early access to their large language models. Just over a year later, we are seeing these generative AI platforms, tools and partnerships being activated throughout every area of our business, from strategy to creative, to production, media and precision marketing.\nOne example is TBWA's launch of collective AI, a suite of AI tools available to its employees and clients. Collective AI automates and drives efficiencies in basic tests and provides AI-driven insights, allowing our teams to dedicate more time to helping brands bring distinctive products, services and experiences to market. Collective AI includes custom applications, leverages TBWA's extensive archives, using large language models and is powered by Omni's first-mover generative AI partnerships.\nAnother example is the recent launch of ArtBotAI, our intelligent content orchestration platform. Leveraging models powered by Omni, ArtBotAI assembles clients' digital assets to create and deliver high-quality personalized experiences to consumers at scale, maximizing the value of client's creative content as well as the precision and performance of their media investments. These developments highlight the success of our generative AI strategy, which is to provide our agencies Omni commlide tools and capabilities that can be used to make our people more effective and our operations more efficient, and to drive transformative outcomes for our clients.\nDuring the quarter, we also continued to execute our strategic plans to further expand our market-leading retail media and e-commerce capabilities following the acquisition of Flywheel. At Com, we announced a collaboration with Amazon Ads that enables our media teams to access Amazon's browsing, shopping and streaming insights to directly tie linear and CTV investments to purchases made on Amazon. Essential to this partnership are Flywheel's products and transactional signals, which are paired with Omni's audience and viewership data. This connection results in more effective marketing investments and increased ROI for our clients.\nAlso Com, Flywheel certified with TikTok shop, enabling us to connect creator content to product sales so we can measure marketing performance. These additions to our e-commerce offerings follow Omnicom's designation as a leader in the Q2 2024 Forrester Wave for commerce services. Our prominent position in the market is a testament to the early success of our acquisition of Flywheel aligned with the omnichannel capabilities of Omnicom Commerce Group and the MarTech consulting capabilities of Omnicom's Precision Marketing Group.\nIn June, we announced the formation of Omnicom Production, a new practice area that combines our global production units. Omnicom Production provides best-in-class content production services throughout a network of studios powered by data-driven insights and the latest technologies. The centralization of our production agencies will improve how we deliver content to clients in a simpler, more integrated and more effective way.\nMore importantly, Omnicom Production now has the breadth of capabilities to pursue a significant amount of incremental production revenue growth as we consolidate investments in new technologies and products that will provide better, cheaper services to our clients.\nThe group has over 3,000 people across major markets worldwide. Through the combination of Omnicom content studios, EG Plus, the designer mother Chong, Link 9 and the production departments previously housed within our creative agencies. Sergio Lopez, one of the industry's most awarded creative production leaders is leading Omnicom Production. We're thrilled to have him at the home. This centralized production capability, coupled with ArtBotAI powered by Omni provides the industry's most comprehensive and intelligent content solution that delivers on the promise of mass personalization at scale.\nFrom Gen AI to e-commerce to production, we are continuing to enhance our offerings to meet our clients' needs for better inform strategic insights using AI, creatively inspired content that can be personalized at scale, and investments in targeted media that can be measured through quantifiable outcomes, all delivered in the most efficient and effective manner. Our differentiated capabilities uniquely position us to serve our current and future client needs.\nOur success is reflected through a series of recent client wins. Omnicom Precision Marketing Group won the consolidated CRM business from General Motors. TBWA was awarded the creative account for Carnival. AstraZeneca appointed Omnicom as one of its primary oncology network partners. Flywheel has several account wins, including Canon, Carter's, Lifton and Nestle. Omnicom Media Group won the Media Accounted for GAAP, PhD retained Singapore Airlines and the Volkswagen accounts and more David Jarman's and Pricelines media business.\nOur Media Group's strong showing was underpinned by two of its agencies, OMD and Ph.D., we remained the top 2 media agencies at time lines this year. Congratulations to everybody who played a role in these client wins as well as the award-winning work at Com.\nOverall, we're pleased with our first half financial results and our progress on key strategic initiatives. Looking ahead, we expect stronger second half results in line with our full year organic growth and margin targets. I'm confident we can meet these targets even as we continue to monitor and adapt to changes in the macro environment.\nI'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As you just heard, there are many exciting things underway at Omnicom, and our success is driven by the investments we've made and continue to make in leading tools, platforms and capabilities needed to serve our current and future clients in a rapidly changing marketplace.\nThe strength of our business model is that we continue to make these investments while delivering solid financial results as we did in the second quarter. Let's review our performance beginning on Slide 4.\nOrganic growth in the quarter was strong at 5.2%. The impact on revenue from foreign currency translation, as we expected, decreased reported revenue by 1%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be negative 0.5% for Q3 2024 and for the full year 2024. The net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue and reported revenue was positive 2.6% due primarily to the acquisition of Flywheel this January and partially offset by the cycling of some smaller dispositions. Based on transactions completed to date, we expect the impact of acquisition and disposition revenue will approximate 1.5% for Q3 and for the full year.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, advertising and media growth was once again quite strong at 7.8%, driven by improved performance in advertising and excellent performance on our Global Media businesses. Precision Marketing grew 1.4%. While we saw a strong double-digit performance at Flywheel, some of our project-based consulting agencies within precision marketing and counter delays in client spending this score. We do expect a strong performance starting later in the second half as new wins are brought online and project spend returns to a more normal level.\nPublic relations returned to growth in the quarter and was up 1%. In the U.S., growth was approximately 4%, with a little more than half of that growth driven by U.S. election-related work. Health care grew 2% during the quarter with consistent performance for both our U.S. and international agencies.\nBranding and retail commerce declined by 3.8% as the environment for our branding agencies remains difficult. Experiential grew a strong 17.6%, driven primarily by client work related to the Olympics. And execution and support grew 1.2% with strong performance by our fuel marketing business which was offset by our merchandising business.\nTurning to geographic growth on Slide 6, we had a solid quarter across our regions. Our largest market, the U.S., grew 6.3%. Europe and the U.K. also posted strong growth. Asia Pacific, however, was flat on a challenging comparison to Q2 2023 at our experiential business in China, while Latin America continued its strong growth stream.\nSlide 7 is our revenue by industry sector for the quarter. Results year-to-date were generally stable as usual. Looking at our larger categories, we saw an increase in food and beverage and consumer products as a percentage of the total, driven by Flywheel's client mix, which was not part of our prior year revenue.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the first quarter, salary-related service costs grew with increased staffing levels, which primarily reflect our acquisition of Flywheel in January. However, these costs were down over 1 point as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, reflecting ongoing strategic repositioning actions and changes in our global employee mix.\nThird-party service costs grew in connection with the growth in our revenue, especially in disciplines that have a higher level of these costs such as media, experiential and field marketing. Third-party incidental costs increased along with growth in our business and related out-of-pocket costs billed directly to clients.\nOccupancy and other costs increased year-over-year, mostly due to the Flywheel acquisition. Our rent expense decreased and although total occupancy and other costs increased. They were flat year-over-year as a percentage of revenues.\nSG&A expenses increased year-over-year, primarily from increases in professional fees incurred in connection with our strategic initiatives. As a percentage of revenue on a constant dollar basis, however, SG&A levels were only up slightly.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our income statement in more detail. To start, in Q2, we took a repositioning charge of $57.8 million, which increased our operating expenses. This primarily reflects severance related to efficiency initiatives, including strategic agency consolidation in the smaller international markets of our advertising networks, the start of our centralized production strategy and other efficiency efforts. These initiatives continue. And although we expect some additional steps to be taken in these areas in Q3, we expect them to be primarily self-liquidating. Table on this page shows the impact of this repositioning charge in the second quarter of 2024 as well as the net impact in Q2 of 2023 of the $72.3 million repositioning charge as well as the gain of $78.8 million that we recorded in Q2 of last year.\nOn a non-GAAP adjusted basis, EBITDA grew 5.5% and EBITDA margin was 15.3% versus the comparable 15.5% margin in the second quarter of last year. As discussed last quarter, the relatively small decrease in margin includes the results of our Flywheel acquisition as well as the related integration costs.\nSimilar to last quarter, EBITDA reflects the $21.5 million add-back to operating income, for amortization of acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform intangible assets. We expect similar levels of amortization in the second half of the year. We also continue to expect our full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin to be close to flat with our 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6%.\nMoving down the income statement. Net interest expense for the second quarter of 2024 increased $14.3 million to $41.7 million. The change was driven by a $5.2 million increase in interest expense due to higher outstanding debt from the Flywheel financing and a $9.1 million decrease in interest income due to lower average cash and short-term investment balances.\nOur income tax rate of 26% was close to flat compared to Q2 of 2023. For the second half of 2024, we continue to expect our income tax rate to approximate 27%. Higher income from equity investments was offset by higher expense from earnings attributed to minority interests. And despite a reduced diluted share count, reported earnings per share declined due to the repositioning costs, but on a non-GAAP adjusted basis increased 4.8% to $1.95.\nNow please turn to Slide 11. Free cash flow year-to-date is up 2.4% from last year. We defined free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital. In Q2 2024, our working capital use followed its typical seasonal cycle and decline from Q1 to Q2. And our Q2 performance improved compared to Q2 of 2023 and the first half of 2023. We're making progress as expected, and we continue to work towards our historically neutral levels of working capital.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $279 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $34 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures increased to $62 million which as discussed on prior calls, we expect to be somewhat higher than last year as we continue to invest in Flywheel and our strategic platform initiatives. Total acquisition payments were $829 million, which reflects the $845 million acquisition of Flywheel net of cash acquired. There were no acquisitions in the second quarter.\nFinally, our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds and stock plans was $246 million year-to-date at $70 million in the quarter. Our expectation for the year is unchanged. The total repurchases reduced as a result of the Flywheel acquisition, approximately half of our historical average of $600 million. We continue to maintain our balanced approach to capital allocation with a competitive dividends, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases and an investment-grade balance sheet.\nSlide 12 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the second quarter of 2024, the book value of our outstanding debt was $6.2 billion, up over $600 million from funding a portion of the Flywheel acquisition during Q1 of 2024.\nCash equivalents and short-term investments at June 30 were $2.7 billion, down slightly from last year. We also have an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program. We continue to monitor the credit markets with regard to our $750 million of 3.65% senior notes that are due November 1, 2024. At this point, given where interest rates are and our financing activity early in 2024 and the anticipated refinancing, our current estimate compared to last year is that net interest expense will increase by approximately $7 million in Q3 and $16 million in Q4.\nSlide 13 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended June 30, 2024. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 20% and return on equity was 43%, both of which consistently reflect our strong performance and solid balance sheet.\nI will now ask the operator to please open the lines up for questions and answers."

Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2024 results. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a solid start to the year. Organic growth in the first quarter was 4% with strong growth in our advertising and media and precision marketing disciplines. EBITA margin which excludes amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles was 13.8% for the quarter and operating margin was 13.2%.\nNon-GAAP adjusted earnings per share, which excludes after-tax amortization of acquired and strategic platform intangibles was $1.67, up 3.7% versus the comparable number in Q1 2023. As a result of our strong performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our full year organic growth range to between 4% and 5%. As discussed during the quarter, we raised EUR 600 million through a senior note offering to partially finance the acquisition of Flywheel.\nOur cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong and support our primary uses of cash flow, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. The Flywheel acquisition is off to a great start. Flywheel's Commerce Cloud is fully integrated into Omni. Omni audience and behavioral data, combined with Flywheel's digital marketplace point of purchase transaction data provide us with the most comprehensive data set in the industry.\nAcross several significant Omnicom clients, Flywheel teams are now fully engaged to deliver enhanced value of our combined capabilities and insights to them, including new ways to [ plan and build ] audiences using omni audience data and Flywheel's performance benchmarks [ plus ] funnel investment management built on Omni and enhanced with Flywheel's data specific to performance across commerce platforms. Using omni influencer capabilities and connecting them to commerce and retail outcomes from Flywheel and holistic video measurement and optimization based upon integrating Omni's video viewership data with Flywheel's Commerce outcomes. These products and services are helping our clients sell more goods more efficiently across hundreds of digital marketplaces and optimizing their investment across media platforms.\nIn addition to integrating Flywheel Commerce Cloud, we made important updates to Omni's generative AI functionality during the quarter. This includes completing a first mover partnership with Shutterstock that allows us to integrate its text to image model into Omni. As part of our first mover partnership established with Google and their Vertex AI platform last year, we became the first holding company to receive access to the Gemini 1.5 next-generation model. We remain committed to Omni's open architecture and flexibility, leveraging these valuable partnerships.\nWe've seen notable traction with Omni Assist, the generative AI tool we launched in 2023. Employees for more than 40 markets globally have access to Omni Assist and using it to produce audience intelligence, summarize cultural trends, recommend influences and much more. Some of our agency teams teams are also creating client-specific Omni Assist agency. For example, a client dedicated marketing consultant, media consultant and briefing agent to streamline global, multi-brand client agency planning.\nAs we work alongside our clients to explore how these new technologies can transform their businesses, 2 areas are critical to how we can drive transformation and growth. Our digital transformation consulting business and our content production capabilities. This past month, our highly successful consulting firm, Credera, announced the simplification of its organization to offer clients a more streamlined experience. Its services will now be delivered under a single global brand through 2 primary business units.\nDigital with capabilities in MarTech, e-commerce and digital platforms and consulting with capabilities in management and technology consulting, data, AI and business transformation. Since joining Omnicom in 2018, Credera has grown from 300 employees in 3 U.S. offices to over 4,000 people across 17 locations worldwide. This growth is a testament to our track record and success in acquiring and integrating businesses in new high-growth market segments.\nToday, our clients demand more high-quality, personalized creative content delivered across more media channels and at faster speeds. We have developed standardized platforms and processes to automate the development of content and deliver it at the right time and place to consumers by combining Credera's expertise in designing and implementing intelligent content platforms leveraging our Adobe partnership, [indiscernible], our content orchestration engine and Omni's Audience and Data insights. Our solution provides unmatched outcomes through an open operating system, fueled by customer centricity to some of our most important brands, such as AT&T and Nike.\nI'm pleased that our strategy resulted in industry recognition in the first quarter, including Omnicom being named WARC's #1 holding company for effectiveness, PHD being recognized as Adweek's Global Media Agency of the Year. Omnicom Media Group being recognized Leading Global Media Agency for 2023 with nearly $3 billion in net new business. Although risks and uncertainty continue to exist in the global economic and geopolitical environment, we remain optimistic about our position in the industry, our strategies and our financial performance. I remain confident that our management teams are well prepared to drive operational excellence even as they monitor and adapt to the changes in the macro environment. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We began the year with solid results, and we're optimistic about the year ahead. Let's review the first quarter performance in detail, beginning with revenue on Slide 4. Organic growth in the quarter was 4%. The impact from foreign currency was relatively flat, decreasing reported revenue by 0.1%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be negative 1% for Q2 '24 and flat for the full year 2024.\nThe net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue on reported revenue was positive 1.5% due primarily to the acquisition of Flywheel this January. Based on transactions completed to date, we expect a positive contribution of approximately 2.5% for Q2 and 2% for the year. Now let's turn to Slide 5. And to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, advertising and media growth was very strong at 7%, driven by excellent performance at our Global Media businesses. Precision Marketing, which now includes Flywheel grew 4.3%. We expect this to continue to be one of our fastest-growing disciplines in the future. Public Relations declined by 1.1% in the quarter. We expect this discipline will improve the rest of the year and benefit from the 2024 U.S. elections. Healthcare grew 2.1% during the quarter as we continue to cycle through some client losses from 2023, which we expect to lap after Q2.\nBranding and retail commerce declined by 3.8%, driven by a challenging environment for our branding agencies that are more aligned on project-based engagements and faced a difficult comparison to Q1 of 2023 when they grew by 9%. You'll note that we've updated the name for this discipline, which was formerly called Commerce and Branding. Experiential grew a strong 9.5% led by the U.S. which offset a small reduction in revenue internationally. We expect this discipline to benefit later in the year from the Summer Olympic Games in Paris. And Execution and Support declined by 4.3% with mixed results that overshadowed continued strength in field marketing.\nTurning to geographic growth on Slide 6. We saw growth in 6 of our 7 regions, led by the U.S. and Europe and a strong growth in Latin America, driven by advertising and media. Slide 7 shows our revenue by industry sector. First quarter results were very similar to last year.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the first quarter, salary related service costs grew as a result of increased staffing levels, primarily as a result of our acquisition of Flywheel Digital, but they were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, driven by our repositioning actions last year and through ongoing changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased in connection with the growth in our revenue. The third-party incidental costs increased somewhat, primarily as a result of increases in reimbursed travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs. Occupancy and other costs increased primarily due to our acquisition activity during the period, but were essentially flat as a percentage of revenue due to lower rents as a result of our prior year real estate rationalization.\nAnd SG&A expense was down both in dollar amount and as a percentage of revenue. Now let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our income statement in more detail. Our operating income increased 2.8% and the related margin was 13.2%, down slightly from the prior year adjusted margin of 13.5% arising primarily from our acquisition activity, including Flywheel. As you may recall, our margin estimate this year is based on EBITDA, which we have and continue to use as a measure of operating performance.\nSimilar to our peers and in response to requests from investors, this reflects an adjustment for the amortization of intangible assets. The adjustment now reflects amortization expense related to both acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform intangible assets. Strategic platform intangible assets relate to the costs we are required to capitalize and amortize over future periods in connection with the ongoing development of the Omni platform and the future ongoing development of the Flywheel Commerce Cloud platform.\nThe amortization expense added back to calculate EBITDA does not include amortization expense for internally developed software related to administrative and back-office operations tools, such as ERP or workflow platforms. For the first quarter of 2024, this amortization was $21.5 million, and we expect the remaining quarters of 2024 to approximate this amount. For comparability purposes, we've included a slide in the appendix of this presentation, and it reflects the prior year amortization related to acquired intangible assets and internally developed strategic platform intangible assets for the 4 prior year calendar quarters of 2023 and the full year for 2023 and 2022.\nThe EBITDA in Q1 2024 were $500.4 million, increased 4.1% year-over-year and the related margin was 13.8%. We continue to expect our fiscal year 2024 EBITDA margin to be close to flat with our 2023 adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.6% for the full year. Moving down the income statement. Our income tax rate of 26% was similar to the rate for the first quarter of 2023. For full year 2024, we continue to expect our income tax rate to approximate 27%. Changes in income from equity investments and income attributed to minority interest investments were not significant. As you can see at the bottom of this slide, we have also provided a new line item, non-GAAP adjusted net income per diluted share. Similar to EBITDA, this also excludes the amortization on an after-tax basis that I just discussed related to acquired intangibles and internally developed strategic platform intangibles.\nThis new reporting more closely measures the performance of our operating businesses year-on-year and is similar to our peer group's approach of adding back after-tax amortization expense when calculating non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. For the first quarter of 2024, this metric increased to $1.67 or 3.7% compared to the non-GAAP adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.61 to Q1 2023.\nNow let's turn to cash flow on Slide 10. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for 2024 was $415.1 million, a slight decrease of 3.2%. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $139 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $13 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders.\nOur capital expenditures were $23 million, similar to last year, although we still expect fiscal year 2024 levels to be higher due to growth in capital investment at the newly acquired Flywheel. Total acquisition payments were $812 million, which reflects the $845 million acquisition of Flywheel net of cash required. Finally, our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans was $178 million in the quarter, which is in line with our estimate of total repurchases for the year of approximately half of our historical average given our Flywheel acquisition.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the first quarter of 2024, the book value of our outstanding debt was $6.3 billion, up over $600 million from funding a portion of the Flywheel purchase price. As previously disclosed, we issued EUR 600 million senior notes due March 2032 with a coupon of 3.7%. Net proceeds in U.S. dollars were approximately $643 million. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments were roughly flat at $3.2 billion. We also have an undrawn $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program.\nWe continue to monitor the credit markets with regard to our $750 million of 3.65% senior notes due November 1, 2024. At this point, given where interest rates are and our financing activity early in 2024, we expect that net interest expense for the full year 2024 could increase by approximately $45 million relative to full year 2023.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on 2 important performance metrics for the 12 months ended March 31, 2024. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 22%, and our return on equity was 44%, both reflecting very strong performance. I will now ask the operator to please open up the lines for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference. Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining for the question-and-answer session will be Duncan Painter, CEO of Flywheel Digital; and Paulo Yuvienco, Omnicom Chief Technology Officer. On our website, omnicomgroup.com is a press release and the presentation covering the information we'll review today as well as a webcast of this call. An archived version will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore I start, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements. And these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our '22 Form 10-K and our '23 10-K, which we expect to file shortly.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find a reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We'll begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. And after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the line for your questions. I'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. I'm pleased to report our fourth quarter performance was very strong. For the fourth quarter, organic growth of 4.4% exceeded our expectations and full year organic growth was 4.1%. Excluding acquisition transaction fees related primarily to Flywheel. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.3%. For the full year, operating profit margin adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was 15.2%. Earnings per share for the quarter adjusted for acquisition transaction fees was $2.20, up 5.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2022. For the full year, EPS adjusted for certain non-GAAP items was $7.41, an increase of 6.9% compared to the full year 2022.\nIn 2023, we generated approximately $1.9 billion in free cash flow and returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, share repurchases and acquisitions.\nOn January 2, we closed the acquisition of Flywheel Digital, it is the biggest acquisition in Omnicom's history and bring scaled capabilities in the fastest-growing segments of the industry, retail, media and digital commerce. Flywheel enables brands to sell goods across digital marketplaces such as Amazon, Walmart, Alibaba and more than 100 other marketplaces around the world. Flywheel opens up an entirely new market opportunity for Omnicom, transforming us from an advertising and marketing focused company to a marketing and sales-focused company. We can now seamlessly integrate end-to-end services from brand media to precision marketing to e-commerce and in-store comers, ultimately delivering superior results for our clients.\nIn January, we began combining Omni's audience and behavioral data with marketplace point of purchase sales data in Flywheels Commerce Cloud, giving us an unmatched set of data not only to more effectively drive sales for clients, but to be fully able to measure return on advertising spend. It's a unique offering that no one has been able to achieve and our competitors can't match.\nI'm also proud to inform you that last week, Flywell captured its first significant win as part of Omnicom, winning the highly owned e-commerce business in Europe from one of our competitors. This is a unique partnership and opportunity. In January, we welcomed CEO, Duncan Painter and more than 2,000 Flywheelers around the world to Omnicom, and we are excited about what we can achieve for our clients together.\nIn the fourth quarter, we acquired Coffee and TV, a U.K.-based creative studio that specializes in CGI and visual effects. The acquisition is part of our strategy to leverage the scale of our production operations and launch a holistic suite of global content and production services under a single unit, Omnicom content studios. Omnicom content studios creates content for brands across all consumer experiences and touch points from long and short-form videos to social, experiential, digital and everything in between.\nIn addition to these acquisitions, we continue to invest in high-growth areas through internal investments and partnerships. Last month at CES, we introduced several new ways to offer planning and measurement in the booming area of influencers. We announced several first of the current partnerships with TikTok, Google, Amazon and Meta to optimize the use of influences, seamlessly integrate creator our assets in campaigns and measure influencer-driven commerce.\nIn November, we announced the first mover collaboration with Getty Images that provides us early access to this new generative AI tool. It pairs Getty's library of creative content with Omni's data and AI technology. So our agencies can produce commercially safe and legally indemnified customized images for our clients.\nIn 2023, we launched Omni Assist, a virtual assistant our people use to create, plan and execute ad campaigns using the trove of data in Omni. Omni Assist accesses Open AI's GPT miles through Microsoft. As the first holding company and second company overall to be giving full access to Open AI models in Microsoft Azure environment. we have a significant first-mover advantage, allowing us to experiment, prototype and launch applications within our platform before any other organization.\nHistorically, we've invested tens of millions of dollars in AR. Going forward, Generative AI investments and partnerships to enhance our platforms and educate our knowledge workers are expected to require greater resources. These investments will result in increased productivity and success for our clients. From e-commerce to influencers to Generative AI, we are investing in all the areas that will shape the future of our industry. When these capabilities are combined with our legendary creativity, we remain positioned at the forefront of change in innovation.\nIn new business, we had a very successful 2023. We secured record business with Amazon, [ Beiersdorf ],HSBC, Jaguar, Land Rover, Novartis, Phillips, Telstra, Uber, Under Armour, Vans and Virgin Voyages among others. And we closed the year with exciting news that BMW consolidated its U.S. creative, digital and CRM and its media accounts with us.\nBefore I discuss our outlook for 2024, I want to welcome the newest member of our Board of Directors, Casey Santos, who was recently appointed as an independent Director and a member of the Finance Committee. Casey joins one of the most diverse boards within the Fortune 500. Now at 11 members, our Board is proud to have 7 women and 6 diverse members. Casey's deep expertise in technology makes her a valuable addition to our Board.\nI also want to thank our people around the world for helping us successfully close out 2023. Your dedication and commitment to do outstanding work allow our agencies, clients and Omnicom to succeed. We entered 2024 from a position of strength, supported by our solid financial performance and balance sheet new business wins and key strategic investments in the areas that will drive significant growth in the years ahead.\nWhile we continue to plan cautiously, given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment based on current marketing conditions, we are targeting a 2024 organic revenue growth between 3.5% to 5%. Our range of organic growth during the year will be impacted by new business won in the fourth quarter which doesn't positively impact us until the second quarter and Flywheel's growth, which is typically stronger in the second half of the year. I'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We finished the year on a strong note in terms of revenue growth and profitability, even though the business environment was uncertain in 2023. As we look towards 2024, we're optimistic about the performance of our agencies and an improving economy.\nLet me spend a few minutes reviewing the financial details of the quarter, and then we'll open the lines up for questions and answers.\nLet's start with a review of our revenue performance on Slide 4. Organic growth in the quarter was 4.4%. The impact on foreign currency translation increased reported revenue by 1.2%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be close to flat in Q1 2024 and for the full year.\nThe net impact of acquisition and disposition revenue on reported revenue was negative 0.7%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of '23 of our research businesses. In 2024, we expect a positive contribution beginning in the first quarter with an increase of about 1.5% and around 2% for the full year, reflecting recent acquisitions and are having moved past recent dispositions.\nFor the full year, organic revenue growth was 4.1%. This was in line with our revised guidance of 3.5% to 5%. We made some good progress toward this target despite a challenging comparison to 9.4% growth in 2022 and an uncertain macroeconomic environment during the year. As John discussed, organic revenue growth outlook for the full year 2024 is between 3.5% and 5%.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, advertising and media growth was very strong at 9.3%, once again driven by Global Media performance, which was partially offset by softer results from our advertising agencies. Precision marketing growth contracted 1.1%, reflecting a difficult comp to 11.5% growth in Q4 of 2022 and cycling some client spending reductions from earlier in the year.\nAs we look forward to 2024, we expect this to once again be one of our fastest-growing disciplines. Commerce and branding grew by 1% compared to growth of 7.5% last year. driven primarily by growth in specialty production, offset reductions in the quarter at our branding and commerce agencies. Experiential was down 8%, reflecting a difficult comp of 17% growth in Q4 of 2022 with the FIFA World Cup in Qatar, primarily offset by strong growth in Europe in the quarter.\nWhile quarterly results can be choppy based on the timing of certain client events. Experiential remains a solid business and is important to our clients' marketing plans. Execution and support declined by 0.4%, with mixed results that included a solid performance in field marketing. Public relations declined 2.9% in the quarter. due to difficult comps related to the U.S. midterm elections of 2022 when growth exceeded 12% as well as softness in certain international markets. Finally, Healthcare continued its steady growth of 3.6% during the quarter.\nTurning to geographic growth on Slide 6. We saw growth in our five largest markets offset again by declines in Canada and the cyclical impact of experiential revenue in Middle East and Africa. The U.S. was up 0.6% in the quarter on solid performances by advertising and media, led by media, and our health care businesses, offset primarily by execution and support, public relations and commerce and branding.\nSlide 7 shows our revenue by industry sector for the full year and the quarter. Looking at the full year, which tends to eliminate the volatility of client changes in the quarter. We saw a notable increase of 2 points in automotive and 1 point increases in both food and beverage and financial services. weaker markets in technology and entertainment, which have been discussed widely in the industry over the course of the year, resulted in reductions of 3 points and 1 point, respectively.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 for a look at our expenses. In the fourth quarter, salary and related service costs were higher due to increased staffing levels but were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year, driven by our repositioning actions earlier in the year and through ongoing changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased in connection with the growth in our revenues. We generated profit on these costs and the higher levels in the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to '22 were driven primarily by strong growth in our media business. Our disposition activity during the quarter and the year did not have much of an impact on this cost category. Third-party incidental costs were close to the same level as last year. And reflect client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that a bill declines directly at our cost with no profit.\nOccupancy and other costs were down in both dollar amount and relative to revenue. driven by ongoing rationalizations in our real estate portfolio. SG&A expenses were up primarily due to $14.5 million in professional fees related to acquisition costs incurred in the quarter, the majority of which related to Flywheel. Excluding these costs, quarterly SG&A levels were comparable to last year.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9 and look at our quarterly and annual income statement. To make the numbers more comparable. The table and footnotes describe some of the other adjustments that were made during this year and last year that we discussed on prior calls. Our operating income margin was negatively impacted by $14.5 million of costs in connection with the Flywheel acquisition, as I just discussed. Adjusting for this amount results in an operating income margin of 16.3% and an EBITDA margin of 16.8%.\nFor the full year, our adjusted operating income margin was 15.2%, within our expected range of 15% to 15.4%. As a result of the Flywheel acquisition, we'll have higher levels of amortization expense than past dues, and we will be focusing our margin expectations on EBITDA. We continue to expect integration costs as well as operating synergies and related to the Flywheel acquisition during 2024. And the acquisition will be accretive to diluted EPS adjusted for amortization expense by the fourth quarter.\nFor the full year 2024, we expect adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of reported revenue to be close to flat with last year. Also in this slide, you can see that our non-GAAP adjusted income tax rate of 26% for the full year 2023 and was comparable to 2022. We do not expect the Flywheel business to change our tax rate outlook for 2024, but the 2024 rate will be negatively impacted, primarily related to increases in the statutory rates of certain international countries. For full year 2024, we expect our rates to approximate 27%.\nAcquisition costs related to Flywheel and better performance at agencies with minority shareholders contributed to a decrease in reported net income of 1%, but an increase of 2.1% and on an adjusted basis.\nLastly, adjusted diluted EPS of $2.20 for the fourth quarter increased 5.3% from last year. For the year, adjusted EPS increased by 6.9%.\nSlide 10 is our cash flow performance for the year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.9 billion, an increase of 6.5%. This increase was driven in part from operational improvements compared to 2022 and the use of operating capital, which we expect to improve further in the future.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $563 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $71 million for dividends and noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $78 million, similar to last year. We expect 2024 levels to be higher due to growth investments at Flywheel. Total acquisition payments were $249 million. Although we closed the Flywheel acquisition on January 2, 2024, using cash on hand of approximately $845 million. It remains our intention, as we stated in the October 30 announcement to finance 2/3 of the purchase price with new debt, which I'll discuss in a moment.\nFinally, our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans was $535 million year-to-date within our expected range. Our capital allocation in 2024 will be consistent with our practice of returning cash to shareholders through a healthy dividend, making strategic acquisitions that lead to accelerated growth and using a portion of residual cash to repurchase common stock. Since 2024 began with the closing of a larger-than-normal acquisition, we expect the total share repurchases in 2024 and or approximate 50% of our recent average.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program remains undrawn, and our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $4.4 billion.\nWe will continue to monitor the credit markets throughout 2024, and we expect to enter the debt markets to finance approximately $550 million or 2/3 of the $845 million we spent on Flywheel acquisition. And during the year, we will refinance the $750 million of 3.625% senior notes, which are due November 1, 2024.\nFinancing the Flywheel acquisition will increase our interest expense in 2024. It's also likely that refinancing November notes will increase interest expense by some amount, but it is too early to estimate. For 2024, we expect that our internal financing of the Flywheel acquisition in early January with cash on hand prior to an expected financing of 2/3 of the purchase price, coupled with a decline in global interest rates. Will lead to lower interest income in 2024 compared to 2023.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on two important performance metrics for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023. Omnicom's return on invested capital is 26% and return on equity was 41%, both reflecting very strong performance. Healthy returns like these reflect the strength of our industry our operating discipline and the preservation of our conservative balance sheet. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our third quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn our website, omnicomgroup.com, we've posted a press release along with the presentation covering the information we'll review today as well as a webcast of this call. An archived version will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we've included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation.\nWe will begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. And after our prepared remarks, we will open the line up for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our third quarter results.\nBefore we discuss the quarter, I want to touch on something that is top of mind for many of us. The horrific attacks on Israel and the subsequent war have been devastating to witness. We've seen a complete lack of humanity displayed, and that hate has no place in this world. We morn the innocent lives lost, and our thoughts remain with all those personally impacted.\nTurning to our results. Organic growth was 3.3% for the quarter, which is in line with our expectations. Operating income margin was 15.7%. And diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.86, up 5.1% versus the comparable period in 2022. Our results for the quarter keep us on pace to maintain our full year organic growth target of 3.5% to 5% and our operating margin target of 15% to 15.4%. Phil will cover our results in more detail during his remarks.\nOur cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and our balance sheet remain very strong. During the quarter, we continued to make solid progress on our key strategic priorities to position Omnicom for sustainable and profitable long-term growth.\nStarting on the talent front, we made several key leadership changes as part of our succession planning. Alex Lubar was named Global CEO of DDB Worldwide. Alex served as the Global President and Chief Operating Officer of DDB and succeeds Marty O'Halloran, who will become Chairman. In addition, Glenn Lomas, currently CEO of DDB EMEA, has been elevated to Global President and Chief Operating Officer, in partnership with Alex. Nancy Reyes is moving from her post as CEO of TBWA New York to become CEO of the Americas at BBDO. Nancy succeeds St. John Walsh, who has been with BBDO for 27 years. Guy Marks, previously Omnicom Media Group's CEO of EMEA was named the CEO of PHD worldwide. Guy succeeds Philippa Brown, who is leaving the media industry after nearly 4 decades. Dan Clays, who led Omnicom's Media Group U.K. as CEO, will fill the CEO of OMG EMEA's position.\nI want to congratulate Alex, Glenn, Nancy, Guy and Dan and extend my gratitude to Marty, St. John and Philippa for their many years of service to Omnicom. This series of announcements is a testament to our emphasis on succession planning and ensuring our networks and practice areas have the right teams to lead them into the future.\nDuring the quarter, we continued building our generative AI capabilities with the rollout of Omni Assist, our proprietary version of ChatGPT that enhances every test within Omni. Omni Assist is just one example of how we are improving our capabilities and efficiency through generative AI. We continue assessing how generative AI will affect the way we work across the organization and preparing ourselves for the future.\nWe've broadened our capabilities through strategic acquisitions in high-growth areas in the quarter. In July, Omnicom Media Group acquired Outpromo and Global Shopper, 2 of Brazil's leading connected commerce and retail media agencies. These acquisitions create a dedicated end-to-end e-commerce and retail media performance agency in the Brazilian market for Omnicom Media Group.\nOPRG strengthened its services through the acquisition of PLUS Communications, a top public affairs firm; and FP1 strategies, a leading political consultancy. The Beltway based acquisitions further solidified OPRG's leadership position and portfolio in public affairs and crisis communications, particularly into health care and technology.\nWe recently announced the formation of Omnicom Advertising Services India, comprised of Omnicom's creative agencies located in India, BBDO, DDB and TBWA. Omnicom Advertising Services will be able to offer the best creative capabilities and talent for our clients across the group. The formation of Omnicom Advertising Services India follows the launch of our global delivery services and centers of excellence in India, which we announced earlier this year.\nToday, we have over 4,000 people in global centers of excellence in 4 major cities, supporting our clients and agencies around the world. We are rapidly scaling the operations and expect to triple the size over the next 24 to 36 months. Our centers of excellence are helping our company transform from within, improving our client offerings and providing operating efficiencies.\nWhile we position Omnicom for the long term, we're driving growth through significant new business wins. Some of these wins this quarter include: Omnicom Media Group won the global media business for Uber and HSBC; Beiersdorf selected OMD as its media agency of record for Europe and North America; on the creative front, adam&eveDDB picked up Amazon's creative business in Europe; Omnicom Health Group and our advertising collective also continued to grow their relationship with Novartis, expanding in oncology and winning significantly in pharma, including their renal portfolio; finally, TBWA was awarded the creative duties for Telstra, Australia's largest mobile network.\nOverall, we are pleased with our financial results and our progress on our key strategic initiatives. While we remain optimistic entering the fourth quarter, as in past years, our performance in the fourth quarter will be impacted by the amount of year-end project spend that our clients execute and their agencies are successfully capturing. We continue to plan cautiously given the uncertainties in the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment, including higher interest rates, oil prices, instability due to the wars in Ukraine and Israel, and the continuing risk of a recession in the United States.\nI will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As John said, our business is solid, despite the challenges of the current macroeconomic environment. Before we open the call up for questions and answers, let's go through our third quarter results in more detail, starting with the summary income statement for the second quarter on Slide 3.\nReported revenue increased by 3.9% and organic growth was 3.3%. Reported operating income increased by 2.7% to $560.8 million, and the related margin was 15.7%. Net interest expense was $38.3 million for the quarter, an increase of $9.2 million compared to the third quarter of 2022, due in part to lower interest income on cash and short-term investments. In Q4, we expect that, compared to the prior year, net interest expense will experience a similar increase.\nOur reported income tax rate was 26%. This is lower than our 27% estimate from July due to a reduction in tax expense resulting from the vesting of share-based compensation. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our tax rate will be 27%.\nReported net income in Q3 increased by 2%, and diluted earnings per share was up 5.1% driven by both higher net income and by lower shares outstanding, resulting from share repurchases.\nLet's turn to revenue on Slide 4. As mentioned, organic growth in the third quarter was 3.3%. The impact from foreign currency translation reversed course in the third quarter, increasing reported revenue by 1.7%. If rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be a benefit of approximately 0.5% for Q4 and a reduction of approximately 0.5% for the year.\nThe impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1.1%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of our research businesses. We expect a reduction of 75 basis points for the fourth quarter and expect that the recent acquisitions will result in an increase in reported acquisition and disposition revenue next year.\nAs John discussed, our organic growth outlook for the year remains unchanged at 3.5% with a stretch target of 5%, which still factors in some uncertainty about the level of year-end incremental marketing spend and project work that we expect our agencies will be successfully capturing in the fourth quarter.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the quarter, Advertising & Media posted 6.1% growth, its strongest this year, driven by continued strength in our media business globally. Precision Marketing grew 4.3%, a solid performance given the comparison to the 16.2% growth it experienced in Q3 of '22 and the challenging backdrop of certain of their technology and telecom clients that we discussed last quarter.\nCommerce & Brandon declined by 1.7% driven by reductions at our shopper marketing agencies. Experiential grew 9.2% led by Asia, Europe and the U.K., which offset negative growth in the U.S. and the Middle East. Execution & Support declined 3.6% due primarily to declines in our merchandising business.\nPublic Relations was down 5.5%, reflecting difficult comps against the 12.6% growth we delivered in Q3 of 2022. Approximately half of the reduction relates to less revenue connected to the 2022 election cycle, and the balance was due to the slowing of project spend in the quarter. We expect a similar headwind related to a reduction in revenue in Q4 compared to the benefit from the election cycle in Q4 of 2022. Finally, Healthcare grew 3.8% with good momentum at several large clients.\nTurning to Slide 6. We saw growth across our larger regions, offset by a decline in Canada as well as a decline in the Middle East and Africa, which grew by 12.2% in Q3 of 2022, caused in part by the cyclicality in Experiential.\nLooking at the year-to-date revenue by industry sector on Slide 7. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we had higher relative weights in 2 of our larger categories, food and beverage and automotive and, as expected, a lower relative weight in technology and a reduction, although smaller, in telecom.\nNow let's turn to Slide 8 where you can see good progress on our expenses year-over-year. Salary and related service costs were down as a percentage of revenue year-over-year driven by our repositioning actions and through changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased in connection with growth in our revenues. These costs include third-party supplier costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients. They are an integral part of our service offering to our clients, and we generate profit on them. Third-party incidental costs increased due to an increase in client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that have bill declines directly at our cost at no profit.\nOccupancy and other costs were helped by reductions in our real estate portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. Reductions in rent expense were offset partially by an increase in operating expenses from higher levels of in-office work globally. SG&A expenses were up a bit, primarily due to higher professional fees related to the acquisitions we recently completed.\nTurning to Slide 9. Operating income in Q3 was up 2.7% on a reported basis, and the related margin was 15.7%, down slightly as expected from 15.9% in the third quarter of 2022. For the full year, we remain comfortable with the expected operating margin range of between 15% and 15.4%.\nOn a 9-month year-to-date non-GAAP adjusted basis, as presented here on Slide 9, operating income margin was 14.8% compared to 14.9% in 2022. Our EBITDA margin in Q3 was 16.2%, also down slightly from 16.4% in the third quarter of 2022. On a 9-month year-to-date non-GAAP adjusted basis, our EBITDA margin was 15.3% compared to 15.5% in 2022.\nSlide 10 is our cash flow performance for the first 9 months of the year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital. Free cash flow for the third quarter of 2023 was $1.3 billion, an increase of 9.4% from last year. We continue to expect changes in working capital to be close to flat for the year as it usually is.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $424 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $47 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $64 million, similar to last year. Total acquisition payments were $202 million. And our stock repurchase activity, net of proceeds from stock plans, was $530 million year-to-date. Most of this took place in the first half of the year.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn. And our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.8 billion. Our next debt maturity is not until November of 2024.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on two important performance metrics for the 12 months ended September 30, 2023. Omnicom's return on invested capital was 23%, and return on equity was 47%. These metrics continue to be an excellent indicator of our conservative capital structure and the health of our business.\nIn closing, despite a challenging macro environment, we're pleased with our financial results and our year-to-date organic growth of 4%. We believe we are positioned very well for strong growth in the future when the caution on the macro environment clears.\nOperator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our second quarter 2023 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our website, omnicomgroup.com, we've posted a press release along with the presentation covering the information we'll review today as well as a webcast of this call. An archived version will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2022 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures.

After our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for your questions.\nAnd I will now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to share our second quarter results. Organic growth was a solid 3.4% for the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Adjusted operating income margin was also in line with our expectations at 15.1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $1.81, up 7.7% versus the comparable amount in 2022. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 8.9%.\nOur cash flow continues to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases, and our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong. We are pleased with our financial results for the quarter and first half and are increasing our full year organic growth target to 3.5% to 5% and maintaining our 15% to 15.4% operating margin target. Phil will cover our results in more detail during his remarks.\nOperationally, we had a very successful quarter. We made significant progress on our AI strategy by adding generative AI to Omni, our market-leading technology platform, and entering into significant first-of-a-kind technology partnerships. We enhanced our capabilities and management team in e-commerce and retail media, solidified our position as the most creative holding company in the world at Cannes and completed a couple of important strategic acquisitions.\nWhile we have engaged in AI for over a decade, generative AI will have a profound effect on our industry and Omnicom. We are quickly embracing the technology as we see massive opportunities to boost the productivity of our people and deliver better work to our clients. As with any new technology, we're working closely with our clients to take advantage of the benefits while being mindful of its limitations, risks and privacy concerns. We have a significant competitive advantage in harnessing the power of generative AI through our open operating system, Omni.\nFor over a decade, we've invested in the development of Omni. Today, more than 50,000 people use the platform in over 100 countries, and it houses over 1 billion IDs globally with data from first, second and third parties. Generative AI will turbocharge Omni users by helping them for to deploy and activate this rich set of data. The open architecture of Omni makes it feasible for us to quickly adopt generative AI models from our key tech partners in a scalable, reliable and secure environment. Equally important, our clients remain in control of their first-party data.\nIn June, at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, we announced the launch of Omni 3.0, the next-generation operating system for Omni, where every experience will be powered by generative AI. The experience is delivered through Omni users and is the result of our partnership with Microsoft, which allowed us to be one of the first companies to be given full access to their ChatGPT model.\nOmni Assist is a custom-trained, enterprise-level, Omnicom-proprietary version of ChatGPT that enhances every cash within Omni, including research, creating, planning and executing marketing campaign. Omni Assist will give our agency teams the power to do their jobs more efficiently and focus on high-impact work for our clients.\nFollowing the launch of Omni 3.0, we unveiled several other collaborations at Cannes that will introduce generative AI capabilities directly to our creative work. The first was Google Marketing Cloud, which offered us the unique access to Vertex AI platform and IMAGIN. IMAGIN is a text-to-image model with copyright protections built in, enabling agency and client teams to accelerate the content development process for marketing campaigns.\nNext, we announced we were the first holding company to have access to Adobe's Firefly Creative generative AI models. Combining these models with Omni data, we will be able to embed the power of Firefly into our clients' ecosystems to generate automated content in a brand's unique style and language.\nFinally, we shared our first-mover collaboration with Amazon Web Services. Pairing Omnicom's open operating system with AWS' generative AI services will enable the automation of advertising campaigns and the creative journey development on behalf of our brands. These collaborations feed directly into Omni and will accelerate our generative AI capabilities.\nAlso in Aso Cannes, we further expanded and strengthened our e-commerce and retail media capabilities by launching Omni Commerce, the industry's first connected commerce and orchestration solution. Omnicommerce provides a single, standardized and customizable view of the commerce journey. With the retail media landscape becoming increasingly fragmented, Omni Commerce helps our clients harness the full power of retail media with a holistic view of their ROI.\nIn June, we announced the appointment of Jacqueline Baker as CEO of the Omnicom Commerce Group. Jacqueline succeeds Sophie Dorani, who is stepping down to pursue consultancy and nonprofit opportunities. With over 20 years of commerce and brand-building experience, Jacqueline has an established track record of driving innovation within the commerce landscape.\nWhile we have made substantial progress with Omni and generative AI, it's critically important to note that AI can never replace the inspiration and genius that comes from our people and their creativity. These technological advances will simply make it easier and faster for them to develop and deploy creative ideas.\nThat's why I'm especially pleased we are recognized as the most creative company in the world at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity. Omnicom agencies for more than 40 countries won over 175 Lions throughout the week. Two of our creative networks, DDB and BBDO, placed in the top 3 in the Network of the Year competition with DDB coming in first and BBDO coming in third.\nWe continue to invest in our global creative capabilities. In early July, we announced the acquisition of German-based Gears and Partner, a world-class creative agency headquartered in Hamburg. Kabar's has been named to prestigious industry lists such as Cannes Lion, Top 10 Independent Agencies of the Decade and Campaign U.K.'s world-leading independent agencies. Following the announcement of Gabars and together with certain management changes we recently made, on, Germany's leading industry trade magazine, noted Omnicom has significantly strengthened its position in the world's fourth largest advertising market.\nAlso in July, we expanded our media services through the acquisition of Tamega Media headquartered in London with several offices around the world. Tamega is a specialist agency providing end-to-end media and marketing solutions to financial services brands. The agency's capability within the Omnicom Media Group will enable an unprecedented and singular depth of financial service industry and media planning and buying expertise.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our first half financial results and our progress in key strategic initiatives. While we remain optimistic for the second half of the year, we continue to plan cautiously given the number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic environment.\nI'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As you just heard, we had a solid quarter and first half of the year, and we are on track with our expectations for both revenue growth and operating margin. Let's now go into some more detail on our results.\nStarting with the summary income statement for the second quarter on Slide 3. Reported revenue increased by 1.5% and by 3.4% organically. Reported operating income increased by 1.7%, and operating margin was 15.3%. Reported net income in Q2 increased by 5.1%, and our Q2 diluted earnings per share was up 8.3% on a reported basis.\nDuring the quarter, we recognized a gain of approximately $79 million on the disposition of our research businesses, which were included in our execution and support discipline. We also incurred repositioning costs of approximately $72.5 million related to severance. We have also included Slide 9 in the deck, which summarizes our reported results alongside our non-GAAP adjusted results, which exclude the net impact of $6.5 million pretax from these 2 items. We'll review that analysis in a few minutes.\nLet's now turn to revenues on Slide 4. Our organic growth in the second quarter was 3.4%, which brings our year-to-date organic growth rate to 4.3%. The impact from foreign currency translation only reduced reported revenue by 0.7% compared to a reduction of over 3% in Q1 2023. And if rates stay where they are currently, we estimate the impact of foreign currency translation will be a benefit of approximately 1.5% for Q3 and Q4 and close to flat for the year.\nThe impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1.5%, primarily reflecting the sale in Q2 of our research businesses. We expect a similar reduction of 1.5% for the balance of the year, although acquisitions we have recently completed will moderate this somewhat.\nNow let's turn to Slide 5 to review our organic revenue growth by discipline. During the second quarter, Advertising and media, similar to Q1 of '23, posted 5.1% growth driven by strength in our media business. Precision Marketing grew 2.3%. Certainly clients, especially those in the tech and telecom industries, have become more cautious with their spending as reflected in our tech consulting and transformation agencies. This also reflects in part the business coming off a strong 21% growth comp last year. We expect our investments in generative AI will naturally benefit this discipline, and we expect growth in this discipline to accelerate in the future.\nCommerce and Brand Consulting grew by 2.4% driven primarily by our branding and design consulting agencies. Experiential growth was 9.2% driven by strong results in Europe and France in particular as well as China from clients in the automotive and luxury categories.\nExecution and support revenue fell 3.8% due primarily to declines in our merchandising and fuel marketing agencies. Public Relations was flat in Q2, coming off a 16% growth comp last year, which reflected the benefit of some revenue from the U.S. election cycle that wasn't present this year. Finally, Healthcare performance was solid at 3%, and our outlook for this discipline remains very good over time.\nTurning to Slide 6. We once again grew organically in every region globally. Notably, there was strong growth in Asia Pacific, led by China, which had the benefit of easier comps due to the lockdowns in Q2 of 2022.\nLooking at the revenue by industry sector on Slide 7. Compared to the second quarter of 2022, we had higher relative weights in food and beverage, pharma and health, and automotive, offset by lower relative weights in technology and telecom. Other categories were relatively stable.\nTurning to Slide 8, which is our operating expense detail. You can see a more granular view of our operating expense levels. Slide 16 in the appendix also shows these expenses on a constant dollar basis.\nSalary-related service costs were again down as a percentage of revenues year-over-year. We saw reductions driven by some of our repositioning actions and through changes in our global employee mix. Third-party service costs increased due to an increase in organic revenue, particularly in proprietary media and events. These costs include third-party supplier costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients. They are an integral part of our service offering to our clients, and we generated profit on them.\nThird-party incidental costs, which we began breaking out separately last quarter, decreased a bit compared to the prior year. These costs primarily consist of client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that we bill back to clients directly at our cost at no profit.\nOccupancy and other costs were up slightly in dollar terms but flat as a percentage of revenue. As discussed last quarter, we saw increased occupancy costs associated with higher levels of in-office work, offset by lower rent from the reductions in our real estate portfolio in the first quarter of 2023. SG&A expenses decreased in both dollar terms and as a percentage of revenue due primarily to lower professional fees.\nNow let's turn to Slide 9. As I mentioned earlier, this is a clear presentation which summarizes our reported and non-GAAP adjusted results for both the 3 and 6 months ended June 30. As a reminder, the non-GAAP adjusted amounts for the second quarter of 2023 include a gain of approximately $79 million on the disposition of our research businesses as well as repositioning costs of approximately $72.5 million related to severance for a net impact of $6.5 million pretax.\nOperating income was up 1.7% on a reported basis and up 50 basis points on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. The related operating income margins were 15.3% and 15.1%, respectively, both of which were close to flat with the operating income margin of 15.2% from the second quarter of 2022. For the full year, we're comfortable with the expected range of our operating income margin of between 15% and 15.4%.\nNet interest expense was $27.4 million for the quarter, a reduction of $12.7 million, primarily from higher levels of interest income compared to Q2 of 2022 given comparable higher short-term investing rates were in place in the second half of 2022. The second half of 2023, we expect that net interest expense will be flat to up slightly relative to the second half of 2022.\nOur reported income tax rate was 27%. The non-GAAP adjusted tax rate, excluding the gain, the repositioning costs and the related taxes, was 26.3%. We still expect a rate of 27% for the balance of the year.\nReported net income in Q2 increased by 5.1%, and non-GAAP adjusted net income increased by 4.7%. Our diluted earnings per share was up 8.3% on a reported basis and up 7.7% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Year-to-date reported diluted EPS is up 16.3% and up 9.4% on a non-GAAP adjusted basis. This diluted EPS growth was also driven by lower shares outstanding resulting from share repurchases.\nSlide 10 shows our cash flow performance so far this year. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in operating capital, which historically, we expect to be neutral for the year. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2023 was $880 million, an increase of 14.7% from last year.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $285 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $32 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures were $40 million. Acquisition payments were $55 million, excluding net proceeds from dispositions of approximately $180 million. Our stock repurchase activity net of proceeds from stock plan continued in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date amount to $506 million.\nSlide 11 is a summary of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the second quarter of 2023, the book value of our outstanding debt was $5.6 billion. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter other than foreign exchange translations. Our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn and our cash equivalents and short-term investments were $2.8 billion. Our next debt maturity is not until November of 2024.\nSlide 12 presents our historical returns on 2 key metrics for the 12 months ended June 30, 2023. We generated a return on invested capital of 22% and a return on equity of 46%. These metrics are a strong reflection of the strength of our business and our conservative capital structure.\nSlide 13 is a summary of all our recent technology partnership announcements. As a reminder, our historical development of Omni, our current investments in technology and services that prepare our business for the future are largely reflected in our operating income. We expect to continue to grow our revenues, improve our operations, return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while we manage with the current economic environment. And as John discussed, we continue to prepare for a dynamic future.\nOperator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

I'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & Chief Executive Officer, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to share our first quarter results. As we discussed on our last call, we entered 2023, extremely confident in our strategic and financial position. I'm pleased to report that for the first 3 months of the year, we met our internal revenue and margin targets. Organic growth in the first quarter was 5.2%. Our growth was broad-based across disciplines, geographic regions and client sectors.\nAdvertising and media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations were the largest contributors in the quarter. Adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 13.5%. Non-GAAP adjusted earnings per share was $1.56, up 12.2% versus non-GAAP adjusted EPS for Q1 2022. Our cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong and support our primary uses of free cash flow, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nWe're pleased with our results for the quarter and remain on track to achieve our full year targets of 3% to 5% organic growth and 15% to 15.4% operating margin. Strategically, we continue to invest in our creative leadership with TBWA's recent acquisition of Dark Horses, a London-based award-winning sports marketing agency. Dark Horses operates in a high-growth area and works with a strong roster of global clients and influential sports organizations.\nWhile creativity remains a core part of our culture and organization, we continue to be recognized for our integrated suite of services across Precision Marketing, data, e-commerce and other disciplines. Most recently, our capabilities were highlighted by Ad Age who named us their 2023 Holding Company of the Year. The publication noted that while still creative, Omnicom is a data-driven powerhouse, enabling marketers to transform their businesses using capabilities in e-commerce, consumer experience management, CRM and more.\nOur ability to deliver increasingly specialized integrated services, enables us to expand the work we do for our clients and remain a trusted adviser to them. In fact, in 2022, 100 of our largest clients were served on average by more than 50 of our agencies across different disciplines and geographies. As we move ahead, we continue to look for ways to strengthen our portfolio through acquisitions and investments in high-growth areas such as Precision Marketing, health care, e-commerce, media and PR as well as in our core creative services.\nI'd like to now turn to how we are approaching the new way our people work, which has resulted in changes in our real estate. We created a plan that underlies our belief that our physical offices play a critical role in maintaining culture, inspiring creativity and innovation and promoting professional development. Our approach also recognizes that providing flexibility creates benefits for the health and well-being of our people.\nWith this in mind, we recently announced we are requiring our people to work in our offices a minimum 3 days a week. In practice, many of our agencies are already at or well ahead of this requirement. Many are working a full week in the office. Based on this plan, during the quarter, we made a decision to exit over 1.6 million square feet of office space around the world. Since 2018, we reduced our office footprint by 35%, while our employee headcount has increased by approximately 4,000.\nWe are also experimenting with different approaches to make it easier for our people to return to the office. One example is in the New York metro area, where we are opening 3 satellite offices in Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey. We are also opening new Omnicom campuses in 3 cities in India. Chennai, Gurgaon and Hyderabad as the number of employees in India continues to grow at a significant pace. Phil will cover the financial impact of our real estate actions during his remarks.\nGoing forward, we continue to invest in new modern workplaces that provides the type of environments most effective for collaboration and in-office work. We are also rapidly charting a path of how we use new technologies for the future of work. In the area of generative AI through our large-scale relationship with Microsoft, we have established a dedicated Azure environment with secure enterprise access to the latest OpenAI GPT model.\nThis unique setup is allowing us to responsibly develop new custom and version control models against various use cases within Omni as well as supporting overall automation and transformation efforts. The development includes careful consideration related to all aspects of generative from confidentiality to intellectual property rights, privacy, biases and ethics.\nIn conclusion, we are pleased with how the year has started and remain on track to meet the targets we've set for the year. At the same time, we remain cautious as to how inflation, interest rates, the war in Ukraine, increasing tensions in the Middle East and the recent banking and credit events in the United States could impact the economy and our operations.\nMany of these risks have been evident for quite some time, and we have developed plans to appropriately respond to any potential headwinds and minimize the effect on our financial performance. I will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at the financials. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, Omnicom Group, Inc.\n\nThanks, John. 2023 is off to a solid start in what remains an uncertain year. All of our disciplines and geographies grew organically in the first quarter, and we continue to invest in our operations and took strategic steps to reduce our real estate footprint. And we continued our balanced capital allocation, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nLet's begin with a high-level review of the quarter on Slide 3. As John mentioned, the transition to a flexible working environment with a hybrid model, which allows for partial remote work has resulted in changes to our real estate strategy, and we made the decision to exit certain leases and reduce our office space. While there will be some investments we will be making in existing and new locations, the net impact over time will result in lower rent and occupancy costs.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we took a charge of $119 million related to this reduction in our office lease portfolio. The charge is primarily related to the noncash impairment of a portion of our operating lease right-of-use assets and the write-off of the net book value of leasehold improvements at the affected locations. As a result, rent and occupancy expense will be reduced in the future, and substantially all of the charges will be paid out of the remaining lease terms over the next few years.\nThis slide shows our reported results followed by certain adjustments, which make the periods comparable and the resulting non-GAAP adjusted amounts for both periods. In addition to the real estate charge I just discussed for 2023, operating expenses in the first quarter of 2022 include a $113 million charge arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine.\nIn summary, reported revenues were up 1% and non-GAAP adjusted operating income was flat. Both were negatively impacted by foreign currency translations. Moving down the income statement. Net interest expense improved due to higher interest income than we expected. In Q2, we estimate that interest expense will increase a bit, primarily due to an increase in the interest rate applied to our pension and post-retirement obligations.\nThis will be offset by an expected increase in interest income in Q2 of 2023 relative to Q2 of 2022. Although we do not expect as much interest income in Q2 of '23 as we had in Q1 of '23 due to our working capital cycle, the second half of 2023, we expect that net interest expense will be flat to up slightly relative to the second half of 2022. In Q1 of 2023, the effective tax rate was somewhat lower than our annual guidance of 27% due to a lower effective tax rate related to the real estate repositioning charge and the realization of certain tax benefits and NOLs.\nWe still expect a tax rate of 27% for the balance of the year, as indicated on our February 2023 call. Non-GAAP adjusted net income increased 9%. As a result of share repurchases, our diluted share count declined by 2.5%, and non-GAAP diluted EPS was up 12.2% on an adjusted basis. Without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter increased by approximately 16%.\nNow let's review the quarter in more detail, beginning with the components of our revenue change on Slide 4. Our organic growth was 5.2%. The impact from foreign currency translation was negative and reduced reported revenue by 3.2%, which once again was a bit less than the preceding quarter. Looking forward, we still estimate that the impact will moderate for the remainder of 2023 and will be approximately flat for the year.\nThe impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1%, primarily reflecting the disposition of our businesses in Russia announced near the end of the first quarter of 2022. Given the recent disposition of our small research businesses earlier in April, we expect a similar reduction of about 1% for the balance of the year, prior to any acquisitions we expect to complete later this year.\nMoving on to Slide 5, let's review our revenue growth by discipline. During the first quarter, Advertising and media posted 5.1% organic growth, once again led by strong performance in our media businesses. Precision Marketing had strong growth of 7% organically. We continue to invest in this area, and we see opportunities for future growth in the market for digital customer experience, data analytics and digital transformation services.\nCommerce and brand consulting grew organically by 3.3%, primarily on the strength of our branding and design agencies. Experiential organic growth was 8.4%, led by Europe, the U.K. and the Middle East. Execution and support returned to growth at 3.6%, led by our merchandising and support businesses and offset by a reduction in our research businesses. Public Relations was strong at 5.8%, coming off a challenging double-digit growth comparable in Q1 of '22. Finally, health care grew 4.8%, and we continue to see good growth trends in this business, 2023 supported by new client wins last year.\nPlease note that we made some adjustments to reclassify certain agencies among our disciplines to reflect changes where an agency's current and future capabilities better aligns with our new discipline. Prior periods have been restated to the current presentation. No changes were made to total revenues or total organic growth. For your reference, we've included a slide in the appendix of updated 2022 quarterly and annual revenue by discipline.\nThe impact of the changes on the 2022 presentation by discipline was minor. The only notable change resulting from reclassifying our digital communities agency, which has been more closely aligned with our research capabilities from the commerce and brand consulting discipline to our execution and support discipline. Turning to Slide 6 for revenue by region. You can see that growth was above 5% everywhere except Asia Pacific, where we saw some regional performance challenges impact results.\nIn the U.S., our 5.1% quarterly organic growth was led by Advertising and media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations. International organic growth of 5.4% was led by Advertising and media, Precision Marketing. And our experiential businesses had strong growth outside the U.S., but were flat in the U.S. Regionally, we had positive growth across our top 10 countries with the exception of China. Looking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 7 compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nWe had higher relative weights in food and beverage and auto, offset by a lower relative weight in technology. Other categories were broadly stable. Let's now move down the income statement and look at expenses on Slide 8. Our total operating expenses were flat at $3.1 billion. Salary-related service costs were flat. The increase resulting from organic revenue growth and additional head count was offset by the effects of foreign currency translation.\nAs a percentage of revenue, these costs decreased 1% year-over-year. Third-party service costs, which include third-party supplier costs when we act as principal in providing services to our clients, increased due to an increase in organic revenue. These costs are an integral part of our service offering to our clients. We provided additional operating expense detail this quarter with the addition of the third-party incidental cost line, which primarily consists of client-related travel and incidental out-of-pocket costs that we will back to clients directly at our cost, and we are required to include in revenue.\nThese costs were previously included in the third-party service cost line, and they tend to increase when revenue increases and decrease when revenue decreases. In Q1, they increased due to an increase in revenues. We hope this incremental disclosure will assist in your analysis of our results. Occupancy and other costs were down a bit. They increased slightly due to growth in general office expenses as our workforce continues to return to the office, which was offset by the effects of foreign currency translation.\nSG&A expenses decreased primarily due to lower professional fees and the effects of foreign currency translations. We will reference -- Slide 16 in the appendix presents our operating expense detail on a constant currency basis. Similar to the income statement highlights slide we discussed earlier, Slide 9 presents both the reported and non-GAAP adjusted results of 2023 and 2022 by removing the Q1 2023 real estate repositioning charges and the Q1 2022 charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine.\nOur first quarter 2023 adjusted operating income of $466 million was flat with the first quarter of last year. The related adjusted operating income margin was 13.5% compared to 13.7% in the first quarter of last year. Please turn now to Slide 10 for our cash flow performance. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for the first quarter of 2023 was $429 million, up 26.3% from last year, which included the cash impact of charges arising from the war in Ukraine.\nChanges in operating capital are typically negative in the first quarter and level for the first quarter of 2023 was similar to the last few years. As we look forward for the full year 2023, we continue to expect changes in operating capital to be a source of cash again. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $142 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $13 million for dividends and noncontrolling interest shareholders, both similar to last year.\nOur capital expenditures of $23 million were at normal levels and flat with last year. Acquisition spend, net of dispositions and other items was $38 million and related to the acquisition of additional noncontrolling interests. And lastly, our net stock repurchases for the quarter of $279 million, roughly in line with last year's first quarter level and well on the way toward our annual expectation of $500 million to $600 million.\nSlide 11 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. At the end of the first quarter of '23, the book value of our outstanding debt was relatively flat at $5.6 billion, compared to the same period last year. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter. And our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn. And our cash and cash equivalents were $3.3 billion.\nTurning to Slide 12. Our operating capital discipline consistently drives above-average returns on both invested capital and equity. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, we generated a solid return on invested capital, 24% and a strong return on equity of 45%. The strength of our business delivers attractive returns on a relative basis in both strong and weaker macroeconomic environments. In closing, as 2023 begins, we continue to review our costs to better align with our estimated revenues and an uncertain economy.\nAnd our decision to exit certain real estate in Q1 is consistent with this approach. Our Q1 performance was solid and a first step toward delivering on our full year guidance of an operating income margin between 15% and 15.4%, excluding the impact of the real estate repositioning charge. We expect to be at or close to the top of that range.\nOur approach always includes the opportunity for strategic and accretive acquisitions. And if those opportunities are not immediately available, we will continue to use our free cash flow to boost total shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our website, omnicomgroup.com., we've posted a press release, along with the presentation covering the information we'll review today, as well as a webcast of this call. An archived version will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start, I would like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial and other information that we have included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements, and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K, which should be filed tomorrow.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We'll begin the call with an overview of our business from John, then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. And after our prepared remarks, we'll open up the lines for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & CEO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results.\nI'm pleased to report our fourth quarter performance was very strong on both the top and bottom lines, and we finished an outstanding year in 2022. We entered 2023 with a high level of confidence in our strategic and financial position while remaining cautious and being prepared for possible changes in the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment.\nFor the fourth quarter, organic growth of 7.2% exceeded our expectations. Growth was broad-based across our disciplines, geographic regions and client sectors. We again saw a double-digit growth in our Precision Marketing, Public Relations and Experiential disciplines. Full year organic growth was 9.4%.\nOperating margin for the fourth quarter was 16.6%, an increase of 50 basis points compared to the prior year. For the full year, operating margin, adjusted for certain non-GAAP items illustrated on Page 10 of our investor presentation, was 15.4%, which is 40 basis points higher than our operating margin in 2021.\nEarnings per share for the quarter was $2.09, up 7.2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021. The negative currency impact on EPS of the strong U.S. dollar was approximately 6%. On a constant currency basis, EPS increased by approximately 13%.\nFor the year, we generated over $1.7 billion in free cash flow and returned more than 65% to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Our liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash: dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nOur strong performance validates the growing role we play as clients increasingly turn to us for advice in navigating through a complex marketing and communications environment. We're also advising our clients on transforming their organizations by deploying new processes and marketing technology platforms that can provide more connected experiences for their consumers.\nDuring the quarter, we expanded and further strengthened our talent. At the time of our Q3 remarks, we had just appointed Andrea Lennon to the new role of Chief Client Officer. In the fourth quarter, we added 2 prominent leaders: Kathleen Saxton, previously of MediaLink, joined as Chief Marketing Officer; and Alex Hesz, previously of adam&eveDDB joined as Chief Strategy Officer.\nAndrea, Kathleen and Alex will strengthen our position in the marketplace, identify and pursue new business opportunities and work with our global client leaders and agencies to deliver innovative and transformational ideas to our clients. We're fortunate to be adding this team from a position of strength. We ended 2022 with significant new business wins and deepened our relationship with many of our enterprise-level clients.\nIn the fourth quarter, L'Oréal named Omnicom Media Group its U.S. media agency of record. This marked one of the biggest wins of 2022, with an estimated $1 billion in U.S. media billings as reported by COMvergence. L'Oréal selected OMG due to its steep specialization and integration of expertise, talent and technology to deliver modern marketing outcomes. Our recently launched Commerce Agency, Transact, along with our best-in-class analytics and insights team at Annalect, which supports the Omni operating system, played instrumental roles in winning the L'Oréal business.\nAlso, on the media front, OMD secured a major win as it was named Media Agency of Record for Burberry. The win includes an innovative and bespoke agency model created specifically for Burberry. Our Healthcare Group, which had 6.4% growth in the fourth quarter, won a significant new business pitch with Merck, capping off the year in which it won [one of the] largest health care pitches of 2022.\nA key component of our new business success was driven by our e-commerce capabilities, an area where we've made and continue to make significant investments. We recently expanded our e-commerce capabilities through a partnership with Albertsons Media Collective, a retail media arm for the Albertsons Companies.\nThis partnership will provide first-to-market solutions that will enable marketers to better target and measure ROI and connected TV environments. Going forward, we plan to continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to solidify our position as best-in-class provider of retail, media and e-commerce services as well as in other high-growth areas such as precision marketing, performance media and health.\nI want to thank our people around the world for helping us close out 2022 on such a positive note. It's your dedication and commitment and outstanding work that allows our agencies, clients and Omnicom to succeed. We entered 2023 in a very strong position, supported by our strong financial performance, new business wins and steady progress on our key strategic initiatives. We also continue to see strong demand for our services.\nBased on current market conditions, we're targeting 2023 organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% and expect our operating margin to be between 15% and 15.4%. At the same time, we remain extremely cautious of macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, including the ongoing war in the Ukraine, the economic risk posed by rising interest rates and higher inflation around the world.\nTo be prepared, we continue to actively develop plans to respond to the headwinds from macro factors, and I'm confident we can manage through this economic cycle. And we have the leadership teams in place to minimize the impact on our top and bottom lines.\nI'll now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThanks, John. We're pleased to be closing 2022 with solid fourth quarter results, driven by strong organic revenue growth, operating profit growth and earnings per share growth. We finished the year with a healthy balance sheet and excellent liquidity. Our strong credit position and the operating flexibility of our business position us well for any macro uncertainty ahead.\nPlease turn now to Slide 3, and we'll begin our review with a summary of the fourth quarter income statement. Reported total revenue in the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year at $3.9 billion with organic growth of 7.2%, offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translations and net disposition revenue in excess of acquisition revenue.\nSince most of our expenses are incurred in the local markets where our revenue is earned, foreign currency translation also reduced our operating expenses, which were flat versus last year. Reported operating profit for the fourth quarter increased 3.2% and, on a constant currency basis, it increased 8.4%.\nMoving down the income statement. Higher interest income again helped lower our net interest expense, which decreased by $18.5 million. Our tax rate of 26.5% was as expected.\nIn 2023, despite the increasing interest rate environment, we currently expect interest expense to approximate 2022 levels and interest income to increase moderately in Q1 and Q2 of 2023 compared to the first half of 2022 and approximate 2022 levels in the second half of 2023.\nWe also currently expect our effective book income tax rate in 2023 to be approximately 27%. The increase relative to our 2022 rate is primarily due to the U.K. tax rate, which is scheduled to increase in April of 2023.\nOverall, our Q4 '22 net income rose 3.3% on a reported basis. Combined with the reduction in shares year-over-year, diluted EPS rose 7.2%. Without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, diluted EPS for the quarter increased 13.3%.\nFor a review of the full year, please turn to Slide 4, where we show certain non-GAAP adjustments to make the periods more comparable. None of these adjustments are new this quarter, they were discussed earlier this year and last year.\nFor the year-to-date 2022 period, operating expenses and income taxes were impacted by charges in the first quarter arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine. For the year-to-date 2021 period, operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of a subsidiary, and both interest expense and income tax expense reflect the impact from the early extinguishment of debt in 2021.\nContinuing on Slide 4. Similar to the quarterly results we just discussed, the strength in the dollar this year also impacted our year-to-date results. Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 4.8%.\nOperating profit on a non-GAAP adjusted basis of $2.2 billion was up 2.3%. And without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, it increased 6.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS of $6.93 rose 8.5% or, without the headwind from negative foreign currency translation, it increased 13.6%.\nLet's now go into some more detail on our results, beginning on Slide 5 with an analysis of the change in our revenue. As discussed, our organic growth was 7.2% for the quarter and 9.4% year-to-date. The quarterly impact from foreign currency translation was negative 5.5%.\nIt's worth noting that for financial reporting purposes, the U.S. dollar strengthened against the currencies of every country we operate in, except for Brazil, when compared to Q4 of 2022. However, this impact was slightly less than it was in the third quarter, so it did move in the right direction. The impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1.4%, primarily reflecting the disposition of our businesses in Russia during the first quarter of 2022.\nLooking forward, if foreign currency exchange rates stay where they were as of February 1, we estimate that the impact will reduce our revenue by approximately 3% in the first quarter and moderate for the remainder of 2023 to be approximately flat for the year. Based on deals completed to date, we expect the impact from net acquisitions and dispositions will result in a reduction of our revenue by approximately 1.5% in the first quarter, primarily resulting in the disposition of our businesses in Russia in the first quarter of 2022.\nTurning to Slide 6. For the quarter, we once again showed organic growth across all of our disciplines, with the exception of Execution & Support as we expected. As you can see, performance in each of our other disciplines remained solid, with double-digit organic growth in 3 of them.\nAdvertising & Media, our largest category, posted 6% organic growth in the quarter, led by strong performance in our media businesses. Precision Marketing continued its strong performance, 11.6% organic growth, as clients continue to turn to us for digital transformation, digital customer experience and data analytics services. Although this growth rate moderated a bit relative to the third quarter, we're excited about the outlook, and we'll continue to invest in this space.\nCommerce & Brand Consulting was up 7.2% organically on the strength of our branding and design agencies. Experiential organic growth was a strong 17%, where we saw more benefits than we expected from the FIFA World Cup and other year-end projects. Execution & Support, which we expected would be choppy in the second half, had a decline of 2.8% against the comp of 5.2% growth in last year's fourth quarter.\nPublic Relations grew a strong 12.7% organically in the quarter, keeping up a double-digit trend, reflecting continued client demand across many industries and geographies and including increased revenue of approximately $10 million, resulting from increased election spending in the U.S. in the second half of the year. And Healthcare delivered solid organic growth of 6.4%.\nTurning to Slide 7 for revenue by region. We're pleased to see continued positive growth globally. In the U.S., our 5.6% quarterly organic growth was led by Advertising & Media, Precision Marketing and Public Relations. International growth of 8.7% was also led by Advertising & Media and Precision Marketing and also saw the strong contribution from Experiential that I mentioned earlier.\nRegionally, we saw some expected slowdown compared to the first half of the year in the U.K. and Europe, with their organic growth of 10% and 5%, respectively, is still quite healthy. Asia Pacific also improved, led by China and also driven by most of our other markets in the region.\nLooking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 8. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2021, the mix of our client portfolio is broadly stable. Categories that moved year-over-year included an increase in exposure to pharma and health and a decrease in exposure to technology.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our operating expenses for the quarter. For your reference, Slide 17 in the appendix presents this on a constant currency basis. Our total expenses were essentially flat at $3.2 billion due primarily to the weakening of almost all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar.\nSalary and related service costs decreased as we saw an increase related to organic revenue growth and additional head count, offset by the effects of foreign currency translation. Third-party service costs increased due to an increase in organic revenue. Occupancy and other costs increased primarily due to some growth in general office expenses as our workforce returns to the office, partially offset by lower rents.\nOn the topic of rent, you may have seen in January that we moved the Madison Avenue headquarters for TBWA to a location that houses other Omnicom agencies. It is an open, modern and collaborative space with an efficient design. This is another example of the rationalization of our rooftops, which we expect will continue in the future. SG&A expenses were down year-over-year due to lower professional fees, lower marketing-related costs and reductions from the effects of foreign currency translations.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our fourth quarter operating profit was $643 million, a 3.2% increase from last year, net of a reduction of $32.3 million of the impact of foreign currency translations. Our operating profit margin reached 16.6% on total revenue compared to last year's margin of 16.1%.\nPlease turn now to Slide 11 for our cash flow performance on a full year basis. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in operating capital. Free cash flow for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, flat compared to last year. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $581 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $80 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders.\nCapital expenditures of $78 million were at normal levels. Acquisition spend, net of dispositions and other items, was $330 million. And lastly, our net stock repurchases for the year were $594 million, at the high end of our expectations of $500 million to $600 million. In 2023, we expect that we will also repurchase shares within this historical range.\nRegarding the changes in our operating capital for the year, which resulted in a use of cash of approximately $840 million, the principal factors that caused this reduction included a reduction in billings in 2022 resulting from certain client losses in 2021; the disposition of our businesses in Russia, including cash for operations in Q1 of 2022; the disposition of our specialty media business in 2021; impacts from increased client activity related to the reopening in China at the end of the fourth quarter; and timing differences compared to the prior year of cash collections and cash payments at year-end. As we look forward, we expect changes in operating capital to be a source of cash again for fiscal year 2023.\nSlide 12 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. During the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates on our euro- and sterling-denominated debt caused the book value of our outstanding debt to decrease to $5.6 billion from $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter. And our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, remains undrawn.\nOur cash and cash equivalents were $4.3 billion at year-end. The reduction relative to year-end 2021 is due primarily to the changes in operating capital that I just discussed as well as the effect of foreign exchange rate changes, which reduced our cash balance by $219 million for the year.\nTurning to Slide 13. Our operating capital discipline consistently drives above-average returns on both invested capital and equity. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2022, we generated a solid return on invested capital of 28% and a strong return on equity of 40%. The strength of our business delivers attractive returns on a relative basis in both strong and weaker macroeconomic environments.\nIn closing, as 2023 unfolds, we are prepared, as always, for an uncertain business environment. We have a strong track record of providing attractive returns through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing our business through challenging market conditions, and we will do so while continuing to invest in our strategic future growth.\nOperator, please open the line for questions and answers. Thank you."

We exceeded our expectations with organic growth of 7.5%, which was broad-based across our agencies, disciplines regions and client sectors.\nYear-to-date, organic growth is 10.3%. Operating profit margin for the quarter was 15.9%, 10 basis points higher than our comparable margin in 2021. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.77, up 7.3% versus 2021. The negative currency impact on EPS of the strong U.S. dollar was approximately 5%. On a constant currency basis, EPS would have increased approximately 12.3%. Our cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Phil will cover our financial results in more detail during his remarks.\nOn last quarter's call, we mentioned several first-of-a-kind e-commerce collaborations with Amazon, Instacart, Kroger and Walmart. This quarter, we expanded and enhanced our e-commerce capabilities by announcing Transact, a dedicated practice focused on connected commerce consulting and e-retail execution services. Transact will capitalize on the unique partnerships we've entered into, and we'll focus on driving sales for clients and growing market share on e-retail platforms. Transact adds to our best-in-class e-commerce services in digital transformation and MarTech Consulting, CRM and Precision Marketing, media, campaign activation and creative content.\nWe also continue to invest in our iconic agency brands. A recent example was TBWA Worldwide, which recently acquired innovation agency, dotdotdash. Dotdotdash builds future forward brand experiences at the intersection of culture and technology, a valuable addition for the total brand experience company like TBWA. We will continue investing to enhance our capabilities in high growth areas, including CRM and precision marketing, digital transformation, performance media and e-commerce. Our investments in these areas to date have been very effective and are reflected in third-party validations.\nA few weeks ago, we were named a leader in Forrester's Wave assessment for global marketing services. We received the highest scores possible in 5 criteria: creative content and services, media management services, integration services, global client teams and innovation road map. Our performance highlights our ability to deliver creative and strategic solutions to our clients through integrated multidisciplinary teams. One way we do this is through our global client leaders group, which has led the industry in developing innovative service solutions for our largest clients.\nSince 2014, we our GCL Group has been led by Peter Sherman. After a successful 25-year tenure at Omnicom, Peter has made the decision to become a full-time undergraduate professor, teaching marketing and communications at a top rank university.\nI want to thank Peter for his countless contributions at Omnicom and wish him the best of luck. We are expanding on the foundation Peter Help build to further enhance the services we deliver to our largest clients and to pursue new business opportunities aggressively.\nAs a first step towards that goal, we announced the appointment of Andrea Lennon to the new role of Chief Client Officer. Andrea has a strong track record in marketing transformation at critical mass Omnicom's digital experienced design agency, where she spent 7 years working in Asia, Europe and the United States prior to being main President 2 years ago.\nAndrea will focus on transformative marketing solutions and capabilities that drive business results for our global enterprise clients. In partnership with the GCL team, she will accelerate solutions that draw on the group's best talent, integrating Omnicom's leading capabilities in data, creative, media communications and technology. We will be sharing more updates on our Client Solutions strategy and the business team in the coming weeks.\nWe are fortunate to be making these changes from a position of strength. We were recently recognized by the Effie's with 1 of the industry's most prestigious honors. Identifying ideas that work the 2021 Global Effie Effectiveness Index, named Omnicom the most effective marketing communications company in the world. 4 of our agency networks, BBDO, DDB, OMD and TBWA placed in the top 6 of the most effective agency network category.\nIn addition, OMD was named the most effective media agency network. These notable rankings demonstrate our standout talent. I want to congratulate all of our agencies and people on executing the most effective and creative work in the industry for the benefit of our clients.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our quarterly and year-to-date financial results as well as our progress on our key strategic initiatives. Based on our strong performance this quarter and for the first 9 months of the year, we are increasing our prior organic growth forecast from 6.5% to 7%, to 8% to 8.5% for the full year 2022. We also continue to anticipate delivering the same strong operating margin of 15.4% for the full year of 2022 that we achieved in 2021.\nWhile we are confinee in our forecast, we retain a healthy level of caution due to macro factors, including the ongoing war in Ukraine, the continuing disruption of global supply chains, the economic risk posed by rising interest rates here in the United States and higher inflation around the world. In light of these risks, we are actively taking actions to mitigate the potential negative effects of these macro factors on our business. I'm confident we are well equipped to handle any economic downturn and have the leadership teams in place to minimize the impact on our top and bottom lines.\nI will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As you just heard from John, our third quarter results were solid, reflecting growth across all our disciplines. While the rate of growth as expected, is below our first half results, we feel very good about the competitive position of our company, leading us to raise our guidance for full year 2022 organic growth and we have a positive outlook for 2023 and beyond.\nFurther down the income statement, our cost management has resulted in strong operating performance and operating profit margins. and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and investment has led to both improved service offerings and increased shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, all while maintaining an excellent credit and liquidity position.\nLet's go into the financial details of the quarter, beginning on Slide 3. Reported total revenue in the third quarter was flat year-over-year at $3.4 billion. Organic growth was 7.5% for the quarter. However, as I'm sure you're aware, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly and almost half of our revenue is outside the U.S. In dollar terms for the third quarter, this drove the largest negative quarterly impact from foreign currency translation so far this year.\nThe $216.6 million or 6.3% reduction of revenue. With most of our expenses incurred in the local markets where our revenue is earned, foreign currency translation impacted our profits as well. Reported operating profit for the third quarter increased around 1%. And while on a constant currency basis, it increased 6%. Below line, higher interest income helped lower our net interest expense, and we benefited a bit from the translation impact of our euro and British pound-denominated debt.\nOverall, our net income rose 2.5% on a reported basis, combined with a 4% reduction in shares year-over-year, diluted EPS rose 7.3% after a negative 5% headwind from foreign currency translation.\nOn a year-to-date basis, it's helpful to turn to Slide 4, where we show adjustments to make the current and prior year-to-date periods more comparable. None of these adjustments are new this quarter. They were discussed earlier this year and last year. The year-to-date 2022 period, operating expenses and income taxes were impacted by charges in the first quarter arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine. With the year-to-date 2021 period, operating expenses benefited from a gain on sale of the subsidiary in both interest expense and income tax expense reflect the impact from the early extinguishment of debt.\nSimilar to the quarterly results we just discussed. The strength in the dollar this year also impacted our year-to-date results. Foreign currency translation reduced revenues by 4.5%. Operating profit on a non-GAAP adjusted basis was up 1.9%. And on a constant currency basis, was up 6.1%.\nFor a more detailed look at our results, let's now turn to Slide 5, and begin with an analysis of the changes in our revenue. As discussed, the quarterly impact from foreign currency translation was negative 6.3%. The impact of acquisition and disposition revenue was negative 1%, primarily reflecting the disposition of our businesses in Russia during the first quarter. Organic growth was 7.5% for the quarter and 10.3% year-to-date.\nLooking forward, if FX rates stay where they were as of October 12, we estimate that the impact of foreign exchange rates will reduce our revenue by approximately 6.5% in the fourth quarter. Based on deals completed to date, we expect the impact from net acquisitions and dispositions will result in a reduction of our revenue of approximately 1.4% in the fourth quarter, primarily resulting from the disposition of our businesses in Russia.\nTurning to Slide 6. For the quarter, we once again showed growth across all of our disciplines with double-digit growth in 3 of them. Advertising and media, our largest category, posted 6% organic growth in the quarter, led by strong media results. Precision Marketing continued its strong performance with 16% organic growth as clients turn to us for digital transformation digital customer experience and data and analytics services.\nCommerce and Brand Consulting was again up 11% organically on the strength of our branding and design agencies. Experiential organic growth slowed to 2% as we continue to experience declines in China. As expected, growth in this discipline will remain choppy.\nExecution and support which we also expected would grow slower in the second half, had organic growth of 4%. Public relations grew a strong 13% organically, reflecting client demand across many industries and geographies. And lastly, Healthcare delivered solid organic growth of 5%.\nTurning to Slide 7 for organic growth rates by region. It's clear that growth was solid overall, but vary widely by region and as expected, each region grew a bit less than they did in the second quarter, both in the U.S. and internationally, in Q3, Organic growth was primarily driven by revenue growth in advertising and media, precision marketing, commerce and consulting and public relations. Organic growth in the U.S. was strong at 7.6%. And outside the U.S., the organic increase in revenue was led by the U.K. at 11.5% and Europe at 6%.\nLooking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 8. Relative to the third quarter of 2022, the broad distribution of our clients remain very stable. Let's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our operating expenses for the quarter. For your reference, a slide in the appendix also presents this on a constant currency basis.\nOur total expenses, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, were flat at $2.8 billion, down 10 basis points as a percentage of revenue. Salary related service costs were fairly constant at 50.8% of revenue compared to 50.4% last year. The slight increase was due primarily to the increase in organic revenue, an increase in head count and a return to more normal business conditions.\nThird-party service costs were flat at 21% of revenue. Occupancy and other costs were also flat at 8.2% of revenue. A decrease due to lower rent and other occupancy costs, partially offset by an increase in office expense and other costs resulting from the return of our workforce to the office. SG&A expenses were down year-over-year as a percentage of revenue, due primarily to decreases in professional fees and third-party marketing costs.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our third quarter operating profit was $546 million, a 1% increase from last year, net of a reduction of 5.2% due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Our operating profit margin of 15.9% on total revenue was 10 basis points above last year's result.\nPlease turn now to Slide 11 for our cash flow performance. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital, which are generally positive for us on an annual basis. Free cash flow for the first 9 months of 2022 was $1.23 billion compared to $1.25 billion for the first 9 months of last year, a small reduction year-over-year. However, as a reminder, we note that $48 million of the charges we recorded in the first quarter of 2022 for the effects of the war in Ukraine were cash related.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $438 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $63 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures of $66 million were at normal levels. Acquisition spend, net of dispositions and other items was $330 million. And lastly, our net stock repurchases during the third quarter were $486 million. We continue to expect total repurchases for the year at our historical annual range of around $500 million to $600 million.\nSlide 12 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. During the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange rates on our euro and sterling denominated debt caused the book value of our outstanding debt to decrease to $5.5 billion from $5.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. There were no changes in outstanding balances during the quarter and our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility, which backstops our $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program remains undrawn. Our cash and equivalents were $3.3 billion, flat with our balance at June 30, 2022, reflecting an increase in net free cash flow during the quarter, which was offset by the negative impact of foreign currency translation.\nTurning to Slide 13. Our operating capital discipline consistently drives above-average returns on both invested capital and equity. For the 12 months ended September 30, 2022, we generated a solid return on invested capital of 25% and a strong return on equity of 43%. We're confident that the outlook for our business growth and our prudent process for capital allocation will lead to increasing returns as they have historically.\nOperator, please open the lines up for questions and answers. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our second quarter 2022 earnings call. With me today are John Wren, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Angelastro, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOn our website, omnicomgroup.com, we posted a press release along with the presentation covering the information we'll review today as well as a webcast of this call. An archived version will be available when today's call concludes.\nBefore we start today, I'd like to remind everyone to read the forward-looking statements, non-GAAP financial and other information that we've included at the end of our investor presentation. Certain of the statements made today may constitute forward-looking statements and these statements are our present expectations. Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are listed in our earnings materials and in our SEC filings, including our 2021 Form 10-K.\nDuring the course of today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP measures. You can find the reconciliation of these to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in the presentation materials. We will begin the call with an overview of our business from John and then Phil will review our financial results for the quarter. After our prepared remarks, we will open up the line for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & CEO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to share our second quarter results. Our second quarter performance was very strong. We exceeded our expectations with organic growth of 11.3%, which was broad-based across our agencies, disciplines, regions and client sectors.\nOperating profit margin for the quarter was 15.2%, 70 basis points higher than our comparable margin in 2021. Our agency management teams continue to grow their top line while closely managing costs in line with revenue. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.68, up 15.1% versus the comparable amount in 2021. Finally, our cash flow, liquidity and balance sheet remain very strong and we continue to support our primary uses of cash, dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases. Phil will cover our results in more detail during his remarks.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to focus on evolving our existing capabilities to meet the needs of our clients and prospects. Most notably, we expanded and strengthened our e-commerce and retail media capabilities. At the Cannes Line Festival of Creativity in June, we announced a number of first of its kind e-commerce collaborations with Amazon, Instacart, Kroger and Walmart. We now have more than 1,500 certified experts helping our clients navigate the complexity of executing media and driving sales on retail media platforms.\nThe commerce partnerships we recently announced will provide us with additional access to online and in-store transactions and audiences, so we can deliver more precise and actionable consumer insights, more effective creative ideas and content and more targeted media for our clients.\nWe are delivering these services by leveraging the power of our omni platform. We have developed omni commerce which integrates data about audiences, shopper behavior, media, content, shelf analytics, sales and inventory. Omni commerce enables us to maximize brand awareness and increase the effectiveness of our clients' retail media investments, driving product sales and profitability.\nWe're pleased to see our efforts in this critical area being recognized in a recent Forrester report which noted that Omnicom Media Group leads across our peer set in retail and commerce media, audience intelligence capabilities, optimization and operations automation. Going forward, we will continue to invest organically and through acquisitions in e-commerce and retail media as well as in our other growth areas, including performance media, CRM and Precision Marketing, digital transformation and MarTech Consulting and the health sector.\nAs we continue to expand the capabilities of Omni, we are maintaining our privacy-first approach in how we aggregate and manage data on behalf of our clients and partners. To oversee these efforts, we recently appointed Brian Clayton as Omnicom's Chief Data Privacy Officer. Brian has an extensive background in data privacy that incorporates data ethics, governance and protection. He will be a key member of our team as we continue to protect the privacy and security of the data we manage.\nClients are rightfully demanding greater insight and control over their data as third-party cookies come to an end and as increasingly complex data privacy laws and regulations emerge around the globe. Our approach is to ensure that we have Omnicom-wide privacy practices, frameworks and programs that safeguard the security of client data, employee data and data we obtain from third-party partners.\nContinuing with some key leadership additions, I'm pleased to announce the appointment of Matt McNally as CEO of Omnicom Health Group. He succeeds Ed Wise, who recently announced his retirement. Christina Hanson was named U.S. CEO of OMD. Chrissy has served as the network's Global Chief Strategy Officer since 2018. She succeeds John Osborn, who after more than 30 years with Omnicom, is stepping back to focus on his long-standing work with nonprofit organizations.\nIn June, we attended the Cannes Lions. Omnicom agencies for more than 30 countries won over 120 Lions. Two of our creative networks, DDB and BBDO, placed in the top 5 in the Network of the Year competition. In media, OMD won Media Network of the Year, which was followed by a recent report from Forrester naming Omnicom Media Group as having the strongest current offering in the marketplace. Congratulations to all our agencies and people on their exceptional performance.\nDE&I continues to be a top priority for us. And during the quarter, we issued our diversity, equity and inclusion performance report. I encourage our people and stakeholders to read the report on our website and know we are committed to keep building on our progress moving forward.\nOverall, we are very pleased with our progress on our key strategic initiatives and our first half financial results. Our notable new partnerships and continued investments in high-growth areas position us extremely well to service our clients now and in the future.\nWhile we remain confident in our strategies and execution, we're retaining a healthy level of caution due to the existing macro factors, including the ongoing war in the Ukraine, the effects of the pandemic across markets, the continuing disruption of global supply chains and the economic risks posed by higher inflation and rising interest rates.\nEven with this backdrop, we are continuing to see strong demand for our services, and based on our first half results, are increasing our organic revenue growth forecast to between 6.5% to 7% for the full year 2022. We also continue to anticipate delivering the same strong operating margin of 15.4% in 2022 that we delivered in 2021.\nBefore I finish, I'd like to address the ongoing challenges our people are facing around the globe. The war in the Ukraine continues to impact the lives of our colleagues and their families in the Ukraine and is having an effect on our people around the world. We remain steadfast in supporting them for as long as needed. In the U.S., we continue to encounter mass shootings, senseless acts of gun violence and racially motivated hate crimes. My heart goes out to the families of the victims of these crimes.\nFinally, the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe V. Wade was a step back in the advancement of women's rights and is having a detrimental effect on many of our colleagues. We're committed to ensuring our people have equal access to health services no matter where they live in the United States. Our actions with respect to the Ukraine war and the recent Supreme Court decisions reflects our commitment to always put the safety and well-being of our colleagues first.\nI will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financial results. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThanks, John. As John said, our second quarter results were very solid. Organic growth continued at a very high rate, driven by performance across all of our disciplines. Our growth delivered healthy operating margins and good earnings per share performance. And we continue to return a significant portion of our free cash flow to our investors through dividends and additional share buybacks.\nLet's go into the financial details of the quarter, beginning on Slide 4. This view of the reported income statement shows adjustments to make the second quarter of the prior year comparable as well as making the 6 months for both 2021 and 2022 comparable. As we described last year, for the second quarter of 2021, operating expenses in the second quarter of last year benefited from a gain on the sale of a subsidiary. Interest expense includes a charge in the second quarter of last year on the early extinguishment of debt. And income tax expense in the second quarter of last year was also impacted by the early extinguishment of debt.\nIn addition, as we discussed last quarter, for the year-to-date 2022 period, operating expenses included charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine in the first quarter of this year, and income taxes were also impacted by these charges. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, the net effects of these items resulted in strong EPS of $1.68 versus $1.46 from Q1 of 2021 as adjusted, representing EPS growth of 15.1% in the second quarter. For the 6 months, EPS of $3.07 as adjusted grew 10% from $2.79, also as adjusted.\nOur reported tax rate was 26.5% this quarter, the same level we expect for the remainder of the year. Net interest expense for Q2 of $40.1 million declined by $6.8 million from $46.9 million in Q2 of 2021, excluding the charge from the early extinguishment of debt last year, as previously discussed. The decline was principally driven by an increase in interest income in Q2 of 2022 of approximately $4 million. Given our principal debt is fixed rate, we expect net interest expense to decline in the second half compared to the prior year as interest income increases due to higher investing rates compared to 2021. Lastly, our diluted share count was down almost 5% year-over-year in the second quarter due to our ongoing share repurchase activity.\nNow let's look at our results in more detail, beginning with revenues on Slide 5. Reported revenues were flat as another quarter of strong organic growth at 11.3% was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and disposition revenue in excess of acquisition revenue. Both of these impacts were expected as we saw the dollar continue to strengthen globally and as we pass the final 2 months of our divestiture of a specialty media subsidiary last June, which was included in our Advertising & Media discipline in the U.S.\nThe year-to-date results closely mirror the second quarter. If rates stay where they were as of July 15, we estimate that the impact of foreign exchange rates will reduce our revenue by approximately 6% in the third quarter and by 4.5% for the year. Based on deals completed to date, we expect the impact from net acquisitions and dispositions will result in a reduction of our revenue by approximately 1% in the third quarter, primarily resulting from the disposition of our businesses in Russia, and by approximately 4.5% for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 6. It's clear that our organic strength was broad-based across all of our disciplines. Advertising & Media, our largest category, posted 8% organic growth in the quarter, with strong performance in both our media and our creative agencies. Precision Marketing continued its strong performance with 21% organic growth in the second quarter. Commerce & Brand Consulting was up 11%, led by our branding and design agencies. Experiential had organic growth of 37%, but it's worth noting that lockdowns in Q2 in China weighed on these otherwise good results. As a reference, in reported dollar terms for the first 6 months of 2022, this discipline has reached approximately 80% of its pre-pandemic revenue levels.\nExecution & Support was up 9%, led by our merchandising and point-of-sale businesses. PR was up a very strong 16%, reflecting growth from both long-standing and new clients and increased business activity across many sectors of the economy. And Healthcare, which is 10% of our revenues, grew an impressive 9%.\nTurning to Slide 7. We once again saw strong organic growth rates in every region with the exception of Asia Pacific, which was impacted by the lockdowns in China, as I just mentioned. This was nicely offset by acceleration in the U.S., Europe and the U.K. In the U.S., which is more than half of our revenues, our 10.7% organic growth was primarily driven by growth in Advertising & Media, Public Relations, Precision Marketing and Healthcare. Outside of the U.S., growth was led by Europe, which was primarily driven by Advertising & Media, Experiential and PR. Despite the headwinds in Experiential in Asia, the region saw strong results in Advertising & Media, brand consulting and Healthcare.\nLooking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 8 relative to the second quarter of 2021. The broad distribution of our clients remained relatively stable. As a percentage of the total, we did see an increase in technology, offset by reductions in both retail and travel and entertainment, 2 sectors that have both been impacted by the economy and by some lingering pandemic effects.\nLet's now turn to Slide 9 and look at our operating expenses for the quarter. In total, our operating expenses were relatively flat, which is a good result given the strong growth in our business, tight labor markets in several regions and our continued investment in our strategic focus areas. Salary and related service costs were 50.5% of revenue compared to 50.9% last year after adjusting 2021 for amounts related to acquisitions and dispositions.\nThird-party service costs were 21.4% of revenue compared to 20.1% last year, also after adjusting for amounts related to acquisitions and dispositions with the increase reflecting growth in our businesses. Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue, were flat year-over-year. We will continue to manage our real estate footprint in alignment with how people are working in our offices post pandemic. And it's also worth mentioning that our rent expense was down this quarter.\nS&A expenses were up 7.5% year-over-year, following the increase in our business activity, including higher marketing and professional fees compared to last year.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our second quarter operating profit was $541.6 million, a 4.6% increase from last year and our operating profit margin of 15.2% on total revenues was well above the comparable amount for last year of 14.5% as adjusted.\nPlease turn now to Slide 11 for our cash flow performance. As you know, we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital, which are generally positive for us on an annual basis. Free cash flow for the first 6 months of 2022 was $768 million, down $28 million or 3.5% from the first half of last year. However, $48 million of the charges we recorded in the first quarter for the effects of the war in Ukraine were cash-related. Absent this, we were up a bit year-over-year.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $294 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $38 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures of $43 million were at normal levels. Acquisitions net of dispositions and other items were $289 million. And lastly, our net stock repurchases during the first quarter were $393 million, including another $100 million in the second quarter. As we said on our call in April for the full year 2022, we expect we will spend at our historical annual range of around $500 million to $600 million.\nOn Slide 12 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturities. There were no changes in our outstanding debt during the second quarter, and our gross leverage at June 30 was 2.4x. In addition to $3.3 billion of cash and short-term investments, we also have a $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program, backstopped by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nI'll end my prepared remarks today on Slide 13, which shows our strong return on invested capital of 24.4% for the 12 months ended June 30, a 41.9% return on equity. These are very strong and very competitive returns and reflect Omnicom's consistent operating performance and approach to capital allocation.\nAt this point, operator, please open the lines up for questions and answers."

Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We are pleased to share our first quarter results.\nBefore I discuss our performance, I want to address the ongoing war in the Ukraine. We continue to be witness to this horrific war, and our focus remains the safety and well-being of our Ukrainian colleagues and their families. We've been in constant contact with our agency leaders in the Ukraine and continue to deliver needed humanitarian assistance and support.\nI was privileged to meet our senior regional leaders in Warsaw a few weeks ago. I continue to admire the tremendous bravery of our Ukrainian colleagues as they defend their country and protect their families. Since the onset of the war, our teams in the region, from Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Bulgaria and Hungary, have been providing extraordinary support to their coworkers from Ukraine. It was truly remarkable to see.\nI'm honored to lead a company with a culture of caring and compassion that displays such unity and strength. I want to extend my gratitude to our people around the world that have selflessly and tirelessly worked to help our Ukrainian colleagues. We hope for an end to these atrocities and a peaceful resolution to the war. Omnicom will continue to offer whatever assistance is necessary and will support our people for as long as needed.\nTurning now to our financials. We increased our operating margin and exceeded our expectations for the quarter with organic growth of 11.9%. We made the decision to withdraw from Russia and dispose of our operations. As a result, the financials for the quarter reflect our Russian business only through the end of February. We also took a charge arising from the effects of the war in the Ukraine. Phil will provide more details during his remarks.\nOur revenue growth and margin performance in the quarter was very strong across all geographies and disciplines. Our revenue performance reflects the continuing investments that our clients are making to strengthen their marketing, branding, consumer experience, e-commerce and digital transformation efforts in a rapidly evolving digital economy.\nOperating profit margin for the quarter, excluding the charge arising from the effects of the war in the Ukraine, was also very strong at 13.7%. This is 10 basis points higher than our margin in 2021. I want to compliment our agency management teams for growing their businesses while tightly managing costs in line with revenue growth.\nEarnings per share for the quarter, excluding the charge, was $1.39, up 4.5% versus 2021. Finally, our cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong and support our primary uses of cash: dividends, acquisitions and share repurchases.\nDuring the quarter, we continue to invest internally and through accretive acquisitions in high-growth areas like CRM and precision marketing, digital transformation and MarTech, data and analytics, e-commerce, performance media and the health sector. In the quarter, we acquired TA Digital, a leading global digital experience consultancy. The acquisition further expands the digital transformation, content management, commerce and customer experience capabilities within the Precision Marketing Group.\nThroughout the group, our agencies are delivering connected consumer experiences across media and commerce platforms within owned, paid and earned environments. All of this is enabled by Omni ID, our proprietary person-based identity solution, delivering reach and precision that is part of our Omni open operating system. Omni ID is built to be privacy compliant and is a future-proof framework for a post-cookie marketplace. It delivers the highest possible degree of first-party and CRM data management, control and governance. Our investments in these high-growth areas in our data and technology capabilities and in our best-in-class talent have positioned us extremely well to service our clients now and in the future.\nI want to take a moment to welcome and congratulate 2 new members of our Board of Directors: Patricia Salas Pineda and Mark Gerstein. The diversity of Omnicom's Board is something we take pride in, especially as we look to continue to improve diversity, equity and inclusion throughout our entire organization. At the end of 2021, we saw meaningful progress in our workforce diversity across all professional levels in the United States. We're not done, and we will continue to drive improvements throughout 2022.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our quarterly results. While we are off to a strong start in 2022, we continue to plan cautiously for the remainder of the year given the ongoing war in the Ukraine, the effects of the pandemic across markets, the continuing disruption of global supply chains and the economic risks posed by higher inflation and oil prices.\nWith that said, given our strong performance in the first quarter, we are increasing our forecast for organic growth to between 6% and 6.5% for the full year 2022, and we anticipate delivering the same strong operating margins for the full year 2022 that we delivered in 2021. I'm confident we'll continue to operate at a high level through this business cycle as our agencies remain an integral partner in growing our clients' businesses.\nI want to thank our people around the world for your compassion and dedication. You have continued to produce incredible work for our clients. Your resilience not only drives our financial success, it defines who we are as a company. So thank you once again.\nI want to now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.\nOur first quarter results were very strong. It's good to see the continued momentum, which resulted in growth across every one of our disciplines. Before we go into the details, please turn to Slide 3, where I'd like to draw your attention to the fact that our operating profit and EPS were negatively impacted by the announcement of our withdrawal from Russia as well as charges related to the effects of the war in Ukraine on our agencies there.\nWe have sold or committed to dispose of all of our businesses in Russia. And during the quarter, these actions resulted in a pretax charge of $113.4 million. As a result, operating profit of $353 million was down $112.4 million or 24.1% compared to Q1 of 2021. Our tax rate was elevated due to the nondeductibility of the charges, plus an additional $4.8 million tax charge related to our withdrawal from Russia. Reported revenues were down slightly as strong organic growth of 11.9% was offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and disposition revenue in excess of acquisition revenue.\nTurning to Slide 4, which shows non-GAAP adjusted amounts. You can see after adjusting for the charge, our first quarter operating profit was $466.4 million, slightly above last year. And our operating profit margin was 13.7%, also slightly above last year. Amortization expense was flat year-over-year. And as a result, non-GAAP adjusted EBITA and EBITA margin were flat with last year. As a reminder, last year's 15.4% operating profit margin included a gain from the sale of a subsidiary of $51 million, which was recorded in the second quarter. As John said, we are still comfortable with our guidance of 15.4% for the full year 2022.\nSlide 5 shows the non-GAAP adjusted amount for net income of $292 million for the first quarter and diluted EPS of $1.39 per share, up 4.5%. We are pleased with this underlying performance and the strong organic growth across our businesses and geographies as well as work and travel environment that continues to normalize.\nLet's now go into some more detail, beginning on Slide 6. Our organic growth was a strong 11.9% or $408 million. The impact of foreign exchange rates decreased our revenue by 2.5 percentage points. If rates stay where they were as of April 15, we estimate the impact of foreign exchange rates will reduce our revenue by approximately 3% in the second quarter and by 2% for the year. The impact on revenue from our net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 9.9%. This was consistent with our expectations and is primarily the result of disposition activity from Q2 of 2021 in our advertising and media discipline in the U.S., which we will cycle through after the second quarter. We expect this reduction from dispositions, including the disposition of our businesses in Russia, to reduce our revenue by approximately 6.5% in the second quarter of 2022. And we expect acquisitions, net of dispositions, based on deals completed to date to be approximately negative 4.5% for the full year.\nNow let's look at the changes in our total revenues by business discipline on Slide 7. Advertising and media, our largest category, posted 9% organic growth in the quarter, with continued momentum in both our media and our creative agencies. Precision marketing grew 20.3% organically in the quarter and is now approximately 10% of our total revenues, up 2 points from the first quarter of last year. Our strong growth is being led by demand for our capabilities in digital transformation, MarTech, data and analytics and activation. In particular, Credera continues to perform exceptionally well.\nCommerce and brand consulting was up 13.8%, led by our branding agencies and continued benefits from corporate spin-offs, brand architecture work and widespread focus on corporate reputation around DE&I and ESG issues. We're also seeing increased demand from clients looking for retail media, e-commerce and DTC solutions.\nExperiential had organic growth of 68% compared to negative 33% in Q1 of 2021, reflecting an increase in the number of global in-person events. These events are important to our clients' brands because they engage with customers and build loyalty in unique ways. Results were especially strong in the Middle East. As we look forward this year, we expect growth to continue but will likely be choppy by quarter as clients adjust to the post-COVID environment.\nExecution and support was up 6.3%, led by demand in field marketing and a pickup in physical retail activity. PR was up a very strong 14%, reflecting growth from both long-standing and new clients and a pickup in overall activity as clients adapt their post-pandemic positioning. Health care grew 7.7% with strong performance across our agencies.\nTurning to Slide 8. We saw strong organic growth rates in virtually every region, and we're pleased that growth was solid within each of these regions and across all of our disciplines. In the U.S., our 10.6% organic growth was led by precision marketing, advertising and media and public relations. Outside of the U.S., growth was led by Europe, and its growth was driven by advertising and media, experiential and PR. The Asia Pacific region was also a key driver, as was the Middle East, which saw strong growth in experiential and advertising and media.\nLooking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 9. Relative to the first quarter of 2021, the broad distribution of our clients remained fairly stable. The only notable shifts were a 2-point increase in technology, offset by a reduction in revenue from clients in the travel and entertainment industry. But this change was largely driven by the disposition of a business that had a high concentration of clients in this industry in Q1 of 2021.\nLet's move down the income statement now on Slide 10 and review our operating expenses for the quarter. In total, our operating expense levels were down by 20 basis points year-over-year despite the significant pickup in our business activity and the continuation of our strategic investments in the business. When you look at operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, the year-over-year comparison is not comparable because of the impact of dispositions made subsequent to Q1 of 2021.\nSalary and related service costs, our largest category, increased by 8.8%, consistent with growth in our revenues, excluding dispositions and acquisitions. Adjusting 2021 for amounts related to acquisitions and dispositions, salary and related service costs were 53% of revenue, roughly the same level as this year. Third-party service costs were down $199 million or 22%. They decreased by approximately $315 million from dispositions and were offset by an increase of approximately $114 million from growth in our businesses. Adjusting 2021 for amounts related to acquisitions and dispositions, third-party service costs were approximately 19% of revenue, similar to the level this year. Occupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 2.9% year-on-year due to an increasing number of people returning to the office, partially offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs as we continue to efficiently manage our real estate portfolio.\nThe increase in SG&A expenses on a year-over-year basis was due primarily to a normalization of our business. At 2.8% of revenues this quarter, SG&A has been around this level for 12 months now and is in line with our pre-pandemic run rate.\nThere's one thing I would like to highlight regarding interest expense going forward. Please remember that our interest expense in Q2 of 2021 had a $26 million onetime charge related to the early redemption of our 3.625% notes. Our total interest expense that quarter was $80 million compared to just $51 million this quarter and $43 million net of interest income. We expect net interest expense for Q2 and the remainder of 2022 to approximate that run rate. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to approximate 26.5%, similar to our rate this quarter after adjusting for the charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine. Our diluted share count was down 3.2%, primarily due to our share repurchase activity in the second half of 2021 and in the first quarter of 2022.\nLet's now turn to Slide 11 for our cash flow performance. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital, which are generally positive for us on an annual basis.\nFree cash flow of $340 million was down $43 million. Adjusting for the cash-related portion of the charges arising from the effects of the war in Ukraine of $48 million, free cash flow was flat year-on-year. Regarding our uses of cash, we used $147 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $14 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. Our capital expenditures of $23 million were back to normalized levels. Acquisitions, net of dispositions and other items, were $259 million. As highlighted at the back of this presentation, this included the purchase of TA Digital and is aligned with our stated strategy of pursuing acquisitions in our faster-growing disciplines.\nAnd lastly, our stock repurchases during the first quarter were $287 million net. This puts us on the way toward our historical annual range of $500 million to $600 million. This capital allocation mix may vary in emphasis as opportunities present themselves, but our overall approach and philosophy have not changed.\nSlide 12 is an overview of our credit, liquidity and debt maturity schedule. There were no changes in our long-term debt outstanding during the quarter. As of March 31, our total leverage was 2.5x. In addition to the $4 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, we also have a $2 billion U.S. commercial paper program backstopped by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nI'll end my prepared remarks today on Slide 13, which shows our strong return on invested capital of 26.4% for the 12 months ended March 31 and 41.7% return on equity. These returns are both extremely strong and are a reflection of our consistent operating performance and consistent approach to capital allocation.\nAt this point, operator, please open the lines for questions and answers. Thank you."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to introduce you to your host for today's conference, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Gregory Lundberg. Please go ahead.\n\nGregory H. Lundberg\n\nSVP of IR, Outfront Media Inc.\n\nThank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call.

And after our prepared remarks, we will open up the lines for your questions.\nI'll now hand the call over to John.\n\nJohn D. Wren\n\nChairman & CEO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThank you, Greg. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining today. We're pleased to share our fourth quarter and full year performance. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and for the year. Our organic growth for the fourth quarter was 9.5%, and was broad-based across geographies and disciplines. The full year finished at 10.2% organic growth.\nOur improved performance was underpinned by our precision marketing discipline, which is helping clients transform their business so they can engage directly with their consumers through digital platforms. We also benefited from the continuing rebound in our experiential discipline as more in-person events resumed in Q4.\nOur revenue performance flowed through to our operating profit and bottom line. Our operating profit margin for the fourth quarter was 16.1%, resulting in full year margin of 15.4%. Earnings per share for the quarter was $1.95, up 6% versus 2020. For the full year, EPS increased 49%. Finally, our cash flow and balance sheet remain very strong. Overall, I'm very pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and year and optimistic about our prospects heading into 2022.\nLooking forward, we're forecasting organic revenue growth of between 5% to 6% for the full year 2022, and we anticipate delivering the same strong margin that we delivered in 2021. With the pace of change in the digital space accelerating, we've continued to evolve our existing capabilities and invest in new and innovative offerings to meet the needs of our clients and future prospects.\nThese efforts have allowed us to be extremely competitive in the marketplace by providing a suite of services and capabilities that position us to reimagine and strengthen our clients' businesses brands, services and products; seamlessly connect them with their consumers across the marketing journey by leveraging Omni, our insights and orchestration platform; transform their marketing and customer relationship technology platforms; and innovate in digital, e-commerce and new media channels.\nOne area where these investments are making a demonstrable impact is in our Omnicom Precision Marketing Group, which offers MarTech and digital transformation consulting, decision sciences, customer experience design and targeted customer marketing programs for our clients. In November, we closed on the acquisition of BrightGen, a Salesforce Summit Partner that will extend OPMG Salesforce capabilities and reach in Europe.\nThe success of Omnicom's Precision Marketing offering is reflected by the group's wins with some of the world's largest brands such as Philips, Mercedes, Nike and Diageo and by its financial results. The Precision Marketing discipline grew by 19% in 2021.\nMuch of the work conducted within Omnicom Precision marketing is supported by foundational AI decisioning layer and technology integrated with Omni, our open operating system that orchestrates better outcomes. Omni is built for collaboration across the entire company, acting as a single source of data and process workflow from insights to execution. It empowers our people and clients to make better and faster decisions, maximizing efficiency and ROI.\nA key emphasis for us going forward is to continue to fill the demand for services across the marketing journey by offering more services to our existing clients and winning new business relationships. Our objective in part is to increase the number of clients who consolidate more of their services with Omnicom. These are significant growth opportunities for us where our suite of services, creativity and culture of collaboration, all supported by Omni give us a competitive advantage.\nIn addition to our integrated wins, our world-class talent and agencies had numerous recent new business wins within their specialties and across geographies. Our success on our wins in 2021 has resulted in us expanding our services and continues to inform our priority investments and M&A strategies. We are also increasing our investment in such areas as AI and automation, e-commerce, performance media, data and analytics as well as in high-growth industry opportunities such as gaming and the metaverse.\nWe recently completed the acquisition of Propeller a digitally native engagement agency that specializes in health care, another area we expect will continue to see strong growth. Propeller is a fast-growing omnichannel strategy, content and delivery agency that embraces and mobilizes data to deliver meaningful results for its clients.\nAt Omnicom today, our emphasis is around developing our future talent and continuing our disciplined succession planning. With this in mind, we made important senior management changes this past quarter. Daryl Simm moved into the newly created position of President and Chief Operating Officer of Omnicom. After serving as CEO of Omnicom Media Group for more than 2 decades, Daryl will now work directly with me to oversee business operations across Omnicom.\nFlorian Adamski, who was previously CEO of OMD Worldwide, and help the agency earn back-to-back Adweek Global Media Agency of the Year titles in 2019 and 2020, has succeeded Daryl as the CEO of the Omnicom Media Group. After more than 2 decades of overseeing the growth of our DAS network, Dale Adams, as planned, stepped down as Chairman at the end of 2021. We are grateful for his many years of leadership and commitment to Omnicom and wish him all the best.\nMichael Larson and John Doolittle have been promoted to CEO of DAS and CEO of the newly created Communications consultancy network, respectively, reporting to me. Both of them have worked closely with Dale and have been a driving force within DAS for many years. They are highly talented executives who are skilled at managing agencies in a range of disciplines.\nWith these leadership changes, I couldn't be more confident about the continued success of our group. Our people are our greatest asset, and we are constantly looking to invest and create opportunities for them across the enterprise, especially during the time when the war for talent is fierce, attracting and retaining talent is a top priority.\nWe have made many changes. We've also instituted new programs that provide greater career mobility across our agencies, allow for agile and flexible work arrangements, and expand our investments in technology, learning and development programs while maintaining competitive benefits and compensation programs. We also want Omnicom to be a company that our people can be proud of and want to work for. Over the years, we've been focused on the role we play in critical areas such as environmental, sustainability and diversity, equity and inclusion.\nIn 2021, we named new leadership and expanded our teams in these high-priority areas so that we can continue acting on our goals and implement new initiatives. In fact, this past year, we are the only company in our industry named to Newsweek's list of America's most responsible companies. We aim to achieve more in the new year so we can ensure Omnicom agencies are a destination of choice for top talent.\nWe're entering the new year in a very strong position with a sharp eye on our key strategic initiatives, which remain our talent, dedication to creativity and building our already strong capabilities in precision marketing and MarTech consulting, e-commerce, digital and performance media and predictive data-driven insights, all of which are fully supported by Omni.\nIn closing, I'd like to recognize and thank our people around the world. You are the reason we delivered such strong results this quarter and for the full year. You kept your focus and commitment to Omnicom's client and operations, even with the ongoing challenges of the pandemic. Your efforts in these tough times are noticed and appreciated. Thank you.\nI will now turn the call over to Phil for a closer look at our financials. Phil?\n\nPhilip J. Angelastro\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Omnicom Group Inc.\n\nThanks, John, and good afternoon. Thank you for taking the time to join us today. Our fourth quarter results continued the momentum of the third quarter and helped us finish the year in a strong position. While the world isn't the same as it was pre-pandemic, we are in a stronger position to serve our clients in 2022 and beyond.\nLet's begin with a brief look at our income statement on Slide 3. Growth in revenues and operating profit flowed through to net income for both the quarter and the year. Combined with the resumption of our share buyback program, we had 6% growth in diluted earnings per share. Dividends grew 7.7% in 2021, and we're pleased to resume this growth after maintaining our dividend payments throughout the pandemic.\nPlease turn to Slide 4, and we'll go through our results in more detail, starting with revenues. Our total revenue growth in the quarter was 2.6%, while our organic growth for the quarter was 9.5% or $358 million. The impact of foreign exchange rates decreased our revenue slightly in the quarter by just 30 basis points. However, if rates stay where they were at January 31, we estimate that the impact of foreign exchange rates will reduce our revenue by approximately 2% in both the first and second quarters of 2022.\nThe impact on revenue from our net acquisitions and dispositions decreased revenue by 6.6%. This was consistent with our expectations and is primarily the result of disposition activity from Q2 of 2021. We have also acquired some excellent businesses in key growth areas, which I will discuss later. Based on transactions completed to date, we estimate the impact of acquisitions net of dispositions will reduce our revenue by approximately 9% in the first quarter and by approximately 5% in the second quarter of 2022, and we expect positive acquisition growth in the second half of 2022.\nSlide 5 presents the changes in our total revenues by business discipline. Advertising, our largest category, posted 7.4% organic growth in the quarter. Both our media agencies and our creative agencies contributed nicely to this growth. Precision Marketing grew 19.6% organically in the quarter and is now 8% of our total revenues. As John discussed, the businesses in this discipline are doing exceptionally well and have a great pipeline for their work in digital and marketing transformation consulting services, e-commerce, marketing sciences and digital experience design.\nCommerce and Brand Consulting was up 12.4%, with widespread strength across our larger agencies. In Commerce, our agencies experienced strong growth, although off a reduced base. In Brand Consulting, we're seeing benefits and good activity in the technology sector and from corporate branding aimed at reputation, ESG and DE&I.\nExperiential's growth in excess of 50% benefited from a return of some in-person events throughout the fourth quarter before the Omicron variant took hold, and we expect continued growth in 2022, although likely choppy, as brands look to engage with consumers in person. Execution and support was up 5.2%, with growth in the U.S. businesses exceeding the performance of our businesses in Europe, where our field marketing business was impacted by the new variant.\nPR was up 4.4% and health care was up 4.5%. Both of these disciplines reflected strong performance across their agencies. It's worth remembering that they performed relatively well throughout the pandemic. So we are pleased with the results.\nFlipping to Slide 6, you can see that we grew organically in each of our regions and growth came from most of our disciplines within these geographies. In the U.S., our 7.8% organic growth was slightly higher than last quarter, led by advertising and media as well as precision marketing, where growth remains over 20%. Also, results for our experiential business in the U.S. this quarter were quite strong, as I mentioned.\nOutside the U.S., growth was led by the U.K. and the Asia Pacific region, with strong PR, media and commerce and consulting results in the U.K. and broad strength across the board in Asia. It's worth mentioning the strong organic growth of 48% for the Middle East and Africa, our smallest region. Revenue in Q4 of 2020 was down over 35%. In Q4 2021, advertising and media performance was strong. And this quarter's results were also positively impacted by experiential revenue related to the Dubai Expo, which was initially scheduled for 2020.\nLooking at revenue by industry sector on Slide 7. Relative to full year 2020, there was a 2-point increase in our revenue mix from technology clients, offset by a 1 point reduction in the revenue mix from pharma and health.\nLet's now turn to Slide 8 for a review of our operating expenses. Salary-related service costs, our largest category, increased by 11.1%. As expected, these costs, which include freelance support increased along with our increase in revenue as did travel and entertainment costs, which aligns with the fact that our people are slowly going out in certain markets and meeting with clients in person.\nThe next line item, third-party service costs, were down 11.2%. They decreased by approximately $220 million from dispositions and were offset by an increase of approximately $100 million from growth in our businesses.\nOccupancy and other costs, which are less directly linked to changes in revenue, were up 4.2% year-on-year due to higher general office expenses as we return to the office, offset by lower rent and other occupancy costs as we continue to use our spaces more efficiently. SG&A expenses were up 8.4% on a year-over-year basis due to an increase in marketing, professional fees and new business costs.\nIn total, our operating expense levels were up slightly, less than 3% from the fourth quarter 2020 to 2021. We're comfortable with this growth because it is linked to a return to the pre-pandemic environment as well as our continued revenue growth, new business opportunities and investments for future growth.\nIf you turn to Slide 9, you can see our operating profit growth and our margin performance. For the quarter, operating profit increased 1.3% and represented a 16.1% operating margin. This is a slight margin decline from the fourth quarter of 2020 when expense levels were well below normal.\nOur fourth quarter EBITDA change in margin performance was similar. For the full year, operating profit was up 37.5% with a margin of 15.4%, and EBITDA was up 35.4% with a margin of 15.9%. As we look forward, while we expect to continue to see a return of certain costs to more normalized levels, we also expect that they will be offset in part by reductions in certain discretionary and infrastructure costs resulting from new ways of working and efficiencies achieved during the pandemic.\nAs John mentioned earlier, for the full year 2022, we anticipate delivering the same strong reported operating profit margin of 15.4% that we delivered in 2021. And as always, we will continue to focus on growing our operating profit dollars.\nLet's now turn to our cash flow performance on Slide 10. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding changes in working capital, which are generally positive for us on an annual basis. Free cash flow of $1.8 billion, grew 5.4%. We're pleased with the strength of this important metric.\nRegarding our uses of cash, we used $592 million of cash to pay dividends to common shareholders and another $113 million for dividends to noncontrolling interest shareholders. We maintained our dividend throughout the pandemic in 2020 and increased it by 7.7% in 2021 to a quarterly rate of $0.70 per share.\nI'm going to discuss capital expenditures in 2 pieces. Our normal capital expenditure levels were unchanged from 2020. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we had a very unique opportunity to purchase our primary office building in London for approximately $575 million. Subsequent to the purchase during the fourth quarter of 2021, we issued GBP 325 million sterling notes due in 2033, with an attractive 2.25% coupon.\nTo give you some background, we have more than 5,000 people at work there for multiple agencies. It's our largest office building globally in our second largest market. We've been consolidating space in London for some time and have exited 31 buildings since 2015. London is a key market for our future. And this building is in the South Bank area west of London Bridge near to Tate Modern, culturally vibrant area of London key to attracting and retaining talent.\nFinancially, it's an attractive opportunity for our business. And we will avoid expected market increases on our rent that didn't compare favorably to outright ownership. The purchase of this building has not changed our capital allocation strategy and did not impact our credit rating.\nAcquisitions picked up relative to 2020 at $202 million. As we talked about last call, we are investing in the areas most important to our clients and therefore, to our future revenue growth. Two acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021 are highlighted at the back of this deck. Jump 450 Media, a performance media agency that is now part of Omnicom Media Group; and BrightGen, a digital business transformation specialist that is a significant implementation partner for the Salesforce marketing stack. BrightGen is now part of our Precision Marketing Group.\nAnd lastly, we ramped up our stock repurchases during the fourth quarter, bringing the year to $518 million. As you know, our pre-pandemic annual range was $500 million to $600 million. So we are solidly back on track with this important total return component for our shareholders.\nOur historical capital allocation has been very consistent. Using our free cash flow for dividends stock repurchases and acquisitions. We don't expect this to change going forward. Although we do see more opportunities for acquisitions similar to those we completed in 2021. These tuck-in type acquisitions are efficient for us because the acquired agencies and their service offerings can contribute across our group to serve an embedded base of clients and to help win new ones.\nSlide 11 shows our credit and liquidity. Notwithstanding the sterling note I just mentioned, you can see that our other financing activities throughout the year lowered our outstanding debt from December 2020 to December 2021. At year-end, our total leverage was 2.4x. In addition to the $5.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet at year-end, we also have a USD 2 billion commercial paper program backstopped by our $2.5 billion revolving credit facility.\nI'll end my prepared remarks today on Slide 12. We chose our strong return on invested capital of 33.4% for the fiscal year 2021 and 44.3% return on equity. Both of these took notable steps up from 2020 and remain very healthy indicators of the strength of our business and its attractiveness to shareholders.\nAt this point, operator, please open the lines for questions and answers. Thank you."

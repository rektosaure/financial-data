Welcome to the Philip Morris International 2025 Third Quarter Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJames R. Bushnell\n\nVice President of Investor Relations & Financial Communications\n\nWelcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2025 3rd quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com.\nA glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the Form 8-K dated October 21, 2025, and on our Investor Relations website.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nI'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. Following an excellent first half, we delivered very strong results in Q3. We are especially pleased with the performance of our global smoke-free business, with outstanding volume growth for all 3 of our flagship brands: IQOS, ZYN and VEEV, which together outgrew the global smoke-free industry by a clear margin on year-to-date IMS.\nContinued double-digit smoke-free top line momentum and further scale and cost benefits enable us to achieve more than $3 billion in quarterly smoke-free gross profit for the first time, and an adjusted group operating income margin of over 43%, the highest in almost 4 years. This drove plus 17% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share to a record $2.24. These impressive results were also delivered in a quarter with elevated commercial spending as we invest in the future growth of our brands.\nOur growth investments include geographic expansion and our smoke-free products are now commercialized in 100 markets, including the launch of IQOS in Taiwan this month. We are increasingly deploying our multi-category strategy to enhance growth with all smoke-free brands now commercialized together in 25 markets.\nIQOS delivered excellent performance, including a very strong gross margin contribution, with Q3 HTU adjusted in-market sales growth of plus 9% against a high prior year comparison, and plus 15.5% heated tobacco unit shipment growth. This reflects continued strong momentum in Europe, Japan and Global Markets.\nThe relaunch of ZYN's commercial activities supported a significant Q3 acceleration in U.S. offtake growth to plus 39%, as estimated by Nielsen. Enhanced marketing and promotional intensity supported increased trial among legal age nicotine users, with promising level of repurchase intent. Driven by the strong performance in the fast-growing nicotine pouch category, U.S. shipments grew by plus 37% to 205 million cans, ahead of expectation. International can volumes increased by plus 27% or by over plus 100%, excluding Nordic country.\nIn e-vapor, strong VEEV momentum saw total shipments more than doubling on a year-to-date basis. VEEV is now the #1 closed pod brand in 8 markets, with notably strong performances in Germany, Romania and Greece. Combustibles delivered a good Q3 with better-than-expected volumes in both Turkey and Egypt, combining with further strong pricing to deliver a robust top and bottom line performance.\nOur Q3 performance reflects our position as the global category leader, with the ability to drive strong growth and prioritize resources to invest significantly in our leading brands. The increasing overall profitability of our smoke-free business, coupled with cost efficiency measures and combustible resilience, places us well on track for another year of double-digit adjusted operating income and earnings per share growth in currency-neutral terms, and even stronger dollar growth at prevailing exchange rates.\nTurning to the headline financials for Q3. Positive shipment volumes, strong smoke-free category mix and pricing resulted in organic top line growth of plus 5.9% or approximately plus 7.3%, excluding the Indonesia technical impact explained earlier this year, within the high end of our plus 6% to plus 8% midterm growth algorithm. Adjusted OI grew by plus 7.5% organically and plus 12.4% in dollar terms to $4.7 billion, with increasing profitability across smoke-free and combustibles, enabling good adjusted OI margin expansion of plus 120 basis points.\nAdjusted diluted EPS of $2.24 reflect adjusted net income of $3.5 billion and growth of plus 17.3%, including a currency tailwind of $0.08, which includes around $0.03 of favorable transactional impact in the quarter. This better-than-expected delivery reflects the strength of our financial model, with both IQOS and ZYN performing at the high end of our expectation, further supported by the resilience of combustible and a more favorable tax rate.\nOur progress on a year-to-date basis was outstanding, with comparable growth above our midterm targets on all metrics. Organic net revenue growth of plus 7.5%, or around plus 9%, excluding the Indonesia technical impact, was driven by the same factor as the quarter. Adjusted operating income grew by plus 12.5% organically and close to plus 14% in dollar terms to $12.7 billion, enabling EPS growth of plus 16%, both including and excluding currency impact. Our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate was 1% lower than our forecast of around 22% rate for the year, with a higher rate expected in Q4.\nTurning to shipment volumes, where we again delivered positive growth of plus 0.7% in Q3 or plus 1.8% on a year-to-date basis. Q3 smoke-free volume growth of plus 16.6% was underpinned by the strong fundamentals of IQOS, where HTU shipments grew plus 15.5% to 41 billion units, above our prior expectation even when excluding a shipment timing benefit of around 1 billion units. On a year-to-date basis, HTU shipment grew plus 12%. The excellent volume trajectory of both ZYN and VEEV was again accretive to smoke-free product growth in both Q3 and year-to-date, notably including U.S. ZYN. Cigarette volumes declined by 3.2% in Q3, close to the more favorable end of our 3% to 4% forecast decline for H2, and reflecting better-than-expected dynamics in Turkey and Egypt.\nTurning to Q3 net revenues in more detail. Growth of plus 7.3%, excluding the technical Indonesia impact, reflects the strong smoke-free performance described, alongside robust pricing. Total pricing contributed plus 3.1 points, with convertible pricing of over plus 8% and a positive IQOS HTU variance, partly offset by the impact of the relaunch promotion in the U.S. The positive mix impact from smoke-free growth drove a further plus 4.7 points.\nCombustible geographic mix and other factors had an unfavorable impact of 1.2 points. Currency and scope effect had a positive impact of plus 3.5 points. The same dynamic drove strong year-to-date top line growth as our 3 pillars of growth: volumes, pricing, and mix continue to deliver sustainably.\nLooking at the Q3 performance by category, both smoke-free and combustibles delivered strong gross margin expansion. Q3 smoke-free net revenues grew organically by plus 13.9% and gross profit by plus 14.8%, including the short-term impact of heightened U.S. promotions.\nGross margin expanded by plus 60 basis points to 70% in Q3, exceeding combustible by 3.5 points at the current category and geographic mix. This performance was powered by IQOS, with a combination of strong volumes, pricing scale and cost efficiency outdoing the dilutive impact of higher device sales in the quarter.\nWhile combustible volumes declined by 3%, the business delivered another strong quarter, with organic net revenue growth of plus 1% or around plus 3%, excluding the technical impact in Indonesia, and gross profit growing strongly by plus 4.8%. This performance epitomized the continued resilience of our combustible business model with a combination of low single-digit volume decline, robust pricing and efficiency driving top line and gross profit growth over time. We are well on track to deliver our target of combustible gross margin expansion organically and in dollar terms for the year.\nThe combination of sustained smoke-free momentum and combustible resilience drove plus 170 basis points of gross margin expansion overall to reach 67.9%, a record quarterly level since the pandemic recovery of 2021.\nOur year-to-date performance was outstanding, with the accretive impact of smoke-free growth clearly evident. Smoke-free gross margin expanded by plus 360 basis points, with IQOS, again a significant contributor, in addition to ZYN's superior U.S. margin and a growing contribution from VEEV. Combined with strong combustible performance, we delivered plus 260 basis points of gross margin expansion for total PMI.\nMoving down the P&L to OI margin. We delivered a plus 60 basis points of organic expansion in Q3 or plus 120 basis points in dollar terms to reach an excellent 43.1%. This reflects the plus 170 basis point gross margin expansion I just covered, partly offset by elevated SG&A costs as flagged last quarter. This includes a substantial planned commercial investment in international markets beyond the expansion and brand equity of IQOS, ZYN and VEEV. It also includes stepped-up marketing and brand investment behind ZYN in the U.S., following the return to full availability and further investment in our U.S. capabilities to support the future growth of ZYN and IQOS. We anticipate SG&A costs will increase slightly more than underlying net revenue for the year, excluding currency, reflecting this strong reinvestment.\nOngoing cost efficiency in both cost of goods sold and SG&A partially offset increased investments, and we remain well on track to deliver our planned $2 billion cost-saving objective over 2024-2026.\nFocusing now on our global smoke-free business, our portfolio is outpacing the industry in the 100 markets where we are present, with over plus 12% estimated IMS volume growth year-to-date compared to less than 10% for the industry. We estimate our volume share of smoke-free product in this market is around 60%, and our year-to-date share of category growth is more than 10 points higher than this. With our portfolio of leading premium brands, our share of smoke-free in value term is notably higher than this 60%.\nOur multi-category portfolio is a key strength as we leverage the equity and reach of IQOS to convert more legal age nicotine users. IQOS generated more than $11 billion in net revenue last year, and its 75% plus share of the growing global tobacco category remained stable despite intensifying competition. ZYN, while still small in comparison, is growing notably faster than the category as we benefit from a strong leadership position in the U.S. and rapid progress in international market, supported by a differentiated and long-term oriented portfolio. The same is true in e-vapor, where brand loyalty and repeat purchase for VEEV is accelerating growth.\nIQOS delivered a strong Q3, with plus 9% adjusted IMS growth against a strong prior year comparison, resulting in plus 10% growth year-to-date. As flagged last quarter, we expect double-digit growth in H2 and plus 10% to plus 12% growth in adjusted IMS for the year, including an acceleration in the fourth quarter. This is supported by continuous innovation on devices and consumables, including a high focus on brand engagement, with an example being the rollout of the limited edition Seletti device in Japan, followed by other markets as part of our Curious X campaign.\nTurning to ZYN. Can shipment grew by plus 36% on a global basis, with a presence now in 47 markets. This includes the Q3 launch in Spain as well as the rollout of small-scale pilot in Japan with ZYN by IQOS building on the strong brand equity and commercial presence of the world's leading smoke-free brand.\nIn the U.S., can shipment grew by plus 37% with a strong acceleration in offtake, which I will come back to. Outside the U.S., can shipment grew plus 27% or over plus 100% excluding the Nordics, with rapid growth from the U.K., Pakistan, Poland and South Africa.\nWe continue to enrich our ZYN product offering, including the progressive rollout of lower strength variant as part of our dry-led portfolio, where we observe a substantial increase in repeat purchase for legal aged smokers new to the oral category versus higher strength product.\nMoving to e-vapor. This strong momentum continued, with the brand now holding the #1 closed pod position in 8 markets. We delivered excellent Q3 volume growth of plus 91% despite unfavorable regulatory development in Poland. Strong year-to-date volume momentum, including an improved pods-to-kit ratio driven by repeat purchase, drove increasing operating leverage and scale benefit, enhancing profitability.\nReviewing now by geography, Europe is the most developed multicategory region, with markets such as Italy, Greece, Spain and Romania posting excellent growth within all 3 smoke-free categories. IQOS continued its strong growth trajectory in Q3, with adjusted IMS up plus 7.3% against a tougher comparison, notably driven by Italy and supported by innovation on new TEREA variants and LEVIA capsules.\nPMI HTU shares of the combined cigarette and HTU industry increased by plus 1.2 points to 10.7%, with key cities such as Munich, Rome and Madrid, all posting very strong growth. We expect a nice acceleration in adjusted IMS growth in Q4. After numerous launches and expansions across the region in the last 1 to 2 years, this excellent early traction continued with share gains across markets, including Poland, Switzerland, Greece and the U.K. Within e-vapor, the consumer shift to close pod continue to underpin growth. These volumes doubled, with the brand now holding the #1 pod position in 7 European markets.\nIn Japan, IQOS continues to grow very robustly, with Q3 adjusted IMS growth of plus 6%, again, against a strong plus 14% in Q3 last year and plus 7.6% on a year-to-date basis. This primarily reflects the category growth rate, with 12-month segment share stable at around 70%, notwithstanding a very significant step-up in competitive commercial investment and intensity, and as in similar periods in the past, some increased trial of discounted competitor product.\nAs mentioned last quarter, IQOS delivered truly exceptional growth in 2023 and 2024, especially considering the size of the category is approaching half of total nicotine offtake volume nationally, and more than half in 14 of the top 20 cities. The growth that our business has delivered so far in '25 is essentially in line with the trend in the years prior. Q3 adjusted IQOS HTU share increased 1.8 points year-on-year to reach 31.7% as we continue to innovate on IQOS and plant the first seeds of multi-category deployment, with the introduction of ZYN in select channels and location.\nTurning now to the U.S., which made up around 7% of our global net revenues and 9% of our adjusted operating income year-to-date. Q3 ZYN volume performance was remarkable, with an acceleration to plus 39% of the growth according to Nielsen, the fastest growth in the last 5 quarters. As the fastest-growing category in the world's highest value nicotine market, excluding China, we are naturally investing in ZYN and the category's future growth, where the brands continue to hold over 60% share of volume and 2/3 of value.\nAfter posting plus 31% offtake growth across July and August according to Nielsen, our Q3 growth was amplified in September to plus 58% by the reacceleration of marketing and promotional support after several quarters of supplied constraint. With the growth of ZYN now close to that of the industry, ZYN captured the majority of Q3 category growth in both volume and value terms despite a markedly lower average price for the quarter.\nIndeed, ZYN was the fastest-growing brand by dollar retail value across all categories in the U.S. convenience channel on both the Q3 and year-to-date basis as measured by Nielsen, with PMI U.S. also the same on a manufacturer level as shown here. This emphasized the strength and power of ZYN franchise with both our retail partners and legal age nicotine users, providing an excellent platform from which to drive further growth.\nAs mentioned, we recently implemented a strong step-up in overall marketing and brand-building activities to support ZYN's presence at point of sale, brand visibility, brand equity and relative price positioning. In Q3, this had a notable skew to promotions. In the supply constrained first half of 2025, only around 20% of ZYN volumes were sold on promotion according to Nielsen, with competitors closer to 50%.\nWith our return to full commercial activity, we expect to maintain a higher level of promotion than H1 as we continue to adapt our marketing mix to provide the appropriate level of support for the brand and the growth of the category. We naturally intend to maintain a clear premium positioning for ZYN as the leading premium brand. We also look forward to reporting back on future commercial initiatives, with one example being limited edition variants based on our authorized product range.\nAs part of our reintensified activities, we also decided to launch a special September promotion to mark ZYN's return to full availability. This offered a free ZYN can for legal edge consumer purchasing other nicotine products in select location, and was designed to target legal aged smoker and other nicotine users to increase awareness and trial. This is in line with ZYN's mission to grow the nicotine pouch category over the coming years, and we are very happy with the result. The vast majority of those accessing the offer were smokers or vapors with improved brand perception and promising level of repurchase intent. This offer accounted for a single-digit percentage of our Q3 shipment.\nEssentially, all the promotional cost of activating the special free can offer, including retail incentives, were booked in net revenues in the quarter. This largely explains the lower Americas top line when volumes were growing. With accumulation of relaunch activities, this was an exceptional quarter of investment, with around $100 million of Q3 specific investment and reduced revenues linked to restarting our commercial engine.\nThe U.S. nicotine pouch category has been growing at more than 40% over the last 18 months, and today represents a high single-digit percentage of the nicotine market by volume. We believe it has the capacity to become one of the largest category in the U.S. over the coming years, where we estimate cigarettes are more than 40% of the market, and e-vapor in the region of 30%.\nZYN is America's #1 smoke-free brand by value with a franchise which is second to none. We are investing to support ZYN's momentum, both within and outside the U.S. We also hope for a positive outcome from FDA's recently announced plan to streamline the review process for nicotine pouches, which should help clarify and level the playing field. As a reminder, the FDA has only authorized 20 nicotine pouch product to date, all of which are under the ZYN brand, and we expect the TPSAC hearing from ZYN's MRTP application in the first quarter of 2026.\nAltogether, we expect ZYN will continue to be an important growth driver of PMI net revenue and operating income. While the absence of a full commercial program in the first half of this year drove an exceptional level of U.S. profitability, we expect ZYN to continue delivering best-in-class margins within PMI.\nOn a more short-term basis, we continue to expect H2 shipment volume growth broadly in line with offtake growth before channel inventory movement. We anticipate a 20 million to 30 million can inventory reduction in the coming months. This impact being effectively delayed from Q3, given strong September promotional activity.\nWe also continue to await the FDA authorization of IQOS ILUMA, which represent, by far, the most successful product globally in switching cigarette user completely away from smoking. In the meantime, we are continuing with IQOS 3 pilots including the latest location of Jackson, Mississippi as we also await the renewal of our IQOS 3 MRTP, following the TPSAC meeting earlier this month.\nOutside of the U.S., Japan and Europe, all 3 of our smoke-free category are delivering dynamic growth, with Q3 shipments up plus 23% to over 12 billion units. This includes continued strong IQOS performance in South Korea, rapid in growth in Pakistan and South Africa and very dynamic multicat growth in Global Travel Retail and Indonesia. We include further IQOS key city offtake shares in the appendix.\nMoving to combustibles. Our cigar portfolio continued to demonstrate its resilience, with a strong performance from Marlboro gaining plus 0.4 points to reach a historic high share of 10.9%. International category share declined in the quarter, largely driven by Turkey, following supply chain disruption earlier in the year. However, our share is recovering well sequentially, and was essentially stable year-to-date.\nQ3 pricing of plus 8.3% came in better than expected, with contribution from all regions and notably from Indonesia Australia, Turkey and Germany. While this was partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix, we now forecast full year pricing a little above plus 7%, with a slowdown in Q3 as expected due to timing factors. Most importantly, and as covered earlier, our combustible business continues to deliver a very robust contribution, with close to plus 5% year-to-date gross profit growth. This is fully in line with our objective of maximizing value over time and supporting the growth of our smoke-free business.\nThis brings me to our outlook for the full year. We are on track for a very strong performance with another year of double-digit growth in adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. This starts with shipments where we continue to target total PMI growth of around plus 1%. Our fifth consecutive year of volume growth, including a cigarette decline of around 2% and smoke-free volume growth of plus 12% to plus 14%. Smoke-free shipment growth is more likely to be in the lower half of this range, factoring in the potential inventory adjustment for ZYN I described and expected IQOS HTU shipments of close to 38 billion units in Q4. This Q4 HTU forecast includes modestly lower channel inventory and a reversal of around 2 billion units due to timing impact, with HTU shipment growth thus broadly in line with our plus 10 to plus 12 adjusted IMS growth forecast for 2025 overall.\nWe continue to forecast organic net revenue growth of plus 6% to plus 8%, driven by positive volumes, smoke-free mix and pricing. Consistent with smoke-free volumes and given the top line impact of U.S. investment, the lower half of this range is also more likely. Excluding the technical impact of Indonesia, our forecast growth would be at or above the high end of our 3-year growth algorithm.\nWe expect another year of double-digit organic operating income progression, where we now forecast plus 10% to plus 11.5% growth for the year, including the same factor as net revenues. We expect this growth to drive strong adjusted OI margin expansion to land firmly back above 40%. This above algorithm growth in a year of strong investment clearly demonstrate the dynamism of our global growth model.\nWe are raising our adjusted diluted earnings per share forecast to the mid- to upper end of our previous currency-neutral growth range at plus 12% to plus 13.5%, which translate into plus 13.5% to plus 15.1% in dollar term. This includes an estimated $0.10 currency tailwind, and we would expect a similar sized tailwind for 2026, all at prevailing exchange rates. The 2025 forecast includes an adjusted effective tax rate of around 22% for the year based on the latest assessment of tax dynamic and market mix.\nIn Q4, we expect a continued strong performance from our smoke-free business, including an acceleration in IQOS adjusted in-market sales growth. In terms of financial performance, as expected, we anticipate a slower quarter given the dynamic I covered on shipments of IQOS and potentially ZYN, the timing of pricing and declining volume in combustible and a higher tax rate. Taking these factors, continued brand investment and comparison effect into account, we forecast a slower quarter of top line growth, single-digit organic OI growth and up to 6% currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth.\nIn addition, we are upgrading our full year operating cash flow forecast to more than $11.5 billion at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirements. This reflects strong full year profit delivery and cash conversion and now includes a Q3 dividend payment from our deconsolidated Canadian affiliate.\nIn terms of our balance sheet, we continue to target further deleveraging in 2025 with Euro-dollar currency movement, of course, having a potential influence on our ultimate year-end leverage ratio given our Euro debt position. Importantly, we remain on track for our target ratio of around 2x net debt to EBITDA by the end of 2026.\nGiven our strong year-to-date and expected full year performance, we are well on track to exceed our 2024-2026 CAGR targets, which already represent a best-in-class growth profile within consumer packaged goods. With such strong progress already delivered and an exciting growth outlook over the coming years, we look forward with confidence to 2026 and beyond.\nIn summary, our year-to-date performance reflects the strength and momentum of our global smoke-free business, combined with the resilience of combustible. Our smoke-free business is increasingly profitable, with IQOS and ZYN leading the way. We remain excited about our future growth potential as we continue to deploy our multi-category strategy and invest in our category leading premium brands.\nOur financial model is built on strength across all categories, complemented by proactive measures on pricing and cost efficiencies. This drives our confidence in strong and sustainable adjusted diluted EPS growth in both currency neutral and dollar terms.\nOur focused capital allocation strategy allows us to not only reinvest at the optimal level to support and elevate our smoke-free portfolio, but also to reward our shareholders. In September, we raised our dividend for the 18th consecutive year to $5.88 per share, with growth of plus 8.9%, the largest increase since 2013, reflecting our strong year-to-date performance and confidence in our outlook. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation continues.\nThank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.",

Please go ahead.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations, Philip Morris International\n\nWelcome and good morning. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2025 second quarter results. Press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K filed today and on our investor relations website.

I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. We delivered an excellent set of H1 results following another very strong performance in the second quarter of 2025. Top-line dynamism from our smoke-free portfolio, which reached a record $4 billion in net revenues, coupled with margin improvements across our business drove strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in both constant currency and dollar terms. The multi-category momentum of our smoke-free business accelerated with a Q2 step-up in offtake growth for IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV. As expected, IQOS delivered another strong performance with heated tobacco unit adjusted in-market sales\ngrowth accelerating to +11.4% in Q2. This reflects broad-based growth both globally and in Europe as markets such as Italy pass the transitory disruption of the characterizing flavor ban. ZYN confirmed its upward trajectory with a significant acceleration in US consumer offtake growth to +26% for Q2 and 36% in June as in-store availability improved. Internationally, Q2 nicotine pouch volumes increased +65% and almost trebled outside the Nordics. In e-vapor, VEEV continued its remarkable trajectory with shipments more than doubling year-over-year, driving further gross margin expansion for combustibles. Despite an expected return to modest volume declines, our business\ndelivered robust top- and bottom-line performance reflecting its resilient model led by strong pricing. We continue to generate best-in-class growth across the P&L with high single-digit organic H1 top-line growth and mid-teens adjusted OI growth to reach a margin of over 41%. This high-quality performance reflects the increasing profitability of our three smoke-free categories, scale, operating leverage, and efficiencies. Combined, these results provide an excellent platform for another year of superior growth. We expect strong smoke-free momentum to continue in H2 while we factor in the exceptional H2 prior year comparison, notably on growing combustible volumes and certain\ntiming factors. With strong business fundamentals and a slightly more favorable expected tax rate, we are raising our Adjusted Diluted EPS full-year forecast to +13% to +15% growth or +11.5% to 13.5% excluding currency. Looking at our Q2 financials, we delivered another quarter of shipment volume growth of 1.2% and organic top line growth of 6.8% or plus 7.1% in dollar terms to reach over $10 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time. Excluding the Indonesia technical impact explained last quarter, organic net revenues grew by more than 8%. Adjusted OI grew by 14.9% organically with growing profitability in all categories, positive smoke-free margin mix, and ongoing cost\nefficiencies. Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.91 reflects growth of +20% including a favorable currency variance of $0.02, $0.04 lower than previously guided mainly due to intercompany transactional impact from currency volatility at payer end including on the Swiss franc. This better than expected EPS delivery notably reflect strong top-line momentum, positive margin evolution in our smoke-free product business, and robust combustible pricing. Combining this excellent Q2 with a strong first quarter, we achieved one of our strongest ever H1 performances. Total shipment volumes grew by +2.5% and organic net revenues by +8.4% or approximately 10% excluding the\nIndonesia technical impact. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove Adjusted Operating Income growth of circa +15% in both organic and USD terms to reach $8 billion in total. H1 Adjusted Diluted EPS was up by 17.7% in constant currency and by +16.1% in dollar terms. Turning to shipment volumes, we delivered Q2 growth of 1.2% and +2.5% for the first half, driven by more than 13% growth from our smoke-free business while adjusted in-market sales growth accelerated. Q2 HTU shipment volume grew +9.2% to 38 billion units including robust growth in Europe and Japan as well as promising growth from global market such as\nIndonesia, South Korea, and global travel retail. H1 HTU shipments increased by +10.5% broadly in line with adjusted in-market sales growth. As mentioned last quarter, our H1 shipments include a Q1 shipment timing benefit of around 1 billion units which we expect to reverse in the fourth quarter. Oral and e-vapor shipments again grew significantly. Cigarette volumes declined modestly in Q2 following the exceptional growth of recent quarters. This was primarily due to contraction in Indonesia and in Turkey where we experienced supply chain issues following a change in regulatory requirements. This resulted in a temporary loss of volume and share with some associated inventory\nwrite-downs. We expect a gradual recovery through the remainder of the year, though H2 year-on-year comparisons are still likely to be affected. In Indonesia, despite a good share performance, a growing illicit segment is impacting both the legal industry and our volumes within it, and this is also likely to extend into H2. We expect our cigarette volumes to decline around 2% for the year, more in line with the historic underlying trend. This includes a forecast decline of 3% to 4% in H2 against the high prior year comparison I mentioned, with Turkey accounting for close to half of this decline. This also factored the continuation of decline in Europe and Japan as smoke-free\nproduct grows strongly, and the dynamic in Indonesia and in Egypt where the recovery of the main local competitor is ongoing after previous supply constraints. As a testament to the resilience of our combustible model, we are still targeting combustible gross profit growth in H2 supported by pricing and cost efficiencies for smoke-free product. We anticipate continued double digit volume growth in H2 including the expected reversal of H1 phasing benefit on IQOS. However, given cigarette dynamics it is possible that H2 may see modest decline for total PMI volumes. Importantly, with the forecast full-year increase of around +1%, we continue to target our fifth consecutive year of\ntotal volume growth as we do for future years, as our smoke-free portfolio continues to drive performance. Breaking the performance down by category, exceptional gross margin and OI growth in Q2 resulted in impressive first half results powered by our increasingly profitable smoke-free business. H1 smoke-free net revenue grew organically by +17.3% to $8.1 billion and gross profit by +27% to $5.6 billion with 530 basis points of organic expansion to reach over 70% gross margin. This is around 4.5 points above the gross margin of combustibles at the current category and geographic mix as in 2024. This reflects continued margin expansion for all three smoke-free categories.\nNotably, combined with the positive mix impact of ZYN, accretive unit economics and pricing on both HTUs and ZYN. Very strong IQOS growth, margin expansion reflect the powerful growth and scale effect of this large and growing business, manufacturing productivities, and a comparison benefit from higher device shipment in the prior year when ILUMA i was launched in Japan and other markets. We expect strong margin to continue in H2, albeit without the device year-on-year comparison benefit, as we also further expand the presence of ILUMA i across markets, Bonds in Indonesia. Combustible net revenues increased by +2.9% or more than 5% excluding the\nIndonesia technical impact. Gross profit grew by +5% driving 140 basis points of margin expansion despite the financial impact of the Turkey disruption. This includes a robust Q2 with organic net revenue growth of +2% and gross profit growth of 4.8%. This performance epitomize the resilience of our ongoing combustible business model with low single digit volume declines, robust pricing, and efficiencies combining to deliver top line and gross profit growth over time. We continue to target combustible gross margin expansion organically and in dollar term for the year despite slower pricing and weaker volume. In H2 the combination of sustained smoke-free momentum and\ncombustible resilience led to +15.4% H1 organic OI growth at total PMI level resulting in +250 basis points of operating income margin expansion to surpass 41%. H1 net revenue growth of 8.4% was again fueled by the three engines of our top line growth model with positive volumes, robust pricing, and favorable smoke-free mix. Pricing contributed +5.2 points driven by combustible pricing of 7.7% and low single-digit smoke-free pricing excluding devices. The positive mix impact of rapid SFP growth drove a further contribution of 3.1 points. Combustible geographic mix and other factors had an unfavorable impact of 2.4 points, including the Indonesia technical impact\nof around 1.5 points. Currency had a negative impact of 1.5 points with a further 0.4 points from acquisition and divestitures which include the divestment of Vectura. Turning now to gross margins, we delivered H1 organic expansion of 300 basis points and +320 basis points including currency, acquisitions, and divestitures. Pricing made a +160 basis points contribution, more than offsetting the 60 basis points unfavorable impact from cost inflation net of productivity and other cost items. Smoke-free growth drove an excellent +190 basis points, reflecting the factors I covered earlier. The impact of combustibles was broadly flat excluding pricing but including the Indonesia impact\nbelow gross profit. We continue to invest strongly in the future growth of our smoke-free brands, including in the US, with SG&A organic growth of +10.6% for H1, marginally above net revenue growth excluding the technical impact of Indonesia. We achieved more than $500 million in gross cost savings year-to-date through our manufacturing and back office efficiency initiatives. Now, at the midpoint of our target 2024-26 period, we have delivered over $1.2 billion, placing us well on track towards our $2 billion objective. Altogether, gross margin expansion more than compensating for higher year-on-year commercial investment. We delivered +290 basis points of adjusted\noperating income margin expansion in H1 or +250 basis points organically. Q2 organic OI margin expansion of +300 basis points was even stronger than the +200 basis points in our first quarter. Focusing now on our smoke-free business where our multi-category strategy is facilitating the continuous growth of our smoke-free user base. Estimated legal-age consumer of our SFPs grew by approximately 5 million versus one year ago, reaching around 41.5 million as of 30 June. Our smoke-free products are now available in 97 markets following the Q2 launch of ZYN in Ireland and Cambodia. Almost half of these markets now have a multi-category offer with at least two of IQOS,\nZYN, and VEEV on sale to legal-age nicotine user. As shown on this slide, we now have all three categories deployed in 20 markets as we continue to broaden our multi-category presence. The regulatory environment is a key enabler of smoke-free growth, and I'm pleased to report some more examples of positive progress, such as legislation providing new market access for one or more SFP categories across several Middle East markets. We also note the recently published proposal to revise the EU Tobacco Excise Directive which marked the start of a formal legislative process that will require unanimous approval by all Member States and subsequent transposition into national law.\nMany Member States have already adopted risk proportionate regulation and taxation frameworks for smoke-free products which can serve as a valuable foundation and benchmark for shaping the final directive. While we note the clear differentiation for smoke-free product relative to combustible in the proposed minimum rate, we are also disappointed to observe the lack of a plan to counter the threat of illicit trade which accounted for 9.2% of total EU cigarette consumption in 2024 with governments losing over EUR 14 billion in tax revenue. At a time when many countries face intense economic pressure. Our multi-category approach is built on the strength of the brand and\ncommercial presence of IQOS, which remains our core smoke-free product growth engine. We continue to be laser-focused on maximizing the growth of IQOS over time with the deployment of ZYN and VEEV under its umbrella, offering complementary opportunities to fully transition legal-age nicotine users from cigarettes to SFPs. In this context, I'm especially pleased to confirm the acceleration in IQOS HTU adjusted in-market sales growth to +11.4% in Q2, notably driven by Europe and including excellent progress in its largest market of Italy as the impact of the characterizing flavor ban recedes and our commercial initiatives bear fruit. Japan also delivered another robust\nquarter of growth, and other global markets accelerated nicely. While competitive activity is increasing, we see this as positive for category growth over time and we expect continued strong IQOS progress in H2. We continue to target 10% to 12% HTU adjusted IMS growth for the year. Continuous IQOS innovation on devices and consumables combined with investment in brand equity are fundamental pillars of our growth. The rollout of the ILUMA i technology, now present in over 30 markets, remains ongoing. We are expanding the portfolio of LEVIA tobacco-free consumables with promising initial results from recently launched new test variants and flavor capsules. We\nalso commenced the rollout of a new impact design on our core premium TEREA HTUs as well as the expansion of our mainstream-priced offering DELIA with excellent results in markets such as Germany and Poland. In the US we continue with small-scale IQOS 3 pilots which are generating considerable adult consumer interest as we progress our commercial pilot in Austin. We also launched a second pilot in Fort Lauderdale during the quarter, with further initiative planned in the coming months as we prepare for the at scale launch of IQOS ILUMA once authorized by the FDA. Our second flagship premium smoke-free brand ZYN leads a category which has a potential to fundamentally\nreshape the consumption of nicotine for the substantial net benefit of global public health. As adult smokers increasingly switch to smoke-free product Q2 can shipments grew by +43% on a global basis and offtake re-accelerated strongly in the US which I'll come back to in more detail. Building on ZYN's strength, our global rollout continued to advance with Q2 international can volume up +65% year-on-year or a remarkable 179% excluding the Nordics. The growth of our international business reflects both market expansion and strong offtake growth supported by expanding production capacity in new geographies. Notable strong performances include our global\ntravel retail business with close to 200% volume excluding the US as well as the UK, Pakistan, Poland, South Africa, and Mexico as covered in our recent Europe Focus event. Our focus is on growing the category by switching legal age smokers rather than sourcing from the small existing category. It is also notable that ZYN holds the number one position in Mexico, South Africa where we launch our predominantly mini dry portfolio at the same time as competitor brands. Dry pouches already make up the majority of our pouch volumes in more than three quarters of ZYN market and we believe this format is especially relevant for legal age smokers.\nZYN is now present in 44 markets globally following additional launches in Q2. Our smoke-free trilogy is completed by these H1 shipment volumes more than double to reach almost 1.5 billion equivalent units with increasingly profitable growth driven by Europe where VEEV now holds the number one close spot position in six markets including Italy, and Greece. Outside Europe we see significant potential for the brand with nice results in diverse markets such as Indonesia, Canada, and Colombia and further rollout plan. Increasing repeat purchase rates and consumer loyalty are especially promising as we seek to leverage our multi category infrastructure under the IQOS\numbrella of quality, premiumness, and superior technology. In this vein, we recently launched our latest innovation VEEV Prime in the Czech Republic. VEEV Prime offers an upgraded premium user experience with higher intensity of flavors, a larger cloud size, and higher battery capacity with an optimized podcast profile. The most developed multi-category consumer landscape is in Europe, and we now have 30 markets with at least two categories on offer. Of course, IQOS remains the core driver of our performance in the region, and I'm delighted to report a meaningful Q2 acceleration of HTU-adjusted in-market sales growth to +9.1% as adjusted market share grew by +1.2 points\nyear-on-year to 10.9% in this seasonally higher period for combustibles. As explained at our recent Europe event, IQOS has a very strong brand platform across the region and this performance reflects our innovation and commercial initiatives including those on ILUMA i, LEVIA, and DELIA. This helped drive strong double digit adjusted IMS growth across markets including Germany, Spain, Romania, Greece, and Bulgaria. A significant Q2 call out is Italy, Europe's largest IQOS market by volume which delivered a very welcome uptick in both sequential and year-on-year growth. With the exception of Poland, Austria, Estonia, and Croatia. The impact of the EU Characterizing\nFlavor Ban is now behind us, and our absolute regional growth in HTU-adjusted IMS is now getting closer to pre-ban levels. While quarterly comparison from 2024 have some volatility from Flavor Ban dynamics, sequential trends are very positive, and we look forward to the remainder of the year with confidence in further strong IQOS growth. On top of this IQOS progression, the accretion from our multi category strategy is evident in our total volume of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV with shipment growth of +13.5% in Q2 compared to HTUs alone at +10.5%. ZYN and VEEV are still very early in their development but are demonstrating exceptional growth. The number you see here are for Europe\noverall, and I would also note that where we are present with all three brands such as Italy, Greece, Poland, and Romania, we see several points higher SFP volume growth. In Japan, we achieved a significant milestone of 10 million estimated users, and Q2 adjusted HTU shares increased +2.3 percentage points year-on-year to 31.7%. Despite increased competitive intensity, IQOS continues to deliver strong progress with Q2 adjusted IMS growth of 7.8% against a prior year period, which included the full launch of ILUMA i. As shown on the slide, IQOS delivered truly exceptional growth in 2023 and 2024, especially considering the size of the category now stands at almost half\nof total nicotine heated tobacco volume nationally and more than half in certain cities. The high single digit growth that our business delivered in H1 2025 remains very healthy and is essentially in line with the trend in the years prior. We expect further strong adjusted IMS growth in the remainder of the year. We are pleased to see our competitors embrace the heat-not-burn category, as while our category share was sequentially stable at around 70% in Q2, our biggest focus is on accelerating the size of smoke-free product overall to maximize the growth of our leading proposition and convert more smokers. Switching now to the US, the strong reacceleration in ZYN offtake growth is\na clear highlight of our Q2 performance and testament to the strength of the brand as in-store availability improves and legal age consumers regain access to the full ZYN portfolio offering. The supply constraint of previous quarters had limited the growth in sellout volumes and meant ZYN was growing less than the overall category. With manufacturing capacity now in very good shape, the recovery to around 36% ZYN volume growth in June as measured by Nielsen and +26% in Q2 overall marked the return of ZYN to its category-driving position in terms of growth and market share. On a sequential basis, ZYN offtake volume accelerated to around 12% growth versus Q1 in\nline with the total category. With a number of commercial programs restarting at the end of the quarter, this is clearly very promising as we increasingly focus on legal age smokers and vapers who have not yet switched to the category. Q2 shipments increased 41% year-on-year, reaching 190 million cans. As with any out of stock situation, quarterly shipments are subject to volatility. Restocking of the value chain was effectively completed in H1 with the majority of this taking place in the first quarter. We estimate the total net impact at broadly 14 million cans for the year, slightly below our initial expectation. This factors in the good news that retail availability is now approaching\nnormalized level, with a lower scarcity premium in retail prices narrowing the price gap to competition. Importantly, sales velocity are accelerating, and with 36% of tech growth in June, this bodes well for the second half of the year. With shipments now primarily driven by consumer offtake. We expect a broadly similar level of shipments in Q3 as in Q2, factoring in the possibility of a few days' adjustment to wholesaler and distributor inventory as the situation fully normalizes. We continue to target full-year US shipments of 800 to 840 million cans, including a sequential step-up in Q4. With our US production capacity increase ahead of plan and now well set for this year and beyond, we are\nincredibly excited to drive ZYN and the overall nicotine pouch category to its full potential over the coming years. Having covered Europe, Japan, and the US in some detail, let's look at the rest of the world. In most markets both the nicotine pouch category and our multi-category presence are nascent. Both ZYN and VEEV will leverage on the strength of IQOS where Q2 adjusted in-market sales accelerated to +19.3% growth with broad-based progress including Egypt, the Philippines, and Indonesia. While pouch and e-vapor volumes are naturally very small across this market, at this stage we can measure their Q2 growth in multiples rather than percentages.\nThis impressive IQOS growth is exemplified by offtake share gains in global key cities. Strong presence in South Korea and Malaysia is more than matched by key cities in Mexico, Serbia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Global travel retail, where multi-category is increasingly prominent, also continues to grow strongly. The world's largest cigarette market by volume outside China is Indonesia, where Jakarta offtake share grew by +2.5 points year-on-year to 7.5%. Following promising results from the pilot launch of our full flavor Heat-not-Burn Technology BONDS, which is tailored to local kretek taste preferences, we have recently commenced a broader rollout. BONDS is also\nprogressing well in Lebanon. Turning to combustible, our business delivered robust organic net revenue growth of 2% in Q2 and +2.9% for H1 with Marlboro reaching a POS category share high of 10.7% in Q2. Strong Q2 pricing of 7.2% included notable contribution from Indonesia, Germany, and Italy yielding +7.7% in H1 overall. While we continue to expect a moderation in H2 pricing due to timing and comparison dynamic, we now forecast +6 to 7% for the full year. Our strategy is to take pricing action to optimize the financial contribution to the business over time, which can naturally impact volume and share performance on a quarterly basis.\nOur combustible business is resilient, and the combination of pricing category leadership and ongoing efficiencies drove very good gross profit growth as covered earlier. This performance is in line with our objective of maximizing value over time and supporting the growth of our smoke-free business. This brings me to our revised outlook for a remarkable 2025 where we are raising our Adjusted Diluted EPS forecast for the year in both constant currency and dollar terms. As expected, we delivered a strong H1 organic performance compared to our target ranges for the full year. While combustible volume dynamics and the phasing of comparisons and costs are less favorable in H2, our\nfundamental outlook remains very good. We expect continued strong momentum on both IQOS and ZYN alongside robust pricing and meaningful margin improvement. We expect further double-digit HTU adjusted IMS progression with growth skewed to the fourth quarter. Given a strong comparison in Q3, we forecast Q3 HTU shipment of 38.5 to 39.5 billion and mid-single-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS to $2.08 to 2.13 including strong investment and a favorable currency variance of $0.05 at prevailing rates. For the full year. We continue to expect very strong organic net revenue growth in the range of +6% to 8%. Following excellent H1 top line dynamism and margin progression,\nwe are raising our forecast trend for organic operating income growth to +11% to 12.5%. We are also raising our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +11.5% to 13.5%. This includes a slightly improved effective corporate tax rate of approximately 22% to 23%. Based on the latest assessment of tax dynamic and market mix, we are still reviewing the implication of the Job Act US tax reform. In dollar terms we expect adjusted diluted EPS growth of 13% to 15%. This includes an estimated $0.10 favorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rate with favorable earnings translation from a broadly weaker dollar partly offset by transactional impact due to currency\nvolatility which I covered earlier. Given our expectation for a strong full-year profit delivery and cash conversion, we are raising our forecast for operating cash flow to around $11.5 billion at prevailing exchange rates and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We project capital expenditures slightly above our prior forecast at around $1.6 billion primarily due to further international ZYN capacity investment with CapEx spend almost entirely focused on supporting the growth of smoke-free. With regard to our balance sheet, we continue to target further deleveraging in 2025, placing us on track for our target ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026. As mentioned last\nquarter, we are a global company with broadly diversified production and a worldwide supplier network, including an established US manufacturing base, and we believe we are well positioned to mitigate potential supply chain challenges. While the situation is volatile, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our business from recently introduced, discussed tariff. Our financial growth model is driving a continuous improvement in the quality of our business, with smoke-free accretion and combustible resilience driving considerable bottom-line growth. We are well on track to meet or exceed our three-year CAGR targets, demonstrating our ability to deliver what we\nbelieve to be best-in-class CPG growth. Adjusted diluted EPS growth in dollar terms is a key objective, and we are pleased to see this delivered in H1 2024 as well as in our outlook for the year. I will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. We delivered an exceptional first half of the year placing us well on track for another year of strong performance. Our smoke-free growth is increasingly profitable as IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV gain scale and drive synergies at the consumer and commercial level. Our best-in-class financial performance is bolstered by underlying strength across all categories, including the resilience of our combustible business, in\naddition to our proactive measures on pricing and cost efficiencies. This drives our confidence in strong and sustainable adjusted diluted EPS growth in both currency-neutral and dollar terms. Finally, we remain a highly cash-generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers continued growth. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, Barclays\n\nGood morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, Barclays\n\nThank you for taking my question. A few questions for me. One is on ZYN. You know, you are saying that restock was less than what you had expected. How should one read it, that your expectations for future growth were higher earlier and now they are lower? Not only yours, but the market expectations were higher and now they are lower, and that's why the need for restock is lower. In that context, if I look at your ZYN volume guide, if I say Q3 is flat versus Q2, then in Q4 you need to do 219 to 259 million cans for that 800 to 840 guide range, which would imply almost 15% to 36% growth on a QOQ basis. I remember from covering Swedish Match, you know, a few years ago\nthat Q4 actually used to have lesser shipping days for them. They didn't really used to grow Q4 over Q3. Can you just help me understand all the moving parts from ZYN?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, with great pleasure. First of all, on the impact of the restocking, well, let's be a bit humble here. We talk about a brand that we're targeting to deliver for the year, 800 to 840 million can. There are several weeks of inventory between wholesaler, distributor, and the retailers. I'm not able to tell you a precise number. It's probably anywhere between, let's say, six to seven weeks altogether. Here we are talking, when we say it's a bit lower, I mean it's clear that for instance at the retailer level we had no precise idea of the level of inventory. We are a bit below our expectation. If I was to give a number, it's probably maybe 10 to 20 million can below. Frankly, I'm not able to be more\nspecific than that. We are talking about a few days of sales, so it's really small. That's really what we're talking about. Again, we've been facing this significant out-of-stock situation. We had the exercise of reloading. The good news is that it's behind us. We made a few assumptions on what it would mean in terms of restocking. We've been probably a bit higher versus what was really needed, but this is it. I don't think there is anything else to be read there. At the end of the day, I think we should focus on what is really important, which is the great dynamism that ZYN is facing now that there is full availability. Indeed, June was growing 36% in terms of consumer offtake according to Nielsen.\nIf I look at the first two weeks of July, we are north of 37%. I think the market is a bit above 39%. Basically, we are growing now in line with the market. It just shows that we have absolutely resumed a strong momentum, and that, of course, bodes very well for the future. At the same time, as I mentioned, we are really restarting promotional, advertising, commercial activity in a 360-degree manner, I would say. That's really what I think is important on the sequence. In my remark, I noted the fact that there may be some adjustment as people have been maybe buying ZYN in a kind of mindset of shortages. We think there could be some adjustment on the volume here and there in\nQ3, so that can impact the Q3 performance. Then we say there is a step up in Q4. At the end of the day, we are now in a dynamic where we are quarter on quarter growing nicely. I think the growth in the second quarter, 12% versus Q1, was by far the biggest sequential growth quarter on quarter since the first quarter of 2024. We are absolutely back to renewed dynamism, and we are growing fast year-on-year, and that is what is driving our expectation for volume growth. In the next months.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, Barclays\n\nSure. My second question is just on EU TPD, like you reference a few comments, but could you help us understand in more detail, like what exactly are the proposals in terms of different tax rates on NGP products. If there. Is any update on EU TPD as well?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGaurav, I'm not going to elaborate on the initial proposal. We are at the beginning of a long process. Last time it was 2010, 2011, it took two years. I think from the beginning to the end a lot of discussion will happen. I reminded everybody that it requires unanimity from the parties. I'm not going to comment on things until there is more clarity on what's going to happen. The process has started. There will be several steps. As I said last time, it took almost two years. Of course, when we have more clarity on what is really likely to happen, at that moment we'll comment the implication. In my remarks I noted the two points which are important for us for the time being.\nOne is the fact that the initial proposal is indeed coming with differentiation between smoke-free and combustible when it comes to minimum taxation. That's an important element. The second, that as an element which we hope will be improved, obviously that there is nothing when it comes to illicit, which is, I think, a real question for the European Union to tackle. That's what we can say for the time being.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eric Serotta with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks Emmanuel. Morning. A couple of questions. First, in terms of IQOS ILUMA US approval timing. I think you said you mentioned, you know, launch once authorized by the FDA. Are you guys still sticking to your expectation of a second half authorization, realizing it's not something you have control over? When you look at international IQOS, can you talk a bit about some of the drivers of the reacceleration in IMS and sort of the sustainability for the second half of the year? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Eric. First on the US, I mean we don't have anything new to report on the potential PMTA for. IQOS ILUMA. I think everybody can see that FDA is resuming activity on PMTA, and that's good news as far as we are concerned, and this is public information. There is now for the renewal of the MRTP on IQOS 3. There is a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee that has been scheduled. They have also opened a docket for ZYN MRTP. A number of things are happening. That's what we know for the time being. I have nothing new to report on the PMTA for IQOS ILUMA. We are still hoping for an approval in H2, but we are also at the same time acknowledging the fact that the\nagenda and the workload for the FDA is very heavy, and therefore it is clear that we don't have a certainty that. We will get this PMTA in 2025. That could move of course to 2026. On the second question on the reason for the acceleration of IQOS. I mentioned I think many of them. I think it's really Europe where you have now the effect of the characterizing flavor ban that are waning, and a number of markets reaccelerating. Some markets are doing really very strong performance. I mentioned some of them like Spain, Germany, Romania, and Bulgaria. It's great to see Italy reaccelerating as well. I would say momentum is rebuilding now. There will be some phasing last year on the\nperformance in Europe, but I think we are expecting a nice performance overall for H2. Outside Europe, we expect continued very nice performance from Japan. I've been elaborating on the trend there where we continue to do very well. There are all these new growth markets that are super exciting, and of course global travel retail is one of them. Indonesia, many countries in the Gulf region, Mexico, Philippines, and I mean these are plenty of markets where we see very nice growth trajectory and growth potential for IQOS. In this new growth market, the momentum I would say is progressively building up.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Just one follow up on combustibles. Your volumes down 1.5%, or I should say only 1.5%, despite the headwinds you called out in Turkey and Indonesia. Was that actually a little bit better than you expected, since you guys have been pretty upfront really since last year that you expect combustibles volumes to resume their declines in 2025?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYou're right. Globally today, when we say that for the year we are targeting to be around minus 2% in terms of shipment, that's something that I had the opportunity to say in previous instances very clearly. The fact is that we believe we are going to be back to what we think is a long-term trend for the combustible business, which is a low single-digit decrease. I'm not able to specifically say exactly which kind of low single digit, but that is a trend for sure that we expect in the future. Yes, of course, in a country where there is a ban on smoke-free, it can have some impact on this low single-digit decline. Nevertheless, that is the trend. That's what we have seen in Q2, largely in line with\nour expectation, and that's what we expect for H2. With this impact of Turkey, that is a kind of transitional thing that is going to impact H2 more specifically. Otherwise, I think we are progressively going back to what we describe as a normal long-term trend for combustible.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks so much, Emmanuel. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, Emmanuel. I wanted to ask about the increase in the underlying guidance. The constant currency range is up about a point from the mid from the previous midpoint, and that reflects the stronger second quarter and some favorability on the tax rate. Is it fair to say the second half is more or less in line with your previous expectations? And can you provide a little more detail on the considerations in the second half? You called out phasing, comparisons, and costs and the impact on margins from those and the timing of those when they become lapped in the base.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I think when you look at, there are of course a number of elements that can distort the vision quarter on quarter, H2 versus H1. What we wanted to ensure that everybody understand is that in fact the momentum in Q2 on smoke-free is in fact even better than Q1 and Q1 was already very good. But in fact in Q2 we've seen an acceleration of the IQOS in-market sales and you know we are nice to back to a nice double-digit growth, very nice and very powerful reacceleration of ZYN in the US of course, you know, elsewhere ZYN and VEEV are growing very fast but Q2 in fact is a very nice acceleration on our smoke-free business. And this is absolutely visible in our numbers when\nwe look at H2. In fact, we expect a continuation of this very strong momentum that we've seen in H2 on smoke-free. So, we expect IQOS to continue to grow double-digit in terms of adjusted IMS. We expect, now that we have availability, which is no longer an issue for ZYN in the US, we expect the continuation of this very strong acceleration of ZYN in the US. Again, I reported the 37% growth for the first two weeks of July. So, H2 is starting on a good note for ZYN in the US. So, this momentum is unchanged, and we expect it to remain very strong. Certainly, what is going to be less favorable is the trend on combustibles. We were almost flat, minus 0.3% in volume in H1, and we expect a\n3% to 4% decline. I've been explaining the driver for that. Despite that, we expect a growth on gross profit for combustibles but nevertheless at a lower level of course than in H1. So this is one of the reasons for the differentiated performance. In H2 versus H1 for what we can expect. Then you have a number of phasing elements on smoke-free which have nothing to do with performance, but which are due to basis of comparison or a number of one-off events. If I look at IQOS, there was this 1 billion stick shipment in Q1 that we're going to compensate in Q4, and of course that is favoring H1 and penalizing H2. We had super favorable comps in H1 because of accelerated\nsales of device last year. That has been growing profit and margin. We're not going to have that in the second part of the year. So that's another element. Then you have the ZYN restocking that has been benefiting H1, and of course will not be benefiting H2. But I think it's really that that's really what is behind the guidance. I think if you take all the elements I've just been sharing, you have the right understanding of the dynamic. I hope this is helpful.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nVery helpful. And as a follow-up, pricing for heated tobacco units was up, I think low single digits again in the quarter. You're about a year into realizing a nice contribution from pricing in that business. In the markets where you are taking pricing, how is that impacting volume and new user acquisition relative to your expectations? And has that changed the way you think about the pricing potential in the HTU business over time? Thank you, and I'll leave it there.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, sure. Matt, I think we're really trying to make sure we don't penalize volume with price increases when it comes to IQOS and ZYN, because we describe how positive the volume growth is, because we have higher revenue per unit, we have higher margin. So the name of the game is of course to absolutely optimize the volume. But there is obviously, as we are growing the franchise of the brand, the strength of the brand, there is a position to increase price without impacting the volume. And I think that is the right balance we're looking for, which is we increase volume, but we certainly don't want to change trajectory on volume because of that. So price. Yes, but provided it\ndoes not impact in a meaningful manner the volume trajectory, that is a strategy and that is what we will continue to do.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Hi, Emmanuel. Hi. I had a few follow up questions on ZYN. Based on everything you discussed and what you're seeing in the market, should we assume the lower end of your full year shipment guidance range is more realistic? I guess. I'm trying to understand if the high end is even possible in your mind. And then can you update us on your capacity and where it stands today and when it will increase?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure. So of course if we give this bracket because we believe that we can finish the year within the bracket, at every point of the bracket we give the $800 to 840 million. Clearly the fact that this $10 to 20 million lower restocking than what maybe we thought that is having an impact. But at the end of the day, you can see that the restart of IQOS can be very powerful. I mean 36, 37%. We are restarting commercial activity, advertising. So we don't know what's going to be the growth profile for H2. So that's why we are still comfortable with the $800 to 840 million HTU bracket on the capacity. We can say that today we have been building a comfortable capacity to face all kind of very dynamic growth scenario for the future. And therefore we are comfortable for the coming quarter.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, and then maybe just another follow-up because you just touched on something that I also wanted to ask, which is, you know, now that you're, I guess, essentially back in the stock or you can shift to demand, how does that change your strategy? You know, as for ZYN, as it relates to, you know, your pricing promotions, you know, are you going to, I guess, get a little bit more aggressive in an attempt to possibly grow ZYN faster and take more market share? Just how are you thinking about that? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, yes, of course, Bonnie. So you're right. As I said, we go for putting all levers to maximize the growth of ZYN and all that in a very different environment because now we have full availability. So during many months, many quarters, we've been refraining ourselves from acquiring new user because we knew that we were not really able to supply. The need for new users. That meant limited activity, I would say, across the board. In terms of pricing, in terms of marketing activities, we're going to restart normal activity, and that will certainly include more promotion. We have a much lower level of promotion than any other brand, and I think it probably will stay like that. But it doesn't mean that\nwe cannot increase the level of promotion as well. That will be certainly advertising and commercial activity on the point of sales where we need to step up now that the product is available. That will be the continuation of building the brand franchise and all this iconic element of the ZYN brand and the find your ZYN campaign. We're going to pull all levers to make sure that we give the best support to ZYN.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone again. That's star one one to ask a question. Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nHi Emmanuel. Thank you for taking my questions. To be honest, your answers have been very thorough, so I don't have many more, but I'll take two. I noticed in the second quarter the gross margin gap between combustibles and smoke-free narrowed, and maybe smoke-free even gross margin slightly. Reduced Q2 on Q1. Maybe if you could expand on some of the dynamics around that and maybe what you expect for gross margin, the gross margin gap, over the next couple of quarters. The second question is probably simple, but if you could please remind us of your FX hedge rates for the year, both euro, Japanese yen, and any other currencies that you may hedge. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International",
    "content2": "Yes, Faham, so on the gross margin evolution, so you are really looking after the comma because in fact we are both in Q1 and Q2 around 70% gross margin rate. So of course the mix of ZYN or the importance of the device can have an impact. But globally in line with what we said after Q1 we have a smoke-free business that is around that means that it can be a bit below but around 70% gross margin and I would expect H2 not to be very materially different. Okay, so I'm not saying it's going to be necessarily at 70, but I think we are ballpark in this area where there is a very nice gross margin rate for smoke-free higher than combustible. And you noted that the gap has been narrowing a bit.\nIt's still significant, I mean 4.5 for the full H1, and it's because CC has been improving a bit, which is price and mix of the combustible sales in the quarter. So when I look at the second part of the year, I think I would really insist on the fact that the improvement of margin on the smoke-free business was very important in H1 as we were facing easy comps because of a lot of ILUMA device sales last year as we were launching ILUMA. Fundamentally, this is not the case again in H2. So we don't have the same easy comps, and therefore, as I said, expect margin on smoke-free to stay high and expect, of course, the progress year-on-year to be reduced because we are facing higher margin last\nyear on the smoke-free business. For combustibles, I think we said that we have the ambition to increase the gross margin as well, and that is valid for H2. I'm not going to repeat on Forex, first of all, because I have to admit I haven't been looking at exactly the latest position. I've been giving it because after, I think, after Q1 we wanted to illustrate where we were in terms of forex hedging. But that's not something I intend to do each time, to be clear.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nOkay, thanks Emmanuel.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, Barclays\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Callum Elliott with Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for the question, Emmanuel. Hi, Emmanuel. My first question is on VEEV, if that's okay. For a number of years, I think as a company you guys were quite reluctant to expand too much into the e-vapor space, citing lower loyalty in that category and sort of the resultant gross margins that came from that lower loyalty. We obviously heard a bit at your Europe event a month ago about this increasing emphasis on the three category approach, and sort of the synergies for all three categories when you sort of play in all three areas at the same time. I guess my question is what's changed over the past year or two to drive this increasing three category approach? In\nparticular, I think you called out in the release the improving gross margin that you're seeing for our HTU in particular. I wonder just anything. I doubt you're going to quantify it for me, but anything sort of qualitative you can share about what that means.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Callum. So yeah, I guess it has been explained with a great deal of details during our European day. So I'm sure I'm not going to come with the same granularity. But my first comment would be to say be assured that we know what our priorities are. So our priority is first and foremost to grow IQOS. Okay. This is the leading star brand. This is the one where we see the biggest potential. This is the one where we have the best profitability. Yes, ZYN could be one day at the same level, but of course in terms of volume it's really small today when it comes to most of the markets. So that's something for the future. You should see VEEV as an add-on brand to our portfolio. Yes, there is\nan interest in the multi-category play. I'm not going to repeat everything we presented in Europe. The fact that some consumers actually prefer to be only in one category and one brand other. Sometimes there are also smokers that you want to fully exit from smoking. They will only do that if they move to several smoke-free products, and that's when we want to be able to offer several smoke-free categories. VEEV is having a role to play in these circumstances. We are of course putting priority on VEEV where we believe we can develop a profitable business. That's of course a very, very important condition to develop VEEV. I'm not going to exactly quantify the gross margin\nof VEEV, but I can tell you that it improved by more than 10 percentage points at the beginning of 2025. So its profitability is improving very rapidly. We believe that with the right loyalty, the VEEV business has a possibility to have a similar profitability as the combustible business. Together you need to have the right loyalty. But element that we see today on the market where we develop this seem to show that we can generate this level of repurchase and loyalty. So it's a bit short as a summary, but these are the conditions for us to develop VEEV and that's what is behind our VEEV progression.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nJust as a clarifying question, when you say similar level of profitability to cigarettes, do you mean percentage margin or unit margin?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, in terms of gross margin on revenue growth, margin as a percentage.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay, perfect. And then my second question is on ZYN, sort of the intersection of Gaurav and Bonnie's two questions earlier where obviously what you've spoken about is a sort of cadence of growth that in Q3 is something like 27% year-on-year growth, but maybe a little bit impacted by. Right. Seems to be, you're suggesting some destocking and then the full year guide implying a reacceleration again in Q4. I guess my question is, I wonder how the commercial activities sort of flow into that reacceleration that you're forecasting for Q4, and how confident that you are that as you lean back into those activities. As you have done in the past when you took over this business\nfrom Swedish Match, that drove an acceleration back then. But as you lean into these activities again that you sort of stepped away from when you had the supply chain problems, that you have this ability to redrive the acceleration, how confident are you in that? And does the cadence of these activities explain that sort of cadence between Q3 and Q4?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, I think I've been already giving the answer I could give. So yes, indeed, that is pointing to a very dynamic second part of the year. Again, the level of growth in the consumer offtake in June and at the beginning of July is pointing to a direction that is broadly in line with this growth. And it is at the point in time where we haven't yet, as I said, fully restarted all the commercial marketing activity. So we are hopeful that it will provide further boost to the growth. But I don't have much to add at that stage. I think that the data are there on the table, public, and everybody can understand the objective that we have.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nMaybe I can just follow up then. How quickly can you turn these commercial activities back on? It seems clear that you were taken a bit by surprise with how quickly you were restocking. So how quickly can you turn it back on?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, yeah, it does not, of course, happen in a few weeks. It's gradual. It's not everything at the same time. So the team are very busy in the US today restarting gradually everything. But you're right, that is like restarting an engine, and to get to full speed on the engine, it is going to take some time. I'm not going to elaborate further, of course, as you will understand, but that's something that is going to happen gradually in the course of Q3.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nThank you very much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gerald Pascarelli with Needham & Company. Your line is open.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGreat. Thank you very much for the question. Most of them have been answered, but I just, I wanted to go back to currency. If you could just, can you provide. Some color on exactly what transpired in the quarter. You did not get the benefit you had been guiding for in Q2, and that really is despite the fact that the dollar weakened further over the course of the quarter. I think the expectation was that maybe in addition to an underlying EPS raise, we would have seen an even bigger benefit to your adjusted EPS just due to a more favorable outlook on currency. Not looking for detail on your exact hedges or anything like that, but maybe just some color or thoughts on how we should think\nabout the currency tailwind in the event that we continue to see this dollar weaken over the back half of the year. Any color there would be great. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Gerald. In fact, what probably people are not always capturing, I think versus the $0.10 we're coming up with, we are around $0.04 versus consensus below what the consensus was expecting. I think it's largely the Swiss franc, both in the negative impact that it has because we have a strong exposure in terms of cost to Switzerland, as you all know, but also because the intercompany flows mean that when there is a lot of volatility and there has been a lot of surge in the Swiss franc versus other currency at the end of the period, that is generating some transactional losses. That's a significant impact. Actually, when I look at what is driving this $0.10 estimated impact at the prevailing rate, in\nfact, the Swiss franc is to a large extent offsetting the benefit we have on the euro, just for people to understand. It's a very significant negative impact.\n\nGerald Pascarelli\n\nSenior Analyst, Needham & Company\n\nGot it. Thank you very much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nManaging Director and Fixed Income Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you so much for the question. Emmanuel, I was just wondering if you could walk us through the working capital piece on free cash flow. It looks like based on the numbers that might have been seasonally a bit weaker than what we normally see in the second quarter. Is that largely attributable to the IQOS dynamics or what else is going on there? Should we expect most of that to reverse as we get through the back half of the year?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, Priya. Really, I think when you look at the end of H1 on the differences versus last year, I mean, indeed the cash flow generation is lower. Most of it is the payment of duty that we made in Germany and the final payment of the Job Act in the US. I think that the cumulated impact is largely north of $1 billion. That is really the biggest impact. Otherwise, yes, we may have had on a temporary basis some inventory building, I mean supply chain, of course, playing here and there. You may have some regulatory constraint, but I do not think that for the year in terms of working capital beyond the two elements I mentioned, you should expect anything special.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nManaging Director and Fixed Income Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, that's helpful. Just one housekeeping item. What was your CapEx in the quarter?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nI'm not sure. We're disclosing it by quarter, so I'm not going to give you the number. I think we said $1.6 billion for the year, but we don't split that by quarter.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nManaging Director and Fixed Income Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nOkay, thank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.

Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2025 Q1 results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke-free products, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation, are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the company's Form 8-K dated 23 April 2025, and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. In Q1, we delivered a very strong start to the year with all key elements of the business contributing strongly to deliver double-digit increases in organic net revenue, operating income, and adjusted diluted EPS in both constant currency and dollar terms. Our smoke-free business performed exceptionally well across all areas, with shipment volumes up +14.4% year-on-year, organic net revenue growth of +20%, and outstanding organic gross profit growth of +33%, as all three smoke-free categories expanded gross margins. This was especially fueled by the rapid growth of ZYN and the continued volume momentum, operating leverage, and scale benefit of IQOS. Our smoke-free business now accounts for 44% of total gross profit as we continue to deploy our multi-category strategy across markets and broaden our growth opportunities.\nIQOS delivered close to +10% HTU adjusted IMS growth, with continued strong performance both in Japan and Europe, despite the annualization impact of the EU characterizing flavor ban. We expect double-digit growth for the rest of the year. ZYN, once again, delivered strong growth in the US, with shipments increasing by an impressive +53% to reach 202 million cans, exceeding our initial expectations as demand remained strong and production capacity increased ahead of schedule in the latter part of March, enabling some initial replenishment of trade inventories. International nicotine pouch can volumes also grew by +53% or by +182%, excluding the Nordics, demonstrating the global dynamism of this emerging category. In e-vapor, VEEV Q1 performance was impressive, demonstrating its increasing contribution within our multi-category offering.\nShipments more than doubled year-on-year, and gross margin further expanded, driven by strong pod growth in Europe as we increased our distribution and commercial activities. Within combustible, overall volume growth, coupled with strong pricing and ongoing cost initiatives, drove a robust performance despite notably negative geographic mix from increased volumes in lower margin markets. Overall, the very strong and increasingly profitable underlying growth of our smoke-free business was coupled with very solid combustible results and the added benefit of favorable shipment timing. This allowed us to deliver ±16% organic operating income growth and ±250 basis points of expansion in adjusted OI margin to reach 40.7%, and resulted in strong double-digit Adjusted Diluted EPS growth in both currency-neutral and dollar terms despite currency headwinds.\nWhile it is early in the year and there are a number of uncertainties in the global economic outlook, we remain confident that we will achieve another year of super growth. As such, we now forecast double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth at prevailing exchange rates. Turning to the headline numbers, we delivered volume growth of +3.9%, reflecting the very strong dynamism of our smoke-free business. Combined with strong pricing and despite unfavorable combustible mix, we delivered double-digit organic net revenue growth of +10.2%, reaching $9.3 billion in total. There was also a technical impact from the change in commercial model for the Indonesian below-tier-one cigarette segment, where we now act as a handling agent. This results in lower net revenue and cost of goods sold, but has no meaningful impact on gross profit or operating income.\nExcluding this effect, which will notably affect the first three quarters of the year, organic net revenues grew by around +12%. As I mentioned, our smoke-free business was the primary driver behind our organic adjusted OI growth of +16% or +12.8% in dollar terms. Q1 Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by +17.3% in constant currency and by +12.7% in dollar terms to $1.69. This includes a $0.07 unfavorable currency variance, notably due to non-recurring transactional losses in the quarter linked to currency volatility. This stronger-than-expected performance was primarily driven by the top line and gross margin result of our smoke-free business. Excellent ZYN performance was further enhanced by the great work of our manufacturing team in accelerating capacity initiative.\nStrong IQOS HTU shipment growth includes a robust performance in Europe and around 1 billion units in favorable shipment timing, which we expect to reverse in H2. This was complemented by the resilience of our combustible business. Looking at category performance in more detail, our smoke-free business grew net revenue by +20.4% and gross profit by +33.1%. This led to an impressive +670 basis points of organic gross margin expansion to surpass 70%, more than five points above the gross margin of combustibles at the current category and geographic mix of SFPs. As I mentioned, this reflects an acceleration in gross margin expansion for all three smoke-free categories, notably combined with the positive mix impact of ZYN's accretive unit economics and pricing on both HTUs and ZYN.\nVery strong IQOS gross margin expansion reflects the powerful growth and scale effect of this large and growing business, manufacturing productivities, and a comparison benefit from IQOS device shipment in the prior year when Iluma Eye was launched in Japan. On an organic basis, combustible net revenues and gross profit grew by +3.8% and +5.3%, respectively. While pricing was strong and volume were positive, there was a notably negative geographic mix this quarter due to growth in markets such as Turkey, and Egypt, in addition to the technical impact from Indonesia. We expect both pricing and negative geographic mix to moderate over the rest of the year and target combustible gross margin expansion organically and in dollar terms. As expected, input cost headwinds eased compared to recent years, and based on current assumption, we expect this to further improve in 2026.\nTaking a closer look at our volumes, shipment growth of +3.9% was primarily driven by our smoke-free business, with all categories contributing positively and placing us on track for a fifth consecutive year of total volume growth. Smoke-free volumes grew by +14.4%, above our four-year target range of +12% to +14, reflecting very positive contribution from IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV. In addition to the growth of these three brands, which I covered earlier, I would also note that our all-smoke-free business includes US moist snuff and Scandinavian snus, which declined modestly in the quarter. Despite this, all-smoke-free product shipment growth accelerated versus the prior quarter to +27%. Cigarette volumes were positive for the fourth consecutive quarter as we grew share in a modestly declining industry with continued growth in markets where smoke-free products are not permitted, such as Turkey and India.\nYou have heard us talk recently about our multi-category strategy for smoke-free product as we leverage on the strengths of the IQOS brand and commercial infrastructure in international markets to accelerate incremental growth from ZYN and VEEV. This is evidenced by our strong smoke-free portfolio result in Q1, with visible accretion across region and market. We have 46 markets with multiple smoke-free offerings, including 16 with all three PMI categories on offer. The execution of this three-pronged strategy is generating positive results in markets such as the Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland, and our global travel retail business, in addition to promising starts in the UK and Italy. It is also helping to bolster our position as a global smoke-free champion. Double-digit Q1 organic net revenue growth was again driven by all three key elements of our structural growth model, namely volumes, pricing, and smoke-free mix.\nPricing contributed +6 points, reflecting over +8% combustible pricing and around +3% for smoke-free, excluding devices. The positive mix impact of the shift to smoke-free product, including US smoke-free mix, drove a further positive contribution of +3.1 points. Overall, combustible geographic mix and other factors had an unfavorable impact of 2.7 points. This was more negative than in prior quarters, reflecting the technical Indonesia impact and combustible market mix dynamics I explained earlier. Currency had a negative impact of 3.9 points, with a further 0.5 points from acquisition and divestiture, which include the divestment of Vectura. Turning now to gross margin, we delivered very strong expansion of 340 basis points on an organic basis and +360 basis points, including currency, acquisition, and divestitures.\nThis comprised +180 basis points from pricing, more than offsetting an 80 basis point unfavorable impact from cost inflation, net of productivities, and other cost items. Smoke-free growth delivered an excellent +230 basis points with a flat contribution from combustible, excluding pricing, but including the Indonesia impact. This excellent gross margin performance supported strong adjusted operating income margin expansion of 250 basis points or +200 basis points organically after accounting for the currency mix of our cost, the divestiture of Vectura, and other scope effects. This impressive margin expansion was delivered despite a 140 basis point impact of higher SG&A costs driven by continued investment in our smoke-free growth, including US investment, a low-cost comparison in the prior year, and the impact of 2025 investment phasing.\nAs we continue to invest in top-line growth, we target organic SG&A growth broadly in line with net revenue growth for the year. We continue to drive manufacturing and back-office efficiency and delivered over $180 million in gross cost savings in Q1 across both cost of goods sold and SG&A. After more than $750 million of savings in 2024, this places us nicely on track to achieve our $2 billion target over 2024 to 2026. Focusing now on our IQOS business. As expected, calendar effects and EU flavor ban annualization impacted Q1 adjusted IMS. However, the delivery of +9.4% growth despite these factors marks continued strong underlying momentum. We expect double-digit progress in the balance of the year in line with our target of +10% to +12 growth.\nSupporting this are commercial initiatives around brand building and continuous innovation on devices and consumables as we progressively roll out IQOS ILUMA i and new consumable variants of TEREA, LEVIA, and DELIA. Over the longer term, we have a rich IQOS innovation pipeline to further enhance the breadth and quality of the user experience with the iconic brand. As disclosed in our latest integrated report, over 99% of our 2024 adjusted R&D spend was on smoke-free product, consistent with the last four years as we continue to drive consumer-centered product development. Turning to Europe, where we are building on the strengths of our IQOS business to create an integrated multi-category portfolio to accelerate consumers' switching and value creation. Total shipments of our flagship smoke-free brand advanced by 17.5% in Q1, with an increasing contribution from both ZYN and VEEV.\nIQOS HTU shipments grew more than 15%, including a positive comparison impact from the prior year. Our investment in brand building initiatives is exemplified by the recent partnership with renowned Italian designer Seletti at Milan Design Week as part of the IQOS Curious X campaign. For IQOS, Q1 HTU adjusted IMS grew by +7.4% as we further accelerated our share of cigarettes and HTUs to a record 11.4%. Many markets in the region grew adjusted IMS by double digits, including high-teens growth or more in Spain, Germany, Bulgaria, and Greece. This dynamism more than compensated for flavor ban annualization, which, as flagged last quarter, was especially pronounced in Q1 and most notably in Italy. I am particularly pleased to report that sequential market share in Italy is trending well, with a record high of 18.4% for Q1 and progressive increases through the quarter.\nOverall, regional Q1 adjusted IMS growth was in line with our expectations, and we expect another robust quarter in Q2, followed by an acceleration in the second half. Our experience of the flavor ban impact remains unchanged, with a broadly consistent pattern of recovery across markets following implementation. We continue to expect an impact of around 1 billion units in 2025, primarily due to annualization with only Hungary and Slovakia implementing the ban so far this year. The most notable remaining market is Poland, where the twin shelf date will be in early 2026. We also continue to roll out new and improved variants of our tobacco-free consumable, LEVIA, which is driving promising results. This is well illustrated by Hungary, where LEVIA reached a double-digit share of PMI HTUs less than three months from launch.\nOur fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the consistent growth in key city share. This also includes Hungary, where Budapest share reached almost 42%, over four points higher than Turkey. Impressively, 24 of the 34 markets where IQOS is present in Europe have crossed the 10% key city share mark, with six above 30%. Notable callouts across the region include London, Vienna, Zurich, Lisbon, and Athens. The regulatory landscape is an important determinant of smoke-free progress, and we are encouraged by recent positive developments in a number of markets which recognize the role of tobacco harm reduction in policy measures. This includes Greece, which introduced dedicated legislation supporting science-based claims on smoke-free products, and Hungary, where factual and science-based communication to consumers on smoke-free products is allowed versus a total advertising ban for combustibles.\nIn Ukraine, an excise tax differential on HTU versus cigarettes was reintroduced following a period of equal treatment. In Japan, we deliver HTU adjusted IMS growth of +9.3%, effectively marking the 10th quarter of double-digit growth after accounting for the leap year. HTU adjusted share increased by 3 percentage points year-on-year and +1.6 points sequentially to reach 32.2%, further highlighting the dynamism of the innovative IQOS brand and product portfolio in these two markets. IQOS HTUs captured more than 3/4 of category growth in Q1, and combined with our cigarette business, PMI is now the market leader by volume, of which approximately 75% are HTUs. The overall smoke-free category continues to progress, reaching almost 48% on a national offset basis in March, with 13 cities, and eight prefectures now crossing the 50% threshold.\nGlobally, we continue to see very strong IQOS performance, as illustrated by key city offset shares. Highlights include impressive year-on-year growth in the capital of Indonesia and Mexico to surpass 5% share, robust progress in the Middle East and North Africa, and strong growth in Belgrade to 17.7% share despite increased competitive activity. IQOS reached a new high in South Korea with a 14.1% share in Seoul, supported by the launch of Iluma Eye in a highly competitive market. Offset share performance in Seoul continues to be optically impacted by the growth of the combustible market, where competitive supply has normalized. Also, worth highlighting is the excellent growth of our global travel retail business, which is a leading space for our multi-category offering. We recorded strong HTU growth across all regions, with share of over 18% in airports where IQOS is present.\nIn the US, as planned, we commence direct sales of IQOS 3 devices and HTUs in Austin, Texas, at the end of March, following targeted engagement with legal nicotine consumers over recent months. While intentionally small-scale, we have received strong interest with further IQOS 3 pilot planned in the coming months as we prepare for the at-scale launch of IQOS Iluma. As a reminder, we are not assuming any significant HTU volume from the US in our full-year process. Switching to ZYN, which continues to resonate strongly with adult nicotine users as a superior product with premium brand equity and delivers excellent results. Continued strong demand and increased production capacity enabled shipment volume growth of 53% to reach over 200 million cans for the quarter.\nThis plus 70 million year-on-year increase is impressive, though we should note the prior year Q1 featured notable depletion of retailer and distributor stock levels, and therefore a sell-out volume higher than shipment, and this quarter included the beginning of a replenishment. As we continue to expand production at our Owensboro plant, we accelerated one plant step in this process to the latter part of March. This enabled increased shipment at quarter end and a pull forward of initial distributor restocking. With very limited flow-through of this additional shipment to retail in the quarter, this did not yet have a meaningful impact on in-store availability. We target full normalization of the supply situation in Q3 this year. ZYN continued to perform very robustly at retail given the circumstances with strong double-digit offset growth.\nAccording to Nielsen, Q1 IQOS volume grew by around +15% year-on-year, with category value share remaining strong at over 70% despite heavy competitor discounting. While Nielsen data is based on only a small sample of stalls, it also shows our IQOS volume shares have been held back by availability and declined by 1.45 points sequentially to 61.5%. We already observe our share on MSA data, which measures shipment from distributor to retail, recover to almost 66% in March on the limited flow-through I just mentioned. With category IQOS growing at around +30% to +35, while the leading brand is supply constrained, we expect ZYN IQOS to gradually accelerate in the coming months as in-store availability improves and we reactivate commercial and marketing initiatives.\nWe remain excited about the growth prospects of this dynamic category and its potential to switch legal-age consumers from cigarettes and other traditional forms of tobacco. ZYN remains the only nicotine powder product authorized by the FDA, and this includes all variants in both three and six milligram strength currently commercialized in the US. As I outlined at CAGNY, there is a large addressable market in the millions of legal-age nicotine users in the US, and we plan to engage more actively beyond our existing consumer base to other legal-age nicotine users. Indeed, with strong latent demand and capacity expansion ahead of target, we now raise our shipment forecast to 800 to 840 million cans for the year. With the outstanding effort of our team on the ground, we continue to work on increasing capacity in our Owensboro facility.\nConstruction of our second US manufacturing site in Colorado is well underway, with production due to commence in early 2026. We remain, as we have been since entering the US, committed to investing in US manufacturing. The substantial investments we have made in the US are expected to continue to result in significant job creation and economic contribution to the country. Outside the US now, we continue to roll out ZYN, leveraging our presence with IQOS and ZYN to drive awareness and trial with legal age nicotine users. The total international nicotine powder category is nascent in almost all geographies and stands at around half the size of the US in volume terms. We are now in 38 markets globally, following Q1 launches in the UAE and Colombia, and ultimately see all addressable markets as meaningful opportunities given the unique characteristics of the category.\nUsing the 53% growth of our international cross-category volume, shipments almost tripled outside of the Nordics, including promising momentum in European markets such as Austria, Switzerland, and the UK, where we commence a national share count rollout. In emerging markets, strong progress continues in Pakistan, Mexico, and South Africa. PMI Global Travel Retail is a notable standout as it also increases global visibility and awareness of ZYN within our multi-category offering. Finally, closing our smoke-free performance with e-vapor. ZYN plays an increasingly important role within our multi-category universe, with growing volumes and gross margins. Shipment volume doubled year-on-year to 0.6 billion on an equivalent unit basis, driven by very good performance in Europe, where the pod segment continued to grow strongly, partially at the expense of disposable given increased bans and restrictions for this format.\nWe observe increasing V1 adoption rates and low abandonment across key markets, which is testament to the quality and presentation of this premium product to legal age consumers. Turning to combustibles, our business performed robustly in Q1, with organic net revenue growth of +3.8% or closer to +7%, excluding the Indonesia technical impact. This was driven by strong pricing of +8.3%, with notable contribution from Turkey, Poland, and Germany. With less favorable timing dynamic in HTU, we continue to expect full year combustible pricing of +5% to +6. The cigarette industry declined by 1.3% in Q1 due to growth in geographies where smoke-free products are nascent or not present, more than offset by accelerated cigarette declines on stock. Where SFPs are not permitted, such as in Turkey or India, we expect these divergences to continue, supported in some cases by demographic trends.\nNonetheless, we continue to expect a low single-digit cigarette industry decline for the year. Category share was strong, growing 0.4 points in Q1, partly due to services market needs. Both Marlboro and our global brand portfolio reached all-time Q1 highs. We continue to target broadly stable category share over time, with our main priority being maximizing value and supporting the growth of smoke-free products. Most importantly, combustible organic growth profits continue to grow robustly at +5.3% following the recovery of 2024. This brings us to our outlook for 2025. We delivered a very strong Q1, including better-than-expected margins, and we remain confident we will achieve another year of superior growth. As such, we are reconfirming the currency neutral growth outlook we provided in February, despite a backdrop of increased uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment.\nAs a global company with broadly diversified production and a worldwide supplier network, including an established US manufacturing base, we believe we are well-positioned to mitigate potential supply chain challenges. While the situation is volatile, we do not currently anticipate a material impact on our business from recently introduced or discussed tariffs. We expect a continuation of strong momentum from our smoke-free business, including the benefits of further multi-category deployment. As I explained, we are raising our forecast for US ZYN shipment to 800 to 840 million cans. This further supports our forecast of +12% to +14 SSP shipment growth, which incorporates an increased strong growth assumption for IQOS.\nWe also continue to expect total PMI organic net revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8, organic operating income growth of 10.5% to 12.5, and currency neutral Adjusted Diluted EPS growth of 10.5% to 12.5. As announced in this morning's press release, we are raising our 2025 Adjusted Diluted EPS forecast to $7.36 to $7.49. This now reflects 12% to 14 growth in dollar terms and includes a favorable estimated currency impact of $0.10 at the value exchange rate. This reflects recent strength in the euro, Japanese yen, and Russian ruble, partly offset by a stronger Swiss franc. For Q2, we assume HTU shipment volume of 37.5 to 38.5 billion, with another strong quarter of HTU adjusted IMS growth of around 10%.\nFor US ZYN, we expect shipments to be at a similar level to Q1 as trade restocking continues and offset gradually accelerates. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 to 1.85, including a favorable currency variance of $0.06 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong H1 overall, with organic net revenue growth around the high end of our target range for the full year and organic OI growth slightly above. With regard to our balance sheet, debt leverage remains a key priority, and we continue to target further reduction in 2025, placing us on track for our target ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026. We believe our growth profile is best in class within large cap consumer goods, as shown by our three-year target, which we are well on track to meet or exceed.\nAdjusted EPS growth in dollar terms is a key priority, and as demonstrated in 2024, we are committed to taking proactive steps to manage potential currency volatility, including through our hedging activity. Behind the delivery of our growth lies the enormous effort we have made to transform our business over the last ten years and the continued drive towards our ambition to become substantially smoke-free. This quarter coincides with the publication of the 6th edition of our Annual Integrated Report, which provides a comprehensive view of our company's performance across both financial and non-financial dimensions. Highlights include the important efforts and actions we are taking with regard to youth access prevention, as well as the progress we have made on our operational efficiency, strengthening our resilience, driving innovation, and ultimately future-proofing our business.\nAs explained in the report, our approach to sustainability is fundamentally business-driven, with the objective of both sustaining and enhancing the growth of our smoke-free consumption to drive continued value creation. I would encourage anyone with an interest in how and why we are transforming to read it. I will now conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Following an excellent start to the year, we are now on track for another year of strong performance in 2025. While no company is immune to macroeconomic volatility, we believe we are well-positioned to navigate external dynamics. We have three powerful growth drivers, with pricing power, and positive smoke-free category mix on top of volume growth, where we target our fifth consecutive year of extension led by IQOS, ZYN, and ZYN.\nAs we continue to invest strongly behind our smoke-free brand, these drivers are also profit-accretive, and combined with our proactive measures on pricing and costs, we have great confidence in sustainable adjusted EPS growth in both currency neutral and dollar terms. Finally, we remain a highly cash-generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you, and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again, and please stand by while we compile our Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Hi, Emmanuel and everyone.\nHi, Em. Hi. I had a few questions on ZYN. Could you maybe give us some more color on the out-of-stock issues you might still be experiencing in the US? I know you touched on this, but then just curious how long you think it will take for retailers to rebuild their inventories. And I know you, you know, you raised your shipment guidance for ZYN for the year, but it does still imply that growth will decelerate year-over-year to around, I think, 35% for the rest of the year. This is at the low end of your range versus, I guess, the 53% you reported this quarter. So just hoping you could talk through the thinking behind this, maybe just the phasing. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Bonnie. Happy to do that. So, of course, we are facing a particular year in 2025 with ZYN in the US.\nbecause it's going to be a mix of continuation of strong growth and strong consumer offtake growth. Of course, when you look at the shipment, be careful, and I flag that in my remarks because last year we had clearly consumer offtake in Q1, which was much, much stronger than our shipment. That was the time when the consumer started to empty the shelves. So we need to be cautious when we look at the shipment if they are now reflecting the consumer offtake and take that into account. And next to this strong growth that we expect from consumer offtake, and we have a very dynamic category, 30% to 35 growth, despite the fact that the leader ZIN was constrained, we're going to add on top of that this replenishment, this restocking.\nI'm not going to speculate on exactly what it is, but it's certainly a few tens of millions of cans. We have started, because of this good performance on production that I explained, to send more product to, first of all, wholesalers, distributors, and themselves; they're going to start to ship to retailers. So it's going to be a very gradual process. There are still, of course, very, I would say, material situations of out of stock. We're going to continue the replenishment in Q2, maybe part of Q3 as well. We've been explaining that we are expecting to be back to a normalized situation, if I may say. Therefore, no more material out of stock situation in Q3 2025.\nSo in terms of shipment, that's going to be this profile through the year of an accelerating growth for our shipment. That's what we expect, which is going to reflect first the consumer off-take that is going to accelerate, and then, of course, a replenishment impact that is going to decrease as we fulfill this replenishment, if you want. So it's a particular profile, and the replenishment, if you want, to some extent is going to hide the fact that there is a growth in the consumer off-take that we're going to experience through the year.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just maybe a second question from me on margins. You delivered, you know, robust margin expansion in the quarter. So how should we think about the drivers of continued margin expansion for the remaining of the year?\nI guess especially in the context of what you mentioned as it relates to continued SG&A growth and, you know, the investments, et cetera. And then on the back of that, you know, I know we've talked about this before, but how should we also think about the margin gap you're seeing between your combustible business and then, you know, smoke-free products today, and then, you know, possibly key drivers of further expansion of that gap over the next couple of years? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, Bonnie, obviously, we are very pleased with our margin expansion. That's something we are targeting for 2025, and we are very positive about our expectation. We have a clear illustration in Q1 of the strong performance in terms of margin expansion. Clearly, our smoke-free products are here driving this, first and foremost, this margin expansion.\nYou have an impressive 670 basis points organic expansion in Q1 for our smoke-free business. Don't take that as a reference for the full year, but that means that we are now above a 70% gross margin rate for the smoke-free business. It's a 5 percentage point higher than combustible. So as we are growing, of course, very fast, our smoke-free business and faster than combustible, that means that we are benefiting at the margin level of a very positive mix evolution. We believe that this difference through 2025 should stay between smoke-free and combustible. I'm not saying it's going to stay exactly at the same level, but we're going to keep a very material difference between the two, and we're going to continue to benefit from this positive mix effect.\nI think for the future, there are a number of drivers that will continue to play on the margin for our smoke-free portfolio. There is, of course, the mix coming from ZYN. ZYN in the US is the best-in-class gross profit margin. So when we grow ZYN fast in the US, that has a positive impact. You have all the scale impact that we are generating on IQOS. And if you look at the last two, three years, you've seen on a very consistent basis a gradual improvement on the margin on IQOS. This is certainly magnified in the Q1 because we have a less sale of device. Last year, we had a big device sale in Japan as we were launching ILUMA. So that is helping the margin. But fundamentally, we are benefiting from scale impact, productivity, and a better performance on device.\nAnd then we have some pricing that you have seen 3% on consumable for our smoke-free business. So we are increasing price as well. And last element, which is more marginal today, but we are also improving the margin on ZYN. So that is also helping. So as you can see, we have many positive drivers behind our smoke-free business, and smoke-free business is the driver for, or the first driver for margin improvement.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Perfect. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And our next question comes from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, Emmanuel. Thank you for the question.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Matt.\nIf we could first talk about the guidance outlook with the strong Q1 and now the Q2 guidance, the H1 EPS growth on a constant currency basis is a few points above the high end of the full-year outlook. Can you talk about the factors in the second half that we should take into consideration with the constant currency EPS growth outlook implied to be a couple of points below the full-year average by my math, just the shape of the year there?\nSure, Matt. Happy to take that one. So yes, we are saying that we expect to be well-positioned versus the overall bracket for the year in terms of revenue growth. We expect to be a bit above on OI. Now, you know that these are the traditional difference that you can see during a year between H1 and H2.\nYou may have some comparison basis that can play. There is potentially some phasing on how we're going to position SG&A. So there is here nothing to be read, I think, in terms of change in the underlying business between H1 and H2. These are more how a number of things are positioned in terms of shipment through the year, in terms of investments. But I would say we expect a strong year through the, as we go through the quarters. And we've been flagging the fact, for instance, that we expect in some area an acceleration for IQOS in the second half in terms of IMS, but that's not going to necessarily translate into shipment as the phasing for shipment can be a bit different. So again, I think we expect strong, strong momentum through the year for our smoke-free portfolio.\nWe've been flagging the fact that on combustible, we are positive in volume in Q1, but for the year, we expect a low single-digit decline. So that could mean that the second part of the year will have more negative volume for our combustible. But clearly, we expect strength through the year.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. And as a follow-up, I wanted to talk about the IMS growth you referenced for IQOS. You had nice growth in the first quarter. I think it was above 9%, but if we look back to the fourth quarter, it was around 13%. Now you're expecting a re-acceleration in those IMS, in IQOS IMS growth across the remainder of 2025. So can you talk about some of the underlying benefits to IMS growth re-accelerating across the rest of 2025? Thank you. I'll leave it there.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah.\nSo indeed, 9.4% was in line with our expectation. There are, you know, and Europe was below the average, so there are always a turbulence coming from the flavor ban implementation in Europe. We believe that the impact will be lower in H2 as we go through annualization. And therefore, we expect in H2 an acceleration, as I mentioned, in the IMS growth in the second half in Europe. But otherwise, we are expecting, you know, this 10% to 12 adjusted IMS growth through the year. So we expect overall a continuation of a nice double-digit growth. Q4 was very strong after, you know, a few quarters that had been weaker last year. So you can have some phasing through the year. But after this Q1, which was in line with expectation, we expect continuation of very good growth in Europe, in Japan.\nI took some time in my remarks to talk about the other markets where we see also some very promising growth in several markets.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Eric Serotta of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Great.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for the question. In terms of the full year guidance, you did raise the ZYN shipment volumes. And obviously, that's a very high-margin product. You kept the, you know, the constant currency EPS guidance the same. You, you know, delivered some very, very robust margin expansion in the first half. Are there any specific offsets that you could point to that cause you to reiterate the guidance rather than, you know, flow some more through to the full year? Or is it, you know, more of a factor that we're early in the year and there's, you know, obviously a lot of macro and geopolitical uncertainty?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Eric, for the question. So indeed, we were targeting a year of very strong growth and performance. And I think Q1 is flagging the fact that we are well on track to deliver a year of strong growth. So we are confirming that we expect a year of very strong growth across the board for PMI. What we've seen in Q1 is indeed very reassuring on the fact that we're going to deliver this strong year. We are raising the guidance for the volume for ZYN in the US by on average 20 million cans. So yes, it is a very profitable brand, but not to the extent to dramatically change the outlook for the year. So I would say that goes into, you know, various scenarios with which we are playing to give the guidance for the year.\nAnd obviously, after only one quarter, and in this uncertain, volatile environment, we need to, of course, be cautious and say this is the beginning of the year. And we are happy to confirm the guidance. Again, I think Q1 is showing that we are well on track to deliver a very good 2025.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. And then a quick follow-up. How are you guys thinking about what the unconstrained growth for, what the unconstrained, you know, off-take growth for ZYN theoretically looks like? Obviously, you can't observe it. You could estimate it, but how are you thinking about how that evolves, you know, where it is today and sort of how it evolves as you get into the second half and next year where, you know, the business is obviously a lot larger than when you bought it?\nSo really, you can't give a precise answer, but any color there would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nEric, frankly, we don't know, of course, what is the unconstrained demand because the demand is still constrained. So I'm not able to provide an answer. What I can say is that certainly, as we are removing the limitation and the out-of-stock situation, we expect an acceleration in the consumer offtake. And we are very much encouraged by the very nice dynamism of the category, which shows the appeal, the attraction for the consumer, and all these legal-age nicotine users that are discovering the category and understand the benefit. So we expect the acceleration. We're going to be gradually back to normal life because it's true we've been mentioning that we had very limited commercial marketing activity.\nSo we were trying to service the existing ZYN consumer, and we knew that it was not reasonable to try to acquire new consumers at that time that we could not serve and supply. So obviously, that's going to be also another leg of the growth in the coming quarter. And, you know, I guess that's certainly something to include in unconstrained demand. But frankly, I don't want to speculate on what this unconstrained demand is going to be. We are expecting a gradual acceleration of the consumer offtake for ZYN in the coming months. Fair enough. And then just one quick last one.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nYou did cite the Nielsen data in terms of ZYN. Are you seeing different trends or divergent trends when you look at some of the non-track channels that, you know, you would have a better read on than, you know, than we would?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, I mean, I certainly don't want to say that Nielsen is not an interesting data point, but of course, it's 3,000 sales points and, you know, on the universe, that probably is close to 200,000. When you are in out-of-stock situation, you can create some distortion on the perception of the consumer off-take. So I'm not able to say whether the 15%, I mean, we know it's an estimate. What I was reporting is the MSA, so the very nice acceleration towards the end of March of the sales from wholesaler and distributor to the retailers. But that's, you know, the other data point that we have. But we don't have any other, I would say, reliable data we could share with you. We can sense in the market the very strong underlying demand for ZYN. That's very clear.\nAnd I also flag the fact that the consumer offtake, so what Nielsen measured last year for Q1, then probably significantly higher than the 130 million cans that we reported for the quarter, Q1 2024. So that was the basis on which you should apply the 15% if the 15% is accurate to have an idea of the consumer offtake today.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nTerrific. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. And as a reminder, if you have a question, please press star one one. Our next question comes from Faham Baig of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Researc, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, Emmanuel. A couple of questions from me as well.\nJust coming back to the growth at ZYN and the offtake, are you in a position to potentially share what the MSA data highlights is the growth rate for ZYN and how it really compares to this sort of 30% to 35 growth you highlight for the category? The second question, sticking with the US and IQOS, I just wanted to get your views on the recent movements at the CTP and how that impacts the timing of ILUMA's launch in the market or whether it does impact the timing of the launch would be helpful. And the final question is really housekeeping net interest guidance for the year would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSorry, I missed the last question, Faham.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Researc, UBS\n\nThe net interest cost guidance for the year would be helpful, please.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah.So, taking your question in order, growth of ZYN, I think we said that the share was close to 66% on MSA in March. It's probably a growth, you know, around close to 30%, but, you know, take that with a pinch of salt. I'm not sure I have a very precise data, but clearly, the MSA was showing this acceleration as more product was coming. So that's one thing. On the, you know, the new situation at the CTP and what it means for IQOS, no, it's too early to say. So we have nothing to report, and I don't know what is going to happen. I think we are still hoping for an efficient process to be put in place and for the FDA to comply with the mandate, which was to give answer after six months.\nI have nothing new to report on this situation at that stage. On the net interest for the third, for the year, I think you have the performance in Q1. I don't have at that stage nothing specific to tell you for the full year. We're not providing any additional data for the full year, but of course, we started well the year, nevertheless, with some positive impact coming from mark-to-market on some of our hedging.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director of Equity Researc, UBS\n\nThanks, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn it back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. That concludes our call today. Please be aware that the script from the call is posted on our website for any of you that may have had some sound issues partway through the webcast broadcast. Thank you very much for joining us.\nIf you have any follow-up questions, please do contact the investor relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you all and speak to you soon. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.",

Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 Q4, and full year results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K dated 6 February 2025 and on our Investor Relations website.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. We delivered an outstanding performance in 2024 with all key elements of the business contributing strongly to deliver best in class organic top and bottom line growth. This resulted in significant acceleration in adjusted diluted earnings per share growth in both currency neutral and equally importantly dollar terms as we mitigated substantial currency headwinds. Our business outperformed the industry and consumer packaged goods overall. With growth across all categories to deliver our fourth consecutive year of positive volumes.\nIQOS continued its strong underlying momentum with continued excellent growth in Japan, robust progress in Europe despite the EU characterizing flavor ban, and further strong growth in other global markets. Importantly, the growth of IQOS is increasingly profitable as the benefits of scale and pricing more than offset continued substantial growth investments including brand building activities, and innovations on devices and consumables. ZYN once again delivered strong growth in the US as 2023 demand acceleration continued in 2024. This resulted in short-term supply challenges which we have progressively addressed throughout the year, working towards our goal of matching existing user demand.\nAs we unlock further capacity, we will be in a position to explore the full potential of this dynamic category. Outside the US shipments grew by 75% as we increased our global presence in nicotine pouches to 37 markets. In e-vapor, VEEV is progressively contributing to growth with encouraging volume momentum in closed pods and strengthening market position with a premium offer. Our combustible business performed well on all metrics. We delivered double-digit gross profit growth in Q4 of last year and around 7% organically for the year, led by strong pricing, resilient volumes in certain markets, and the ongoing benefits of our cost actions.\nOverall, our strong performance across all categories and regions drove meaningful operating leverage, notably in our smoke-free business alongside cost efficiency initiatives across the entire value chain. This enabled us to deliver operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS above our expectations at the start of the year despite ongoing currency and input cost headwinds. Our transformation journey and growth drivers have excellent momentum and we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth and returns in 2025 and beyond.\nOver the past year we achieved several key milestones in our smoke-free journey including the 10-year anniversary of IQOS and ZYN. Our smoke-free business is large, profitable, and growing fast. Our total smoke-free net revenues reach almost $15 billion in 2024. Combined with a strong combustible performance, our company also surpassed $10 billion in adjusted net earnings for the first time. Our smoke-free business reached 40% of total PMI net revenues in Q4 and around 42% of adjusted gross profit, as our transformation becomes increasingly profitable.\nIn our top five markets by operating income, around 60% of net revenues were smoke-free. We have deployed our smoke-free multi-category strategy across almost half of the 95 markets with smoke-free products, and we closed the year with over 38.5 million estimated adult users across heat-not-burn, oral, and e-vapor. Our smoke-free business surpassed 1 billion cans, including 644 million cans of nicotine pouches. The ZYN brand continues to resonate with adult nicotine consumers across the US where it is the number one smoke-free brand and the fourth biggest nicotine brand and also grows international.\nWe are also very pleased that the robust science and responsible marketing practices behind ZYN were recognized by FDA through the recent marketing authorization of all currently commercialized US ZYN variants, making ZYN the first and the only authorized nicotine pouch brand in the United States. We remain at the forefront of the effort to increase understanding of smoke-free products and advance tobacco harm reductions among consumers and regulators. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to incentivize switching to reduced nicotine product instead of continuing to smoke, which is a sound public health policy.\nA number of markets are also moving favorably with regards to robust regulation of nicotine pouches and the vapor. Now, regretfully, there is also resistance in many places, often driven by ideology, not facts and science, and therefore a considerable amount of work is still in front of us. While reaching important milestones is pleasing, after 10 years we are still in the early stages of industry transformation. With our strong brands and our innovative and commercial capabilities, we have many years of opportunities and growth ahead. I look forward to sharing more with you at the upcoming CAGNY conference on 19 February. I will now hand over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Jacek. I will start with the headline financials for the year. As Jacek said, this was a truly outstanding year of growth across our business as the rapid progress of IQOS and US ZYN was complemented by emerging growth contribution from VEEV and ZYN internationally and much improved combustible performance. We delivered in line or above our last communicated expectation across key metrics. Organic net revenue growth of 9.8%, adjusted IMS and shipments of HTUs, and combustible pricing of 8.7% were strong. Excellent total shipment volume growth of 2.9%, including ZYN and combustible volumes, performed at the top end of our expectation. Coupled with accelerated cost efficiencies, this led to better than expected +14.9% organic operating income growth and +15.6% currency neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share growth.\nOur clear focus on delivering performance in dollar terms was reflected in the +9.3% growth in adjusted diluted EPS. As a result, we achieved record operating cash flow of $12.2 billion, which was significantly above both our initial and most recent forecast. Supported by excellent profit delivery, favorable working capital, and strong adjusted EBITDA. This allowed us to significantly improve our leverage ratio, which I'll come back to later. We closed the year strongly in Q4 with organic net revenue growth of 7.3%. Despite the impact of timing and comparison effect, most notably related to Red Sea disruption, the EU Characterizing Flavor Ban for HTUs, and pre-launch ILUMA i device shipments. This was driven by total volume growth of +2.3% alongside positive smoke-free mix and robust pricing.\nCombined with operating leverage and manufacturing efficiencies. We delivered close to 12% organic operating income growth and 10% currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. In dollar terms, adjusted operating income increased 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 14% to $1.55. This includes a positive currency impact of $0.06 which reflects an unfavorable transactional impact in the prior year in Argentina as well as a move to hyperinflationary accounting in Egypt which also had a negative impact on our organic growth of around 1 point on net revenues and 2 points on operating income. The non-cash impairment of our RBH equity investment had no impact on our adjusted financials. In future we may benefit from RBH dividend income but we do not include any impact in our 2025 forecast at this time.\nLet's take a step back and consider 2024 in the context of the last few years. Our organic top line delivery has been consistently strong since the pandemic and further accelerated this year as both smoke-free products and combustibles stepped up their trajectory. Clearly, 2024 was also a standout year for adjusted diluted EPS growth. The profitability of our smoke-free business accelerated due to the operating leverage of IQOS's increasing scale, favorable unit economics, pricing efficiency, and the impressive accretion from ZYN's rapid growth at superior US margins. We also benefited from a notably robust combustibles performance which provide important structural support for our transformation journey. These dynamics are further demonstrated by the organic top line and gross profit growth of both categories. In the year, our smoke-free business accelerated to +17% net revenue growth and +23% gross profit growth, reaching close to $10 billion in gross profit.\nThis drove an impressive +330 basis points of organic gross margin expansion fueled by the factors I just mentioned. On the combustible side, net revenue and gross profit grew organically by +6% and +7% respectively, leading to 60 basis points of organic gross margin expansion. Our combustible business is once again contributing positively with pricing and cost efficiency more than compensating for the third year of significant input cost headwinds, which you expect to ease in 2025. I would also note that adjusted gross margin for smoke-free products were +490 basis points higher than combustibles in Q4 and +270 basis points higher for the year overall at 66.6%.\nWhile we continue to target gross margin expansion in combustibles, we expect this gap to grow over time as we continue to drive profitable growth from smoke-free products while investing in new market, brand building, and innovation. Taking a closer look now at our volume performance, we delivered our fourth consecutive year of shipment growth up +2.3% in the Q4 and close to +3% for the full year, including our VEEV e-vapor business in equivalent unit. This growth was +2.4% and +3% respectively. Our total 2024 smoke-free volume growth, including VEEV, was +13.5% or 19 billion unit equivalents, an acceleration compared to 2023. For QOS, we delivered HTU adjusted in-market sales growth of close to 13% and shipment volumes of 139.7 billion, both broadly in line with our expectation.\nAdjusted IMS growth accelerated in H2 to close to 14% essentially in line with our target of +14% to +15%. This includes dynamic growth of close to 11% in Europe with strong momentum across the large majority of markets. As I touched on earlier, Q4 HTU shipment growth include the impact of additional shipments in the prior year to prepare for the EU characterizing flavor ban and the phasing effect of additional shipment to Japan in H1. Notably, due to Red Sea disruption, our overall smoke-free business grew 2024 shipment volume by +24.6%, including ZYN's US growth of 51% to 581 million cans. Snus and moist snuff volumes were stable.\nCigarette shipments grew by +0.6%, approximately in line with the estimated growth of the international industry. The growth of the cigarette market can be largely attributed to growth in markets which were smoke-free products are not permitted, such as Turkey, Brazil, and India. Excluding such markets, we observe a low single digit decline consistent with historic trends. Our strong full-year top-line growth of almost 10% was again achieved through a combination of volume growth, pricing, and the positive mix impact of the shift to smoke-free products. Pricing contributed +6.2%, reflecting almost 9% combustibles pricing and +2% for smoke-free products.\nSmoke-free also drove a positive mix impact of +1.9% due to the higher net revenue per unit of both IQOS and ZYN. Overall, smoke-free product contributed +2.2% to overall group top-line growth for. The year demonstrating ZYN's role as a meaningful accelerator to our performance. As in prior years, geographic mix was negative, primarily due to combustibles but to a lesser degree, given robust net revenue growth in Europe. Moving down to adjusted operating margins, we delivered full year organic expansion of 180asis points and +100 basis points in dollar terms comfortably achieving our objective of expansion on both basis. This reflects Q4 with OI margin expanding organically by +140 basis points. As gross margin expansion outweighs SG&A investment, full year gross margins increase organically by +160 basis points and by +120 basis points in dollar terms.\nSG&A drove +20 basis points of margin expansion enabled by cost efficiency action despite significant reinvestment and commercial support behind our small business and US capabilities, especially in H2. We delivered over $750 million in gross cost per efficiency for the year. With cost productivity across more free and combustibles and continued back-office savings, this places us well on track for our 2024-2026 target of $2 billion. Focusing on our smoke-free business, we grew our estimated user base by over 5 million people in 2024 to reach approximately 38.6 million legal aid users as of December 31st. This includes an estimated 32.2 million IQOS users, 5.7 million oral users and 1 million VEEV users.\nI am pleased to report robust IQOS user growth of 3.4 million versus prior year and 1.5 million during H1. This growth is broad-based and consistent with recent years despite limited new market opening and the EU characterizing flavor ban. Overall, added 1.5 million users year-on-year driven by ZYN's continued strong traction with legal-age consumers in the US despite supply constraints. Zooming in now on IQOS. Strong user momentum is reflected in adjusted IMS volume with 2024 growth of over 15 billion units in line with the prior year despite the impact of the EU flavor ban. This growth is also in line with the five-year average and more than 1 billion units above when excluding contributions from markets launched in the current or preceding year. Importantly, following the rollout of IQOS ILUMA and with the increasing scale of the business, the profitability of IQOS is growing strongly.\nWe illustrate this here with the index product contribution over time at constant exchange rate. As we've explained before, the upcoming cost of a business to consumer operation results in declining infrastructure per user over time as the user fund grows in a market. This is a dynamic we expect to continue in the future. Turning to IQOS in Europe, as expected, HTU adjusted IMS growth accelerated strongly in H2 to almost 11% following H1 progression of around 8%. This resulted in robust 9.4% growth overall for the year despite the significant disruption of the characterizing flavor ban. This double-digit adjusted IMS growth in H2 was driven by strong progress in a large number of markets including growth of around 20% or more in markets such as Bulgaria, Greece, Germany, Romania, and Spain, while growth was less dynamic in Poland, Czech Republic, and Italy. Recovery in Italy is ongoing following the disruption of the silver band, although at a slightly slower pace than expected in Q4.\nThe continued momentum in the region drove Q4 adjusted share growth of 0.9 points year-on-year to 10.6% with adjusted IMS volume reaching 13.5 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. Q4 shipment volumes increased by 6% against the previous horizon which included additional volumes related to the implementation of the flavor ban, notably in Italy. The flavor ban is now active in all that fixed EU market with a generally consistent pattern of short-term disruption. Followed by a return to the pre-ban growth trajectory. Following an impact of around 2 billion units in 2020, we expected a 2025 impact of around 1 billion on both segments and IMS including annualization effect with the most prominent effect in Q1 2025.\nWe also continue to roll out the ILUMA i device and new consumable variants such as TEREA and SENTIA to more markets providing an increasing choice of taste profile and price points. Looking at our HTU of tech shares in Europe, we reached a number of important milestones with Budapest achieving over 40% share, Rome over 30% and London approaching 10%, with Madrid not far behind. Japan delivered outstanding results yet again with HTU adjusted IMS growth of close to +13% in both the quarter and the full year to reach an adjusted PMI share of 30.6% +3.1 points higher year-on-year.\nThis was supported by continued share growth of TEREA and SENTIA as well as a positive fraction of the IQOS ILUMA i device as we reach over 9.5 million adult users. IQOS share in Tokyo for the overall heat-not-burn category reached 52.8% in December with the addition of Shizuoka and Hamamatsu to make 10 cities and five prefectures exceeding the 50% share threshold. On a national offset basis, 47% of the total industry is now smoke-free. Outside of Europe and Japan. Adjusted in-market sales growth continues to grow strongly in Q4. Promising growth in a number of markets is illustrated by TCP shares in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and Mexico.\nContinuous innovation is a key driver of this growth with TEREA variant and capsule in Indonesia driving an uplift in the quarter, and some good initial results from the trial of bonds. Our lower tier offerings. IQOS continues to perform well in Cairo though offset share performance was impacted by the dynamics of the combustible market where competitor supply normalized and a very strong prior year quarter following the launch of IQOS ILUMA. Our duty-free HTU offset share increased nicely as we start to harness the strength of our multi-category portfolio drive sales of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV together. Turning now to the US, where our IQOS would be the first campaign in US team is progressing well, and we expect to commence direct sales of device. IQOS in Austin around the end of Q1. We are seeing high interest from consumers. With over 4,000 adult smokers on our waitlist.\nAs we learned from this initial consumer engagement, we are planning the rollout of pilots to other cities. As you know, our focus will focus on selective adult consumer engagement and building awareness through category and brand education in legal-age smoker communities. We do not assume any significant volume from US IQOS before the expected launch of IQOS ILUMA and we continue to hope for an FDA authorization in H2 2025. Switching categories now to ZYN, where we continued strong demand supported Q4 EU achieved volume growth of +42% year-on-year to 165 million cans despite ongoing production limitation. This reflects an acceleration to a near record sequential increase of 16 million cans substitute.\nOn a full year basis, shipment volumes grew by +196 million cans as of 2023, highlighting both the magnitude of growth and the tremendous effort made to maximize our production capacity. ZYN category share incrementally improved through the second half reaching 65.9% in Q4, as we progress in increasing production, further supported the growth of the category. Indeed, category growth slowed significantly during the summer peak of our supply constraint as shown on this chart. As the situation started to gradually improve, ZYN was again leading and outpacing the category. I am pleased to share that underlying demand for ZYN from adult consumers continued to grow in Q4 and was higher than previously assumed. We continue to experience some out-of-stock at retail and while production capacity continues to increase. We now target full normalization sometime in H2 2025.\nWe continue to target around 900 million yons of capacity for the full year from our Kentucky facility, and as supply continues to improve, we will look to further extend growth beyond our existing consumer base to other legal ethnicity users. Our greenfield site in Colorado is due to come online in early 2026, and we believe we are well positioned to capture this potential over the coming years. Responsible regulation of the industry is fundamental to supporting sustainable future growth for this dynamic category. We are therefore encouraged by the recent FDA authorization for the marketing and sale of all ZYN nicotine pouches currently marketed in the US following extensive scientific review by the agency.\nAs mentioned, this makes ZYN the first and only authorizing pouch in the market. Among several considerations were the substantially lower amount of harmful constituents versus cigarettes and other smokeless tobacco products as well as current low usage levels. The FDA's authorization marks an important step. In the protection of public health by recognizing the role that ZYN can play in providing better alternatives to cigarettes and other traditional tobacco products for legal age adults. We remain committed to driving industry standards in under 21 prevention with policies and initiatives designed to help prevent youth access.\nFurther, combating illicit trade in tobacco and nicotine products remain a core priority and we dedicate a significant level of resources to support this effort. ZYN also has an exciting future outside of the US. While still in its very early stages, international nicotine pouch shipments grew by 27 million Canada or+75% and we already see strong volume momentum in key international markets such as Pakistan, South Africa, Mexico, the UK, and global DP3. We launched nicotine pouches in six new markets during the quarter to reach a total of 37 worldwide including Italy, Romania, and Thailand. Within e-vapor we continue to see strong consumer traction behind VEEV ONE. The brand holds a top three close spot position in 13 European markets and held the number one position in five including Italy. This plays an important role within our multi-category strategy as an increasingly trusted choice for smoke-free category loyal users and a source of incremental growth with improving economics.\nOur primary focus for the combustible business is to maximize value over time while supporting the growth of the smoke-free products pricing and cost efficiencies are the key levers to drive performance while maintaining our category leadership. We delivered another robust volume quarter with growth of 1.1%. All regions contributed to strong 2.4% organic net revenue growth of 6.2%, with gross profit increasing by +10.8%. Full year pricing of 8.7% include strong contributions from Germany, Egypt, and Turkey. We expect organic 2025 combustible prices to normalize to +5% to +6%. Partly reflecting Egypt move to hyperinflationary accounting in Q4 2024.\nCategory share was flat in Q4 with positive contribution from Turkey and India offset by decline in Egypt and Indonesia with continued growth in the below tier one segment. On a full year basis we grew category share +0.1 points, reaching all-time high for both Marlboro and our global brands overall. This brings me to the outlook for 2025 where we expect another year of strong growth from all categories driving top and bottom line delivery. We anticipate a fifth consecutive year of positive volumes with growth of up to +2%, notably driven by another year of strong growth in smoke-free products at around +12% to +14%.\nFor IQOS, we expect a continuation of strong momentum with the absolute growth in HTU adjusted IMS volume expected to be at a similar level to 2024, translating into +10% to +12% growth. We expect shipment growth to be broadly in line with this double-digit trajectory, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing and trade inventory movement. We expect ongoing strong growth dynamic within the US nicotine pouch category, despite the supply constraints I mentioned before, we forecast a US ZYN volume shipment range of 780 to 820 million cans for the year, supported by capacity expansion.\nThis represents another year of substantial acceleration in volumes with an expected increase of approximately 200 to 240 million cans compared to the 196 million can increase in 2024. This supports a total PMI forecast of +6% to +8% organic net revenue growth. This includes a headwind of over 100 basis points due to hyperinflationary accounting in Egypt and the technical impact of implementing a new commercial model in Indonesia below Tier one segment. The change in Indonesia has no effect on operating income. Moving down to the P&L, we expect ongoing smoke-free mix effect, operating leverage, and cost efficiency to drive double-digit adjusted operating income growth of +10.5% to +12.5%. This includes strong gross profit growth with both gross and adjusted operating margin forecast to expand in both organic and adjusted dollar terms at prevailing exchange rate.\nWe expect SG&A costs to increase broadly in line with net revenue on an organic basis as we invest behind our small-scale products. We forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of +10.5% to +12.5%. This factors in essentially stable net interest expense and an increase in our effective corporate tax rate to approximately 22.5% to 23.5%, due to tax increases in line with OECD Global Minimum Tax and the mix of international earnings. In dollar terms, we forecast growth of +7% to +9% to a range of $7.04 to 7.17.\nThis includes an unfavorable forecast currency impact of $0.22 at prevailing exchange rate primarily driven by the broad strength of the dollar mitigated by our hedging activities. For Q1 2025, we expect a strong start to the year with net revenue and operating income growth broadly in line with our full year objective. Despite the leap year comparison, we forecast HTU adjusted IMS growth of around 10% which factors in the large annualization impact from the EU flavor ban in the quarter with a progressive improvement through the year.\nWe forecast shipment volume of 35 to 36 billion for HTUs and 170 to 180 million cans for US ZYNs. We project Q1 Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.58 to 1.63 including a negative currency variance of $0.04 at prevailing rates and an effective corporate tax rate two to three points higher than the prior year quarter. With our 2024 delivery and 2025 outlook, we are well positioned to meet or exceed all metrics of the 2024-2026 CAGR targets presented at our 2023 Investor Day. This is especially true at the level of operating income growth as well as for EPS delivery, where our algorithm achieved constant 2023 to corporate tax rate.\nThis level of top- and bottom-line growth reflects a best in class growth profile within the context of large cap consumer cycle. Importantly, we're also well on track to deliver high single digit adjusted diluted EPS growth in dollar terms across the 2024-2026 period at constant rates. Indeed, we measured our cash flows in dollars and after a record delivery in 2020. We expect to deliver operating cash flow of around $11 billion for 2025. This is broadly in line with 2024 once accounting for two non-recurring payments with a total impact of around $1 billion. While we continue to appeal the German tax surcharge case, we have decided to make a $0.8 billion payment this year, and we also anticipate the final transition tax payment related to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\nWe anticipate capital expenditure of around $1.5 billion with a large portion of this related, as we prioritize the investment behind our smoke-free portfolio. Our strong 2024 cash flow and EBITDA growth combined with a favorable impact from our Euro balance sheet hedging allowed us to reduce our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by 0.5x to 2.66x ahead of our expectation and representing a dramatic acceleration of our deleveraging. We expect further progress in 2025 placing. We're on track for our target ratio of around 2x by the end of 2026. I will now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you Emmanuel. In summary, 2024 was a remarkable year for PMI. Our financial results epitomize the strength of our strategy and the success of our transformation with underlying momentum across categories bolstered by our proactive measures on pricing and cost efficient. I remain confident in our position as the global smoke-free champion as we continue to execute on our multi-category strategy with leading premium brands IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV. Our key strategic priorities for 2025 are clear as we continue to support the expansion and development of our small business both in the US and International.\nWe expect continued strong momentum in 2025 and we remain confident in our ability to deliver or exceed our 2024-2026 growth target as we progress towards our ambition of becoming substantially smoke-free by 2030. Finally, and importantly, our strong growth output highly cash flow generative business enables us to continue reinvesting in our smoke-free transformation while returning cash to shareholders. In September, we increased our annual dividend for the 17th consecutive year in line with our long-term commitment. Thank you and Emmanuel and I will. I'm happy now to answer your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question today comes from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, Jacek and Emmanuel.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Matthew.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Matthew.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThe 2025 outlook calls for HTU shipments in numbers or in market sales growth fairly in line with what you saw in 2024. But could you talk about the composition of the growth if it's overall in line? Are you seeing different contribution by geography in your outlook? And can you remind us on if there has been any progress in new markets contributing to growth in 2025 or if you've made any progress in those markets as you look out to your 2026 goals? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nNo, so in our guidance we essentially continue seeing good growth in Japan and in a number of markets in Europe. I mean Emmanuel mentioned about Italy, Czech, Poland, right, when the growth is a bit below what we would expect at this stage, especially Italy and Czech following the flavor ban. But we also see that there is some recovery coming in. So I think, you know, hopefully in the second part of the year we should bring Italy another geography is at part to what the rest of the Europe is going through, and we have not, in the guidance, assumed any significant new market opening in terms of the volume.\nAs you know, you and I had it in my remarks. I mean, we're dealing with this rational world fighting with the irrational world. I hope that, you know, the most recent authorizations of the FDA, following the authorizations of heat-not-burn and the pouches, will be a good incentive or encouragement by other governments, which, to be very frank, stupidly oppose smoke-free products while allowing cigarettes. But in the guidance, we have not put any significant volume coming from the new geography. So this is all organic growth, and as you can see in the subsequent quarters of this year, despite the fact even if you look at Japan when almost half of the market is already on smoke-free products, the growth continues there.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Jacek. I'll pass it on.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Hi Emmanuel and Jacek. I had a question on your margins. You're guiding robust operating leverage on a currency neutral basis this year. So hoping you could highlight the, you know, some of the key drivers behind this. Also sort of wanted to verify if your guidance assumes a potential entry of an ILUMA in the US or you know, just possibly continued investments without, you know, any corresponding sales. Then how should we think about the margin contribution from ILUMA in the US and how long it might take after your entry in the market for those margins to really be meaningful?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, so Bonnie, good morning. I mean, yes, we're looking for a robust margin expansion this year. Maybe not precisely to the same level as we had last year, but still it's going to be robust I think in a hundred basis points or so territory. This is what we're looking into is that, you know, combinations of a few factors. We're still looking at the pricing contributions pretty obvious. There's obviously positive mix right between categories and especially now that we have our smoke-free categories on the positive margin path, including the e-vapor. So we're now very happy that our strategy of going selectively but with the right impacts in the geographies that is needed. We're not leaving money behind, if you like margin behind.\nSo this will contribute and you know we had in the past, as you remember, quite the headwinds coming from a COGS and I think those have, I think they are behind us. Okay then obviously this whole, you know, conversations these days here and there, especially coming from the US about the tariffs and so on. But you know, the way we organize our supply chain as you know it's autonomous is essentially self-sufficient. Our supply chains in Europe, I mean we organized our supply chain almost by blocks.\nSo I don't see at this stage that there should be any surprises coming on the tariff side. I think we're pretty confident where we'll land with the COGS for the year. There is obviously ongoing support coming from the scale of IQOS, especially devices, when, okay, there is economy of scale, there is a robustness of the device in terms of quality, etc. We actually don't have this like in the past, a bit of a pressure on the margins coming from a device sale. This we have well stabilized for 2024, that's behind the margin expansion, and I think we should expect the same. We are expecting the same in 2025. Now your questions with regards to ILUMA margins versus. Okay, maybe one by one. We still expect that hopefully, you know, we will get authorization for IQOS ILUMA around the middle of this year.\nAgain, on the one hand, one could read this as encouragement that after, as we said, it's thorough scientific, et cetera review, FDA has gave authorizations for all variants of the. I wouldn't be myself if I wouldn't comment that obviously something takes five years, it must be thorough because otherwise I cannot explain, you know, the length of the process. But I do hope that you know, FDA will move faster and you know, already I could do my spending for a while. By the way, if you have also authorization for ZYN so the margin story, I would repeat myself that obviously when we start adding support behind ILUMA, I mean at the initial period will be a negative. Right?\nIn a scheme of the things and the P&L size, if you like, of our business in the US, I don't think it should be something which is, you know, that much worried, and I believe it will go in the similar path as we had on a heat-not-burn in other places. So two to three years we should. IQOS should be net, net contributor to the bottom line. Bearing in mind as always reminding everyone that we don't really have the headwind of cannibalization. Right. So we don't really. We're in a better starting position and we, you know, we had a growing confidence in the IQOS ILUMA internationally, but we know what IQOS ILUMA brought us internationally over the last three years and it continues, you know, generating the growth user acquisition. I believe it's really a great proposition for adult smokers in the US.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMaybe just to comment on the margin side. Bonnie, as you can judge from our guidance, we have significant ambition in terms of margin improvement in 2025, and what is driving that is the fact that we are flying on several engines here on margin improvement, and everything is coming together positively at the same time. So indeed we have, of course, the mix evolution that is very favorable to us with smoke-free products coming with a higher margin, and they are growing very fast. Among those smoke-free products, we have the US and ZYN that is growing even faster, and which, as we already said, is best in class in terms of margin. So that's obviously a plus. We are also increasing price. Yes, of course we're not going to continue to deliver 8%+ price increase on combustibles, but it's going to remain extremely robust.\nAnd we also have the ambition to grow our price not at the same level, but significantly on our smoke-free portfolio. And then when we look at our COGS, we are working on productivity; they have scale effect that are delivering positively. And as you know, we were facing until now a significant headwind cost, notably on the combustible business. This is easing, 2025 should be better, and 2026 could be even better than 2025, by the way. So we are going in the right direction there, and that is making us clearly targeting nice margin improvement both organically and in the long term for 2025.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, super helpful. And actually, I'm just going to ask a quick follow-up because you kind of touched on this, but you also mentioned this morning about, you know, targeting or you continue to target gross margin expansion in combustibles. And then you did say that you expect the gap to grow relative to your smoke-free product gross margin. So, you know, previously you guys have talked about, I think, a 10-point gap. So, you know, as your, your gross margins expand on, you know, combustibles. I think what I'm hearing you say is that, you know, not only is that an opportunity, but also continued margin expansion on smoke-free, which you just mentioned. So, do you foresee that gap expanding? I mean, does it go to 15-point spread or, you know, could it go to 20? Just kind of trying to think through that in the next couple of years.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook on the consumable, we've already highlighted the fact that there was a 10 percentage point gap and it has been expanding in the last few years. So indeed we have the ambition to do better on the gross margin for combustibles, and we explain why. But as we continue to progress also rapidly on smoke-free products and both, you know, with the mix effect coming from ZYN, but separately on IQOS and ZYN, we want to continue to progress. So we could have indeed a gap that could continue to expand between smoke-free products and combustibles in the coming years.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you Bonnie.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nGood morning, Emmanuel and Jacek. Thank you for taking my questions, there are a couple of questions. One is on ZYN. So if I look at the scatter data, your volumes have decelerated to mid-teens growth, and your guidance is for 34% to 41% growth and then you also mentioned that the supply normalization will only happen in H2 2025, so you know, just wanted to understand what gives us the confidence that suddenly then we'll be accelerating to this almost 40% growth rate again.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, so I would take it. Gaurav, good morning. So we look also on, you know, how the volumes were evolving in Q4 of the weeks of the last quarter. We see the growing velocities behind ZYN. Actually there was the only brand I think over the last few weeks which was growing in a velocity not the rest of the. At least the big four other brands or smaller, but big other brands. Look, we all also have to understand that we're reading all this data with no full supply of the supply constrained environment. Right. So it's a bit difficult that you see at the retail. It depends even in which source you're looking at that something which be significantly different than what we're shipping to the trade. But, you know Q4 as we predicted, you know with the increased capacity on Owensboro.\nWe had Q1 with the significant sequential quarter-on-quarter growth even if you will take the run rate of what we see, the last weeks, etc. I think that the guidance is somehow reflecting what we see there. Now, our comments that, you know, we should, we think that we should be meeting a demand by about mid of this year. I have to make one reservation is that it's difficult to actually read what the demand is because we know what is the level of out of stock. We know what is the existing users of ZYN and demand for the product. Knowing that these purchases or the purchases are somehow impacted by the fact that unfortunately they are confronted with the lack of availability out of stock and then is the, you know, all the positive momentum which doesn't have.\nI believe also the FDA authorizations, which, you know, on the one hand, one could read product was in the market, so there is no change. But actually, I think it gives a lot of, you know, visibility and stability to all the market participants, including the trade, and I believe also the consumers, that the product now has the full-fledged, you know, in my language, authorization in all the flavor variants. All of these things I think will translate into the volumes, our projections of the volumes, which were reflected in our guidance.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nSure. A follow up question to that. You know, so ZYN clearly in supply shortage, retailers have been putting their markups. I think you increased prices at $0.30 last year while retail has increased pricing by $1 or you know, $3, $5. How do you control retail price? And is there a way for you to, as supply normalizes, to reduce retail price so that will also have a positive effect on your volume?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So, you know, if you have a degree of the out-of-stock as ZYN is experiencing, it's obviously managing the price at the retail level is, you know, a little bit more challenging. Right. I mean, it's pretty obvious. But I believe with the growing demand, sorry, with the growing supply of the product, I think this pricing will come to some sort of natural normalization. I have to also admit that, look, we are very happy with the support we're getting from, you know, retailers handling our products. You know, it's not that easy for them also to be confronted with product which on the one hand has the demand. On the other hand, they cannot realize their margins. You know, they take from a consumer price. You know, I hope, I think that, you know, this pricing situation in the market will sort out somehow naturally the moment when the product will be in a fully unconstrained supply. As we said, you know, H2 2025, we should start seeing improvement on this.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nSure. If I could just squeeze in one last question on ZYN Ultra. Could you just talk about that a little, what the product is, and when do you think we can see it in the market?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So obviously, as well as we all notice, right. The ZYN authorization came essentially last days or hours of the one administration. Now I guess we'll have to wait for the, for the new authorization. Sorry. For the new administration. Look, as I said in the, you know, in the answer to the questions before that, I do hope that, you know, period of four or five years waiting for authorization is too much. It's too long.\nI do believe that there will be some, I hope there will be some accelerations in the processing because of the authorizations. And you know, we have to also understand that, you know, partially the challenge which the US market has very much on the e-vapor product is by the fact that the legal part of the market has not been created. So on the one hand, you know, FDA is doing a lot of right things in terms of law enforcement and chasing the illegal Chinese or whatever imports. On the other hand, there is a demand among smokers, adult nicotine users for this type of a product.\nUnless we create in a fast manner, the legal part of that market and then, you know, we're essentially wasting our time and money. I do believe that FDA will take this also in the considerations that this situation shouldn't happen in our product categories. If there is a demand for the product, we all have the interest in case, intelligent part of the market, and then a control for the law enforcement, et cetera, the illicit market. But you cannot just control the illicit market if you haven't provided the legal solutions in the market which are available. I do believe that, you know, the IQOS, sorry, IQOS as well, but then has some pending authorizations or applications, I should say. I do believe that they're going to be processed in a faster manner than before.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Gaurav.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. As a reminder, if you have a question, please press star one one. Our next question comes from Eric Serotta of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks guys. Hoping you guys give some color in terms of what you're seeing in Italy. You mentioned that the Q4 was a little bit softer than you had anticipated after the nice recovery you saw in the Q3 from the characterizing flavor ban. Then in terms of Poland, can you remind us when you expect to see some disruption from the ban being implemented? And what sort of an impact do you expect in terms of overall European combustion business? And then lastly on FX, it seems like the FX headwind that you called out for the year and the guidance was a bit less than what seems to be implied based on spot rates and your typical Yen hedge. Wondering if there's been any change in the hedging policy or if there's any reason why it may be a bit lower than anticipated? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, so maybe I think the last one is the easiest one. I come back to Italy, which is a bit the longer story. I mean, in $0.22 at spot rates right now. I mean, frankly speaking, the biggest contributor to the negative is the Russian ruble, and that's well above the 60% of the variance. The yen actually goes in a cent. I guess it was, if I recall, about the $0.04 in our estimates at the spot rate. Obviously, as we all know, we're living in the pretty dynamic times as we speak, but this is what it is. There was a big contribution last year coming from the Egyptian pound. Right. When we had to take the heat. That obviously will not be repeated in 2025. Actually, this will result in a positive currency benefit. But this is on the currency. So frankly speaking, at this stage it's a ruble and, as I said, $0.04 or so on the end. And the rest is just the mixed bag due to our international footprint. Emmanuel wants to add something?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International",
    "content2": "No, I want to add something because I think, I mean, you know, the volatility we're seeing on the currency market today will be a good torture test on, you know, how things are working for us. I should first remind you that we have a natural hedging in our balance sheet with more than 60% of our debt that is in Euro. Therefore when we have a weakness in the euro versus dollar, which is a situation we've seen recently, of course we have a negative impact on our P&L, but we have also a decrease of our debt in dollar terms, and we are also benefiting from lower cost of the debt in Euro, plus of course lower interest cost in Euro translated into dollar.\nThat has been certainly helping our trajectory in 2024. And if there was continued weakness of the euro that would continue to help us in the future. Probably what is not fully captured by the market is the fact that indeed on top of that we have two significant hedge position. One, on our exposure to the yen for 2025, we have around 60% of our exposure that is covered at a rate of around JPY 138 for $1. So that means that we are not impacted by the possible deterioration of the yen for that part of our exposure.\nWe have also a lower exposure to a lower hedging on Euro where we have around a bit more than 1/5, sorry, 1/4 of our exposure to Euro where we are covered at 1.12, which is also limiting a bit the impact on the P&L when the Euro is going down. So with everything I've been saying, you have all the explanation, plus what Jacek has been sharing with you on the Forex impact for us today.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, now on Italy. So I think yes, the second half was a bit weaker than we would maybe expect. Italy was going, as you know, many others, not all, but many other member states of the EU for the flavor ban. I think what we see is that, okay, some smokers, some users have hopped temporarily back to cigarettes, which always was the risk. It also explains in some geographies the cigarette trends are slightly or better than one could expect or could think. There is some poly use between VEEV products very much, that I believe maybe partially also explains why our VEEV proposition has advanced most in Italy.\nThis was in a pod in a closed system very shortly after a short period of time, jump to the number one position. I think we need to maybe look at the category of a smoke-free over a period of time on a total basis because there will be some poly usage, and sometimes driven by the events like this flavors ban. But we also have geographies in Europe that very shortly after the implementation of the flavor ban, I mean, they actually return to the growth rates which we had before. So you know, maybe Italy is our player we're looking into this whole thing.\nBut as I said, part of our multi-category strategy is also should there be any leakage at the heat-not-burn users, we can capture this with our proposition. Then I guess we need a bit more time to see the stabilization. Poland, you asked about Poland. I don't think Poland has put the stick in the ground which moment they really want to fully implement the ban to the letter will happen. I think some are in 2025 but it has to be if this is not, you know, if the stick has not been put in the ground, it is more toward the end of this year.\n\nEric Serotta\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thanks so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. The line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for the questions. Hi, guys, a couple from me as well. Firstly, on ZYN again in the US, we noticed a couple of your peers have launched synthetic moist nicotine products, and according to the scanner data, have seen some initial uptick. How do you see the moist versus dry dynamic in the US, and where do you think the consumer may end up in the future, recognizing that in Europe most products are moist? And the second question maybe comes back to your comments around Italy. But just longer term, we see the vapor category continuing to grow quite strongly, and we can discuss its flaws around flavored flavors, marketing, underage use, etc. But do you see this as a headwind for the tobacco industry, or do you believe the total pie can continue to grow with limited impact on tobacco?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, so maybe the second part I take it. I think the total pie grows despite the fact that the movements between the categories within smoke-free. You know there is some dynamics right between heat-not-burn, e-vapor, and pouches now depends how market is organized and regulated. We also know that you know the most difficult actually to read category due to the way the market is organized currently is the e-vapor category, right? Because you have a disposables, you have pods, you have open tank systems, and some products are under the regulations and properly authorized depends on the jurisdiction. Some products are just popping up in the market. You could call it the different forms of illicit trade.\nI think you see this in the US, but also in Europe, in the UK, and a few other places. Regulators, governments are taking more a serious look into properly organizing that market. I can't tell you whether this will be completed in 2025, but definitely there is the moves, the movements, the moves are in the right direction. So I believe 2025, 2026, the category should be normalized by the fact that it's going to be properly regulated and then we take it from there. I don't want to talk about the youth exposure, etc.\nBecause you know, we, you know, four of you know our policy, you know what our views on this one, but definitely it's difficult to control or the discipline the market if you're dealing with, you know, all of the different emanations of the product coming essentially legal to the marketplace. It obviously also enjoys the less disciplined trade channels so completely, you know, invisible trade channels if you like, etc. When it comes to your questions about the synthetic versus dry. So just to take it from a perspective, the way we look at the data in the US, for example, this whole new things which are coming into the market, there is quite a long list of different SKUs, and you know, the moist, others, and you know.\nThis whole market, that part of the market if I am not mistaken, move year-on-year by barely 20 basis points. So in a scheme of these things, there's presumably a lot of dynamics on the weekly basis, but doesn't seem that it has any major traction etc. The insights which we have when we talk of our consumers, we see obviously, when you read the consumer insight is not a pure mathematical accuracy and the exact number, but I think that the moist products, moist pouch products is more appealing to the moist snuff type of users, right, like snus, et cetera. While what we see in the marketplace that the dry product has more appeal towards the smokers and the vapers. What is what I can tell you at this stage.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you guys, really appreciate that.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question today comes from Philip Spain of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\n\nPhilip Spain\n\nVP of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nHi, good afternoon, thanks very much for taking. I just had one question please.It was just on the HTU guidance, if I look at where the volumes landed at the end of 2024 and then I look at the guidance range. The 10% to 12%, you've got it here for 25%. But then, just extrapolating that out for 2026 and looking at your guidance there of the 180 to 200 million of shipment volume. Just trying to get a sense of what gives you confidence in my math that implies acceleration in the growth in 2026 and to understand, I suppose what gives you that confidence that you will see that reacceleration in 2026. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, so as I said earlier, I mean in the guidance for this year for 2025, we essentially stayed very low into. We essentially focus on organic growth in the markets, existing markets. Obviously if you open the, you know, 2025 and beyond 2026, I think it's becoming maybe more prudent or fair to assume that there will be some geographies also coming finally and opening the markets to the new proposition. There is one point which I maybe we haven't articulated well in our remarks and the answers to the questions before is that, there is still about the 20% or so of the volumes on the heat-not-burn that we don't really do.\nWe can't really realize the full growth potential. I'm referring here to the geographies of Russia and Ukraine now for obvious reasons. But if I was just look at the numbers of 2024, I think we have left behind about 0.6%, maybe even more, point of growth which we would normally expect to deliver if all these markets were subject to the same sort of market conditions as other places. Right. As ILUMA, etc. So okay, let's see how this unwind. I think the growth which we projected very much focus on organic. Organic meaning the geographies which we have today aren't. I think is a good growth. Volume terms is essentially the same volume growth as we used to have in the past.\nBut also, in a broader sense, we more and more see the potential of the multi-category, and the total volumes of the smoke-free products is just the one category, and as we know very well, the margin from the margin perspective, they all essentially create the great opportunities. I mean, they all greatly accretive to where we are today and especially to the combustibles. Second thing is, and I think we will zoom a little bit more or try to zoom a bit more to this, our CAGNY presentations, but from the user's perspective is actually pretty nice economic proposition because we essentially then leveraging all the investments for the user acquisitions etc. And you know, one of the category obviously takes the burden of acquiring the user, but all the other product categories actually very nicely benefited from this whole thing. So you will hear from us more and more talking.\nObviously, we'll give you the granularity about the heat-not-burn vape and ZYN, but I think in the next few years the focus will be more and more turning into total smoke-free rather than just the individual because this also somehow reflects the user direction, the consumer dynamics.\n\nPhilip Spain\n\nVP of Equity Research, JPMorgan\n\nThank you very much.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn it back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Before closing our call, I'd like to remind you that as Jacek mentioned, we will be presenting at the CAGNY conference on 19 February and we hope you'll be able to join us either in person or virtually. Thank you again for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the investor relations team and have a great day. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.

Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered another outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024. Our categories were strong across the board to deliver a record H1 2024 on organic top line growth and on organic operating income growth excluding the pandemic recovery year of 2021. The strong underlying momentum of IQOS continued in Q2 with shipments and adjusted in-market sales volume growth above or in line with our expectations. This reflects another quarter of strong progress in Japan and robust fundamentals in Europe despite the volatility of the Characterizing Flavor Ban.\nWith pricing, manufacturing efficiency, and scale benefit, the expanding profit contribution of IQOS is driving excellent growth for PMI. ZYN continued its impressive growth trajectory with Q2 US volumes growing by over 50% despite recent supply tensions and increased pricing. In addition to IQOS and US ZYN, I am pleased to report building multi-category momentum while still early days. VEEV has already become the closed pod leader in five European markets and is firmly on the path to profitability while international nicotine pouch volumes grew over +60% in H1 matching US growth rates. This progress of smoke-free products is reflected in a rapidly growing consumer base with around 36.5 million estimated adult users as of 30 June and our products now available across 90 markets worldwide.\nOur combustible business also over delivered with a return to gross margin expansion ahead of plan in Q2 after two years of significant inflationary headwinds. This was driven by stable H1 volumes and category share despite robust pricing in addition to cost efficiencies.\nThis broad-based delivery translated into double-digit organic operating income growth with significant margin expansion. As we have outlined previously, delivering robust growth in dollar terms is a key priority, and we are taking proactive steps on pricing and cost efficiency to mitigate currency headwinds. This is clearly evident in our H1 adjusted diluted earnings per share delivery of mid-single-digit growth despite a currency headwind of over 12%, as essentially all of the expected full-year impact fell in the first half.\nFollowing this exceptional first half performance, we are increasing our 2024 full year forecast on all organic dimensions and for Adjusted Diluted EPS on both a currency neutral and U.S. dollar basis. This reflects our strong H2 2024 outlook with accelerating adjusted IMS growth for IQOS, sequentially higher ZYN volumes, and a stepped up rate of USD EPS growth at prevailing exchange rate.\nLooking at our headline financials, strong total cigarette volume growth of +2.8% drove Q2 organic net revenue growth of 9.6%, or 5.6% in dollar terms. Robust top line growth, positive smoke-free margin mix, and ongoing cost efficiencies enable us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.59. This represents +10.6% growth excluding a larger than expected unfavorable currency variance of $0.18, which includes a small transactional impact from exchange rate volatility at quarter end. This better than expected ex-currency performance reflects the improving profitability of IQOS, ZYN, and combustibles, which I will come back to.\nLooking now at the first half. Overall, our volumes grew by 3.2% and organic net revenue by 10.2%, our highest growth since the 2008 spin. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove operating income growth of 17% with margin expansion of 230 basis points organically and plus 7.1% growth in dollar terms. We expect continued robust OI growth on both a reported and an organic basis in the second half.\nH1 adjusted diluted EPS grew by an impressive 16.8% in constant currency and by 4% in dollar terms. The $0.38 unfavorable H1 currency variance includes $0.08 of non-recurring transactional impact from Egypt and Russia.\nFocusing now on volume, total shipment growth in both the quarter and H1 overall reflect smoke-free share gains in a resilient international industry which grew by more than 1% in both periods and even excluding oral and e-vapor. Q2 HTU shipments of 35.5 billion units exceeded our prior outlook, notably driven by continued strong performance in Japan, robust underlying growth in Europe, and promising growth in newer markets such as Indonesia. In addition to underlying momentum, Q2 saw an incremental phasing impact of around 0.5 billion units primarily related to Red Sea disruption.\nQ2 HCU adjusted IMS volume grew by +10.2% in line with our expectation. This includes the impact of the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, most notably in Italy this quarter. Total smoke-free adjusted in-market sales volume grew +11.2% in Q2 and +13.1% in H1. This includes our oral smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with Q2 pouch unit volumes up by +20%.\nU.S. ZYN shipment grew by 50% to 35.1 million cans.\nThis does not include the promising result of our e-vapor business where volumes grew strongly to the equivalent of 0.7 billion units on a year-to-date basis. Cigarette shipments grew by +0.4% with notable positive contribution from Turkey and North Africa. This reflects a stable category share excluding market mix despite step-up pricing. With such a positive H1 volume performance, we are raising our full-year forecast for total cigarette, HTU, and oral unit volumes to +1% to +2%, which would mark our fourth consecutive year of volume growth.\nThe power of our multi-category smoke-free transformation and recovery in combustibles are clearly illustrated on this slide as both areas contributed strongly to double-digit organic OI growth of +12.5% for the group in Q2. Smoke-free continued its excellent momentum with +18% organic growth in net revenue and +22% in gross profit driving +220 basis points organic gross margin expansion. This reflects the strong performance of ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS including manufacturing productivities and an increasing albeit smaller contribution from VEEV. Expanding smoke-free gross margin continues to widen the gap versus combustibles gross margin enhancing the very positive mix effect of our transformation. However, combustibles gross margin expansion is also a key objective.\nAfter seven quarters of contraction, we are very pleased to report +50 basis points expansion and gross profit growth of +5.5% on an organic basis, providing a meaningful contribution to total PMI profitability. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong pricing, in addition to ongoing efficiencies and reduced headwinds on our COGS, notwithstanding continued tobacco leaf inflation. We also expect combustibles gross margin expansion in H2.\nCombined with a very strong Q1. The year-to-date picture is even more compelling with double-digit organic net revenue, gross profit, and OI growth. This is driven by the same dynamic as Q2 with an impressive +390 basis points gross margin expansion and +29% gross profit growth for our smoke-free business.\nOur H1 revenue performance again demonstrates the powerful drivers of our financial model with an unparalleled combination of positive volumes, robust pricing, and the very favorable category mix of our smoke-free product. As mentioned, volume grew by 3.2%. Pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth including 8.3% pricing on combustibles and around +2% on smoke-free. Smoke-free category mix added plus 2.5 points to the top line reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and ZYN. While still small, VEEV also contributed positively to the overall mix. I also note that overall smoke-free product added plus 2 points to organic net revenue progression underlying the continued accretion from the Swedish Match acquisition.\nAs in recent quarters, geographic mix was negative. This is primarily due to combustibles, where volumes increasingly skew to lower-margin markets where smoke-free alternatives are small or not available. With higher-margin markets over-indexed to cannibalization, we expect this dynamic to be less impactful in 2024 than last year.\nNow let's focus on the mechanics behind our H1 margin delivery. Gross margin increased organically by 140 basis points and by 80 basis points in dollar terms. This was driven by our higher margin smoke-free business, pricing, and ongoing productivity savings across the value chain. As expected, SG&A cost growth stepped up in Q2, increasing 9.8% organically after a very modest increment in Q1 due to planned phasing of commercial spend. The resulting 5.8% organic increase in H1 was below the rate of top-line growth, driving +1 percentage point of margin expansion. With our successful back-office program able to mitigate some of the investment step-up with a range of important commercial activities in Q3, we expect SG&A to remain elevated but continue to target an organic increase below the rate of net revenue growth for the year.\nI am pleased to report we delivered over $300 million in H1 gross cost efficiency across both COGS and SG&A. As we proactively drive bottom line growth, we expect an acceleration in H2 savings, notably from manufacturing as we progress towards our $2 billion target for 2024-2026 period.\nThe combination of these factors drove a 230 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margin. Despite a significant H1-skewed currency headwind, adjusted OI margin were stable on a dollar basis.\nMoving to our smoke-free business, we estimate there were 36.5 million adult users of PMI smoke-free product as of 30 June, reflecting an additional 3.2 million during H1. This includes an estimated 30.8 million IQOS user, 5.2 million oral users, and 0.8 million VEEV users. The increase in both total and IQOS user was broad-based with notable progress in Japan, Europe, and newer growth markets such as Indonesia. In addition to ZYN's strong traction with legal-age nicotine user in the U.S., our smoke-free products are now present in 19 markets following recent launches of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV.\nFocusing now on IQOS in Europe where fundamental dynamics are developing very well, including the user growth I just mentioned. First, we see robust recoveries in markets where the characterizing flavor ban has passed the initial adjustment phase. Second, there is continued excellent growth in markets where IQOS is already well established such as Portugal, Hungary, and Greece. Last, new growth leader markets are emerging with accelerating momentum in Germany, Spain, Bulgaria, and Romania. In addition to a recovery in Poland following the launch of DELIA.\nOur Q2 HTU share increased by 0.8 points year on year despite the impact of the flavor ban. Due to the usual seasonal factors and a resilient combustible market, Q2 share was sequentially below Q1. HTU adjusted IMS volume demonstrated robust growth, growing by 0.8 billion units sequentially to reach 12.9 billion on the four-quarter moving average. As expected, Adjusted In-Market Sales growth of 6.8% was slower than in Q1 due to higher comparison and the initial impact of the Characterizing Flavor Ban, notably in Italy. Growth excluding Italy was close to 10%.\nThe impact of the ban is progressing in line with our prior estimate in the majority of market, though the implementation in Italy during Q2 was slightly more pronounced than anticipated. This was primarily driven by earlier sell through of affected SKUs and concurrent pricing. It is important to note this is a transitory dynamic and I'm pleased to report a recovery in markets such as Greece, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania where the ban was implemented previously following an initial period of consumer adjustment. Indeed, despite an uncertain outlook in Ukraine, we anticipate an acceleration in Europe adjusted IMS growth in the second half. This is supported by the planned step up in commercial activity behind IQOS including the introduction of DELIA and LEVIA HTUs to an increasing number of markets.\nAnother illustration of our continued progress in Europe is in our key cities' HTU share. Strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoption such as Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon, and Sofia and historically slower growth markets such as Madrid, London, and Amsterdam highlight the enduring growth potential in the region.\nJapan demonstrated impressive IQOS growth in the quarter with adjusted HTU IMS growth of 12.5%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit progression. Adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially, reaching 10.5 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. Total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by 3.1 points year on year to 29.4%, with national offtake share exceeding the impressive milestone of 30% in June.\nWe also maintain offtake share of over 35% in Tokyo despite seasonal factors where the overall category continues to track at over 50% of total offtake and grow sequentially, demonstrating the continued potential in this important market.\nOur continuous innovation is a key driver of this growth with Q2 seeing a strong step up in user acquisition following the launch of ILUMA i and further innovative TEREA variants such as Capsule consumables.\nTaking a more global view, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across a broad range of geographies, including low- and middle-income markets, as highlighted by key cities' HTU shares. Accelerating growth in Indonesia, the world's largest cigarette market by volume excluding China, leads the way with increasing geographic reach and clove HTU innovation.\nMarkets across North Africa and the Middle East are also a growing weight and source of growth. We show Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia here in addition to Egypt where performance in Cairo remains robust despite recent pricing and a recovery in the combustible market. I am also pleased to report very good progress in the UAE and Jordan following the recent launch of ILUMA. Growth in Mexico City is very promising and the East Asian market of South Korea and Malaysia continue to perform well. Also worth highlighting is a successful contribution of duty-free where we are increasingly leveraging our multi-category portfolio to expand share in a growing market as travel recovers in Asia.\nOur fundamental HTU growth outlook for the year has not changed. H1 adjusted IMS growth of 11.4% reflects the strong dynamic I described across Japan, Europe, and global markets partly offset by the transitory impact of the EU flavor ban. Indeed, growth excluding Europe accelerated compared to the last year and we expect this to continue.\nHowever, we see an incremental headwind of around 2 billion units to our full-year adjusted IMS forecast, the majority of which is driven by the ongoing delay in approval for commercialization in Taiwan, which was previously expected around the midpoint of the year. We also factor in an impact of a few hundred million units for a slower recovery from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, principally in Italy. I would note that our revised full-year forecast for adjusted IMS growth of around 13% represents the same absolute volume increase as 2023 despite the EU headwind. We accordingly forecast full-year HTU shipment volume of around 140 billion units, with shipment as usual expected to be a few billion units higher than adjusted IMS given continued offtake and user growth.\nImportantly, we expect very strong H2 delivery in adjusted IMS on both a sequential and year-on-year basis to between 14% and 15% growth. This is supported by a notable step up in commercial activity, continued momentum in Japan, and increasingly dynamic global market. This includes the market I just mentioned and the ongoing acceleration in duty-free for Europe. A broadening of growth through acceleration in Germany, Spain, the UK, and Romania adds to the ongoing momentum in geographies such as Portugal and Greece. H2 should also see several markets start to rebound from initial flavor ban impact, including a gradual recovery in Italy.\nTurning now to ZYN where very good US progress continued in Q2 with close to +70% growth in 12 months rolling shipments. As we shared earlier in the year, strong demand dynamics have created short-term supply chain constraints which has impacted volume growth as shown on this slide. This has resulted in a temporary slowdown of the category. ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity remain strong while maintaining very robust category volume and value share. Despite these availability challenges and the recent price increase, we also remain highly focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use.\nWe are making good progress on expanding production and continue to expect a gradual improvement through Q3, with sequentially higher volume, and for production volumes to meet expected consumer demand during the course of Q4. We expect the ongoing expansion of the existing facility in Kentucky to provide around 900 million cans of capacity for 2025. We also recently announced a planned investment in a new plant in Colorado, which is due to begin preliminary operation by the end of next year. Together, these plans support our ZYN growth ambitions for the coming years.\nFor 2024. We are now forecasting a US shipment range of 560 to 580 million cans to reflect strongly increasing demand from adult nicotine users and the progress made on increasing our production capacity.\nI will now take a moment to update you on the international expansion of our smoke-free business. Our multi-category approach is gaining momentum as we unlock new horizons of growth with the increasing commercialization of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV across markets. Our focus strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. In Europe, closed pods are accelerating. Within the dynamic e-vapor category, we are seeing strong traction of our VEEV ONE product, achieving a number one closed pod position in five markets within the first year of launch, including Italy, the Czech Republic, and Romania.\nWe continue to observe good repeat purchase and conversion rate, which is often a challenge for this category. We expect continued volume momentum in H2 supported by ongoing geographic expansion and to reach profitability in Q3. For ZYN, there is a large opportunity outside of the US which we are working to capture. Our international nicotine pouch volume, including the Nordics, grew by over 60% in H1, matching us in growth. We see promising results in a number of markets including Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan, and the important UK market where we have seen strong traction with only limited distribution so far. Our expansion of the IQOS portfolio remains active as we innovate to broaden and enhance our offer for both existing users and switching adult smokers.\nFurther market launches are planned in H2 including DELIA and LEVIA, HTUs and the new ILUMA i device range which is currently only available in Japan.\nWe also continue with our preparation for IQOS ILUMA in the US and we are underway with consumer engagement for our first city pilot in Austin, Texas with the IQOS 3 system which we expect to start in Q4. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and focused on direct activation of select legal-age smokers in a few cities and allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose is to fine-tune our approach and readiness in anticipation of the at-scale launch of ILUMA. We continue to assume an authorization from the FDA in H2 2025.\nFocusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth and a very positive profit contribution. As I covered earlier, this reflects resilient volume despite very strong Q2 pricing of 8.7% including our proactive action to maximize growth. It is worth noting the large majority of our pricing is derived from regular pricing action unrelated to significant currency devaluation. Factoring a strong H1 and favorable outlook, we now forecast an increased fully combustible price variance of 7 to 8%. Our cigarette category share was stable in H1 and down 0.2 points in Q2 or stable excluding market mix impact. Lower share in Egypt and Indonesia was offset by positive contribution from Turkey, India, and the Europe region. Again, despite strong pricing, our global brand grew category share in the quarter with Marlboro gaining +0.3 points to 10.1%.\nOn a global basis, our leadership in combustibles is a critical enabler to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we target a stable category share over time. As mentioned previously, we evaluate our strategy on a market-by-market basis and have the flexibility to adapt our approach where smoke-free products have already reached critical mass.\nTaking a more holistic view on the business, our transformation and smoke-free journey are backed by a strategy that seeks to embed sustainability in all that we do. We are making strong progress towards our product transformation targets. Our smoke-free products are now available in 90 markets, placing us on track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low- and middle-income countries to comprise over 50% of smoke-free product market. The rapid growth of our estimated SFP user base which now stand at around 36.5 million adult users as previously described is further testament to this progress.\nWith regard to our operations, decarbonization is an important focus area, and we are very pleased to have been awarded the top spot on the Forbes 2024 net zero leader list, which highlights the 100 US public companies best positioned to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It also follows the announcement earlier this year of CDP awarding us a AAA rating for our disclosure and efforts on climate change, forest, and water security.\nThis recognition reflects our continued focus on our sustainability performance and robust reporting as we continue to work towards a smoke-free future.\nThis brings me to our outlook for 2024.\nFollowing an excellent H1 performance and strong business momentum. As we start the second half, we are raising our full year currency-neutral and US Dollar growth forecast. This is supported by accelerated total volume growth and pricing and reflect the very strong outlook for ZYN. Despite short-term supply constraint and the increasing profitability of IQOS due to operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies, and pricing, we continue to target close to $15 billion in smoke-free net revenue for the year. Taking these factors into account and robust combustible performance, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to a range of +7.5% to +9%.\nIn addition to strong top line growth, the positive smoke-free mix effect, combustible recovery, and further cost efficiency enable LC margin expansion. We are accordingly raising our organic operating income growth forecast to 11% to 13% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free product and combustible and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI all in both corporate organic and dollar terms.\nConsequently, and also factoring a lower forecast net financing cost, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +11% to +13%. This translates into a range of $6.33 to 6.45, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.34 for the year at prevailing rate. The increased currency headwind versus prior guidance is primarily due to the Q2 impact already described, as shown by the increase in our forecast USD EPS growth to +5% to +7%. The underlying strength of our business and proactive mitigating actions have allowed us to more than compensate for this, and we expect to deliver on our objective of strong growth in the latter terms.\nFocusing on the second half in more detail, we expect another strong performance driven by excellent IQOS adjusted IMS growth, the progressive improvement in ZYN volume, and continued positive impact from our actions to drive bottom line growth. For Q3, we forecast a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.77 to $1.82 despite a significant step up in commercial spending and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 at prevailing rates. This is in contrast to a forecast currency tailwind of $0.04 for H2 overall, which enable us to target accelerated US dollar adjusted diluted EPS growth. We include a table of estimated currency impact by quarter in the appendix.\nThis Q3 forecast notably reflects another quarter of dynamic growth with HTU shipment of 34.35 billion units and an acceleration in HTU adjusted IMS growth. Given expectation for a strong full-year profit delivery, we are forecasting operating cash flow of around $2.011 billion, which is at the upper end of our previous forecast range at prevailing exchange rate and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We expect this improvement to more than offset an increase in capital expenditure to around $1.3 to 1.4 billion as we further accelerate ZYN capacity expansion. Last, we continue to target a 0.3 to 0.5 times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation.\nAs of 30 June, we have already improved to a ratio of 3x on a 12-month trailing basis as compared to 3.2x at the end of 2023. This represents good progress towards our target of around 2x. By the end of 2026, we intend to reconsider share repurchase, subject to board approval, once we are within sight of this goal.\nI will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. The powerful combination of strong underlying business momentum and our own proactive steps enable us to generate best-in-class growth across key metrics. Our strategy is delivering on volumes, pricing, cash flow, and dollar earnings despite ongoing currency headwinds. The success of our smoke-free transformation is reflected in our remarkable first half performance with excellent underlying IQOS and ZYN growth. Very robust pricing, positive category mix, and step-up cost efficiencies. This puts us firmly on track for an exceptional 2024 with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Our momentum is broadening across the business with exciting multi-category growth opportunity. To further support the delivery of our 2024-2026 growth targets. We remain highly focused on delivering performance in SG&A, and as shown in H1 2024, we are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds.\nFinally, we are steadfastly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Our growth outlook and strong cash flow generation underpins our capital allocation priorities to reinvest behind our rapidly transforming business alongside our progressive dividend policy.\nThank you. We are now very happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster. One moment for our first question.\nOur first question will come from Gaurav Jain of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi. Good morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nMorning, Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi. So two questions from me. One is, you know, just on the cigarette pricing algorithm that you have. So if I look at your market share gains, clearly quite impressive even excluding modern oral, and if I add that then you are gaining almost 80 basis points share right now per annum. So isn't that level of market share gain excessive? And suggest that you are not monetizing your cigarette business as much as you should be. And that would mean that increase the pricing growth in cigarettes from 7% to 8% to let's say 8% to 10%. Then I have a follow up.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Gaurav, for the question. Look, let's be clear. We can always challenge us on whether we could do even better in terms of price increase. The fact is that we are doing better than what we thought initially. We have this very strong performance: 8.7% price increase for combustibles for H1. I think we all know that the inflationary environment is no longer what it was last year. So obviously this is a very strong performance. Please bear in mind, I said it in my preliminary remarks. But around 3/4 of that is not coming from inflation.\nFrom price increase in country with very high inflation. This 8.7% in Q2 is largely driven by the markets where we are really driving price on a kind of opportunistic basis, building on the strength of our portfolio and making sure that we are ever optimizing the potential for price increase. So you can be absolutely sure that this is a very granular work, market by market. Each time as we signal, we take into account what is our position on smoke-free product on this market, what is the impact of increasing price. And I think we can demonstrate that we have a very successful approach on this price increase. So I would tend to believe that we are optimizing this price increase potential in the current environment.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nSure. Thank you.\nYou know, you mentioned that ZYN capacity will increase to 900 million cans next year. So does it mean that by Q4 of this year it will be 225 million cans per quarter? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook Gurav . I'm confirming that we have the objective to be around 900 million cans of production capacity for next year. That's for the full year 2025. We are gradually improving our capacity, and there is a number of steps that we are taking. I'm not going to elaborate on them, but there are several levers that we are pulling to increase this capacity. So I would say every quarter versus the previous one we are improving the capacity, not going to give a prediction on where we're going to be at the end of the year.\nWe believe, given what we see from the potential consumer demand today, that in terms of what we produce at a certain point in Q4 versus what the consumer of tech could be without restriction, we're going to be good and then we'll see exactly how we finish in terms of capacity at the end of the year. But I think what is more relevant and frankly more important is you have the picture of this 560 to 580 million can. That is our goal for 20 24. You know that we have this capacity for 900 million can for next year. Let's be clear, it's not a guidance on the volume for next year. We're just here giving the capacity on which we are working and I think with that you have what is important.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thank you.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi Emanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nMorning, Bonnie.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning.\nI have a question on your guidance. You raised your top and bottom line growth expectations, but you lowered your HTU shipment volume outlook slightly and you attribute this to slightly greater than expected impact from the EU flavor ban. You did touch on this, but maybe hoping for a little more color on that and any other impact on HTU volume that you're expecting in the back half. Are you expecting IQOS growth to remain robust in Japan in the second half, for instance? Then finally you mentioned your HTU guide assumes no volumes in Taiwan. Maybe an update there in terms of timing.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure, Bonnie. And thank you for maybe giving me the opportunity to further clarify the dynamic and the good dynamic that we are seeing behind IQOS. So we are indeed revising, first of all, our objective of adjusted in-market sales by around $2 billion. I've been clarifying that the majority of that is coming from Taiwan. Okay. So in fact it's really the fact that we were expecting Taiwan to start more than six months this year. And at the end of the day, today we are making here the assumption that at the end of the day it's going to be zero volume in Taiwan. We thought it was a reasonable assumption. Remember the law allowing for heated tobacco product was passed now 15 months ago. So we thought that during this period of time there was this capacity to get the approval from the regulator.\nThere is an administrative process asking questions. You have Q&A. It's just taking much more time than what we thought. But first and foremost, the reason for this $2 billion revision on adjusted IMS is Taiwan. Then, in addition to that, we have this few hundred million that is coming from Europe. So that's really, or you should understand, the $2 billion. And because of Taiwan, we are indeed saying when we were expecting to be above 140 billion sticks in terms of shipments, we are now expecting to be around 140 billion sticks. Again, that's the way you should understand the revision on the guidance. But let me take two minutes to explain the dynamics because I want to make sure that things are very clear. What we've been seeing in H1 is in fact an acceleration of the IQOS business outside Europe.\nSo if you look at the Adjusted In-Market Sales outside Europe and we're talking about 60% of the business, the Adjusted IMS were growing around 14% versus around 13% last year. So we've been growing faster in percentage. So you can imagine in terms of volume, of course that means a significant acceleration. And indeed what is beyond this very nice dynamism is Japan. You have other developed markets such as South Korea. But we've been seeing a number of new contributors to this growth. We mentioned Indonesia, we mentioned a number of markets in the Middle East. Mexico is also accelerating, and we enjoy also nice performance in duty-free. So that's really what we are seeing outside Europe then. Europe, absolutely, as expected. I mean we're going through what is a significant transition.\nYou know, we're moving away from flavor. It's still growing outside Italy. We have adjusted in-market sales growing close to double-digit. So very strong dynamism despite the fact that many of the countries are going through this transition. And as we flagged, it is true that it's really great to see at the same time our champion markets like we mentioned in Portugal, Greece, and Germany, that continue to do very well. We have new markets that are really confirming their status of growth driver for the future. We mentioned Germany, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria. So it's important to have this new growth provider if you want, and then a number of markets exiting. I would say as expected, the turmoil or the disruption I would say of a few weeks that is coming with.\nThe implementation of the flavor ban. Here we can mention Greece, we can mention Romania, we can mention Bulgaria, we can mention Czech Republic. So a number of markets where things are happening absolutely as expected. Then you have Italy where we've been in fact evaluating the level of flavored product available with distributor and with the retail. There was less than what we thought. Therefore the consumption of HTU has been impacted quicker than what we were anticipating by the absence of flavored product after the implementation of the flavor ban. That has had some impact on the growth. At the same time, no doubt that the two accumulating have had some impact.\nWe've been increasing price by $0.30 on our consumable, and that has not been followed or only very marginally by the competition with some impact on our market share. As it happens, you know, when we increase price in a meaningful manner, widening the gap with competition and the competition not following. So that is really the picture. Now when we are looking at the second half, we expect outside Europe situation to continue to do well. I'm not going to.\nIn many of these very great countries where we are performing extremely well. We have the launch of LEVIA and DELIA in a number of countries. We expect Europe to accelerate as we are transitioning out of this phase of adjustment to the flavor ban. Italy will be part of the market where we expect improvement. But I would say globally we expect more acceleration in all the markets that have been going through the flavor ban. So I think this is really the complete picture. Bonnie, I hope it is helpful.\nAnd answering your question.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThat was definitely very helpful.I appreciate you going through all of that. And then if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on ILUMA i in Japan. I guess I was hoping to hear a little more color on this device, which I believe is only available in Japan right now. Curious to hear how big of a lift it's been or essentially how incremental and really what you're seeing or hearing from consumers in terms of acceptance of the new device, impact on your growth margins, et cetera. And then finally your plans for further rollout of this device. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure. Bonnie. So you're right. IQOS ILUMA i, so the latest generation of IQOS ILUMA. So it's not changed the fundamental technology, but the device is offering a number of additional functionalities. It's for the time being only present in Japan. There is the launch in a few other countries that is planned for H2. And it's always difficult to say what this new product is triggering. But we've been seeing clearly a new acquisition of IQOS users. We've been seeing consumer sentiment going up with some very good reaction to this product. So I would say we continue to have more ammunition to convert smokers to IQOS, to improve the experience, to improve customer satisfaction. That is triggering, of course, more loyalty that can have some impact on the average daily consumption. So a number of positive effects. That's what we have seen in Japan.\nDifficult for me to tell you exactly by how much this has been further accelerating the growth in Japan, but no doubt that this was a positive for the market.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you.\nI'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Matt Smith of Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nGood morning, Matt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nGood morning. Could you provide a little more detail on the growth in oral pouches in international markets? You highlighted some early success in several markets. Are you continuing to expand distribution there? Are there any capacity constraints for those international markets outside of the US?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nSo as a coincidence, I suppose. But it is true that in H1 the growth in nicotine pouch outside the US was very similar to the one in the US, no, watch out. We talk about 10% only of the volume in the US that is included. It's not totally nothing because that is including the Nordics. And what we are clearly seeing is that there is from the nicotine user some interest and attraction in many countries. And I tend to really put three buckets of possible growth for these markets. You have, of course, the Nordic country that has the knowledge, the understanding, the culture of this product, and where the nicotine pouch category is dynamic, and here we want to take our fair share of the growth.\nThen you have Europe, where the category is not relevant in all markets, but we can already flag a number of countries such as Austria, UK, Switzerland, where we believe that there is potential and we see the growth. Then you have, I would say, global market, international market. We can name Pakistan, we could name South Africa, we could talk about Indonesia, maybe Philippines, where we see potential for these nicotine pouches. You may have some culture already of oral product, and we see some development of the product. I could add Mexico to the list, by the way, by the way, where we are starting nicely, the development of ZYN. So we see that this product maybe because of the US influence. I think in the case of some country like the UK, it's clear that's a category that could grow its awareness, I would say, interestingly and rapidly.\nWe want absolutely to make sure that we're going to capture our fair share of this opportunity.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. Just a quick follow up. Is there any capacity limitation on that international business or is that.\nCapacity not constrained like what you're seeing in the US?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nNo, there is no capacity issue that I have to report at that stage.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. I'll leave it there.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Faham Baig of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nHi, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question.\nI've got two as well. One on the vapor category and one on ZYN. I know you're looking to expand with your VEEV product, but how do you see the development of the vapor category, particularly outside of the US? What profile of users is the category attracting, for example, in Europe? I'm just trying to understand whether consumers that use vapor see it as an alternative to heated tobacco. Or are the two categories attracting a different profile of consumers, particularly post the flavor ban.\nIn Europe?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nYou want to ask a question on ZYN now, or you want to come back on ZYN after?\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nWhy don't I come back after your episode?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nOkay, so on the vaping category, I think what we are seeing is that what we've always been saying, the vaping category is a legitimate category to be an alternative to people who would otherwise smoke. And therefore that is a category that is growing not necessarily faster than heat-not-burn, not faster than nicotine pouch, for sure. But of course the basis for nicotine pouch is smaller. And we know that the vaping category is more appealing for people legal age and above that want to start consuming nicotine, and it's much more difficult to convert smokers, and that clearly what IQOS and the heat-not-burn category is doing much better. So yes, vaping can be appealing for some legal age and above nicotine user, more difficult to convert smokers.\nVery clearly, we haven't seen any meaningful report of people moving to vaping and the change of kind of dynamic in the category following the implementation of the flavor ban in Europe. Of course, we are monitoring that, but at this time there is nothing that we can obviously report on that trend which probably could confirm that. We talk about people that are probably with different profile, but that's something that we will have to keep monitoring, of course. So we've always been saying that the concern with the vaping category is that if the products are not properly developed and marketed, if there is an unreasonable appeal to flavor, well, that can trigger unintended usage. And that is a problem for the category.\nAnd we are very happy with our growth because we do that in a very responsible manner, both in terms of development of our product, development of our marketing activity, and we are developing this responsible approach very much based on our commercial strength and a great product. I think VEEV ONE is a great product and strong partnership with the trade that is giving this very good start. As we mentioned, the number one position in five countries for closed pods. That's really what I can share with you at that stage.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, that's helpful. Then secondly on ZYN in the US now, according to the scanner data, some of which we received today as well, ZYN's momentum from a volume perspective is sequentially falling, albeit very low single digits. Would you have an estimate of, if you did not have the capacity constraint, what volumes could potentially look like? And in the back half, when you are expecting an acceleration in volumes, is that implying that you begin to gain market share or is that largely driven by further acceleration in the overall category?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, on ZYN, I think we mentioned the fact that we are clearly with some restrictions. So, I'm not sure that what you read in the Nielsen, which corresponds to the availability, is a going view on the trend and the consumer demand. We are gradually improving, and we expect to see that in the coming months. The availability today, we clarify that we are working with a target of around 900 million can capacity for next year. So, we are creating very nice headroom for growth for the coming quarters, and we think it's really important. I'm not going to be able to tell you because frankly it's impossible to say what would have been the growth rate without the limitation.\nPlease bear in mind that there was some competitors' move in terms of pricing last year that trigger an acceleration in our market share, and that the effect is now behind us. So it is also having some impact on the year-on-year comparison. So that's what.\nWe can sell on ZYN.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nIf I could quickly squeeze in one more. Is there any update on the review of the ZYN sales post a recent subpoena in the District of Columbia that is ongoing and force you to close your ZYN.com sales, and when that might recover?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nYes, there is nothing new. We keep working and fully cooperating, of course, with the Attorney General, and at that stage it's impossible to say how long the work will take or what will be the conclusion. There is nothing new today.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThanks Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Owen Bennett of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nMorning, Emmanuel. Hope you're well.\nHi. I just had a couple of questions on the US pouch dynamics. So first, and I would assume this is due to certain retailers trying to fill the supply gaps. I have been seeing some Scandinavian ZYN available in certain stores. So I was wondering how you can get on top of this to make sure that's not happening. And then second, I'm also now seeing other modern oral brands appearing that I assume do not have a PMTA submitted. So how do you see the risk? We could see a similar scenario developing in pouches in the US and to what we're seeing in vape with illegal products. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSo you're alluding to product that would come from non-US market, correct?\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies",
    "content2": "That's what.\nYes. I'm assuming certain retailers and distributors are buying them online from Scandinavia to try and solve the supply gap. I have been just wondering how you can get on top of that to make sure that's not happening.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, I don't have any information about that, so I cannot make any comment or report. I think we are doing everywhere we can our utmost to ensure that the flows are appropriate and not going where they should not be going. We are working very hard with this objective and I, I don't have any data and I cannot react.\nOn that. But our position is very clear. We are very strict on doing everything we can to make sure that these parallel flows are not happening. On your question on if I understand you well, Owen, could we see the same kind of phenomenon on nicotine pouch as the one we are seeing on vaping, which is illicit parallel flow that would be entering the US market?\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nYeah, exactly. I'm starting to see brands that I am assuming do not have the PMTA. Just wondering how you see the risk.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nAround that today from what we can monitor in the market. We are not having the feeling that there is anything material at that stage. But of course we are monitoring that very carefully if it was to become material. I think what we are clearly seeing today is that the authorities take that seriously and they are starting to have much more action and be much more alert on the topic. So I would expect them to have the same behavior when it comes to nicotine pouches. So to summarize, I don't think we're seeing anything meaningful today to be certainly watched and if it was to become the case, we would expect the authority to have the same, I would say proactive behavior that they, I think they are starting to implement on vape.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will come from Callum Elliott.\nOf Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nHi, thank you very much for the question. It's actually a follow up, quite similar question to what you just had from Owen. But I want to push you a bit further because we also, like Owen, see pretty widespread evidence now of European moist versions of ZYN that do not have pre-market approval as far as I'm aware and weren't in the market as of August 2016.\nAre available for sale on a widespread basis across New York City. But also the online form suggests that this has become a pretty widespread issue across the US as a whole. So I guess two questions. Can you just confirm for us that those products weren't in the market at 8 August 2016 and that they are being sold in breach of FDA regulations? And then I guess secondly.\nBuilding upon what Owen asked, presuming that you're not selling illicit product directly to US retailers yourselves.\nWhat can you do and what are you doing to stop European e-commerce retailers selling this product? Because it strikes me that this presents a pretty meaningful potential risk to your US in-market business. If this illicit product continues entering the US market in this way.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Callum. Look again, I don't have any data on what you're saying, so it's very difficult for me to report. I think we know whether the product that benefit from the situation and the positioning on HTU in the market and that therefore are legally being commercialized.\nAs you can imagine, I'm going to repeat only what I said. We are doing everything we can to control the flows. I don't have information today saying that you have these flows of product. If we knew, we would certainly tackle that and we would try to understand where it's coming from. What I can certainly repeat is that our objective is to do our utmost, everything we can to be compliant with the regulation. There is nothing else I can say, really.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nOkay, thank you.\nMaybe just a follow-up, I guess, as you think about.\nBringing supply back online in the US or also bringing new supply online to meet demand, what gives you this confidence that we're going to see the upward lift of ZYN guidance? Today implies a very significant sort of back half hockey stick in terms of positive inflection in the growth rate, which to Faham's earlier question, we see sequential declines in growth now quarter to date. So what gives you the confidence that the consumers who are switching to on!, consumers who are switching to Rogue, some of the consumer reviews for some of these competitive products are sometimes better than for ZYN. So what gives you the confidence that now that consumer awareness for these other brands has grown as a result of your supply chain issues, that you're going to immediately win those consumers back when the supply comes online again?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, Callum, this is obviously coming from a mix of consumer demand perception that we have, and we believe that if we can produce them, there is a space to get to 580 million can shipments. That's the first element, and that's what our sensors are telling us about what consumer would be happy to buy if it was available. At the same time, of course, our measures to increase production capacity, where, as I said, I'm not going to elaborate on the various levers, but we're pulling a number of levers to progressively increase the capacity for ZYN production in the US. So that's really the combination of the two.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you\n\nOperator\n\nThank you.Our last question will be coming from Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question, Emmanuel. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the IQOS ILUMA test that you're planning for the US. It sounds like just a few cities. Will those be sort of diverse geographically across the US and what are some of the learnings that you're hoping to, I think unlock? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nPriya. Well, that's a very broad question, although a very important one of course. So given where we are, I'm going to make a short answer on that one. First of all, we clarify the fact that we go for a scale launch only once we get the PMTA for Illuma. And as I said in my preliminary remarks, we are still today targeting to get this approval in the second half of 2025. Once we are there, then we have the right product to really go broader in the US and at that stage we will have been learning with a number of things that we're going to do between Q4 and the moment where we go with Illuma. And you're asking, okay, what are you going to do differently?\nLet's be clear, we don't believe that IQOS has never been launched in a kind of serious, consistent, and profound manner. We believe that what makes IQOS so popular outside the US is going to resonate with a number of smokers among the around 30 million smokers in the US, so we're going to develop what has been working elsewhere. It will be about, of course, going to the smokers, explaining what IQOS is about, explaining the experience, why IQOS is a better product than smoking. I think it will be, as always, very important to create the image, the brand territory, but also talk about closely with the smokers. Okay. This is a journey to move away from smoking and to go to a better product to IQOS.\nWe will have the same commercial, I would say, machine that has been successful in so many markets with developing our own retail sales point. We will have a strong partnership with a number of independent, and third-party retailers. So we're going to pull all the levers, and something that has not been done in the US because until now it has been only a very limited launch in a few cities with limited action. So everything is going to start at that moment for IQOS, and there won't be any magic. We're going to use what has been working so well elsewhere. Of course, adapting it to the US market.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThat's really helpful, and I guess just a follow on to that is you talked a lot about the development of IQOS outside the US. Maybe broad strokes. How do you think that product could play out in the US and at what point would you think about filing PMTA and then broadening the availability of that in the US? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, for the time being we don't have the plan to file a PMTA on VEEV. We are very much focusing on IQOS. I think that VEEV's success is just at the beginning today. It's great to have already five markets where we are number one on the closed pods system. But it's just the beginning. We're going to keep learning, developing how we can develop a successful profitable business on vaping, and then we will see whether in due course it makes sense to have some thoughts for VEEV in the US, but we are not at that stage today.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you. Just one final, I think, housekeeping item. You talked about your interest expense being at the low end of your prior range, $1.3 billion. Does that reflect, I guess, the issuance you've done to date? And should we anticipate that there wouldn't be any incremental interest expense headwinds, that is, potential scope for any other refinancing or pre financing that you might consider? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nNo, I think the improvement in the estimated financial cost for the year is reflecting a better situation on, first of all, the level of the debt with the cash flow generation, second, with how we are financing the group. And that is coming with this. You said it. I mean, we are in the low end of the initial bracket, and I don't think you should expect some kind of revolution in the way we are financing the company. Nothing on the agenda.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you.\nAppreciate that.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to hand the call back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThat concludes our call today.\nThank you for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the PMI investor relations team. Thank you again and have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Over to you, Emmanuel.\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. Our business delivered another outstanding performance in the second quarter of 2024. Our categories were strong across the board to deliver a record H1 2024 on organic top line growth and on organic operating income growth excluding the pandemic recovery year of 2021. The strong underlying momentum of IQOS continued in Q2 with shipment and adjusted in-market sales volume growth above or in line with our expectations. This reflects another quarter of strong progress in Japan and robust fundamentals in Europe. Despite the volatility of the Characterizing Flavor Ban.\nWith pricing, manufacturing efficiency, and scale benefit. The expanding profit contribution of IQOS is driving excellent growth for PMI. ZYN continued its impressive growth trajectory with Q2 US volumes growing by over 50% despite recent supply tensions, and increased pricing. In addition to IQOS and US ZYN, I am pleased to report building multi-category momentum while still early days. VEEV has already become the closed pod leader in five European markets and is firmly on the path to profitability while international nicotine pouch volumes grew over 60% in H1, matching US growth rates. This progress of smoke-free product is reflected in a rapidly growing consumer base with around 36.5 million estimated adult users as of 30 June and our products now available across 90 markets worldwide.\nOur combustible business also over delivered with a return to gross margin expansion ahead of plan in Q2 after two years of significant inflationary headwinds. This was driven by stable H1 volumes and category share despite robust pricing in addition to cost efficiencies.\nThis broad-based delivery translated into double-digit organic operating income growth with significant margin expansion. As we have outlined previously, delivering robust growth in dollar terms is a key priority, and we are taking proactive steps on pricing and cost efficiency to mitigate currency headwinds. This is clearly evident in our H1 adjusted diluted earnings per share delivery of mid-single-digit growth despite a currency headwind of over 12%, as essentially all of the expected full-year impact fell in the first half.\nFollowing this exceptional first half performance, we are increasing our 2024 full-year forecast on all organic dimensions and for Adjusted Diluted EPS on both a currency-neutral and US dollar basis. This reflects our strong H2 outlook with accelerating adjusted IMS growth for IQOS, sequentially higher ZYN volumes, and a step-up rate of USD EPS growth at prevailing exchange rate.\nLooking at our headline financials, strong total shipment volume growth of +2.8% drove Q2 organic net revenue growth of 9.6% or +5.6% in dollar terms. Robust top line growth, positive smoke-free margin mix, and ongoing cost efficiencies enable us to deliver Adjusted Diluted EPS of $1.59. This represents 10.6% growth excluding a larger than expected unfavorable currency variance of $0.18, which includes a small transactional impact from exchange rate volatility at quarter end. This better than expected ex-currency performance reflect the improving profitability of IQOS, ZYN, and combustibles, which I will come back to.\nLooking now at the first half. Overall, our volumes grew by ±3.2% and organic net revenue by ±10.2%, our highest growth since the 2008 spin. Strong performance from both smoke-free and combustibles drove operating income growth of ±17% with margin expansion of 230 basis points organically and ±7.1% growth in dollar terms. We expect continued robust OI growth on both a reported and an organic basis in the second half.\nH1 Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an impressive 16.8% in constant currency and by +4% in dollar terms. The $0.38 unfavorable H1 currency variance includes $0.08 of non-recurring transactional impact from Egypt and Russia.\nFocusing now on volume, total shipment growth in both the quarter and H1 overall reflects smoke-free share gains in a resilient international industry, which grew by more than 1% in both periods. Even excluding oral and e-vapor.\nQ2 HTU shipments of 35.5 billion units exceeded our prior outlook, notably driven by continued strong performance in Japan, robust underlying growth in Europe, and promising growth in newer markets such as Indonesia. In addition to underlying momentum, Q2 saw an incremental phasing impact of around 0.5 billion units primarily related to Red Sea disruption.\nQ2 HTU adjusted IMS volume grew by +10.2% in line with our expectation. This includes the impact of the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, most notably in Italy, this quarter total smoke-free adjusted in-market sales volume grew +11.2% in Q2 and +13.1% in H1. This includes our overall smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with Q2 pouch unit volumes up by 20%.\nUS ZYN shipment grew by 50% to 35.1 million cans.\nThis does not include the promising result of our e-vapor business where volumes grew strongly to the equivalent of 0.7 billion units on a year-to-date basis. Cigarette shipment grew by +0.4% with notable positive contribution from Turkey and North Africa. This reflects a stable category share excluding market mix despite step up pricing. With such a positive H1 volume performance, we are raising our full year forecast for total cigarette, HTU, and all unit volumes to +1% to 2%, which would mark our fourth consecutive year of volume growth.\nThe power of our multi-category smoke-free transformation and recovery in combustibles are clearly illustrated on this slide as both areas contributed strongly to double-digit organic OI growth of 12.5% for the group in Q2. Smoke-free continued its excellent momentum with 18% organic growth in net revenue and 22% in gross profit driving 220 basis points organic gross margin expansion. This reflects the strong performance of ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS including manufacturing productivities and an increasing albeit smaller contribution from VEEV. Expanding smoke-free gross margin continue to widen the gap versus combustibles gross margin enhancing the very positive mix effect of our transformation. However, combustibles gross margin expansion is also a key objective.\nAfter seven quarters of contraction, we are very pleased to report 50 basis points expansion and gross profit growth of 5.5% on an organic basis, providing a meaningful contribution to total PMI profitability. This reflects resilient volume despite very strong pricing, in addition to ongoing efficiencies and reduced headwinds on our COGS, notwithstanding continued tobacco leaf inflation. We also expect combustible gross margin expansion in H2.\nCombined with a very strong first quarter. The year-to-date picture is even more compelling with double-digit organic net revenue, gross profit, and OI growth. This is driven by the same dynamic as Q2 with an impressive 390-basis-point gross margin expansion and +29% gross profit growth for our smoke-free business.\nOur H1 revenue performance again demonstrates the powerful drivers of our financial model with an unparalleled combination of positive volumes, robust pricing, and the very favorable category mix of our smoke-free products. As mentioned, volume grew by 3.2%, pricing contributed plus 6 points of growth, including 8.3% pricing on combustibles and around 2% on smoke-free.\nSmoke-free category mix added plus 2.5 points to the top line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and ZYN. While still small, VEEV also contributed positively to the overall mix. I also note that all smoke-free product added plus 2 points to organic net revenue progression, underlying the continued accretion from the Swedish Match acquisition.\nAs in recent quarters, geographic mix was negative. This is primarily due to combustibles where volumes increasingly skew to lower margin markets where smoke-free alternatives are small or not available. With higher margin markets over-indexed to cannibalization, we expect this dynamic to be less impactful in 2024 than last year.\nNow let's focus on the mechanics behind our H1 margin delivery. Gross margin increased organically by 140 basis points and by 80 basis points in dollar terms. This was driven by our higher margin smoke-free business pricing and ongoing productivity savings across the value chain. As expected, SG&A cost growth stepped up in Q2, increasing 9.8% organically after a very modest increment in Q1 due to planned phasing of commercial spend. The resulting 5.8% organic increase in H1 was below the rate of top-line growth driving +1 percentage point of margin expansion. With our successful back-office program able to mitigate some of the investment step-up with a range of important commercial activities in Q3, we expect SG&A to remain elevated but continue to target an organic increase below the rate of net revenue growth for the year.\nI am pleased to report we delivered over $300 million in H1 gross cost efficiency across both COGS and SG&A. As we proactively drive bottom line growth, we expect an acceleration in H2 savings, notably from manufacturing, as we progress towards our $2 billion target for 2024-2026 period.\nThe combination of these factors drove a 230 basis points expansion in our organic operating income margin. Despite a significant H1-skewed currency headwind, adjusted OI margin were stable on a dollar basis.\nMoving to our smoke-free business, we estimate there were 36.5 million adult users of PMI smoke-free product as of 30 June, reflecting an additional 3.2 million during H1. This includes an estimated 30.8 million IQOS users, 5.2 million ZYN users, and 0.8 million VEEV users. The increase in both total and IQOS users was broad-based with notable progress in Japan, Europe, and newer growth markets such as Indonesia. In addition to ZYN's strong traction with legal-age nicotine users in the US, our smoke-free products are now present in 19 markets following recent launches of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV.\nFocusing now on IQOS in Europe where fundamental dynamics are developing very well, including the user growth I just mentioned. First, we see robust recoveries in markets where the Characterizing Flavor Ban has passed the initial adjustment phase. Second, there is continued excellent growth in markets where IQOS is already well established such as Portugal, Hungary, and Greece. Last, new growth leader markets are emerging with accelerating momentum in Germany, Spain, Bulgaria, and Romania in addition to a recovery in Poland following the launch of DELIA.\nOur Q2 HTU share increased by 0.8 points year on year despite the impact of the flavor ban due to the usual seasonal factors and a resilient combustibles market. Q2 share was sequentially below Q1 HTU. Adjusted IMS volume demonstrated robust growth, growing by 0.8 billion units sequentially to reach 12.9 billion on the four-quarter moving average. As expected, Adjusted In-Market Sales growth of 6.8% was slower than in Q1 due to higher comparison and the initial impact of the Characterizing Flavor Ban, notably in Italy. Growth excluding Italy was close to 10%.\nThe impact of the ban is progressing in line with our prior estimate in the majority of market, though the implementation in Italy during Q2 was slightly more pronounced than anticipated. This was primarily driven by earlier sell through of affected SKUs and concurrent pricing. It is important to note this is a transitory dynamic and I'm pleased to report a recovery in markets such as Greece, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Romania where the ban was implemented previously following an initial period of consumer adjustment. Indeed, despite an uncertain outlook in Ukraine, we anticipate an acceleration in Europe adjusted IMS growth in the second half. This is supported by the planned step up in commercial activity behind IQOS including the introduction of DELIA and LEVIA HTUs to an increasing number of markets.\nAnother illustration of our continued progress in Europe is in our key cities, the category share strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoption such as Budapest, Bucharest, Bratislava, Lisbon, and Sofia, and historically slower growth markets such as Madrid, London, and Amsterdam highlight the enduring growth potential in the region.\nJapan demonstrated impressive IQOS growth in the quarter with adjusted HTU IMS growth of 12.5%, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit progression. Adjusted IMS volumes continued to grow sequentially, reaching 10.5 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. Total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by 3.1 points year-on-year to 29.4%, with national offtake share exceeding the impressive milestone of 30% in June.\nWe also maintain offtake share of over 35% in Tokyo despite seasonal factors, where the overall category continue to track at over 50% of total offtake and grow sequentially, demonstrating the continued potential in this important market.\nOur continuous innovation is a key driver of this growth, with Q2 seeing a strong step up in user acquisition following the launch of ILUMA i and further innovative TEREA variants such as Capsule consumables.\nTaking a more global view, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across a broad range of geographies including low and middle income market as highlighted by key category shares. Accelerating growth in Indonesia, the world's largest cigarette market by volume excluding China lead the way with increasing geographic reach and clove HTU innovation.\nMarkets across North Africa and the Middle East are also a growing weight and source of growth. We show Saudi Arabia, Lebanon, Morocco, and Tunisia here in addition to Egypt where performance in Cairo remains robust despite recent pricing and a recovery in the combustible market. I am also pleased to report very good progress in the UAE and Jordan following the recent launch of ILUMA. Growth in Mexico City is very promising and the East Asian market of South Korea and Malaysia continue to perform well. Also worth highlighting is a successful contribution of duty-free where we are increasingly leveraging our multi-category portfolio to expand share in a growing market as travel recovers in Asia.\nOur fundamental HTU growth outlook for the year has not changed. H1 adjusted IMS growth of 11.4% reflect the strong dynamic I described across Japan, Europe, and global markets, partly offset by the transitory impact of the EU flavor ban. Indeed, growth excluding Europe accelerated compared to the last year and we expect this to continue.\nHowever, we see an incremental headwind of around 2 billion units to our full year adjusted IMS forecast, the majority of which is driven by the ongoing delay in approval for commercialization in Taiwan, which was previously expected around the midpoint of the year. We also factor in an impact of a few hundred million units for a slower recovery from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe, principally in Italy. I would note that our revised full year forecast for adjusted IMS growth of around 13% represents the same absolute volume increase as 2023 despite the EU headwinds. We accordingly forecast full year HTU shipment volume of around 140 billion units, with shipments, as usual, expected to be a few billion units higher than adjusted IMS given continued offtake and user growth.\nImportantly, we expect very strong H2 delivery in adjusted IMS on both a sequential and year on year basis to between 14% and 15% growth. This is supported by a notable step up in commercial activity, continued momentum in Japan, and increasingly dynamic global market. This includes the market I just mentioned and the ongoing acceleration in duty-free for Europe. A broadening of growth through acceleration in Germany, Spain, the UK, and Romania adds to the ongoing momentum in geographies such as Portugal and Greece. H2 should also see several markets start to rebound from initial flavor ban impact, including a gradual recovery in Italy.\nTurning now to ZYN where very good US progress continued in Q2 with close to plus 70% growth in 12 months rolling shipments. As we shared earlier in the year, strong demand dynamics have created short-term supply chain constraint which has impacted volume growth as shown on this slide. This has resulted in a temporary slowdown of the category. ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity remain strong within maintaining very robust category volume and value share. Despite these availability challenges and the recent price increase, we also remain highly focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use.\nWe are making good progress on expanding production and continue to expect a gradual improvement through Q3 with sequentially higher volume, and for production volumes to meet expected consumer demand during the course of Q4. We expect the ongoing expansion of the existing facility in Kentucky to provide around 900 million cans of capacity for 2025. We also recently announced a planned investment in a new plant in Colorado, which is due to begin preliminary operation by the end of next year. Together, these plans support our US ZYN growth ambitions for the coming years.\nFor 2024 we are now forecasting a US shipment range of 560 to 580 million cans to reflect strongly increasing demand from adult nicotine users and the progress made on increasing our production capacity.\nI will now take a moment to update you on the international expansion of our smoke-free business. Our multi-category approach is gaining momentum as we unlock new horizons of growth with the increasing commercialization of IQOS, ZYN, and VEEV across markets. Our focus strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results. In Europe, closed pods are accelerating within the dynamic e-vapor category. We are seeing strong traction of our VEEV ONE product, achieving a number one closed pod position in five markets within the first year of launch, including Italy, the Czech Republic, and Romania.\nWe continue to observe good repeat purchase and conversion rate, which is often a challenge for this category. We expect continued volume momentum in H2 supported by ongoing geographic expansion and to reach profitability in Q3. For ZYN, there is a large opportunity outside of the US, which we are working to capture. Our international nicotine pouch volume, including the Nordics, grew by over 60% in H1, matching us in growth. We see promising results in a number of markets including Mexico, South Africa, Pakistan, and the important UK market where we have seen strong traction with only limited distribution so far. Our expansion of the IQOS portfolio remains active as we innovate to broaden and enhance our offer for both existing users and switching adult smokers.\nFurther market launches are planned in H2 including DELIA and LEVIA, HTUs and the new ILUMA i device range which is currently only available in Japan.\nWe also continue with our preparation for IQOS ILUMA in the US and we are underway with consumer engagement for our first city pilot in Austin, Texas with the IQOS 3 system which we expect to start in Q4. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and focused on direct activation of select legal-age smokers in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose is to fine-tune our approach and readiness. In anticipation of the IQOS launch of ILUMA, we continue to assume an authorization from the FDA in the second half of 2025.\nFocusing now on combustibles, our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth and a very positive profit contribution. As I covered earlier, this reflects resilient volume despite very strong Q2 pricing of +8.7% including our proactive action to maximize growth. It is worth noting the large majority of our pricing is derived from regular pricing action unrelated to significant currency devaluation. Factoring a strong H1 and favorable outlook, we now forecast an increased fully combustible price variance of 7% to 8%. Our cigarette category share was stable in H1 and down 0.2 points in Q2 or stable excluding market mix impact. Lower share in Egypt and Indonesia was offset by positive contribution from Turkey, India, and the Europe region. Again, despite strong pricing, our global brand grew category share in the quarter with Marlboro gaining 0.3 points to 10.1%.\nOn a global basis, our leadership in combustibles is a critical enabler to maximize switching to smoke-free products, and we target a stable category share over time. As mentioned previously, we evaluate our strategy on a market-by-market basis and have the flexibility to adapt our approach where smoke-free products have already reached critical mass.\nTaking a more holistic view on the business. Our transformation and smokefree journey are backed by a strategy that seeks to embed sustainability in all that we do. We are making strong progress towards our product transformation targets. Our smokefree products are now available in 90 markets, placing us on track for our aspiration of 100 by 2025. We are also moving nicely towards our objective for low and middle income countries to comprise over 50% of smokefree product market. The rapid growth of our estimated SFP user base, which now stands at around 36.5 million adult users as previously described, is further testament to this progress.\nWith regard to our operation, decarbonization is an important focus area, and we are very pleased to have been awarded the top spot on the Forbes 2024 net zero leader list, which highlights the 100 US public companies best positioned to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. It also follows the announcement earlier this year of CDP awarding us a AAA rating for our disclosure and efforts on climate change, forest, and water security.\nThis recognition reflects our continued focus on our sustainability performance and robust reporting as we continue to work towards a smoke-free future.\nThis brings me to our outlook for 2024.\nFollowing an excellent H1 performance and strong business momentum. As we start the second half, we are raising our full-year currency-neutral and US dollar growth forecast. This is supported by accelerated total volume growth and pricing, and reflects the very strong outlook for ZYN. Despite short-term supply constraints and the increasing profitability of IQOS due to operating leverage, manufacturing efficiencies, and pricing, we continue to target close to $15 billion in smoke-free net revenue for the year. Taking these factors into account and robust combustibles performance, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to a range of 7.5% to 9%.\nIn addition to strong top line growth, the positive smoke-free mix effect, combustible recovery, and further cost efficiency enable LC margin expansion. We are accordingly raising our organic operating income growth forecast to 11% to 13% for the year. We continue to target adjusted gross margin expansion for both smoke-free product and combustible, and adjusted OI margin expansion for total PMI all in both organic and dollar terms.\nConsequently, and also factoring a lower forecast net financing cost, we are raising our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +11% to 13%. This translates into a range of $6.33 to 6.45, including an unfavorable currency impact, 34 cents, for the year at prevailing rate. The increased currency headwind versus prior guidance is primarily due to the Q2 impact already described, as shown by the increase in our forecast USD EPS growth to +5% to +7%. The underlying strength of our business and proactive mitigating actions have allowed us to more than compensate for this, and we expect to deliver on our objective of strong growth in dollar terms.\nFocusing on the second half in more detail, we expect another strong performance driven by excellent IQOS adjusted IMS growth, the progressive improvement in ZYN volume, and continued positive impact from our actions to drive bottom line growth. For Q3, we forecast a record high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.77 to 1.82 despite a significant step up in commercial spending and an unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 at prevailing rates. This is in contrast to a forecast currency tailwind of $0.04 for H2 overall, which enable us to target accelerated US dollar adjusted diluted EPS growth. We include a table of estimated currency impact by quarter in the appendix.\nThis Q3 forecast notably reflects another quarter of dynamic growth with HTU shipment of 34.35 billion units and an acceleration in HTU adjusted IMS growth. Given expectation for a strong full-year profit delivery, we are forecasting operating cash flow of around $11 billion, which is at the upper end of our previous forecast range at prevailing exchange rate and subject to year-end working capital requirement. We expect this improvement to more than offset an increase in capital expenditure to around $1.3 to $1.4 billion as we further accelerate ZYN capacity expansion. Last, we continue to target a 0.3 to 0.5 times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024, driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation.\nAs of 30 June, we have already improved to a ratio of 3x on a 12-month trading basis as compared to 3.2x at the end of 2023. This represents good progress towards our target of around 2x by the end of 2026. We intend to reconsider share repurchase and, subject to board approval, once we are within sight of this goal.\nI will now conclude today's presentation with some closing remarks. The powerful combination of strong underlying business momentum and our own proactive steps enable us to generate best-in-class growth across key metrics. Our strategy is delivering on volumes, pricing, cash flow, and dollar earnings despite ongoing currency headwinds. The success of our smoke-free transformation is reflected in our remarkable first half performance with excellent underlying IQOS and HTU growth, very robust pricing, positive category mix, and step-up cost efficiencies. This puts us firmly on track for an exceptional 2024 with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Our momentum is broadening across the business with exciting multi-category growth opportunity. To further support the delivery of our 2024-2026 growth targets. We remain highly focused on delivering performance in SG&A, and as shown in H1, we are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds.\nFinally, we are steadfastly committed to returning cash to our shareholders. Our growth outlook and strong cash flow generation underpins our capital allocation priorities to reinvest behind our rapidly transforming business alongside our progressive dividend policy.\nThank you and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, if you'd like to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone. To withdraw your question, please press star one one. Again, please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster. And one moment for our first question.\nOur first question will come from Gaurav Jain of Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi, good morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nMorning Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi. So two questions from me. One is, you know, just on the cigarette pricing algorithm that you have. So if I look at your market share gains, clearly quite impressive even excluding modern overall, and if I add that then you are gaining almost 80 basis points share right now per annum. So isn't that level of market share gain excessive? And suggest that you are not monetizing your cigarette business as much as you should be. And that would mean that increase the pricing growth in cigarettes from 7% to 8%, to let's say 8% to 10%. And then I have a follow up.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Gaurav, for the question. Look, let's be clear. We can always challenge us on whether we could do even better in terms of price increase. The fact is that we are doing better than what we thought initially. We have this very strong performance. 8.7% price increase for combustibles for H1. I think we all know that the inflationary environment is no longer what it was last year. So obviously this is a very strong performance. Please bear in mind I said it in my preliminary remarks. But around three, four of that is not coming from inflation.\nFrom price increase in country with very high inflation. This 8.7% in Q2 is largely driven by the markets where we are really driving price on a kind of opportunistic basis, building on the strength of our portfolio and making sure that we are ever optimizing the potential for price increase. So you can be absolutely sure that this is a very granular work, market by market. Each time as we signal, we take into account what is our position on smoke free product on this market, what is the impact of increasing price. And I think we can demonstrate that we have a very successful approach on this price increase. So I would tend to believe that we are optimizing this price increase potential in the current environment.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nSure. Thank you.\nYou mentioned that ZYN capacity will increase to 900 million tons next year. So does it mean that by Q4 of this year it will be 225 million cans per quarter?\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook Gurav. Sir, I'm confirming that we have the objective to be around 900 million cans of production capacity for next year. That's for the full year 2025. We are gradually improving our capacity, and there is a number of steps that we are taking. I'm not going to elaborate on them, but there are several levers that we are pulling to increase this capacity. So I would say every quarter versus the previous one, we are improving the capacity. I'm not going to give a prediction on where we're going to be at the end of the year.\nWe believe, given what we see from the potential consumer demand today, that in terms of what we produce at a certain point in Q4 versus what the consumer uptake could be without restriction, we're going to be good, and then we'll see exactly how we finish in terms of capacity at the end of the year. But I think what is more relevant and frankly more important is you have the picture of this 560 to 580 million cans. That is our goal for 2024. You know that we have this capacity for 900 million cans for next year. Let's be clear, it's not a guidance on the volume for next year. We're just here giving the capacity on which we are working. I think with that you have what is important.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nHead of EU SMID, EU packaging, and Global Tobacco and Cannabis, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Bonnie Herzog of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Thank you.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi Emanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nGood morning.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI had a question on your guidance. You raised your top and bottom line growth expectations but you lowered your HTU shipment volume outlook slightly and you attribute this to slightly greater than expected impact from the EU flavor ban. And you did touch on this, but maybe hoping for a little more color on that and any other impact on HTU volume that you're expecting in the back half. Are you expecting IQOS's growth to remain robust in Japan in the second half, for instance? And then finally you mentioned your HTU guide assumes no volumes in Taiwan. So maybe an update there in terms of timing.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc",
    "content3": "Sure, Bonnie, and thank you for maybe giving me the opportunity to further clarify the dynamic and the good dynamic that we are seeing behind IQOS. We are indeed revising first of all our objective of adjusted in-market sales by around $2 billion. I've been clarifying that the majority of that is coming from Taiwan. Okay. So in fact it's really the fact that we were expecting Taiwan to start more than six months this year. And at the end of the day today we are making here the assumption that at the end of the day it's going to be zero volume in Taiwan. We thought it was a reasonable assumption. Remember the law allowing for heated tobacco product was passed now 15 months ago.\nSo we thought that during this period of time there was this capacity to get the approval from the regulator, and there is an administrative process asking questions. You have Q and A. It's just taking much more time than what we thought. But first and foremost, the reason for this $2 billion revision on adjusted IMS is Taiwan. Then, in addition to that, we have this, a few hundred million, that is coming from Europe. So that's really all you should understand, the $2 billion. And because of Taiwan, we are indeed saying when we were expecting to be above 140 billion sticks in terms of shipments, we are now expecting to be around 140 billion sticks. Again, that's the way you should understand the revision on the guidance.\nBut let me take two minutes to explain the dynamic because I want to make sure that things are very clear. What we've been seeing in H1 is in fact an acceleration of the IQOS business outside Europe. So if you look at the adjusted in-market sales outside Europe and we're talking about 60% of the business, the adjusted IMS were growing around 14% versus around 13% last year. So we've been growing faster in percentage. So you can imagine in terms of volume, of course that means a significant acceleration. And indeed what is beyond this very nice dynamism is Japan. You have other developed markets such as South Korea. But we've been seeing a number of new contributor to this growth. We mentioned Indonesia, we mentioned a number of markets in Middle East. Mexico is also accelerating and we enjoy also a nice performance in duty-free.\nSo that's really what we are seeing outside Europe then. Europe, absolutely, as expected. I mean, we're going through what is a significant transition. You know, we're moving away from flavor. It's still growing outside Italy. We have adjusted in-market sales growing close to double-digit. So very strong in ASEAN despite the fact that many of the countries are going through this transition. And as we flagged, it is true that it's really great to see at the same time our champion markets like we mentioned in Portugal, Greece, and Hungary that continue to do very well. We have new markets that are really confirming their status of growth driver for the future. We mentioned Germany, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria. So it's important to have this new growth provider if you want and then a number of markets exiting.\nI would say as expected the turmoil or the disruption, I would say, of a few weeks that is coming with the implementation of the flavor ban. And here we can mention Greece, we can mention Romania, we can mention Bulgaria, we can mention Czech Republic. So a number of markets where things are happening absolutely as expected. And then you have Italy where we've been in fact not evaluating where the level of flavored product available with distributor and with the retail, and there was less than what we thought. And therefore the consumer of tech has been impacted quicker than what we were anticipating by the absence of flavor product after the implementation of the flavor ban. And that has had some impact on the growth, and at the same time, no doubt that the two cumulating had some impact.\nWe've been increasing price by $0.30 on our consumable, and that has not been followed or only very marginally by the competition with some impact on our market share. As it happens when we increase price in a meaningful manner, widening the gap with competition and the competition not following. So that is really the picture. Now when we are looking at the second half, so we expect outside Europe situation to continue to do well. I'm not going to.\nNamely all these very great countries where we are performing extremely well. We have the launch of LEVIA and DELIA in a number of countries, and we expect Europe to accelerate as we are transitioning out of this phase of adjustment to the flavor ban. Italy will be part of the market where we expect improvement. But I would say globally we expect more acceleration in all the markets that have been going through the flavor ban. So I think this is really the complete picture. Bonnie, I hope it is helpful and.Answering your question,\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nthat was definitely very helpful. I appreciate you going through all of that. And then, if I may, I just wanted to ask a question on ILUMA i in Japan. I guess I was hoping to hear a little more color on this device, which I believe is only available in Japan right now. And curious to hear how big of a lift it's been or essentially how incremental and really what you're seeing or hearing from consumers in terms of acceptance of the new device, impact on your growth margins, et cetera, and then finally your plans for further rollout of this device. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure. Bonnie. So you're right. IQOS ILUMA i. So the latest generation of IQOS ILUMA. So it's not changed the fundamental technology, but the device is offering a number of additional functionalities. It's for the time being only present in Japan. There is the launch in a few other countries that is planned for H2. And it's always difficult to say what this new product is triggering, but we've been seeing clearly a new acquisition of IQOS users. We've been seeing consumer sentiment going up with some very good reaction to this product. So I would say we continue to have more ammunition to convert smokers to IQOS, to improve the experience, to improve customer satisfaction. That is triggering, of course, more loyalty that can have some impact on the average daily consumption. So a number of positive effects. That's what we have seen in Japan.\nDifficult for me to tell you exactly by how much this has been further accelerating the growth in Japan, but no doubt that this was a positive for the market.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question. Our next question will be coming from Matt Smith, Stifel. Your line is open.\nMatt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, Emmanuel.\nGood morning. Could you provide a little more detail on the growth in oral pouches in international markets? You highlighted some early success in several markets. Are you continuing to expand distribution there? Are there any capacity constraints for those international markets outside of the US?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nSo as a coincidence, I suppose. But it is true that in H1, the growth in nicotine pouch outside the US was very similar to the one in the US. No, you know, watch out. It's, you know, we talk about 10% only of the volume in the US that is included. It's not totally nothing because that is including the Nordics. And what we are clearly seeing is that there is from the nicotine user some interest and attraction in many countries. And I tend to really put three buckets of possible growth for these markets. You have, of course, the Nordic country that has the knowledge, the understanding, the culture of this product and where the nicotine pouch category is dynamic, and here we want to take our fair share of the growth. Then you have Europe, where the category is not relevant in all markets.\nBut we can already flag a number of countries such as Austria, the UK, Switzerland, where we believe that there is potential and we see the growth. And then you have, I would say, global market, international market. We could name Pakistan, we could name South Africa, we could talk about Indonesia, maybe Philippines, where we see potential for these nicotine pouches. You may have some culture already of overall product and we see some development of the product. I could add Mexico to the list, by the way, where we are starting nicely, the development of ZYN. So we see that this product may be because of the US influence. I think in the case of some countries like the UK, it's clear that's a category that could grow its awareness, I would say, interestingly and rapidly.\nWe want absolutely to make sure that we're going to capture our fair share of this opportunity.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. Just a quick follow up. Is there any capacity limitation on the international business or is that?\nCapacity not constrained like what you're seeing in the.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nUS, no, there is no capacity issue that I have to report at that stage.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. I'll leave it there.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Faham Baig of UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nHi, Emmanuel. Thanks for the question.\nI've got two as well. One on the vapor category and one on ZYN. I know you're looking to expand with your VEEV product, but how do you see the development of the vapor category, particularly outside of the U.S., what profile of users is the category attracting, for example, in Europe? I'm just trying to understand whether consumers that use vapor see it as an alternative to heated tobacco. Or are the two categories attracting a different profile of consumers, particularly post the flavor ban in Europe?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nYou want to ask a question on ZYN now or you want to come back on ZYN after?\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nWhy don't I come back after? You're also on vaping.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nOkay.\nSo on the vaping category, I think what we are seeing is that what we've always been saying, the vaping category is a legitimate category to be an alternative to people who would otherwise smoke. And therefore that is a category that is growing not necessarily faster than heat-not-burn, not faster than nicotine pouch, for sure. But of course the basis for nicotine pouch is smaller. And we know that the vaping category is more appealing for people of legal age and above that want to start consuming nicotine. And it's much more difficult to convert smokers, and that's clearly what IQOS and the heat-not-burn category is doing much better. So yes, vaping can be appealing for some of legal age and above nicotine users, more difficult to convert smokers.\nVery clearly, we haven't seen any meaningful report of people moving to vaping and a change of kind of dynamic in the category following the implementation of the flavor ban in Europe. Of course, we are monitoring that, but at that time there is nothing that we can obviously report on that trend which probably could confirm that. We talk about people that are probably with different profile, but that's something that we will have to keep monitoring, of course. So we've always been saying that the concern with the vaping category is that if the products are not properly developed and marketed, if there is an unreasonable appeal to flavor, well, that can trigger unintended usage and that is a problem for the category.\nWe are very happy with our growth because we do that in a very responsible manner both in terms of development of our product, development of our marketing activity, and we are developing this responsible approach very much based on our commercial strength and a great product. I think VEEV ONE is a great product and strong partnership with the trade that is giving this very good start. As we mentioned, the number one position in five countries, four closed spots. That's really what I can share with you at that stage.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nYeah, that's helpful. And then secondly on ZYN in the U.S. now, according to the scanner data, some of which we received today as well, ZYN's momentum from a volume perspective is sequentially falling, albeit very low single digits. Would you have an estimate of if you did not have the capacity constraint, what volumes could potentially look like? And in the back half when you are expecting an acceleration in volumes, is that implying that you begin to gain market share or is that largely driven by further acceleration in the overall category?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook at ZYN, I think we mentioned the fact that we are clearly with some restrictions. So I'm not sure that what you read in the Nielsen, which corresponds with your availability, is a good indicator of the trend and the consumer demand. We are gradually improving, and we expect to see that in the coming months. The availability. Today we clarify that we are working with a target of around 900 million can capacity for next year. So we are creating very nice headroom for growth for the coming quarters, and we think it's really important. I'm not going to be able to tell you because frankly it's impossible to say what would have been the growth rate without the limitation.\nPlease bear in mind that there was some competitors' move in terms of pricing last year that triggered an acceleration in our market share, and that the effect is now behind us. It is also having some impact on the year-on-year comparison. That's what.\nWe can say on ZYN.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nIf I could quickly squeeze in one more. Is there any update on the review of the ZYN sales post a recent subpoena in the District of Columbia that that is ongoing and force you to close your ZYN.com sales, and when that might recover?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nYes, there is nothing new. We keep working and fully cooperating, of course, with the Attorney General. And at that stage it's impossible to say how long the work will take or what will be the conclusion. And there is nothing new today.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, UBS\n\nThanks, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will be coming from Owen Bennett of Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nMorning, Emmanuel. Hope you're well.\nHi. I just had a couple of questions on the US pouch dynamics. So first, and I would assume this is due to certain retailers trying to fill the supply gaps, I have been seeing some Scandinavian ZYN available in certain stores. So I was wondering how you can get on top of this to make sure that's not happening. And then second, I'm also now seeing other modern oral brands appearing that I assume do not have a PMTA submitted. So how do you see the risk we could see a similar scenario developing in pouches in the US and to what we're seeing in vape with illegal products? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSo, you're alluding to product that would come from non-US market, correct? That's what. Yes.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nI'm assuming certain retailers and distributors are buying them online from Scandinavia to try and fill the supply gap. So I have been wondering how you can get on top of that to make sure that's not happening.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, I don't have any information about that, so I cannot make any comment or report. I think we are doing everywhere we can our utmost to ensure that the flows are appropriate and not going where they should not be going. We are working very hard with this objective. I don't have any data and I cannot react.\nOn that. But our position is very clear. We are very strict on doing everything we can to make sure that these parallel flows are not happening. On your question on if I understand you well, when could we see the same kind of phenomenon on nicotine pouch as the one we are seeing on vaping, which is illicit parallel flow that would be entering the US market?\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nYeah, at least I'm trying to see brands that I am assuming do not have emtx. Just wondering how you see the risk.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nAround that today from what we can monitor in the market, we are not having the feeling that there is anything material at that stage. But of course we are monitoring that very carefully if it was to become material. I think what we are clearly seeing today is that the authorities take that seriously and they are starting to have much more action and be much more alert on the topic. So I would expect them to have the same behavior when it comes to nicotine pouches. So to summarize, I don't think we're seeing anything meaningful today to be certainly watched. And if it was to become the case, we would expect the authority to have the same, I would say proactive behavior that they, I think they are starting to implement on vp.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSVP, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you, sir. Appreciate it.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOne moment for our next question.\nOur next question will come from Callum Elliott of Bernstein. Your line is open.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nHi, thank you very much for the question. It's actually a follow-up quite similar question to what you just had from Owen. But I want to push you a bit further because we also, like Owen, see pretty widespread evidence now that European moist versions of ZYN that do not have pre-market approval, as far as I'm aware, and weren't in the market as of August 2016.\nare available for sale on a widespread basis across New York City. But also the online forum suggests that this has become a pretty widespread issue across the US as a whole. So I guess two questions. Can you just confirm for us that those products weren't in the market at 8 August 2016 and that they are being sold in breach of FDA regulations? And then I guess secondly, building upon what Owen asked, presuming that you're not selling illicit product directly to US retailers yourselves.\nWhat can you do and what are you doing to stop European e-commerce retailers selling this product? Because it strikes me that this presents a pretty meaningful potential risk to your US Inc. business if this illicit product continues entering the US market in this way.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you, Callum. Look again, I don't have any data on what you're saying, so it's very difficult for me to report. I think we know whether the product that benefit from the situation and the positioning on 2016 in the market and that therefore are legally being commercialized as you can imagine. I'm going to repeat only what I said. We are doing everything we can to control the flows. I don't have information today saying that you have this flow of product. If we knew we would certainly tackle that and we would try to understand where it's coming from. And what I can certainly repeat is that our objective is to do our utmost, everything we can to be compliant with the regulation. And there is nothing else I can say, really.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nOkay, thank you.\nMaybe just a follow up, I guess. As you think about.\nBringing supply back online in the US or also bringing new supply online to meet demand, what gives you this confidence that we're going to see the sort of upwards lift, as in guidance today implies a very significant sort of back half hockey stick in terms of positive inflection in, in the growth rate, which to Faham's earlier question, we see sequential declines in growth now quarter to date. So what gives you the confidence that the consumers are switching to on, consumers who are switching to Rogue. Some of the consumer reviews for some of these competitive products are sometimes better than ZYN. So what gives you the confidence that now that consumer awareness for these other brands has grown as a result of your supply chain issues that you're going to immediately win those consumers back once supply comes online again?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, Callum, this is obviously coming from a mix of consumer demand perception that we have. We believe that if we can produce them, there is a space to get to 580 million can shipments. That's the first element, and that's what our sensors are telling us about what consumers would be happy to buy if it was available. At the same time, of course, our measures to increase production capacity, where, as I said, I'm not going to elaborate on the various levers, but we're pulling a number of levers to progressively increase the capacity for ZYN production in the US. That's really the combination of the two.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, AB Bernstein\n\nOkay, thank you,\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nthank you,\n\nOperator\n\nthank you. Our last question will be coming from Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays. Your line is open.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nGreat. Thank you so much for taking the question. Emmanuel, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the IQOS ILUMA test that you're planning for the US. It sounds like just a few cities. Will those be sort of diverse geographically across the US, and what are some of the learnings that you're hoping to, I think, unlock? And how could this be different than what we saw initially several years ago with some of the standalone stores that were put in place? And then I have a follow up. Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nSure.\nPriya. Well, that's a very broad question, although a very important one, of course. So given where we are, I'm going to make a short answer on that one. First of all, we clarify the fact that we go for a scale launch only once we get the PMTA for ILUMA. And as I said in my preliminary remarks, we are still today targeting to get this approval in the second half of 2025. Once we are there, then we have the right product to really go broader in the US and at that stage we will have been learning with a number of things that we're going to do between Q4 and the moment where we go with ILUMA. And you're asking, okay, what are you going to do differently? Let's be clear.\nWe don't believe that IQOS has never been launched in a kind of serious, consistent, and profound manner. We believe that what makes IQOS so popular outside the US is going to resonate with a number of smokers among the around 30 million smokers in the US, so we're going to develop what has been working elsewhere. It will be about, of course, going to the smokers, explaining what IQOS is about, explaining the experience, why IQOS is a better product than smoking. I think it would be, as always, very important to create the image, the brand territory, but also talk about closely with the smokers. Okay. This is a journey to move away from smoking and to go to a better product.\nTo IQOS, we will have the same commercial, I would say, a machine that has been successful in so many markets with developing our own retail sales point. We will have a strong partnership with a number of independent, and third-party retailers. So we're going to pull all the levers, and something that has not been done in the US because until now it has been only a very limited launch in a few cities with limited action. So everything is going to start at that moment for IQOS, and there won't be any magic. We're going to use what has been working so well elsewhere. Of course, adapting it to the US market.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThat's really helpful. And I guess just a follow on to that is you talked a lot about the development of IQOS outside the US. Maybe broad strokes. How do you think that product could play out in the US and at what point would you think about filing PMTAs and then broadening the availability of that in the US? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nLook, for the time being we don't have the plan to file a PMTA on VEEV. We are very much focusing on IQOS. I think that VEEV's success is just at the beginning today. It's great to have already five markets where we are number one on the closed pods system. But it's just the beginning. We're going to keep learning, developing how we can develop a successful profitable business on vaping, and then we will see whether in due course it makes sense to have some thoughts for VEEV in the US, but we are not at that stage today.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you. Just one final, I think, housekeeping item. You talked about your interest expense being at the low end of your prior range, $1.3 billion. Does that reflect, I guess, the issuance you've done to date, and should we anticipate that there wouldn't be any incremental interest expense headwinds, that is, potential scope for any other refinancing or pre-financing that you might consider? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nNo, I think the improvement in the estimated financial cost for the year is reflecting a better situation on, first of all, the level of the debt with the cash flow generation. Second, with how we are financing the group, and that is coming with this. You said it. I mean, we are in the low end of the initial bracket, and I don't think you should expect some kind of revolution in the way we are financing the company. Nothing on the agenda.\n\nPriya Ohri-Gupta\n\nResearch Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you.\nAppreciate that.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nI would now like to hand the call back to James Bushnell for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThat concludes our call today.\nThank you for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the PMI investor relations team. Thank you again and have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2024 first quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K dated 23 April 2024 and on our Investor Relations website. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer, and Jennifer Motles, Chief Sustainability Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. In Q1, we delivered outstanding performance that exceeded our expectations with double-digit growth in organic net revenue and operating income, as well as currency-neutral adjusted diluted earnings per share, all supported by robust volume growth. Excellent smoke-free business momentum continues with +25% organic growth in net revenues and +38% in gross profit. As IQOS, operating leverage and ZYN mix contribute positively. IQOS continues to advance rapidly with growth of 13% in adjusted in-market sales volumes and +21% in shipments. IQOS Iluma is a key driver of this progress and is now available in 64 markets representing nearly 100% of IQOS volumes outside Russia. ZYN also continued its considerable growth in Q1 with US volumes up +80%.Importantly, this top line performance translated into strong operating income growth and margin expansion both organically and in dollar terms. This was notably driven by accelerating profitability in both our IQOS and ZYN businesses. In addition to improving combustible performance. We faced higher than expected currency headwinds in the quarter primarily due to the devaluation of the Egyptian pounds. We are taking mitigating actions, including additional pricing and accelerated cost initiatives, which allowed us to deliver Q1 adjusted diluted EPS above our prior expectation. Despite these pressures.While the prior year quarter was favorable for certain growth comparison, this exceptional start to the year set the stage for us to deliver significantly better than expected 2024 currency neutral growth and robust growth in US dollar at prevailing rates. Turning to the headline numbers, very good shipment volume growth of 3.6%, supported organic top line growth of 11% or +8.6% including currency. This reflects continued excellent IQOS and ZYN momentum as well as strong combustible pricing. Operating income grew by +22.2% organically versus a softer prior year quarter, notably driven by gross margin expansion and a deceleration in SG&A growth. As a result, our organic OI margin expanded by +3.7 percentage points in dollar terms, adjusted OI grew by +11.3%, and adjusted OI margin expanded by 90 basis points.\nWe outperform our Q1 adjusted EPS outlook due to three main factors. The first is the net revenue and profit impact of better volumes following the industry-leading performance of ZYN, the strong shipment growth of IQOS HTUs, including some higher than expected timing benefit, and a resilient combustible delivery. Second is the benefit of our pricing action to mitigate currency headwinds, and third is on cost, including some timing benefit and a step of focus on manufacturing and back office efficiencies to prioritize growth investment. The majority of the outperformance was driven by underlying business dynamic which bodes well for the remainder of the year. Indeed, we delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.50, representing +23.2% growth excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.20. This includes $0.09 from the devaluation of the Egyptian pounds, including a transactional impact of $0.06 primarily related to the balance sheet remeasurement of foreign currency payables. With increased liquidity in the Egyptian pounds, we are now reducing our balance sheet exposure, and this should be complete in the coming weeks. Focusing now on volumes, our Q1 HTU shipments of 33.1 billion units exceeded our outlook with robust underlying growth across geographies and higher-than-anticipated timing impact of shipments to Japan.This incremental shading impact was around one billion units and was primarily related to Red Sea disruption. While uncertain, we assume this will normalize in the second half of the year.As mentioned previously, we believe the best indicator of underlying HTU growth is adjusted in-market sales as the closest metric to consumer offtake. Adjusted IMS volume grew nicely by +12.5%, including the expected impact from the characterizing flavor ban in Europe. We continue to see strong IQOS momentum with excellent growth in Japan, robust underlying fundamentals in Europe, and a growing contribution from newer markets such as Indonesia. We continue to target +14 to 16 adjusted IMS growth for the year with around 10% growth in Q2 followed by an H2 acceleration driven by the timing of commercial programs, Iluma uptake, newer market, and a less demanding prior year comparison.\nTotal smoke-free volume growth of +22% includes the impressive expansion of our overall smoke-free portfolio powered by ZYN with pouch equivalent shipment volumes up by 35.8%. US ZYN shipments grew by +80% to 132 million cans.Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 0.4% in Q1 with a notable positive contribution from Turkey as we increase share in a strong overall market. Let me now walk through the drivers of our Q1 net revenues. As I mentioned, volume grew by a remarkable +3.6%, including overall pricing contributed +5.5 points of growth, primarily from combustibles, as well as pricing of around 3% on HTUs.Smoke-free category mix added +3.1 percentage point to the top line, reflecting the higher net revenue per unit of IQOS and, to an even greater extent, ZYN. All smoke-free product overall boosted our organic net revenue growth by +2.2 points, showcasing its role as a meaningful accelerator. To report a positive contribution from our VEEV e-vapor business, which, while still small in the context of the group, delivered good revenue growth. In 2023, there was a negative geographic mix within our combustibles business. Margin in markets often without smoke-free products grew faster, and smoke-free products accelerated cigarette decline elsewhere.The positive category mix impact of smoke.Free product.And pricing are the three enduring engines of our transformation and growth. Focusing now on the key dynamic of our Q1 profit delivery, smoke-free gross profit grew by an impressive 38%, 8% organically on top line growth of 25%. This reflects the very strong performance of US ZYN and the growth and scale effect of IQOS including manufacturing productivity. This strong underlying acceleration was amplified by only a few percentage points due to HTU shipment phasing.Gross margin expanded substantially for both heat-not-burn and oral nicotine, and by a striking 600 basis points organically for smoke-free overall, which made up close to 39% of total gross profit, an increase of plus 6 percentage points versus prior year.\nCombustible organic gross profit growth was notably improved and exceeded our expectation at plus 2.3%.Gross margins were also better than anticipated, leading to an improved full year outlook. Resilient volumes, strong pricing, and manufacturing productivity more than offset the continued cost pressure in the category, geographic mix, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization, as previously flagged. Cost increases in leaf, wages, and certain other inputs carried over into 2024, and this should ease next year. We were also impacted by around $30 million of cost from implementation of the EU Single-Use Plastics Directive, primarily on cigarettes.A key feature of Q1 was strong operating income margin expansion. Gross margins increased organically by 150 basis points and by 80 basis points including currency. This reflects excellent expansion within smoke-free products, their growing weight within our business at higher margin, and the better-than-expected evolution of combustibles. These factors combined with productivity savings significantly outweighed the unfavorable technical dilutive impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia, which equated to 30 basis points in the quarter.For SG&A costs, currency neutral growth of only 1.4% drove plus 220 basis points of organic margin expansion. This benefited from our resource allocation and prioritization programs, including the delivery of approximately $160 million in gross cost efficiency across COGS and SG&A towards our two billion dollars target for 2024-2026. Although the Q1 margin impact of SG&A cost evolution, including currency, was small due notably to Egyptian pound transactional currency, we continue to target SG&A progression below top line growth for the year. We expect higher organic SG&A increases in the remainder of 2024, notably reflecting investment spend phasing, which was favorable in Q1.Combination of these factors powered a remarkable 370 basis point expansion in our organic operating income margin, and plus 90 basis points including currency. This exceeded our expectation, and we are now raising our full year operating income growth outlook. As I will come back to.\nTaking another lens on adjusted operating income margin by geography, we see broad-based global momentum with all regions delivering strong organic progress in dollar terms. Margin expanded in every region except South and Southeast Asia, CIS, and Middle East Africa region, mainly reflecting the transactional currency impact of the Egyptian pound and the technical dilution in Indonesia.These factors, this region's gross margin grew at a very similar rate to the group.To IQOS. With ILUMA now widely launched, PMI-HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present. PMI-HTUs now exceed the 10% market share milestone on the prior basis. Excluding Indonesia, which we now include following broader commercialization in the market, our HTUs are the number one nicotine brand in 11 markets, and as shown at CAGNY, IQOS net revenues have surpassed those of Marlboro. Focusing on IQOS in Europe, Q1 HTU share increased by 0.9 points, also crossing the 10% regional share milestone for the first time. While still early in many markets, the growing availability and uptake of ILUMA is a key driver and we are seeing a strong acceleration in a number of historically slower growth markets. Adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high of 12.6 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects year-on-year progression of +9.4% in Q1 with excellent growth in Greece, Portugal, Germany, Spain, UK, and the Netherlands. Growth was slower in certain Central European markets such as Poland and Czech Republic where increased economic pressure and price sensitivity are visible.We continue to evolve our portfolio in this market under the recently launched ILUMA system to drive further growth. Excluding Ukraine, where growth was absent, adjusted in-market sales grew double-digit. As anticipated, the 11 markets so far affected by EU characterizing flavor restriction saw an impact in line with our total region estimate of around 2 billion sticks for the year. Consistent with similar past situation, we observe an initial consumer adjustment followed by a reversion of growth rates to previous levels. We have not seen meaningful shifts toward e-vapor or competitor heat-not-burn product, and we expect the structural growth of IQOS to fuel continued HTU progression over the rest of the year.\nThe strong fundamental progress in the region is highlighted by the expansion in key cities of HTU shares. Very strong gains in cities with already high IQOS adoptions such as Lisbon, Rome, Hamburg, and Budapest demonstrate the potential for further growth at the national level.Recent acceleration in London, Madrid, Munich, and Amsterdam is also very promising for the IQOS brand in this market and for Europe overall.In Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by an excellent +3.1 points to 29.3%.Adjusted IMS volumes increased by 13%, maintaining the rapid progress of recent quarters. Such impressive growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable growth potential of IQOS around the world.In connection with IQOS' strong brand equity and commercial footprint, we are fostering growth through continued innovation on both devices and consumables. In March, we launched the latest IQOS device, ILUMA i, in direct channels, with national expansion ongoing.We remain laser focused on innovation. Our innovation in consumables has included a number of new variants and test experiences on the premium TEREA brand as shown by the OFTEC data on this chart. This has helped TEREA to continue growing Japan share at the same time as mainstream price SENTIA. This successful strategy of broadening consumer appeal with different price tiers while reinforcing and growing the premium lineup is a good illustration of how our IQOS business is evolving across market as the category continues to grow.The potential of the category is clearly demonstrated by the performance in Tokyo as shared at CAGNY. Heat-not-burn category volumes surpassed combustibles in January and have continued to grow since then. Led by Japan and Korea, the East Asia and Australia region reached almost 2/3 smoke-free net revenue in Q1. While somewhat flattered by shipment timing, this clearly demonstrates the path forward for the broader company as we strive towards our ambition of becoming substantially smoke-free, surpassing 2/3 by 2030.Outside of Japan and Europe, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth across the globe, including low- and middle-income markets, as highlighted by HTU tech share. A notable call out is Indonesia, where we have expanded commercialization to targeted areas in new cities and introduced area clove variants catering to kretek preferences. We have witnessed an uplift in user growth and now have over 150,000 estimated IQOS users in the country. Our HTU tech share in metro Jakarta is one indicator of this with +1.6 percentage point growth to 3.4% in a growing total industry.\nWe are also pleased to report the reacceleration of IQOS's growth in South Korea following the introduction of IQOS ILUMA. TEREA recently became the number one HTU brand as measured by national C-store off-take, and in Seoul, IQOS's market share grew by 1.8 to 12.8%.Egypt continued to stand out with Cairo off-take share up plus 13.2, 9.1% despite recent pricing, and we also see promising results in Malaysia, Morocco, Lebanon, and the Balkans.While not shown on this slide, Saudi Arabia also had a promising restart with Q1 national offtake share of 1.3% following the resumption of IQOS commercialization in late 2023.In a similar vein to some of our European markets, the novel launch of ILUMA in Canada has coincided with an acceleration in key city growth as shown here by Toronto. While still early days for ILUMA and in a very restrictive regulatory environment, this is clearly a positive development.Moving now to ZYN where excellent US progress continued in Q1 with +70% sequential growth in 12 months rolling shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the fourth consecutive quarter to 74.3%, an increase of 6.9 points year on year and +1.3 points sequentially. Despite a $0.15 per can price increase in March.Retail value share also grew to 79.3%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a broad step up in nationwide store velocities and gradual distribution expansion as the category gained strong traction with adult nicotine users.As outlined at CAGNY, we remain focused on marketing ZYN responsibly to prevent unintended use. We support the FDA's effort to ensure only consumers over 21 have access to nicotine product. Swedish Match follows a robust US marketing code that prohibits using social media, influencer, age-gate digital platform, age 21, and includes partnering with We Card to help ensure retail sales only to legal-age adults.I'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles where our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of +3.7% in Q1. This primarily reflects better than expected pricing of +7.9% with a notable contribution from Germany and stepped up pricing in Egypt. The pricing environment remained favorable, and we now forecast a full year increase of six to seven percent with annualization effect lessening in H2. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.3 points in Q1 and this includes positive contribution from Algeria, Poland, Turkey, resulting in only a modest volume decline in a total cigarette industry which fell by 0.6%. Our global brands gained category share during the quarter with Marlboro gaining +0.4 points as previously flagged, our 2023 share of segment was flattered by competitor supply constraint in Egypt which may normalize this year.\nAs I already mentioned, strong pricing in Q1 coupled with accelerated manufacturing productivity also resulted in a better than expected margin evolution.Now let me provide an update on our latest innovation and expansion plans as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. As I covered earlier, we recently launched IQOS ILUMA i, our most innovative offering to date in Japan. The ILUMA i portfolio consists of three devices offering a range of adaptable new features. This includes a new touch screen on the device holder which allows users to see experience relevant information quickly and easily as well as a pause mode so user can pause and resume their smoke-free moment where they left off. Initial consumer feedback has been very positive. Japan was the first market to launch ILUMA in H2 2021 and we plan to gradually roll out ILUMA i to more geographies over time.As shown in our Japan and Indonesia performance. Consumable innovation on the ILUMA platform is also critical as we broaden offering across markets. LEVIA HTUs, which contain nicotine but no tobacco leaf, were launched nationwide in the Czech Republic and Romania in Q1 with promising initial results. More markets are planned later this year. DELIA, our new mainstream price brand for HTUs, was rolled out in Switzerland, Hungary, and Lithuania.In the US, we continue to prepare for the first consumer pilot in select cities with the IQOS ILUMA i system. As mentioned previously, the commercialization will be initially limited in scope and will be focused on direct activation of select legal-age nicotine users in a few cities, allowing us to experiment with different elements of the commercial model. The main purpose of this consumer activation is to fine-tune our approach in anticipation of the at-scale launch of IQOS ILUMA. Following authorization from the FDA, the international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key focus, notably for ZYN. As the world's leading brand, we have launched or relaunched in 11 markets so far with more planned later this year.In e-vapor. Our focused strategy for VEEV is showing very good early results, positive consumer feedback is translating into promising repeat purchase and conversion rate, and we are on the path to profitability in H2.\nThis brings me to our outlook for 2024. With unparalleled smoke-free volume momentum, best-in-class pricing, and expanding margin, we are raising our full-year currency-neutral growth forecast. This strong pricing combined with positive smoke-free mix and efficient cost allocation also helps us to mitigate currency headwinds and should allow us at prevailing rates to deliver on our objective of robust growth in dollar terms. Given continued ZYN volume progress, we are increasing our US shipment forecast to around 560 million cans. We have further accelerated our capacity expansion plans to support this additional step up. We continue to target strong growth in both adjusted IMS and shipments of IQOS HTUs and to reach close to $15 billion in 2024 smoke-free net revenue at prevailing exchange rate.Factoring the increase in shipment forecast and a strong pricing outlook on both combustible and smoke-free product, we are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to +7% to +8.5%. In addition to higher revenue growth, we expect accelerated organic margin expansion. This is strongly driven by a significant expected uplift in our smoke-free gross margin due to IQOS scale effect, ZYN mix, and accelerated manufacturing productivities. It also includes organic gross margin expansion in combustibles, where we had previously assumed a negative development. In addition, we are focused on delivering further SG&A efficiency while continuing to invest in smoke-free growth. As a result, we are raising our organic operating income growth forecast to 10% to 12%. Accordingly, we are raising our forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to nine percent to 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.19 to $6.31, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.36 at the prevailing rate.The increase forecasted is primarily explained by the devaluation of the Egyptian pound and recent weakness in the Japanese Yen. As I mentioned, we are taking proactive actions to mitigate the incremental impact.We expect full-year growth and operating income margin expansion in both organic and dollar terms at prevailing exchange rates. This includes organic expansion in both H1 and H2. After the excellent Q1 performance, we expect a strong H1 overall with organic net revenue and OI growth around the high end of our full-year ranges.\nFor Q2 specifically, we assume HTU shipment volume of 34 to 35 billion and continued strong volume growth. For Zim, we forecast currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to 1.55 including an unfavorable currency variances of $0.14 at prevailing rates. With regard to our balance sheet deleveraging remain a key priority. We continue to target 0.3 to 0.5 times improvement in our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio in 2024 driven by profit growth and strong cash flow generation. We also continue to target reaching around two times by the end of 2026 and will consider buybacks once confirmed. We are on track.Switching gears as this quarter coincides with the publication of our 2023 Integrated Report. I would like to welcome Jennifer Motles, PMI Chief Sustainability Officer, to share an update on our sustainability progress. Jennifer, over to you.\n\nJennifer Motles\n\nChief Sustainability Officer, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. I'm very pleased to be joining today's earnings call. As Emmanuel mentioned, our sustainability transformation and business strategies are one and the same. We're focused on creating value for the long term, where generating shareholder returns requires us to deliver on transformation and delivering on transformation requires us to deliver on sustainability. As shown in our recent results, our product transformation fosters profitable growth and short, medium, and long-term value creation. However, our transformation also means reshaping both our value chain and how we engage with society. As we venture into new product categories, we actively collaborate with different stakeholders and advocate for regulatory frameworks that can accelerate industry change and end smoking.Business transformation is a company-specific journey which sustainability reporting standards and frameworks often fail to adequately capture. To help illustrate our progress towards achieving our smoke-free purpose, we regularly report our Business Transformation Metrics, a bespoke set of financial and non-financial KPIs. Some of them were already presented by Emmanuel in our financial results. Others you can see here. For example, the growing proportion of commercial and R&D spend on smoke-free products demonstrates the allocation of resources away from our legacy business and towards replacing cigarettes with better alternatives. As another example, increasing the availability and access of adult smokers around the world to smoke-free products are two key pillars of achieving this replacement. As our geographic expansion continues, low- and middle-income markets now make up 47% of our market presence.These metrics, together with our overall performance for 2023, can be found in the latest Integrated Report published last month and available on our website. It is a comprehensive document covering our most important sustainability topics, starting with our products. The report highlights progress on our continued expansion of smoke-free alternatives across categories and geographies, as well as social and environmental progress with, and in parallel to, these products in support of sustainable value creation. These include responsible marketing and sales practices, youth.\nEfforts to reduce post-consumer waste. Further, it highlights our progress on improving the quality of life of people in our supply chain, decarbonizing our operations and value chain, and preserving nature. We're also very pleased with the continued recognition of our sustainability performance and our robust reporting. To highlight just a few from 2023, PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time and for the fourth year in the BGSI North America. In addition, PMI was the only US company to obtain a AAA rating from CDP. More than 20,000 companies worldwide participated in this rating, and only 10 obtained this prestigious recognition, notably for investors in parts of Europe but also in ESG or sustainability theme funds in the US. We are subject to sector exclusion policies because we are a tobacco company.It is clear that excluding companies or sectors from the consideration set does nothing to address the underlying reasons for the exclusion, which in our case would be the harm linked to combustible tobacco use. Many funds that may be excluding tobacco on ESG considerations will still own stocks in other consumer sectors, despite many of these companies not having comparable harm reduction strategies in place to address the impact of their products. As we transform our company away from combustible and work to end smoking at a societal level, we welcome the engagement and challenge of investors to help us accelerate this critical shift. Thank you. I'll now turn it back to Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you Jennifer. I will conclude today's presentation with some key messages. Our excellent IQOS and ZYN volume momentum, best-in-class pricing, positive category mix, and steps of cost efficiency put us on track for a strong 2024 with accelerated top-line growth and margin expansion. Following an exceptional and better than expected start to the year, we have raised our full year currency neutral growth forecast. Critically, we are also focused on delivering performance in dollars. We are taking measures to mitigate currency headwinds through pricing, accelerated manufacturing productivity, and judicious resource allocation to prioritize growth investment. Our 2024 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2024-2026 CAGR targets. Beyond 2026, we have further exciting opportunities to grow our smoke-free business as we progress towards our ambition of being substantially smoke-free by 2030.Finally and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generated business underpins our ability to deleverage while maintaining a steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth. Thank you and we are now very happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nAs a reminder to ask a question, please press star one one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press star one one again. Please stand by while we compile the Q and A roster.Our first question comes from Matthew Smith with Stifel. Your line's now open.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi. Thank you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning, Matt.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nIf we start the first quarter, it was a strong start to the year. You noted a better revenue and margin performance supporting your ability to raise the outlook for both organic revenue and constant currency EPS from a high level. On a constant currency basis, the first quarter EPS was about $0.20 ahead of your Q1 guidance and you raised the full year outlook somewhat below that.Can you talk about unique benefits in?The first quarter that may have changed the timing through the year? Or how are you viewing the rest of the year different now in terms of the fundamental environment or investment level?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, I'm happy to explain why. So some of the bits, but only part of it of course, because we started, as I explained in my prepared remarks, the year in a very strong manner, in an underlying manner, but in addition to the very strong momentum that we are experiencing. Indeed, there was around an additional 1 billion HTUs ticked because of Red Sea. So that has been a plus in Q1, and we expect that to reverse later in the year for the time being. So that's one element that is important. We may have been helped a bit by some volumes on combustibles, but it's probably more marginal, and at the scale of the combustibles business, it's probably smaller. And then the other element of course is the SG&A evolution. Organically 1.4% increase only. We want to grow organically revenue faster than SG&A.Of course we will have the 10 points of difference that we've been experiencing.In Q1. So that will also reverse partially in the rest of the year as we are coming with some phasing on commercial actions and marketing advertising later in the year, and starting in Q2 where we will have more SG&A. So I think that with that you have the key element that have been adding to what was I said, very strong momentum anyway in Q1.\n\nMatthew Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Emmanuel.I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment, for our next question.Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line's now open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you. Good morning, Emmanuel. I wanted to maybe ask for a little bit of more color on a point you made about, or at, the end of your script regarding currency headwinds and how you're hoping to mitigate these headwinds. You highlighted pricing and productivity savings, et cetera. So maybe just provide a little bit more color on those, I guess, levers if you can pull them and maybe why you're more optimistic going forward given the never ending currency headwinds since it continues to impact your business. I think that would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure. Benny, happy to share our view and what we're doing on that one. So we said it at the beginning of the year, and when we are at Cagny, we want to deliver performance in dollar terms, and therefore that means that even when we have another significant forex headwind, and you know, some of that, I mean, we have in Q1 actually $0.06 coming from the Egyptian pound that won't be there next year. So that's not something that's going to stay with us. So it's a kind of one-off negative impact. But we want to deliver robust growth in the long term. So in order to deliver that, we have two big levers. I would say one is on price.To be clear, when we talk about price, it's of course in the countries where we can see some devaluation, but not only, it's really across the board. How can we push the boundaries and push to the maximum of the limit the price increase? Well, we think that we're doing in a way that is not necessarily taking a big risk on market share, but we are clearly here and notably on combustible pushing on price increase. That's something that we can do that is taking into account a certain economic environment. In the current environment, we are doing what we think is optimized and the best we can. Of course, if there was some more depreciation, more devaluation, we would reconsider whether more action.Can be done. Then, on productivity and on cost efficiency, that means really accelerating everything we can do on productivity. We are working across the board. It's, of course, on procurement, it's on optimizing the manufacturing footprints, it's on logistics. I mean, it's on everything where we can generate extra savings.And playing with this environment of a strong dollar. And then on cost allocation, I mean, of course we are working permanently as part of our two billion saving program on plans to be simpler, to generate efficiency, to work in a more efficient manner. So we do that, we try to accelerate that. Here again, we're trying to do things faster. And we are also making sure that when it comes to investment allocation, we really prioritize on what is having the biggest and strongest, and I would say.Clearer return, which is allowing us to also generate some profitability improvement to partially offset the negative forex. So that's really everything, that all the action that we are doing. We're not saying we can offset any kind of adverse forex environment, but I think our Q1 numbers and the outlook for the year is showing that we have some good capacity to mitigate to a very significant extent the forex impact.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that is helpful. And then I just had a quick question if I may. On ZYN, we're actually hearing about some out-of-stocks in the US from some of our industry trade contacts. So maybe hoping for a little more color on this and how much it might have impacted volumes in the quarter. Also curious if these issues are related to maybe specific production issues or more related to the strong demand, and ultimately when you expect them to be resolved. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Benny. This is very much the latter. I mean, you can imagine when a business is growing 80% and we are growing 80%, that is indeed creating some tensions on the supply chain. Without any doubt. I'm not sure that out of stock is still the proper word given where we are today. I think that maybe sometime a reference is not going to be available. Not everything is going to be.is going to be fully available in the range at a certain point in time. But look at what the Nielsen are telling us on Q1 and our volume. I mean, we seem to be growing fast, and it's difficult to see any kind of impact coming from restriction on availability. As we said, we are working very hard to maximize our capacity in this fast growing environment for ZYN. We are comfortable, of course, with our capacity to deliver around our 560 million cans. That is not the limit that we are putting, of course, in terms of production capacity, but we are in this.Phase of adaptation to this strong growth and a fast-rising demand. I think so far, maybe with some tension, but with limited impact on volumes.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your lines now open.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior Vice President, Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nMorning, Emmanuel. Hope all well. Hey, first question on heated, can you maybe talk a bit more about the contribution from newer markets? Is this trending in line with expectations or do you see potential for upside here? Because some of the trends you called out sound very encouraging. I'd also love an update on BONDS and the latest with this if possible. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, with pleasure, Owen. So I think we see, and you said it. I've been elaborating on a number of markets where we see a very interesting trajectory for new market. We've been speaking about Indonesia. We could have been speaking in addition to all the market.Could have been speaking about Mexico where we have also a nice acceleration and we are just launching ILUMA now. So the good thing is that we're not relying on one or two names but we start to have a growing team of new market where we see clearly IQOS getting traction and increasing its stake first as always in the big cities. That's where in many of these countries we have the biggest potential. But that's I would say happening in line with expectation. And as I said, we expect even a further acceleration in the second part of the year. We believe that then Taiwan, we also start adding to the flow of this newer market. So it's in line with expectation and clearly coming with a great potential.With IQOS being perceived in many big cities rapidly as an aspirational product, which is extremely positive for the future and the brand franchise that we're going to be able to build there.Then on top of this new market and the IQOS trajectory in this new market, we have indeed BONDS that we plan to develop in the future. We've been making the test as we explained in the Philippines and Colombia. We are working on the result. We are making a number of adjustments, and we'll come with a detailed plan.In the coming quarters, we want to make sure that we come with a product that has all the ingredients, all the features to be a great success, and we're working on it. So that's going to be really important in all this market because we know that the affordability here is different to come with.A portfolio that is segmented and where IQOS will have a role to play. But we need to also come with the rest of the portfolio, BONDS, lil, in order to cover this market.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior Vice President, Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nThank you, very helpful. I just have one more. I wanted to talk a bit more about vape. What sort of volumes do you think you can do here for the year? And if I heard you right, you said you'll be profitable already in H2, which would suggest volumes have been really healthy already, and just any kind of commentary on which markets you're seeing the strongest traction so far?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure.So it of course stays modest versus IQOS and ZYN in terms of impact at the group level, and we stick to our strategy, which is we don't want to be big in vaping if it's to lose money. We want to be really going with VEEV in markets where we are having the right commercial impact, where VEEV can make a difference, and in a profitable manner. Indeed, the year started well in terms of volumes. We have this outlook of moving into positive bottom line for VEEV in the second part of the year, which would be very good news. We are prioritizing markets where we have the critical mass, where I would say the nature of the vaping market is interesting, and we are developing today very nicely, I would say, in markets such as Italy, Czech Republic, France, UK, and developing in Canada. These are markets where.We can reach, if you want, the size, the mass, and where we have the impact to make our vaping business successful and profitable.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior Vice President, Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nGreat.Thank you, sir. Very helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Owen.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Faham Baig with UBS. Your line is open.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Research, UBS Investment Bank\n\nMorning, Emmanuel. Thank you for the questions. I have a couple as well, both on heated tobacco. Firstly, could I get your view on any implications that you see from the recent EU court ruling on the supplementary excise tax in Germany to any other of the European countries?When are you expecting a decision from the finance court in Dusseldorf? The second question please is again on heated tobacco. Clearly pricing has stepped up over the last couple of quarters. How are you thinking about balance between price and volume growth, and could pricing be higher than the original guidance of low single digits?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you for the question. So first of all, on the German situation, I mean, yes, they've been asking for the view from the European Court of Justice. But it's a purely German question whether the way they've been implementing their extra tax was according to EU law or no. So there is no consequences for other countries. It's really a German question due to how they implemented this increase in the tax. So that's what it is on the final decision. Because at the end of the day that would be the decision from the German court. I have to say I don't know when we will know more, I guess in the coming months, obviously. But I'm not going to be able to be more specific on the timing of the Dusseldorf court to make their decision.There are a number of steps still to be taken before they get there. So that will be for the coming months. I think given where we are today, I'm not able to tell you when they will make their decision. Regarding your second question on price versus volume. So we said, and I'm going to stick to that. Yeah, we believe that we can increase price more low single digits or not at the level of combustible on heat-not-burn. Again, I think we are very clear on the very positive impact coming from the growth in volume from our heat-not-burn business. They're coming with a much higher price.They're coming now with a higher gross margin rate. Even at the level of just the consumable, it's significantly higher than for combustible as an average for the group. So that means that really growing volumes is the name of the game for us. That's where it makes sense. Now on top of it, given the very strong franchise of IQOS and the attractiveness of the brand, we are able to increase price without putting in danger the volume. But that's really the way you should be looking at it for us today. It's very much a play on maximizing the volumes.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nExecutive Director, Equity Research, UBS Investment Bank\n\nThanks, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question.Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Your line is now open.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nHi, good morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you for taking my question. So two questions from me. So one is, you know, just conceptually. So let's take a city like Tokyo where the heated tobacco category share is now 50% plus. So one can argue that by increasing the premium cigarette prices which haven't increased now in two years, you can accelerate the down trading to IQOS. This will accelerate IQOS volume growth. This will also accelerate your $ EPS growth out of Japan. So why wouldn't you do something like this in cities and countries where heated tobacco and IQOS becomes the dominant form factor.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you for your question, Gaurav. Look, you know I'm always very cautious, of course, as you can imagine, on commenting any kind of price strategies, so don't expect me to enter into any kind of detail. But conceptually.It is clear that as we build leadership in the category, as there is a growing adhesion from the nicotine user to it not burn, there is a capacity for ongoing premiumization and more price increase, without any doubt. But as I said and as I explained with the previous question, we believe that today still it's very much about maximizing the volumes and that's what for us is important. Of course, coming with great gross profit per stick and great contribution. So I'm certainly not closing the door to more price in the future. But I think I've been clear on what our priorities are. Having said that, as you know, in Japan we need to have an agreement from the authority to increase the price. So I think it's something that is also sometimes regulated.So it doesn't mean that we have all the latitude that we would like to enjoy on the topic. So that's on the long term. It is clear that today, and we've been discussing that already, you have the IQOS consumable that are positioned even at some discount versus Marlboro. That gives an idea of the kind of increase that we'll be able to reach in the future probably without too much, I would say, issues over time. Once again, it doesn't happen in one go, but as I explained for the time being, maximizing volume is the name of the game and it's coming with, I think, what the Q1 is illustrating in a very bright manner, a very, very powerful mix impact on our financial performance.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nSure.My second question is on Russia. You know, IQOS volumes in Russia grew, which is surprising given that you do not invest in IQOS there anymore. First of all, can you just remind us the contribution of Russia to your EPS? And how should we think of Russian ecosystem shipments for this year?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook on Russia. You have to be a bit cautious on the shipment that you see, and that does not necessarily fully reflect the consumer offtake. You can have some movement from the surrounding countries. So I think we have to be cautious. So Russia is a market that has not been. If I look at the past, I'm not sure that one quarter is enabling us to conclude anything. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, Russia has been a market that has not shown, unfortunately, any kind of meaningful growth today. We have no reason to believe that suddenly Russia is going to become a gross market because nothing has changed fundamentally. And that's a country that has been impacted, of course, by currency depreciation that has been impacting the weight in the EPS. So I think that we were referring to seven percent to eight percent.I think we'll have to revise, and I don't have the number top of mind for 2024 on the outlook, but that was the kind; it was around 9-10, and I think with the currency it has been losing a bit of weight in the overall performance of the company.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nConsumer Analyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nSure. Thank you so much, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our final question comes from Callum Elliott with Barclays.Your line is now open, Funstein. That.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nYes, that's it.Thanks Gareth.My question is actually following up on Bonnie's question on dollar growth.In 2013, I think your dollar EPS, Emmanuel, was $5.40 per share. So you've compounded dollar EPS growth about 1.5% over the subsequent 10-11 years. It's also best in class organic growth and probably worst in class dollar EPS growth over that 10-year period, which is really striking given that that 10 years captures the whole of the creation of this IQOS business.That has been quite remarkable.So my question is, you obviously outlined a number of initiatives in answer to Bonnie's question of how you hope to drive dollar growth. But maybe you could sort of double back on those explanations, which of those are actually new and haven't been present over that sort of past 10-year period that could have been helping you over that past 10 years? Because it struck me in those explanations that it sounded like things like pricing, etc. Those have all been around for the past 10 years, and they haven't helped you offset the effects. So is there anything you can tell us that's new that should give investors confidence that if FX headwinds persist, you are able to drive dollar growth for your business?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International",
    "content2": "Thank you for your question.Well, first of all, I guess you are assuming that the Forex headwind will persist in the coming years, which I think nobody can really say. We know that currency can be facing cycle and that is true that the last 10 years have been about a strengthening of the dollar. We've been knowing other cycle where the dollar was more weakening versus at least other hard currency. So nobody knows what's going to happen. I think what we are saying and thank you for giving me the money to maybe repeat and clarify that we are today in a position.To put together very strong growth before FX. And I think you are seeing with the guidance for 2024 that we are obviously coming still with a very dynamic top line, very much accelerating operating income growth. We are targeting a double digit before currency impact now in 2024, and on top of that we are going to price, and in an environment that today we see positive for pricing, certainly with the fact that pricing on combustible is something that we can use now very tactically. We know that CC is not our future. So we can certainly use pricing very tactically in order to boost performance. We also are coming with some price increase at the level of HTU. We have some price increase on ZYN as well. So we have globally a pricing environment that looks attractive to us in the future.Then when it comes to our cost, it is true that we've been investing a lot in the past years, and we've been reporting on all the action that we were having on investment across the board in terms of innovation, in terms of science, and in terms of R and D, in terms of manufacturing. Now is the time where, of course, we are reaching critical mass on smoke-free products. There are a number of things that we are doing that we can do more efficiently, a number of things that we've been learning, and that we're going to implement in the continuation of our journey. So all that we believe is also giving us some very good ammunition and capacity to generate efficiency at a very high level in the future.So that's all, and they are quite important, quite numerous, all the levers that we own to deliver performance in dollar terms in the future.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThanks, Emmanuel, that's helpful. Maybe I can just ask a follow-up.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nSo we have a number of US consumer staples companies reporting this morning, and many of them face similar FX headwinds, incremental FX headwinds over the past two, three months as PMI does. It's striking to me that among some of those companies, even a commoditized US toilet paper company has done a better job this quarter of offsetting these incremental emerging market FX headwinds with sort of rapidly responding with incremental price increases to offset those headwinds. So I guess my question here is, is there something structural in your business that's making it less agile in responding to these changes in FX relative to some of your other consumer staples peers outside of the tobacco space?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, can I answer you that your question is highly speculative because you asked me to compare with other businesses that are obviously, obviously very different in, I guess, the way they invest, their outlook, what they have to do. We are building here a business that has a tremendous growth potential. So we're not going to, of course, limit all the initiative, all the investment that we must do in order to.Keep growing the business and extract the full potential that we have with our smoke-free portfolio. Maybe that's different versus the vapor business you were mentioning. I frankly have no clue because I don't know what you are referring to and the specific situation. But I think it's difficult to probably compare businesses that are facing different potential, different trajectories. That would be my answer.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nAnalyst, Barclays Bank Plc\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes the question and answer session. I would now like to turn it back to management for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP Investor Relations, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you for joining us. That concludes our call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the investor relations team. Thank you again and have a nice day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nBye bye.

I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nI'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. PMI delivered another strong operating performance in 2023. We achieved our 10th consecutive year of positive volumes and a high single-digit organic top-line growth driven by smoke-free products. Smoke-free products delivered accelerated accretion to profitability in the fourth quarter, as our IQOS business delivered meaningful 2023 operating leverage, mitigating a significant drag from combustibles. I'm also very pleased to report the continued outstanding growth of ZYN, which was not included in organic metrics until mid-November last year. Importantly, smoke-free products reached nearly 40% of total PMI net revenues in the fourth quarter and over 40% of gross profit. For the year, smoke-free gross profit increased by 19% organically, and we expect smoke-free organic growth to accelerate for both net revenues and gross profit in 2024.\nZYN delivered exceptional growth in its first year within PMI, with US pro forma volumes up by over 60% for the year and over 75% in Q4. Oral smoke-free is accretive to both our smoke-free business and the overall group, with Swedish Match contributing 50 basis points organic uplift to Q4 OI margins from only 50 days of the period. Our IQOS business continues to deliver excellent results, with 15% adjusted in-market sales growth for HTUs, reflecting broad-based momentum in Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. The rollout of IQOS ILUMA is substantially complete and now is present in the 51 markets, representing over 95% of IQOS geographies by volume, excluding Russia and Ukraine.\nThe superior experience and design of ILUMA, combined with the strong premium brand equity of IQOS and our commercial infrastructure, enabled IQOS to outgrow the heat-not-burn category despite holding a category share of over 75%. Importantly, as we have seen in Japan, the launch of ILUMA is a multi-year growth driver consistent with past IQOS innovations. Our 2023 combustibles performance was margin-diluted despite strong commercial results, with very good pricing and higher category share. This reflects the significant cost pressures in the category, geographic mix from volume growth in lower-margin markets without smoke-free products, and the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This was also compounded by the technical impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine. While cost and currency headwinds impacted our earnings in 2023, the strengthening growth and margin profile of smoke-free products set us up well to deliver sustainable growth and returns, including currency, in 2024 and beyond.\nWe reached a number of key transformation milestones in the last quarter of last year. First, IQOS net revenues surpassed Marlboro to become the number one international nicotine brand on this measure. This demonstrates the power of innovative smoke-free alternatives to switch adult smokers away from cigarettes and to address the societal issue of combustible tobacco. It is also a testament to our organization's ability to build strong and sustainable brand equity. This also applies to ZYN, the fastest-growing US smoke-free brand, with another outstanding performance in Q4, marked by an increase in category volume share, retail value share, and overall volume. We're also proud to have reached 25 markets where smoke-free products exceed 50% of our top line for both Q4 and the full year. We aim to reach 60 markets by 2030, driving our ambition to exceed 2/3 of group net revenue.\nLast, as I already mentioned, over 40% of our total gross profit was generated by smoke-free products, with the adjusted gross margin rate on smoke-free surpassing combustibles for both the quarter and year. We are encouraged by the increasing number of governments adopting tobacco harm reduction policies to encourage reduced-risk nicotine consumption instead of smoking, which is ultimately more sustainable for society. Nevertheless, a considerable amount of work remains. Sustainable growth requires a sustainable business, and we continue to garner increasing recognition for our sustainability performance across the key product and operational topics for our company. PMI was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index for the first time and for the fourth year in a row by DJSI North America. In addition, PMI was awarded Carbon Disclosure Project AAA rating for the fourth consecutive year.\nI will now hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results and outlook in more detail.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Jacek. Let's start with the headline numbers. We finished the year strongly with Q4 organic net revenue growth of +8.3%. This includes +14% growth from smoke-free products despite slower HTU shipment growth due to comparison effect, and also +5% growth from combustibles. Pricing was a strong driver for both categories, with smoke-free pricing including the impact of retail price increases on HTUs. While Swedish Match was only included in organic metrics as of 12 November, it contributed +0.8 percentage points to Q4 organic top-line growth and grew by an excellent +26% on a pro forma basis. Operating income grew organically by a very good +8%, including a Swedish Match contribution of +2.2 points. As expected, Q4 margins were broadly stable organically and grew, excluding the technical effect mentioned by Jacek.\nThis enabled our business to deliver another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth at +12.2%. We succeeded our prior expectations with ZYN's remarkable growth as a notable contributor. Despite this strong currency-neutral result, Q4 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.00 was adversely affected by a greater-than-expected currency impact of $0.20. This includes a $0.09 balance sheet-related impact under hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina following the devaluation of the peso in mid-December. As with the previously mentioned impact in Q3, this reflects the depreciation of monetary net assets denominated in pesos, which are subject to capital controls. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods. Turning to the full year, net revenue grew by +7.8% organically, representing the third straight year of high single-digit growth. Similar to Q4, this reflects continued excellent IQOS momentum and strong combustibles pricing.\nIn 2023, Swedish Match, led by ZYN, grew pro forma ex-currency net revenues by +20%. Operating income grew by +3.7% organically, reflecting a challenging first half followed by strong growth in H2. We delivered expansion in both adjusted gross margin and operating income margin in H2, driven by the strong progress of smoke-free products. With the impact of accelerated device sales from the ILUMA rollout in the base and a return to FX to Japan, the effect of growing HTU volume and ongoing cost optimization are clearly visible. As expected, OI margin organically contracted 150 basis points for the full year, primarily due to acute cost and supply chain headwinds in H1.\nAs flagged in prior quarters, full-year margin included 40 basis points headwind from the accounting treatment of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia and Ukraine, primarily reflecting the Indonesia excise tax gross up of around $250 million gross in both net revenue and cost of sales. While headwinds in combustibles have not fully abated, our smoke-free business is delivering excellent profit growth, and our organic results will include a strong contribution from Swedish Match going forward. We successfully mitigated inflationary pressure and supported investment with efficiency. Across our total operating cost base, we delivered an incremental $100 million in gross cost efficiency in Q4 and $2.2 billion for 2021-2023 overall, surpassing our $2 billion target. We target an additional $2 billion over the next three years. These positive factors allowed us to deliver very strong currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11% ahead of our prior expectation.\nAdjusted diluted EPS of $6.01 includes unfavorable currency of $0.63, primarily reflecting the Japanese yen, Russian ruble, and specific Argentine peso dynamic I just explained. We include a slide in the appendix to this presentation with more detail. Focusing now on volumes, we comfortably achieved a third consecutive year of shipment growth driven by a +15% increase for IQOS HTUs in addition to a resilient combustible performance. Our smoke-free volumes made up over 20% of total PMI in Q4, and with continued momentum of better growth expected here, we are very well positioned to continue growing volume over the mid and long term. 2023 HTU shipment volume of 125.3 billion units were at the lower end of our targeted range due to delayed launches in Saudi Arabia and Taiwan, combined with lower-than-expected underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine.\nFor IQOS HTUs, we believe the best indicator of underlying growth is adjusted IMS, as the closest metric to consumer offtake. For the full year, adjusted in-market sales volume and shipment growth were in line at 15%. In Q4, HTU shipment growth of 6% reflects trade inventory buildup in the prior-year quarter, and the 14% adjusted IMS growth is, therefore, a more reliable measure of continued strong growth momentum. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, adjusted in-market sales grew by more than +17% for the year. For context, across the two years before the war began in 2022, these markets made up 23% of HTU shipment volume and exceeded the company's growth rate by a notable margin.\nThese smoke-free volume growth rates exclude the excellent development of our oral nicotine portfolio driven by ZYN, with shipment volumes up by +23% in Q4 and +17% in 2023 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette shipments declined by a modest 1.4% in 2023, outperforming the international category decline of 2.4%. Turning to profits, organic operating income growth stepped up in H2 to +10% following the exceptional headwind of H1. We believe this is more representative of the underlying momentum of our business and in line with our 2024-2026 CAGR target range of +8% to +10%. Focusing now on some key drivers of our full-year operating income, smoke-free growth profit grew organically by an excellent +19%, expanding gross margin by 340 basis points.\nThis reflects part of the operating leverage of IQOS I already mentioned, with a notable contribution from Swedish Match oral nicotine in the last 50 days of Q4, with organic operating profit growth of over 50%. With smoke-free commercial costs also increasing by less than net revenue, this clearly bodes well for 2024 as we continue to benefit from scale effect and manufacturing optimization. Despite very strong pricing, there was only marginal organic growth in combustibles gross profit. This partly reflects the negative geographic mix I already mentioned, with greater volume decline in higher-margin markets like Japan, as more smokers switch to smoke-free products, and better volume trends in lower-margin geographies where smoke-free products are small or not available, such as Turkey. There were also significant inflationary pressures on leaf, direct materials, and other manufacturing costs.\nCost increases on leaf, where inventory covers multiple crop years and wedges, are likely to carry over into 2024 and should ease thereafter. Moving now to Swedish Match, which delivered outstanding performance in its first full year as part of PMI, with adjusted pro forma currency-neutral top-line growth of +26% in Q4 and 20% in 2023. When we announced our offer for Swedish Match in 2022, we targeted a return on investment in excess of our cost of capital within five years. With the growth of ZYN surpassing our expectation, we now expect to achieve this well ahead of time. ZYN delivered another remarkable US performance with +78% volume growth in Q4 and 62% in 2023. Internationally, we have launched or relaunched ZYN in 10 markets as planned as we continue to focus on building a truly global brand.\nUS cigars posted robust 2023 results, growing net revenues and profits. This was driven by strong pricing following an increase in April, partially offset by volume decline, which reflects lagged competitor pricing and comparison effects. ZYN's excellent US progress continued in Q4 with +15% sequential growth in 12 months' volume shipments. Impressively, category volume share grew for the third consecutive quarter to 72.8%, an increase of +5.4 points year-on-year and +2 points sequentially. Retail value share also grew during the quarter to 77.4%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth again reflects a growth step-up in nationwide store velocity and gradual distribution expansion as the category gained strong traction with other nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. Now, focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth.\nWe estimate there were 28.6 million IQOS users as of 31 December 2023, representing growth of 1.2 million users in the quarter and +3.7 million for the full year. It's a nice acceleration compared to 2022. This includes notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. ILUMA is now available in essentially all major markets outside Russia and Ukraine, with over 17 million estimated adult users as of 31 December 2023. This reflects the switching of existing IQOS users and the acquisition of adult smokers. We expect ILUMA to drive continued strong IQOS user growth in 2024 and beyond. Considering the seasonal fluctuation and volatility in quarterly user estimation, we plan to report this metric on a semi-annual basis going forward.\nWith the addition of ZYN to our portfolio and the smaller but growing VEEV e-vapor business, we also intend to provide a more holistic view of our total smoke-free user base to investors. Moving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where smoke-free products made up more than 45% of Q4 net revenues. Our Q4 adjusted HTU share increased by +1.2 points to 9.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. A key driver is the growing uptake of ILUMA, which is available to around 90% of IQOS users in the region after eight further launches during the quarter. In the EU, 11 markets making up nearly 30% of regional IQOS volumes adopted the Delegated Directive to implement a Characterizing Flavor Ban on heated tobacco products and implemented Clean Shelf Policy in October.\nWhile still early days, we estimate only a small impact on offtake as consumers adjust, as well as on trade inventory levels. Indeed, Adjusted IMS volume continued to exhibit very good sequential growth and reached a record high, 12.4 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects double-digit year-on-year progression of +13% in Q4, despite the lack of growth in Ukraine. We expect the remaining EU market to adopt the Characterizing Flavor Ban in 2024 and estimate a full-year consumer adjustment impact of around 2 billion units on both shipment and IMS, representing less than 5% of regional volume and less than 2% of total PMI. This is consistent with other past flavor restrictions, such as the EU ban applied to combustible in 2020. Based on the initial data from markets that have enacted the ban, our fundamental view remains the same.\nWe do not expect a meaningful change in the structural trajectory of the category and indeed expect Europe-Adjusted IMS progression to be broadly in line with the group growth rate in 2024. Europe is also an important geography for innovation. LEVIA Zero-Tobacco HTUs were launched in the Czech Republic in mid-October through limited channels, with an encouraging initial response. We plan a broader Czech rollout later this month and further market launches this year. In Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 40% of the total industry, with IQOS driving its growth and reaching over 8.5 million adult users. In Q4, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brand increased by +3.1 points to 27.6%, with offtake share surpassing 34% in Tokyo.\nAdjusted IMS volume increased by 14.5% year-over-year for 2023 and 13.4% in Q4 alone, reaching a record high of almost 10 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. Such increasing growth in a market with already high category penetration is a clear testament to the sustainable potential of IQOS around the world. HTU shipment volume returned to a more normalized state in the fourth quarter as compared to a tough prior year inventory comparison following the substantial completion of the transition back to CIF rate in Q3. In addition to strong IQOS share gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q4 key HT offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\nEgypt continues to impress, with Cairo offtake share up +3 points to 9.4%, also noting encouraging results elsewhere in the region, such as Morocco, and Lebanon. Indonesia also saw notable progress in its capital city, especially given limited commercialization. We continue to see dynamic offtake volume growth across these important future markets, with the city shares towards the right of this chart an indication of the exciting potential. While we have already covered the margin dynamic on combustible, our 2023 commercial performance was very robust, with organic top-line growth of 5.5%. This reflects both strong pricing with notable contribution from Germany, and Indonesia, and positive share performance within a resilient international category. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.1 points in Q4 and +0.2 points in 2023, with notable contribution from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey.\nAlthough bolstered by competitor supply constraints in Egypt, which may normalize in 2024, we again achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share excluding this effect, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This remains key as our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products. This combustible share performance, combined with the structural growth of IQOS, led to an increase of +0.6 points of international cigarette and HTU share for the full year. As mentioned previously, our superior share of smoke-free products gives us a formidable platform for sustainable share gains with superior unit economics. Before we turn to the 2024 outlook, let me briefly reflect on our strong delivery over the past three years, in spite of a number of substantial headwinds.\nThe performance was clearly positive compared to our currency-neutral 2021-2023 target of more than 5% organic top-line and more than 9% bottom-line growth, supported by overall growing volumes. For the next few years, we target a similar strong volume delivery, a +6% to +8% organic net revenue CAGR, and a step-up in organic operating income growth to +8% to +10%. We target an adjusted EPS CAGR of +9% to +11% ex-currency growth at constant 2023 corporate tax rate, including an increase in net financing costs, which skews towards the first year of the period in 2024. Okay, this brings me to the outlook for 2024, where we expect a strong acceleration in smoke-free performance across IQOS volume, smoke-free net revenue, and gross profit.\nWe forecast the highest-ever absolute increase in HTU adjusted IMS volumes to deliver +14% to +16% growth in percentage terms, despite the inclusion of an estimated impact of around 2 billion units from consumer adjustment to the EU Characterizing Flavor Ban I mentioned earlier, and essentially no offtake growth in Russia. For shipment volume, we target more than 140 billion units, subject to the usual inherent volatility of shipment timing, new market launches, and potential supply chain disruption, such as the ongoing situation in the Red Sea. While shipment growth rates naturally follow adjusted IMS over time, there is a possibility of some lower inventory level compared to 2023, given the substantial completion of ILUMA launches and opportunities for working capital optimization. We expect continued excellent US ZYN volume growth to around 520 million cans.\nWe have also accelerated our capacity expansion plan to support this further significant step-up in volume and to manage inventory levels, which are naturally affected by the recent level of growth. Such a strong outlook for IQOS and ZYN means we expect to deliver an acceleration in organic smoke-free top-line growth compared to 2023, reaching close to $15 billion in net revenue at prevailing exchange rate. This supports a total PMI forecast of +6.5% to +8% organic net revenue progression, including a fourth consecutive year of total volume growth and mid-single-digit combustible pricing. We also forecast an acceleration in smoke-free gross profit growth from the organic +19% delivered in 2023, as IQOS profitability expands and ZYN excellent economics continue.\nWe expect smoke-free to again drive the lion's share of our forecast organic OI growth of +8% to +9.5%, notably given the enduring cost pressure and negative geographic mix in combustibles I just mentioned. This naturally implies organic margin expansion, even factoring in the ongoing technical dilution impact of third-party manufacturing in Indonesia. We expect a meaningful organic improvement in overall gross margin, excluding technical impact, and a very limited currency impact on adjusted OI margin. This forecast includes notable capability investment in the US, but as mentioned at Investor Day, we still expect to deliver strong double-digit operating income growth in this market. As flagged at last year's Investor Day, we anticipate an increased net financing expense this year as debt is renewed at higher rates. We forecast a range of $1.3 to 1.4 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2023.\nWe also assume a higher effective corporate tax rate due to Russia's suspension of certain double tax treaties and earnings mix. These tax and interest factors combined impact our currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth projection by around 2 percentage points. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of +7% to +9%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.32 to $6.44, including an unfavorable currency impact of $0.11 at prevailing rates. This notably includes a net favorable impact of $0.13 related to the revaluation of monetary balances in hyperinflationary economy in 2023, skewed to the second-half comparison. Moving to the shape of expected 2024 performance on a quarterly basis, we anticipate good double-digit growth in adjusted IMS HTU growth every quarter, supporting the full-year forecast of +14% to +16%.\nWe forecast a strong Q1 overall, with HTU shipment volume of 31 to 32 billion and continued strong volume growth from ZYN. We expect organic top-line and operating income growth to be broadly consistent with the full-year outlook, which implies organic margin expansion as with the full year. We project strong Q1 currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of +7% to +10%. This translates to a range of $1.37 to $1.42, including a negative currency variance of $0.10 at prevailing rates, with currency comparison improving in the second half as we lap the Argentina impact of 2023. Our business remains highly cash-generative. However, the $9.2 billion in 2023 operating cash flow was lower than expected. This was due to currency effect on net earnings, including the Argentine peso devaluation, other year-end currency impact, and higher-than-expected working capital needs.\nIn 2024, we target between $10 billion and $11 billion in operating cash flow at prevailing exchange rates and subject to working capital requirements. We continue to prioritize investing in innovation and the growth of our smoke-free portfolio. In 2024, we expect capital expenditure of around $1.2 billion, including the ZYN capacity expansion I just mentioned. Deleveraging remains a key priority for us, and as expected, our 2023 net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio was around three times, given the 2023 purchase of the remaining Swedish Match minority and the final US IQOS payment to Altria. We target much better progress of 0.3 to 0.5 times deleveraged in 2024, driven by continued EBITDA growth and strong cash flow generation. We continue to target a ratio of around two times by the end of 2026, with buyback to be considered once confirmed we are on track.\nFinally, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. I will now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for 2024. First is supporting the sustained growth momentum of IQOS for continuous innovation. This includes leveraging the rollout of ILUMA to maximize user growth while innovating further on both devices and consumables. Second is to continue the strong US growth of ZYN, supported by targeted commercial investment, long-term capacity expansion, and organizational infrastructure, which will also support IQOS. Outside the US, we intend to continue developing our integrated multi-category offering to adult nicotine users with further launches of ZYN and, where relevant, our ZYN e-vapor portfolio. Of course, 2024 will be a landmark year for IQOS in the US.\nWhile the ultimate launch of IQOS ILUMA is the main priority, we continue to prepare for the first city test of the IQOS blade-free product starting in Q2 this year. The small-scale pilot launches will allow us to experiment with different aspects of commercialization and support our drive for at-scale commercial success once ILUMA is authorized. While we have no update on the expected PMTA timeline, the patent settlement agreement announced last week allows for commercialization of both blade and induction products while mitigating risks of patent-related disruptions and enables us to leverage the scale, optimized cost, and flexibility of our global supply chain. In combustibles, we continue to target the stable category share over time, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, while taking judicious pricing actions to drive a positive profit contribution. Our capital allocation priorities are crystal clear.\nWe will continue to invest in the growth of smoke-free products, and our commitment to dividend remains steadfast. Following the acquisition of Swedish Match, the leveraging remains our key balance sheet objective. We aim to continue our excellent progress on sustainability initiatives, including those related to product impact, such as new access prevention and post-consumer waste. Finally, and importantly, we remain committed to transforming the tobacco harm reduction landscape by providing superior alternatives to adult smokers who would otherwise continue smoking and advocating for science-based regulations. We will be expanding further on many of these topics at CAGNY conference in two weeks' time. Let me now conclude today's presentation. Overall, our business delivered a strong 2023 performance in the face of notable cost headwinds driven by structural smoke-free momentum. The continued excellent performance of IQOS and remarkable growth of ZYN strengthened their position as leading brands with excellent equity.\nCombined with our unrivaled commercial and innovative capabilities, we have a powerful platform to expedite our smoke-free future as we broaden our portfolio and reach to adult smokers. We expect 2024 to be a year of accelerated growth for smoke-free products, and remain confident in our 2024-2026 growth targets. We have exciting opportunities in the US and internationally, which we are fully dedicated to capture as we progress towards our ambition of being sustainably smoke-free by 2030. Finally, and importantly, our strong growth outlook and highly cash-generative business underpins our ability to leverage while returning cash to shareholders. Thank you, and Emmanuel and I are now happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. Again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please press the star key followed by one on your touch-tone phone.\nIn the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep to a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow-up questions may be taken. You may rejoin the queue again by pressing star and then one on your touch-tone phone. Our first question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, everyone. I actually wanted to ask a high-level question on the year. You originally guided FX neutral EPS growth in 2023 of 7% to 9%, yet you really did finish out the year a lot stronger, reporting 11% currency-neutral EPS growth. So as you look back, what were some of the key areas of outperformance versus your initial expectations? And then as you think about this year, you're initially guiding the 7% to 9% FX neutral EPS growth again.\nSo just trying to understand how conservative this may be, especially considering your 9% to 11% midterm growth target.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nSo Bonnie, with regards to 2023, I think the momentum of which we have and the category has been Japan is really well thought, well thought, singled out. And despite the fact that IQOS occupies a very sizable part of the segment, I mean, we capture well above our segment share. I think we capture about 80% of the entire segment growth in Japan. So this is very strong. Japan is on the forefront of a smoke-free transformation. We're approaching this year 10th anniversary of IQOS in Japan. And if I just look over the last few weeks, how categories continuously expansion in Japan, I think in the Tokyo area, the smoke-free products now about exceeded the size of the cigarette category.\nSo if IQOS continues after 10 years participating in this phenomenal growth, this is really well singled out. Here with ZYN, and as we indicated very much, we've been very keen and very pleased that we could conclude the acquisition of Swedish Match, did add the important element of our portfolio of alternatives to smoking, the pouches, and obviously creates a very good opening for us in entering the US market. And ZYN clearly is going or is growing above the expectations. What is very important as we hear from time to time quite lightly conversations about some unintended consequences about the use of the product, I am so pleased that both IQOS and ZYN actually are delivering as they were designed for, i.e., going after adult smokers in the US above 21 years.\nWe are all familiar with the CDC data, less than 2% usage, as the same is for IQOS in international. So we have a good, in my view, we have a very good, sustainable, growing, two fabulous propositions in the smoke-free product. And we are also trying to be very focused from a financial perspective with regards to the e-vapor. So right now, roll this through to 2024. I think that Japan is on the good momentum. ZYN in the US continues this momentum. Europe is doing very strongly, very well. Yes, we have this distortion, maybe potential headwinds, which I think were very clearly indicated, the 2 billion potential impact from the flavor ban in the EU. But other than that, this key geographies and this key geographies also are very important from the margin perspective expansion. They're really on a positive side.\nI don't want to sound negative on the rest of the world. However, one thing which I know that on occasions there might be some conversations around the growth trajectory of IQOS and so on. You remember during Investors' Day, I've been very clear. We're running IQOS in the 10 consecutive years of a fabulous growth, despite the fact that we essentially lost any growth, access to any growth in Russia and Ukraine. And historically, I mean, Russia alone was delivering, and depends how you know which period you pick up, but easily about the four, maybe even five billion per annum growth of the category. So I think we need to look at this trajectory from this perspective, which makes me even more confident about our three routes.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I did want to ask a little bit more on margins.\nJust hoping for a little bit more color on your margins in Q4, especially in Americas where they were actually negative. I'm assuming, I think you called this out, key driver of this is your investments ahead of the IQOS relaunch in the US in May. So in the context of this, how should we think about operating income growth in Americas this year? Will it continue to be negative? And then for the full year of 2024, your just total company, your guidance is for FX neutral revenue growth and operating income growth does imply operating margin expansion. So could you maybe touch on your expectations for gross margin and OpEx in the context of that? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. Here's one question. Emmanuel, can you chip in with more detail? As I'm thinking the Americas segment, there is more of the impact of the devaluation in Argentina, which drove the margins down rather than the US market. Now, specifically about the US market, yes, there is the increased investment also to continue supporting ZYN growth and expansion, but also in preparing Swedish Match organizations and Philip Morris International in the US organization for being able to handle IQOS soon and obviously have the organizations which is up to the opportunities and the challenges of the US market. So there are some investments which are already flowing through the P&L even ahead of the IQOS per se start of commercialization. Emmanuel, you want to?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nJust to complement and answer your question, Bonnie, and complement with Jacek, we're seeing what is behind the higher than expected performance for 2023.\nClearly, Jacek described the very strong dynamic on the volume, on the commercial dimension, if you want. But we've been very pleased as well with the development of our margin on our smoke-free product. And we are today seeing the margin both on IQOS and on ZYN being above the average margin on CC. We are making progress on the profitability of the IQOS product, and we have some price increase in Q4 overall. So that was the planned dynamic, but it is happening, maybe even a bit better than what we're expecting, and we expect that to continue in Q4. And in that perspective, I mean, clearly the US is a fantastic market. We described the fact that the margin of ZYN in the US is best in class among our portfolio of product.\nAnd therefore, make no mistake, even if indeed we're going to continue to invest in the US, the US is going to be super nicely accretive in all parameters of our P&L at the level of the, of course, revenue growth, but also at the level of the margin evolution and at the level of the operating economy. We flagged the fact that we talk about double-digit growth and very strong double-digit growth. US is a very powerful contributor to our financial performance.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. Emmanuel, if I may just clarify something then for this year, you are expecting gross margin and possibly op margin expansion based on your guidance? It implies op margin.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes. Yes. We do. Absolutely, Bonnie. Yes.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. All right. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi. Good morning. Two questions from me. One is just to clarify the Argentine peso impact. So you have a $0.19 impact this year, which is linked to balance sheet revaluation. On the slides, you're using the Argentine peso rate, which is equal to the spot rate. So there shouldn't be any further balance sheet revaluation down, which means that there is an automatic $0.19 benefit to EPS. Isn't that the way the math works?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, Gaurav, of course, we cannot speculate on any further devaluation of the peso. The reality is that the amount in dollar term has been significantly reduced by the last devaluation. So a further devaluation would impact to a much lower amount. Now, I don't know whether more devaluation could come. Frankly, we're not able to anticipate this kind of thing.\nWhat you have to take into account is that the basis has been, in fact, halved basically with the devaluation in December. So any further devaluation would apply to a lower base in Argentinian peso.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nSure. Maybe I can ask it separately. And my second question is around ZYN. We are hearing a lot of statements. We had a statement by Chuck Schumer. A lot of investors are concerned. They think that regulation is coming on ZYN. Flavors will get banned. So how do you plan to get ahead of this entire potential controversy that could emerge around ZYN?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So as we observe over the last few weeks, quite a lot of conversations around the ZYN in social media, and generally internet and media. I think, look, ZYN is in the US market for 10 years. Okay?\nIf you look even on the CDC's latest data on the year-round average usage, etc., it stays well below 2%, which is the lowest from any product, nicotine, and also other products where there are some age restrictions applied. I think we know what the Swedish Match marketing practice is, and we were taking this very seriously during the acquisitions, the due diligence, etc. And we have said that the alignment with Swedish Match was not only that they were pursuing the smoke-free trajectory, but also that they have a very responsible and a disciplined approach to the marketing. As we are with IQOS, with Philip Morris International, we have reached out to the few people who have been the most vocal in this conversation, Senator Schumer, but also to FDA.\nAnd I think the facts are different than what sometimes is being tried to be portrayed in the media. So the product is helping adult smokers with very strict age verifications. Obviously, when it comes to the conversations among the adults in the social media, that's going a little wild, going on in a territory where we don't have controls. ZYN is not using any paid ambassadors or whatever this is being called in the social media. So we think what we're doing is pretty right. The product has the potential of a reduction of the harm, and the product is based on science positioned on the risk reduction continuum. Frankly speaking, it is the best nicotine alternative to any other nicotine products, very much obviously versus the cigarettes.\nWe have a pending PMTA with FDA, but I think the science is very strong and very conclusive on the side. So I feel very confident from the very beginning of our transformation. So with Swedish Match, we put the marketing and very much the protection of the youth very, very, very high on our agenda. So I think it gives me the confidence that, as I said earlier to Bonnie's question, we have a progress, phenomenal growth on the products which are delivered in a very sustainable manner to adult smokers.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go now to Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGood morning.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nMorning. I have a question about ZYN as well. It's seen phenomenal growth in the US. Can you talk about what's driving the acceleration in growth in ZYN in the US?\nAre there any particular regions where you're seeing stronger growth? And just on the ZYN guidance, it implies about 35% growth in US shipments, but that seems conservative given the strength that we've seen. So is there anything that would temper ZYN's growth outlook relative to what we're observing?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So it's very important to remember for investors that the profile of the ZYN when it comes to where the smokers or where the adults are coming from, the ZYN is sourcing very nicely from combustibles, obviously from the oral categories, including the tobacco-containing pouches of Swedish Snus or similar products, but also from the e-vapor category. So it is being recognized by the growing number of adults, the convenience of usage of a ZYN.\nIt is, in other way of looking at ZYN, it is a natural innovation or extension of the Swedish Snus product, the tobacco-containing pouches. Obviously, as we know them, some people were not maybe comfortable of having a tobacco in the pouch. There are some optical hygienic type of maybe constraints, etc. And ZYN is something which looks cleaner, is white, doesn't contain tobacco, which might have been for or might be for some consumer, create some resistance. So this is what I can say. I think the product has a good trajectory. The market is a large market in the US with the well-developed e-vapor category, obviously still a very sizable combustible cigarette category, and also many other oral tobacco forms. So it's a nice sourcing for ZYN, which is appealing to these audiences.\nWith regards to your comments about the number of accounts forecasted, which we put into our guidance for next year, we're very well familiar with the underlying trends in the US. Can ZYN surprise us to the positive? Yes. Okay. But guidance is built on a number of assumptions, right? I mean, it's a global business, multi-category, and there are some headwinds which we're aware of today. I'm not sure whether they will all materialize, but I think it's a matter of prudence, at this part of the year, at the beginning of the year, to single them out and be prudent. But there are also some upsides and tailwinds which we are well aware of. As the year unfolds, we'll come to the Q1. I mean, as every year, you build the confidence as you go through the year.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. And to clarify the guidance here, we are coming with growth year on year. That would be similar than the one we've been experiencing in terms of total volume growth. I'm not looking at the percentage here versus 2023 on 2022. So these are similar volume growth. It's related to reduction in the growth rate. We'll see whether here we have things going even higher than what we are forecasting for the pandemic.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thank you. That makes sense. And a question on the patent settlement with BAT. Can you elaborate on the implications of that? I know you've been investing in manufacturing capabilities in the US for IQOS. How does the settlement influence your ability to import into the US, and does it change your manufacturing strategy?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, it actually allows us now to locally connect IQOS in the US to the supply chain, which is on the international supply chain from day one, which is operating with all the benefits of economies of scale, etc. So obviously, as the mitigating type of a strategy, we have been implementing in parallel the alternative manufacturing in the US, but that obviously is the first factory, first volumes. It would obviously result in the increased or elevated cost both on the devices and HTUs. And it will take a while until the US on a standalone basis would close at the same level of the benefits of the cost, if you like, as we had on international. So for us, it clears the path for IQOS, both IQOS and ILUMA. So we're bringing a lot of or removing, I should say, uncertainty from today and going forward.\nIQOS, because it is US, is just another market which we added to the geographical family of IQOS presence from day one. We'll have an access, as I said, to the pipeline of the products, and it's the economic cost-benefits as any international market. So for us, actually, is clarity and acceleration, which we gained through this agreement. And obviously, as we all know, the patent litigation territory has a high degree of uncertainty. And we're running a very sizable business, and we plan to have even more sizable business with addition now of the US. And that clarity and the visibility going forward is very important, which I believe is also important for investors too.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. I'll pass it on.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Pam.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Faham Baig with UBS.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nHi guys. Good afternoon. Thank you for the questions.\nI have a couple as well, please. Firstly, you're guiding for another impressive year of mid-teens heated tobacco in-market sales growth. You've highlighted Europe will be within that range. But historically, Europe's done slightly better. What markets make up the sort of difference that help you to still get to the mid-teens growth, if you could allude to the larger markets? And within that, are you assuming any contribution from Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, you mentioned? And what should we expect for the US as well, please?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International",
    "content2": "So maybe I start with the US. I mean, the US, we will do the test market on IQOS 3.0, what we call IQOS 3.0 blade product, which is literally for us the IQOS.\nAnd we're looking forward to get the more visibility from FDA with regards to the PMTA, MRTPA for the IQOS ILUMA, which would allow us to accelerate the broader, more national type of the commercialization. So what we have assumed in 2024 in terms of the volume contribution of IQOS from the US is very minimal. We're more treating this as testing the engine commercial consumer-facing type of a solution rather than go with the current version of the product at the full scale. We have assumed we made some assumptions with regards to opening the markets in which IQOS today is not allowed. The three that's on the list is obviously Taiwan. Okay. That's our assumptions, and we might be right or wrong, but these are the assumptions that we made. It's obviously hinges on the speed of some regulatory decisions and the laws being fast and etc.\nWith regard to you, look, I mean, although I believe the history has shown with the flavor type of regulations in different categories in different places that over a period of time, they don't have much of an impact given at all. But we're going in a period that some markets will be implementing these regulations. So I think we need to be cautious that there might be some distortions. I mean, we put in the guidelines, and we were very transparent. It could be even potential with headwinds, which we baked in in a volume outlook for IQOS. But we'll have to see whether this materializes, not materializes. I think there's a matter of prudence, so we should talk about this. Other than that, the underlying IQOS growth, if I look at the volume or share evolution in essentially all European markets, is pretty strong.\nDespite the fact that very much in Central Europe, there is maybe more of the pricing competition from other heat-not-burn participants. But we also have a very strong price competition, extremely strong price competition, I should say, both on the devices and the consumables in Japan. And over the period of time, IQOS navigates with its highly, sometimes aggressive competitive pricing environment very well. So that's essentially where we are. Germany grows very nicely. Italy continues with a very strong growth momentum. These are the major types. Spain, we start making significant progress. So that's it from me.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you. And then just one other question, please. So you're expecting a smoke-free acceleration in 2024, but that's not translating into group net revenue growth acceleration in 2024. Are you expecting a softer performance in combustibles in 2024? Is that the discrepancy?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. I mean, this is the blended—this one I've been trying at the beginning of the year—the blended outlook for the group revenues, combustibles, oral, and obviously heat-not-burn with a few other smaller things. But we have managed last year to deliver a very strong pricing variance. I think, again, it's fair to assume that that level of a pricing variance may not be repeatable this year, but there is obviously a pricing potential which we baked in or included in the guidance. Look, for some of these things, we need a little bit more visibility to start increasing our confidence. I still believe that if I compare what Philip Morris is delivering now, number of the years when we leave the revenue top line about 7%, and you remember very well the times when we started transformations where we were at the 3% to 5%.\nNow, I think quality is what counts for us, and this is what we pay a lot of attention to, that not only we want to achieve in a sustainable manner the revenue growth, but obviously important is the quality of the revenue growth. So having a three-year total group volumes to start with above, while no decline, not even flat, but growing, then you start overlaying these by pricing and managing to, or focusing to, avoid the risk of some downtrading, etc. I think the about 7% revenue growth is pretty good from a qualitative perspective, not just from the nominal growth perspective. I would think very positive about it.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nJust to add to what Jacek has just been saying, I mean, indeed, please take into account that 2023 was exceptional when it comes to price increase. It's close to 9% on the combustibles portfolio.\nWe don't intend to repeat that. We are guiding to mid-single digit price increase for 2024. Of course, that will have an impact and make a difference on the growth of our revenue on the combustible business.\n\nFaham Baig\n\nResearch Analyst, UBS\n\nThank you very much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go next to Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHi, good morning. Thank you for the questions, guys. I just wanted to start with disposable vaping products. We've obviously seen these products have huge success in the US in 2023, and the UK also, driving a steeper volume decline for combustible cigarettes in those markets. Obviously, your combustible cigarette business in those two markets is not huge, if nonexistent, obviously, in the US. Not a huge impact on your business so far.\nBut my question is, why do you think we haven't seen equivalent success for these products in the markets that are big markets for your business and the EU in particular? And do you think this could be a threat to your business in 2024?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYou mean the threat to our business coming from e-vapor products? Look, there are a number of factors, right? So one is that I think the category of e-vapor product is being disposable, not disposable. It's very much focused in terms of the offering and innovation, frankly speaking, into the flavors, right? And we very often forget that the core of the smokers, market by market, with literally few exceptions, are very much on what I would characterize as a traditional tobacco type of experience, flavor, etc. So this creates a sort of a more dual consumption or occasional consumption.\nBut I think for some smokers, and we know it from our experience of IQOS, it actually triggers curiosity to try, but at the same time triggers the bottleneck in terms of a full-time type of a switching adoption. That's one of the factors, okay? But there are obviously other factors that are at play here.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nI guess I understand that, yes. But why hasn't that? It seems like in the US and the UK, that hasn't been an impediment to these products' success over the past 12, 18 months?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThat is also the focus, right? Because the UK was on the forefront as was the US. So I remember historically of the forefront of this category, partially, I guess, also attracted by the underlying margins in the CC category.\nObviously, people are going with the alternatives to the places, which creates some sort of the underlying margins opportunity with the relative freedoms also to talk about this product. Europe very much, but also in international, some countries, these products are not very, let me put it that way, warmly welcome. Let's leave aside the harm reduction principles, but there are some other opinions and views at play. Look, we know that when we enter the e-vapor category, that we're trying to be very disciplined, the focus, I should say. It's very easy to enter into this category without too much of the path to sustainable profitability. We don't want to defocus the company from some other opportunities which we are pursuing, which in our views are more sustainable and offer the good path for the margins and the underlying profitability.\nBut when we enter with this product, Italy, Czech, a few other markets, I mean, our products, despite the fact that we're relatively late from a category history perspective, I mean, we have gained double-digit shares in these markets in the span of less than 12 months or so. So it also tells you there is a lot of lack of loyalty in this. There's a lot of, yes, I know that we see the volumes, but there's a lot of trial. Heat-not-burn category and the pouches, judged by performance in the US, I mean, by definition, the consumer is more loyal, more focused, more disciplined in how they navigate those, so.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thank you. And I have a follow-up that is related, but maybe a slightly more philosophical question.\nIn a number of markets, and especially the US, related to some of these disposable vaping products, we've been seeing this formation of, I would describe it as, a dual-tiered market that's been forming with big legacy players such as yourselves who are sort of forced to play by the rules and hold themselves to a certain set of standards, marketing only to existing nicotine users. And all of us will have seen your video on ZYN last week, I would imagine. But at the same time, we also have a secondary set of smaller new businesses who seem to be doing basically whatever they want and often illegally, but having great success within the marketplace and attracting lots of consumers.\nI guess my question is, do you think that this dual-tier structure that seems to be forming in a number of markets structurally impairs the attractiveness of your business and your brands when it seems like you're just being forced to play on a playing field which is not level?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, look, obviously, companies like ours is not even thinking about doing something which would be against or crossing the line of regulations or even, I would say, societal expectations. So obviously, I mean, our ability to compete is, this is what you're asking, grossly different than some other operators or participants in the market, especially people who don't have a view of 10 years or 15 years outlook, but it's essentially hit-and-run almost type of operation. I think we know what has happened or what is happening in the US.\nYes, I understand some disciplining of the market is now underway, but frankly speaking, it's a long overview because there is a lot of, pardon my language, but the mess created in the market by the fact that regulators, law enforcement, and other designed for this, designated for these agencies were a bit slow. And I think it's, frankly speaking, a replica which we have for many years and still in some places have on a cigarette market. Any forms of an illicit type of participation in the market is not only marketing practices, but also products, product standards. All of these things create completely wrong distortions in the market at the expense of the legitimate tobacco category manufacturers. And also diverge the conversation from how further we can progress on the harm reductions and diverge them into the things which relatively easily should be fixed.\n\nCallum Elliott\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nOkay. Thanks, Jacek.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur final question will come from Matt Smith with Stifel.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, thank you, Jacek and Emmanuel. I wanted to ask a follow-up question about investment levels embedded in the 2024 outlook. If we consider the expectation for gross and operating profit margin expansion on an organic basis, can you talk about the areas where you're seeing a step up meaningfully in incremental investment? Last year, you called out $150 million of explicit investments, including $75 million or so in the US. It would seem like the growth in ZYN would allow you to step that investment level up while still being able to achieve your double-digit profit expectations in the market.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So in a lot of times, obviously, we target adjusted diluted EPS growth above our revenue growth. So obviously, we assume some improvement in the margins.\nBut on the other hand, I think we will have enough of the resources to support that revenue growth. So if we would completely stop investing, obviously, the expansions on the wide growth would be much more significant. Margins expansions would be much more significant, but it is not what is in our strategy. So I think once you operate at scale, and we do, right, because ZYN has the scale in the US, the revenue is very substantial over there, at least by the US, by the market standards. And the revenue which we generate from smoke-free, but also combustibles on international, with that sort of revenue growth rates, I think we have room to provide for the investments to support today's and tomorrow's growth while also allowing for the, or driving the margin expansion. We also have provided here some inflationary pressure.\nI think, especially on the combustible, we assume that 2024 is a sort of the last year of this extraordinary type of inflationary pressure. As of 2025 and onwards, we should start seeing easing on the COGS pressures, which is about the leaf and some other materials. I think every incremental IQOS and every incremental ZYN is obviously requires proportionally less of the investments that the first IQOS and the first ZYN. So I mean, the scale offers going forward this opportunity for supporting the margin.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you, Jacek. I can leave it there and pass it on.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nBefore closing our call, I'd like to remind you that we'll be presenting at the CAGNY Conference on 21 February, and we hope you'll be able to join either in person or virtually.\nThank you again for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the investor relations team, and I hope you have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you all. Speak to you soon.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",

We do appreciate your patience in holding. We ask that you please continue to stand by. Your conference will begin momentarily. Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the Question and Answer session. In order to ask a question, please press the star key followed by the number one on your telephone keypad at any time. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of Questions from the Investment Community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nWelcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 third quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for smoke free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation and additional net revenue data, are available in Exhibit 99.2, the Company's Form 8-K dated October 19th 2023, and on our Investor Relations website.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. We delivered very strong and better than expected performance in Q3, driven by IQOS and ZYN. Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an excellent +20% in currency neutral terms to reach a record quarterly high of $1.67 despite a significant adverse currency impact in the period, once again our total volumes were positive, with the Q3 progression of over +2% positioning us to deliver our third straight year of growth. While not yet in our organic metrics, ZYN continued its exceptional growth with US volumes up by 66% in Q3 and over 50% year to date with a substantial increase in category share.\nImportantly, our IQOS business delivered another strong quarter with HTU shipment growing +18% in line with the year to date trend. As covered at our recent investor day, HTU volumes have excellent unique economics relative to cigarettes and the +16.5% organic net revenue growth from smoke-free product was a key driver in both our high single digit organic top line and double digit organic operating income growth. Smoke-free products made up over 36% of total Net Revenue in the quarter as we drive toward our new ambition of over two-thirds by 2030 making us substantially smoke-free.\nIn combustibles, we delivered very robust performance with +6% growth in organic net revenues, strong pricing and higher category share despite the impact of the smoker moving to smoke-free product. Our impressive operating income growth drove organic year-on-year margin expansion and a sequential improvement compared to Q2. This includes healthy expansion in the gross margin of our IQOS business, which surpassed combustibles in the period, and lower than expected commercial costs. Overall, we are pleased to report another strong quarter, and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year and beyond.\nTurning now to the headline numbers, we surpassed $9 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time as strong positive volume and continued excellent IQOS momentum supported organic net revenue growth of 9.3%. This organic growth does not include the impressive +22% adjusted ex currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by +7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our cigarette mix and very firm combustibles pricing of +9%. This positive top line and mixed performance drove very strong organic operating income growth of 11.3% and organic margin expansion of 70 basis points. Again, this excludes the exceptional performance of Swedish Match, which is included in our Adjusted Diluted EPS.\nWe delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 20.3% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of 17%, notably due to the Russian ruble, and the balance-sheet-related currency impact in Argentina, as disclosed at our recent investor day, sequentially lower net financing costs were broadly offset by a higher tax rate. Our excellent Q3 combined with the robust H1 resulted in strong delivery year to date. I want to highlight our volume growth of +1.5% and organic net revenue growth of +7.7%, again reflecting continued dynamic IQOS performance and combustible pricing. In addition, Swedish Match currency-neutral net revenues increased by +18% excluding accounting reclassifications. Year-to-date operating income growth grew by +2.4% organically despite accentuated margin headwinds and the notable OI decline in Q1, due to the headwinds covered previously, which are now starting to succeed.\nCombined with outstanding performance, this resulted in year-to-date current adjusted diluted EPS growth of +10.7% to $4.65. This is an excellent performance. Turning now to the full year outlook. I am pleased to share that following this very strong year to date delivery, we are raising our volume organic sales growth and currency mutually adjusted bottom line growth forecast.\nFirst two volumes where we increase our outlook to +1.2% to +1.5% total shipment growth for cigarette and HTUs despite a lower expectation for the total industry. Within this, we expect to deliver HTU shipment volume within the lower half of our prior 125 to 130 billion range. While IQOS's fundamentals remain strong, this narrowing reflects a further delay to the expected market launch in Taiwan, limited underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine as well as. Some uncertainty related to inventory level in the EU, as trade partners, adjust to the upcoming HTU flavor ban. For combustible, the resilience of our portfolio is reflected in an updated forecast of a 1% to 2% cigarette volume decline. ZYN continues to perform exceptionally with strong adult consumer traction.\nFollowing a further step up in the US volume run rate, we are now increasing our full-year and nicotine pouch forecast range to 390 million to 410 million cans. Combining the improved volume outlook with robust pricing and continued positive mix, we are narrowing our organic net revenue growth forecast to around 8%, the midpoint of our previous range. As I will come back to shortly, we expect excellent organic OI growth over the second half of the year. Combining this strong profit performance with the continuation of VIM's phenomenal growth and diligent cost management allows us to raise our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast to +10% to +10.5%.\nThis means we now expect double digit growth for the third year running and translating to a full year range of $6.05 to $6.08 including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.53 at prevailing rates. Last, despite increased currency headwinds, we continue to expect operating cash flow of around $10 billion for the year. This sets us up nicely as we focus on deleveraging towards our target of around 2x adjusted net debt to EBITDA in 2026. Now let me provide a different view of our forecasted results. As you can see, 2023 has very it's been a year of two halves.\nWith a number of accentuated headwinds in H1, as explained in prior quarters, including steep cost inflation. H2 is a different story and we believe it is more reflective of the underlying trajectory of our business. First, we expect an accelerated H2 top line with organic growth of around +9%. Second, we expect a significant RE acceleration in profit growth. We continue to expect organic operating income margin expansion in H2, and we are well on track after delivering another quarter of sequential adjusted OI margin improvement in Q3, with margins also expanding organically year on year. In H2, we expect strong organic operating income growth of around 10%. For the full year, our expectation remains that organic margin evolution will be towards the lower end of our -50 to -150 basis point range including the expected technical margin impact of around 40 basis points from third party arrangement in Indonesia and Ukraine.\nFor Q4 we expect strong operating income growth with broadly stable year on year organic margin progression. This includes the expectation of higher devices as we accelerate our ILUMA rollout to reach around 50 markets by year end. Complemented by further ILUMA device innovation. This very positive organic OI trajectory in H2 naturally translates into an acceleration in consensus adjusted diluted EPS growth bolstered by Swedish Match. Now turning back to our results, our total shipment volumes increased by +2.2% for Q3 and +1.5% year to date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver our third sequential year of growth. HTU shipment volumes grew by +18% in Q3 2020 to reach 32.5 billion units, driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan.\nAdjusting for inventory movement, including the transition back to sea freight, Q3 adjusted IMS grew by +14.4%. This includes Europe at +16% despite heightened competitive activity, notably in Poland. A more normalized growth rate in Japan of +12%. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, where growth remains limited, our adjusted IMS advanced by a very robust +16%. This growth rate excludes the excellent development of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by +19% in Q3 and +14% year to date on a pro forma basis, including the US growth of ZYN of +66% and +56% respectively.\nIf we were to add the growth of nicotine pouches on a unit basis our Q3 performance: smoke-free volume grew by +19.5%, and our total volumes by +2.5%. Cigarette volume declined by a modest 0.5% in Q3 with strong performance in Turkey and Egypt and by 1.3% year to date, reflecting solid category share performance in a resilient category despite robust pricing. I will now walk through the mechanics of our Q3 net revenues. In addition to +2.2% volume growth, pricing contributed plus 6.2 points of growth as Combustibles remained strong and the negative impact on HTU pricing of the annualization of excise tax increases in Japan and Germany notably moderated. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business continues to be a consistent top line driver reflecting higher net revenue per unit.\nThe positive mix impact of HTUs overall volume growth and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. We expect ZYN to enhance this further as it starts to be included in our organic metrics from mid Q4. Looking now at adjusted operating income, where the $3.7 billion delivered in Q3 is also a record high, I am pleased to report that following peak margin headwind in Q1, our organic growth has accelerated nicely as inflation, supply chain disruption, and ILUMA-related factors continue to moderate and the underlying dynamics of our transformation bear fruits.\nThe Q3 progression is slightly above our 2024 to 2026 CAGR target of 8% to 10% organic operating income growth, and as I covered earlier, we expect our overall H2 OI growth to be around the top of this range. This strong operating income growth in excess of an already healthy top line performance drove a better than expected organic margin expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. This was also the first quarter this year where Gross Margin expanded organically, notably due to lower shipping cost, ILUMA margin improvement, and lower device sales compared to the prior year.\nSGNA costs were also organically lower as a percentage of net revenue reflecting a good cost performance and some phasing. Between Q3 and Q4 we delivered a further $120 million in gross cost efficiencies, and in Q3, now surpassing our $2 billion target for 2023. We aim to continue this run rate as reflected in our 2026 target of an incremental $2 billion in gross savings. The Q3 margin currency variance includes a 0.6-point impact from the Argentina balance-sheet-related item I mentioned earlier. By its nature, this does not carry forward to future periods.\nNow moving to Swedish Match which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory as we progress towards becoming substantially smoke-free by 2030. Swedish Match business delivered excellent adjusted currency neutral net revenue growth of +22% in Q3 and +18% year to date. This means that our adjusted pro forma year-to-date top-line growth was 60 basis points higher at +8.3%. Swedish Match strong profitability also enhanced our yea- to-date adjusted operating income margin by +70 basis points. As we covered at Investor Day, Swedish Match smoke-free portfolio has excellent economics and is already a significant size compared to total PMI with its product contribution or operating profit before G&A. To be clearer, approaching 1/4 of our total smoke-free business year to date.\nZYN remains the key performance driver as it delivered another remarkable US performance with 66% volume growth reflecting positive momentum across the country. Elsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gain in US Moist Snuff as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia broadly continued. We continue to be very pleased with the positive impact of Swedish Match on our company, and I would like to thank the team for delivering such a great performance.\nNow let's examine ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Exceptional progress continued in Q3 with an increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume growth of +52% compared to Q3 2022 and +14% sequentially. Impressively, ZYN Q3 category volume share grew to 70.8% which is +4.7 points higher year-on-year and +2.5 points sequentially. Retail value share remains strong at around 76%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth reflect progressive increase in distribution and a further broad step up in nation one store velocity as the category gains strong traction with adult nicotine user for its convenience and pleasurable experience.\nNow focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth, we estimate they were 27.4 million IQOS users as of 30 September 2023. This represents an increase of 3.7 million users versus one year ago and 0.2 million compared to Q2 2023. As shown on the right hand side of the slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower user growth due to the seasonal influences in the calculation. Both new user registration and devices to legal age smokers continue to advance strongly. And at levels broadly in line with Q2 when users grew by 1.4 million sequentially.\nAlso, as in prior years, we expect a substantial acceleration in user growth in Q4. Moving now to IQOS in Europe region where our Q3 HTU share increased by +1.3 points to 8.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Continued share gains include the growing take up of ILUMA, which is available to over 80% of IQOS users in the region. In addition to Q3 launches in Denmark and in the UK, ILUMA was launched in Poland, which, like Japan, is a market with high competitive activity.\nWe look forward to driving its performance year over the coming quarters. While sequential share is as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of +16% in Q3 despite limited growth in Ukraine. We expect strong IMS volume growth to continue in Q4 with a corresponding increase in market share.\nIn the EU, a majority of member states have transposed a delegated directive withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban into national law. The ban in those markets will be effective as of 23 October, and the remaining markets are expected to adopt in 2024. As previously mentioned, we are adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition, and while short-term volatility is possible, including in year-end trade inventories, we do not expect significant change in the structural growth of the category.\nIn Japan, IQOS ILUMA celebrated its second anniversary of the national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU Brands increased by three points in Q3 year-over-year to 26.6%. Importantly, adjusted in-market sales volume again grew sequentially on the four-quarter moving average, reaching over 10 billion units for the first time in Q3 2023 as IQOS outgrew the heated tobacco category.\nIn addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q3 shipment to Japan also benefited from further switching back to sea freight during the quarter. This shift is now substantially progressed and we expect a more normalized rate of HTU shipment in Q4. Our premium price TEREA HTUs and mainstream and SENTIA HTUs continued to grow individually and in aggregate, reaching in Q3 HTU shares of around 18% and 8% respectively despite the impact of seasonality. Our Japan cigarette shares also continue to progress with a number reaching over 30%.\nWe continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQ gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low- and middle-income markets. This slide highlights a selection of Q3 key category share across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We see notable ongoing success in Egypt with Marlboro IQOS share up 3.5 points to almost 9% and in Santo Domingo as our leading Latin America city with offtake share around 8%.\nMost promising is the 3.1% offtake share in Europe and Jakarta where IQOS is only available via the IQOS Club Members program. We continue to see robust offtake volume growth across this important future market despite seasonal effect on sequential share metrics. I'd like to spend a moment now on Combustibles where our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of +6.2% in Q3 and +5.6% year to date. This reflects another strong quarter of pricing with notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia, with better than expected pricing in Q3 of +9% and +8.6% year to date. We now forecast a full year increase of +8% to +8.5%.\nOur cigarette category share grew by +0.6 points in Q3 and +0.3 points year to date. This reflects notable contribution from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey resulting in only modest volume declines. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last two years, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.\nThis combustibles share performance combined with the structural growth of IQOS supports robust overall market share gains. We captured ±0.9 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q3 and ±0.7 points year to date as covered at Investor Day. Our superior share of smoke-free product give us a formidable platform for sustainable market share gains with superior unit economics.\nNow let me update you briefly on our exciting innovation and expansion activities, which will be critical as we aim to reach over 2/3 smoke-free net revenue by 2030, including 60 markets over 50%, and 40 markets of over 75%, as we covered at Investor Day. The global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues. We launched ILUMA in four markets in Q3, reaching 27 markets in total, which represent around 75% of our IQOS business by volume. Iluma continues to generate excellent growth with upgrades from existing user and new user acquisition.\nWith a further six market launches already this month, we expect ILUMA to be present in around 50 markets by year end and to essentially complete the rollout next year. As also mentioned during Investor Day, Superior Tobacco taste is critical to our ongoing success, and we are further exploring complex new test spaces to enhance our tobacco flavor experience.\nOn the other end of the consumer preference spectrum, we will be offering zero-tobacco consumable for non-tobacco flavored discovery under the LEVIA brand. Just as Nicotine Pouches are an evolution from Snus to make the oral category relevant to more adult smokers, LEVIA is a similar non-tobacco evolution for IQOS as we broaden our offering to increase switching away from combustibles.\nThe US represents the most significant opportunity to drive accelerated smoke-free growth at both the top and bottom line. We are continuing to invest behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 2024 and a scaled up rollout with ILUMA. Once authorized, we remain on track to file for IQOS ILUMA's PMTA and MRTPA this month. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key mid to long term focus notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. During Q3, we relaunched ZYN in Switzerland, following positive regulatory developments rolled out ZYN in Finland.\nMoving now to Sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of Combustibles by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products which are designed and marketed for adult use remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy as we become a more sustainable business with accelerated growth and returns over time. With regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that The Science Based Targets initiative validated our Forest, Land, and Agriculture emission reduction target a recognition achieved by very few companies. We pledge to reduce this absolute Scope 3 emissions by 33% by 2030, which is significant given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company's decarbonization strategy. In September, almost 20,000 employees in over 60 countries participated in World Cleanup Day, showcasing our commitment to raising awareness around littering as part of our wider strategy to reduce post-consumer waste.\nWe have long expressed our support for more rigor in sustainability-related reporting, and welcome recent moves toward greater consistency in standards under strong governance framework. As part of our ongoing work, we provided responses to consultation requests from the International Sustainability Standards Board to help shape the development of their work plan, and update to the SASB standards. PMI continues to be recognized by organizations such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development as a leader in non-financial reporting. We have much more to share on our sustainability efforts and transformation.\nJacek will be presenting at the CECP CEO Investor Forum in New York on November 14th and the event is open to all those who would like to attend. To conclude today's presentation, we continue to deliver sustainable growth through our transformation. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business give us confidence in strong full-year results based on volume growth, positive mix, pricing, and cost management. Considering the headwinds faced notably in the first part of the year, we believe this speaks strongly to the fundamentals of our growth model.\nNotably, the outstanding performance of IQOS and ZYN continues further enhancing our position as the global smoke-free champion. We have exciting plans to accelerate our smoke-free future in both the US, the largest smoke-free market and internationally. We are confident in our 2024-2026 CAGR target of +6% to 8% organic top line growth, +8% to +10% organic operating income growth, and +9% to +11% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth. We also have a clear guiding objective with our new ambition to be substantially smoke-free by net revenue in 2030 as another key milestone on our journey toward a smoke-free future. And finally, with our latest dividend raise in September, we have delivered 16 years of continuous dividend increase since our 2008 spin, despite the ups and downs of economic and currency cycle.\nThis translates to a cumulative 183% increase and CAGR of 77.2% since 2008 with an annualized dividend of $5.20. As this demonstrates our commitment to shareholder returns through progressive dividends remain steadfast. Thank you very much, and we are now, extremely happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference. Again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep to a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow up questions may be taken. You may rejoin the queue by again pressing star one. Our first question will come from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning Vivien.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSo I'd like to start with ZYN please. Clearly a very impressive result with continued acceleration in the top line. Emmanuel, you talked about distribution gains. I was hoping you could just level set. How much more runway do you see from a distribution standpoint? Certainly this remains a velocity driven story. I would think so. That would be question one and then the follow up will just be on the margins which came in way ahead of expectations. You called out very strong cost management, that's clearly apparent. I'd love to hear your perspective on the durability of the current margin level for ZYN, please. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Vivien. So on ZYN and of course every quarter will bring its new, I would say, load of news and I think we have been seeing in Q3 another great quarter of acceleration in the velocity. That means that where the brand is already even nicely present, we see the consumer uptake accelerating. It just shows that these products are becoming more relevant for a growing number of adult users and that's great news. There is also the geographical dimension which we elaborated at the time of our Investor Day, and which is showing that while the brand has a certain level our presence on the western part of the US doesn't mean that it isn't going to grow further, but it's, of course, bigger than the rest of the country.\nThere seems to be a trajectory that is saying that the rest of the country is going to adopt it progressively, and that is indeed giving also a nice, I would say, trajectory on further growth in the coming quarters and years. Of course, we talk here about probably years of very nice growth. So it's great that we have behind ZYN, too, engine, which is really where. The brand is already with the biggest presence. We don't see any decrease in the consumer adoption, and we see increase what we call the velocity, and we see progressively, I think as well, quarter after quarter, this geographical momentum building up as expected.\nNow on the margin. Yes, it's true that this growth of ZYN is extremely positive when it comes to margin. Of course we are going to continue to invest beyond this growth potential in the US and we will put the necessary commercial resources to make sure that we maximize the growth potential. But I said ZYN is really best in class in terms of gross margin for our product at the group level. I'm talking about ZYN in the US, but globally nicotine pouch enjoy nice margin, but ZYN in the US is best in class. That means, of course, that growing ZYN is excellent news for top line but also for bottom line. I think that in the growth of the adjusted earnings per share over the quarter, this is absolutely visible.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Bonnie.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nI had a question on your HTU shipment volume for the year. You know, you mentioned you're now expecting to come in within the lower half of your guidance, and then you highlighted a few reasons for this, including, you know, the uncertainty related to inventory levels in Europe given the upcoming flavor ban. So could you give us a sense of maybe where inventory levels are at right now, and then, you know, maybe how many quarters you expect some of this unwind to happen. And then just thinking about the trade, you know, is this being offset in any way with, you know, I'm just thinking about combustible cig inventories, or, you know, really how is the trade responding to this ban?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, so I think it's, it's of course something on which we will be able to elaborate once we have been landing the year after the ban put in place on where the countries are implementing it at the end of October. It's not the case in all countries. One of the questions we have is, with some reduction, with some SKUs, does it mean that they are globally going to reduce the level of inventory and can this impact the level of shipment toward the year end? I think we're flagging that because of course we continue to be with the view that this ban should not ultimately bring major disruption. We've been elaborating on many occasions on why we think that this ban is not going to ultimately change the dynamic in the category.\nBut it's true that we have some question mark on the lending for the reason I've just been describing on the level of inventory. That's why we are mentioning to make sure that we are as clear as possible on the possible, I would say temporary effect that this could generate. Now when I look at our shipment for the year, so we are clarifying the Latin America. When I look at the 2023 performance versus 2022 performance, that would mean even in the low end of the bracket an acceleration in terms of growth versus the goals that we experienced in 2022 in terms of incremental billion of sticks being sold. And of course shipments are as we know what we are selling.\nWhat is probably more important is the consumer offtake and here frankly we see the momentum continuing with no change. I think the Q3 number, where we have seasonality, but when we look at Q3, what we expect for Q4, we are very much with the same strong 15% to 16% IMS growth. We are in line with what we have experienced last year. That shows. And by the way, it's a percentage on a higher base. In fact, in volume, that means that the volume growth is higher. So we don't see any change in the momentum. We see a lot of strength in the growth, and that's visible in the volume, in the market share that we are reporting today with Q3.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of another question I just wanted to ask on your new IQOS users in the quarter, it did come in a bit light. You highlighted that this is normal quarterly seasonal trend. So maybe could you talk through that a bit further for us, and then maybe what other drivers might be impacting this, and essentially how much visibility do you have in terms of Q4? You mentioned you expect a substantial acceleration in user growth this quarter. So just kind of wanted to verify what you're seeing so far in October gives you that confidence. And is it realistic to assume a typical one million average quarterly run rate moving forward? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Bonnie. So actually last year we were flat in terms of user acquisition. So we're doing better this year than last year in terms of user evolution. And I think we are in line with what we experienced in 2021, if I remember. Well, I think we've been showing the numbers. So that's a typical pattern for Q3, which is due to the methodology on how we calculate the user growth. I think we have today. As I said, the element of the momentum, what we are seeing on people buying the device, on people registering, that is pointing to the fact that we see the same momentum, and that there is no change.\nLast year we finished the year with a strong user growth, and we target to do the same this year. I have to say it's remarkably stable in the strength, if I can use this expression. As I said, we could be at the end of the day, in fact, growing in shipments and in IMS volume more than last year. If the percentage is about the same, again, the basis being higher, it means that we're going to increase in terms of volume differential year on year.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. I have a question on the US cigar side of things. You know, clearly the FDA sent this rulemaking process to ban flavored cigars to the OMB. First, how will you address that? And secondly, if I look at the reported numbers on cigars, it seems that the revenue had a pretty steep decline this quarter. Can you help us understand what's happening there?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSo, on the trend, we've been increasing price. I mean, the cigar had been below a certain threshold for a period of time, and we decided to move above this threshold, which was $1 for two. And there is a time for adaptation. And that explains why on volume, we are impacted this year. But I don't think it reflects what's going to happen on the long term, where we continue to have very good brands and with a lot of consumer support.\nFrankly, on the flavor, will you allow me not to speculate? I mean, I don't know exactly what are the plan, what it's going to mean, how long it would take, what is decided. And again, nobody knows what could be decided, how long it's going to take to be implemented. So I'm not going to speculate at that stage on what would be our answer and what we would do, because I'm not going to be relevant on anything I could be saying at that stage.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you. My second question is on FY24 EPS. What's the base we should use to project that? Because I heard in the call that the Argentine balance sheet revaluation impact, which is about $0.06, that will not recur in FY 2024. So we should add that to FY 2023 EPS. Could you also just comment on Russia exposure in the FCF accretion?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes. So this is a technical comment on Argentina. Gaurav, you're absolutely right. You know, this is a Forex impact. That is a kind of one-off if you want, because that is impacting this year. But next year we're not starting with based on our profit that is decreased by that. It's just something that you need to work on your balance sheet exposure. But what is taken is taken. I mean, of course, depending on the evolution of the Argentina peso in the future. But I don't have anything to say at that stage.\nI think I just wanted to clarify this technical impact on Russia, frankly, versus when we met three weeks ago. There is nothing new to report on the Russian situation. This is a market where, of course, we are being very significantly impacted on the profits reported in dollars because of the very strong weakening of the Russian ruble versus the dollar. That is one of the, if not the biggest, impact this year on Forex. That is, of course, I would say, mechanically reducing our exposure to Russia in our profit. That's mechanical. And we are, as we already said, we are seeing very limited growth in Russia. That is a market where, as we've been saying, we've been reducing our commercial activity. And that's not the market where we're investing. And that is translating, of course, on the performance of this market.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Gaurav.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi Pam, good morning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI have a question on the Combustibles business. It's been exceeding expectations, and you've taken up your guidance for volumes on the Combustibles strength. Can you talk about what's driving the performance in this category despite the acceleration in pricing growth?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nI'm happy to do that. So yes, combustible is being resilient. We have a decline, but it's a modest decline in Q3. Let's be clear, this is driven by a few markets where we see a nice share gain. One is Turkey, the other one is Egypt. As you can imagine, they are not markets with great profitability per stick. So let's be very clear. We have a nice performance on combustibles, on volume to some extent on revenue. All the great work that we are doing now on increasing OI and growing margin is first and foremost driven by our smoke-free product IQOS first, ZYN second, and not by the CC. So yes, great performance when it comes to volumes, great performance versus the decline that we may have seen in the past few years.\nGood impact on revenue. We've been doing good on price increase as well. But remember that's a category on which we've seen a lot of inflation on our cost and part of the growth is generated by markets with low profitability.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. And then on ZYN, when do you expect to hear a decision from the FDA on ZYN's PMTA applications? And how are you thinking about the prospects for ZYN flavor approvals considering the FDA has recently issued unfavorable decisions around flavored e-cig products?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, we discussed that three weeks ago, and there is nothing new on the PMTA. We don't know what's going to be the timeline. It's at the discretion of the FDA, and we see that a lot of things are taking a significant time to the decision to be taken. Let me make a couple of comments on this PMTA process. Nevertheless, the first one is that we have with our SMART product and with general an MRTPA of level one. So the FDA has been recognized that these products are representing reduced risk versus combustibles and with very clear health benefit claim.\nWe believe that by nature this product should be considered as equally good if not better. And we believe that they have the potential to really convince millions of smokers to move away from combustible cigarettes to have a better way of consuming nicotine. So we are really hopeful that the FDA will really take that as a very important element, and that it's important to make this product available for nicotine user in the US. Now, on the flavor, because I think that was probably one of your questions, for the same reason we believe it is important that the consumer has a choice of flavor if it is a reason for them to move away from combustible cigarette to this better product. Having said that, we have the example of a ban on flavor in California.\nThe reality is that there was an adjustment during a couple of months and then the growth resumed without flavor in California, and we are today very, very significantly. I think we are close to 30% above the pre-ban level in California. So it shows that these products are extremely attractive and resonate with the nicotine user, with the smokers and with other nicotine users beyond the flavor, which is very good news.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Pam.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning, Matt Smith.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nIf we take the full year organic profit margin guidance, the down 150 basis points or so, and the year-to-date performance along with your commentary around kind of a flattish year-over-year performance in Q4, can you talk about some of the factors in Q4? I understand there's a lot of crosswinds here, but you get the benefit of Swedish Match rolling into the organic base. And then you mentioned you've completed the shift back to sea freight for HTU consumables in Japan. So can you talk about some of the headwinds to margin in Q4? Maybe some detail around your expectations around the incremental ILUMA launches or any other factors would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure. So indeed there are going to be some mix impact in Q4 and notably on the devices as we are rolling out ILUMA in significant number of new markets. We're also launching some new innovation in some markets on the ILUMA device that's going to generate, I would say significantly accelerated activity on our device sales and that is having a negative impact on the margin. So that's going to be clearly one element.\nThen, on top of that, there will be certainly some investment during the fourth quarter, and that is having an impact on the margin. And then you can have some mix coming from geographies, and then and other mix element. But that is what is today behind the guidance of around flat, and it doesn't mean that it can be a bit positive. But today we are seeing this around stability situation for our OI margin year on year organically for Q4.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. And just as a follow up, when you talk about investments in the fourth quarter, should we think of that as a sequential step up in investment relative to the level in the third quarter or is that more of a year over year higher investment compared to the fourth quarter of 2023, and I'll leave it there?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nI think you should. Yeah, I think you should expect certainly continuation of significant level of investment as we are accompanying the growth of our star product IQOS and ZYN. That should probably mean quarter on quarter. I would say sequential increase and still significant growth versus last year.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nMorning Emmanuel. Hope all well.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning Owen.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nI just wanted to ask also ZYN very, very strong in the US but wanted to ask about pouches ex US. So volumes only flat versus Q2 for Scandi and ex Scandi. And you mentioned you also had relaunches in Switzerland and Finland during the quarter. So I was just wondering how you see the near term outlook for volumes ex US. Do you expect any meaningful acceleration over the next several quarters? And then a second question linked to that. There's some increasing chatter now that the EU is looking to potentially ban pouches as part of the new TPD. Does this impact how you think about investing in the space ex US near term? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Yeah, so we have this situation in Scandinavia on nicotine pouches where the product is already present, mainly in Sweden where it's a nicely growing market. That's not where we enjoy the biggest market share. We are globally year to date growing on nicotine pouch in Sweden. But we're not talking about big volumes here as we have our strong leadership in Sweden on Snus. Outside Scandinavia, we are just at the beginning so, yes, we are launching so we explained that we've been launching in Switzerland, Finland, as well in the Nordics. There will be more markets to come now. It's going to be, hopefully nice, but it's going to be small versus what we see in the US.\nYou see what I mean? So it's going to be difficult to see, given the strength of that we are seeing in the US to see volume outside the US showing their strength now. Yes, it's going to add very nicely additional numbers, but again it's not going to be huge compared to the US. We'll see with TPD if there is any decision taken around nicotine pouch. Of course. If there is anything decided that on that respect, which we don't know today, that may influence the way we invest on this category in the EU. But frankly, at that stage it's too early to say because we don't know what's going to be discussed, if anything on that one, and therefore we'll see.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you sir. Appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Andrei Condrea with UBS.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning, Emmanuel. Just one from me please. I know it's a bit of a topic du jour, but the GLP-1 drug, obviously there's been talk about it having anti-addictive properties. Do you think this could be an issue for PMI in the long term? Rather. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, frankly, I mean I've been hearing things about that. I mean, I don't know what the assumption is, everybody going to be under GLP-1 and therefore, you know, they're going to drive massive change in consumer behavior.\nYou know, I'm not even able to tell you what would be the impact for somebody who is a nicotine user and is going to take GLP-1. I'm not sure we have any serious study on human behavior on that that is going to say that. First of all, I don't know how broad the usage of this medicine as drug is going to be. Second, I don't know what's going to be the potential impact. So, I'm not sure that today we can say anything relevant that makes sense on that topic. Frankly.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nNo, that makes sense.Thank you very much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Emmanuel for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, this is James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the investor relations team. Thank you again and have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Talk to you soon.\nBye bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.\nSam.\nSa.\nSam.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nSa.\nGood day and welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

    "content2": "Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2023 third quarter results. The press release is available on our website at pmi.com.\nA glossary of terms including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures for non-GAAP financial measures cited in this presentation and additional net revenue data are available in Exhibit 99.2 to the Company's Form 8-K dated 19 October 2023 and on our investor relations website.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. We delivered very strong and better than expected performance in Q3, driven by IQOS and ZYN. Adjusted Diluted EPS grew by an excellent +20% in currency neutral terms to reach a record quarterly high of $1.67 despite a significant adverse currency impact in the period. Once again our total volumes were positive with the Q3 progression of over +2% positioning us to deliver our third straight year of growth.\nWhile not yet in our organic metrics, ZYN continued its exceptional growth with US volumes up by ±66% in Q3 and over 50% year to date with a substantial increase in category share. Importantly, our IQOS business delivered another strong quarter with HTU shipment growing ±18%.\nIn line with the year to date trend as covered at our recent investor day. HTU volumes have excellent unique economics relative to cigarettes and the +16.5% organic net revenue growth from smoke-free product was a key driver in both our high-single-digit organic top line and double-digit organic operating income growth.\nSmoke-free products made up over 36% of total net revenue in the quarter as we drive toward our new ambition of over 2/3 by 2030 making us substantially smoke-free. In combustibles, we delivered very robust performance with +6% growth in organic net revenues, strong pricing and higher category share despite the impact of the smoker moving to smoke-free product.\nOur impressive operating income growth drove organic year-on-year margin expansion and a sequential improvement compared to the second quarter. This includes healthy expansion in the gross margin of our IQOS business which surpassed combustibles in the period and lower than expected commercial cost.\nOverall, we are pleased to report another strong quarter, and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year and beyond. Turning now to the headline numbers. We surpassed $9 billion in quarterly net revenues for the first time as strong positive volume and continued excellent IQOS momentum supported organic net revenue growth of 9.3%. This organic growth does not include the impressive +22% adjusted ex currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN.\nOur organic net revenue per Unit grew by +7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our SEV mix, and very firm combustible pricing of +9%. This positive top line and mixed performance drove very strong organic operating income growth of 11.3% and organic margin expansion of 70 basis points. Again, this excludes the exceptional performance of Swedish Match, which is included in our Adjusted Diluted EPS.\nWe delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of ±20.3% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.17. Notably due to the Russian ruble and the balance sheet related currency impact in Argentina as disclosed at our recent Investor Day. Sequentially lower net financing costs were broadly offset by a higher tax rate. Our excellent third quarter combined with the robust H1 resulted in strong delivery year to date. I want to highlight our volume growth of +1.5% and organic net revenue growth of +7.7% again reflecting continued dynamic IQOS performance and combustible pricing.\nIn addition, Swedish Match currency neutral net revenues increased by +18% excluding accounting reclassifications year to date. Operating income grew by +2.4% organically, despite accentuated margin headwind and the notable OI decline in Q1 due to the headwinds covered previously, which are now starting to subside. Combined with outstanding performance, this resulted in year-to-date currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of +10.7% to $4.65. This is an excellent performance. Turning now to the full year outlook.\nI am pleased to share that following this very strong year to date delivery, we are raising our volume organic sales growth and currency neutral adjusted bottom line growth forecast. First, total volumes where we increased our outlook to +1% to +1.5% total shipment growth for cigarettes.\nAnd HTUs, despite a lower expectation for the total industry within this, we expect to deliver HTU shipment volume within the lower half of our prior $125 billion to $130 billion range. While IQOS's fundamentals remain strong, this narrowing reflects a further delay to the expected market launch in Taiwan, limited underlying growth in Russia and Ukraine, as well as some uncertainty related to inventory level in the EU as trade partners adjust to the upcoming HTU flavor ban. For combustibles, the resilience of our portfolio is reflected in an updated forecast of 1% to 2% cigarettes volume decline.\nZYN continued to perform exceptionally with strong adult consumer traction. Following a further step up in the US volume run rate. We are now increasing our full-year nicotine pouch forecast range to 390 million to 410 million cans. Combining the improved volume outlook with robust pricing and continued positive mix, we are narrowing our organic net revenue growth forecast to around +8%, the midpoint of our previous range.\nAs I will come back to shortly, we expect excellent organic OI growth over the second half of the year. Combining this strong profit performance with the continuation of ZYN's phenomenal growth and diligent cost management allows us to raise our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth forecast to +10% to +10.5%.\nThis means we now expect double digit. Growth for the third year running and translating to a full year range of $6.05 to $6.08 including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of 50% at prevailing rates. Last, despite increased currency headwinds, we continue to expect operating cash flow of around $10 billion for the year. This sets us up nicely as we focus on deleveraging towards our target of around 2x adjusted net debt to EBITDA in 2026.\nNow let me provide a different view of our forecasted results. As you can see, 2023 has very it's been a year of two halves. With a number of accentuated headwinds in H1 as explained in prior quarters, including steep cost inflation. H2 is a different story and we believe it is more reflective of the underlying trajectory of our business. First, we expect an accelerated H2 top line with organic growth of around plus 9%. Second, we expect a significant reacceleration in profit growth.\nWe continue to expect organic operating income margin expansion in H2, and we are well on track after delivering another quarter of sequential adjusted OI margin improvement in Q3, with margins also expanding organically year on year. In H2 we expect strong organic operating income growth of around 10% for the full year. Our expectation remains that organic margin evolution will be towards the lower end of our -50 to -150 basis points range including the expected technical margin impact of around 40 basis points from third-party arrangement in Indonesia and Ukraine. For Q4 we expect strong operating income growth with broadly stable year on year organic margin progression. This includes the expectation of higher devices as we accelerate our ILUMA rollout to reach around 50 markets by year end complemented by further ILUMA device innovation. This very positive organic OI trajectory in. H2 naturally translates into an acceleration in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth bolstered by Swedish Match.\nNow turning back to our results, our total shipment volume increased by +2.2% for Q3 and +1.5% year to date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver our third sequential year of growth. HTU shipment volumes grew by +18% in Q3 to reach 32.5 billion units driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. Adjusting for inventory movement including the transition back to sea freight, Q3 adjusted IMS grew by +14.4%. This includes Europe at +16% despite heightened competitive activity, notably in Poland and a more normalized growth rate in Japan of +12%.\nExcluding Russia and Ukraine where growth remains limited, our adjusted IMS advanced by a very robust +16%. This growth rate excludes the excellent development of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by +19% in Q3 and +14% year to date on a pro forma basis including the US growth of ZYN of +66% and +56% respectively.\nIf we were to add the growth of nicotine pouches on a unit basis, our Q3 performance smoke-free volume combustibles by +19.5% and our total volume by +2.5%. Cigarette volume declined by a modest volume 0.5% in Q3 with strong performance in Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.3% year to date, reflecting solid category share performance in a resilient category despite robust pricing. I will now walk through the mechanics of our Q3 net revenues. In addition to +2.2% volume growth, pricing contributed +6.2 points of growth as combustibles remained strong and the negative impact on HTU pricing of the annualization of excise tax increases in Japan and Germany notably moderated. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business continues to be a consistent top line driver reflecting higher net revenue per unit. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth.\nWe expect ZYN to enhance this further as it starts to be included in our organic metrics from mid Q4. Looking now at adjusted operating income where the $3.7 billion delivered in Q3 is also a record high. I am pleased to report that following peak margin headwind in Q1 our organic growth has accelerated nicely, as inflation, supply chain disruption, and ILUMA-related factors continue to moderate and the underlying dynamics of our transformation bear fruits. The Q3 progression is slightly above our 2024-2026 CAGR target of +8% to +10% organic operating income growth, and as I covered earlier, we expect our overall H2 OI growth to be around the top of this range.\nThis strong operating income growth in excess of an already healthy top line performance drove a better than expected organic margin expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. This was also the first quarter this year where gross margin expanded organically, notably due to lower shipping costs, ILUMA margin improvement, and lower devices compared to the prior year.\nSG&A costs were also organically lower as a percentage of Net Revenue reflecting a good cost performance and some phasing between Q3 and Q4, we delivered a further $120 million in gross cost efficiencies in Q3, now surpassing our $2 billion target for 2023.\nWe aim to continue this run rate as reflected in our 2024-2026 target of an incremental $2 billion in gross savings. The Q3 margin currency variant includes a 0.6 point impact from the Argentina balance sheet related item I mentioned earlier. By its nature this does not carry forward to future periods. Now moving to Swedish Match which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke free growth trajectory as we progress towards becoming substantially smoke free by 2030.\nSwedish Match business delivered excellent adjusted currency neutral net revenue growth of +22% in Q3 and +18% year to date. This means that our adjusted pro forma year-to-date top-line growth was 60 basis points higher at +8.3%. Swedish Match strong profitability also enhanced our year-to-date adjusted income margin by +70 basis points.\nAs we covered our Swedish Match smoke-free portfolio has excellent economics and is already a significant size compared to total PMI with its product contribution to operating profit before G&A. To be clearer, approaching 1/4 of ours total smoke-free business year to date.\nZYN remains the key performance driver as it delivered another remarkable US performance with +6.66% volume growth reflecting positive momentum across the country.\nElsewhere in smoke-free, three recent trends of share gain in US moist snuff as well as category mix headwind in Scandinavia broadly continued.\nWe continue to be very pleased with the positive impact of Swedish Match on our company, and I would like to thank the team for delivering such a great performance. Now let's examine ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Exceptional progress continued in Q3 with an increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume growth of +52% compared to Q3 2022 and +14% sequentially.\nImpressively, ZYN Q3 category volume share grew to 6.1%-7.8%, which is 4.7 points higher year-on-year, and +2.5 points sequentially. Retail value share remains strong at around 76%, highlighting ZYN's premium positioning and superior brand equity. This accelerated growth reflect progressive increase in distribution and further growth stepped up in national one-store velocity as the category gained strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience.\nNow, focusing on IQOS, starting with user growth, we estimate they were at 27.4 million IQOS users as of 30 September 2023. This represents an increase of 3.7 million users versus one year ago and 0.2 million compared to Q2 2023. As shown on the right hand side of the slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower user growth due to the seasonal influences in the calculation.\nBoth new user registration and devices to legal edge knockers continue to advance strongly. And at levels broadly in line with Q2 when users grew by 1.4 million sequentially. Also, as in prior years, we expect a substantial acceleration in user growth in Q4.\nMoving now to IQOS in the Europe region, where our third quarter HTU share increased by 1.3 points to 8.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. Continued share gains include the growing take up of ILUMA, which is available to over 80% of IQOS users in the region. In addition to Q3 launches in Denmark and in the UK, ILUMA was launched in Poland, which, like Japan, is a market with high competitive activity.\nWe look forward to driving its performance year over the coming quarters. While sequential share is as usual optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category adjusted IMS volumes continue to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-over-year growth up +16% in Q3. Despite limited growth in Ukraine. We expect strong IMS volume growth to continue in Q4 with a corresponding increase in market share. In the EU, a majority of Member States have transposed the delegated directives withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the characterizing flavor ban into national law. The ban in these markets will be effective as of October the 23rd, and the remaining markets are expected to adopt in 2024. As previously mentioned, we are adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition, and while short-term volatility is possible, including in year-end trade inventories, we do not expect significant change in the structural growth of the category.\nIn Japan, IQOS ILUMA celebrated its second anniversary of the national launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction, and retention rates. Adjusted total tobacco share for our IQOS brand increased by +3 points in Q3 year-over-year to 26.6%.\nImportantly, adjusted in-market sales volume again grew sequentially on the four-quarter moving average, reaching over 10 billion units for the first time in Q3 2023.\nIQOS outgrew the heated not burned category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend.\nOur Q3 shipment to Japan also benefited from further switching back to sea freight during the quarter. This shift is now substantially progressed and we expect a more normalized rate of HTU shipment in Q4.\nOur premium-price TEREA HTUs and mainstream-price SENTIA.\nHTUs continued to grow individually and in aggregate, reaching Q3 HTU shares of around 18% and 8% respectively.\nDespite the impact of seasonality, our Japan HTU shares also continue to.\nProgress with a number reaching over 30%.\nWe continue to see a long runway.\nOf growth in Japan over the coming quarters.\nIn addition to strong IPO gains in.\nDeveloped countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income markets.\nThis slide highlights a selection of Q3.\nKey cities of tech share across market.\nIn Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. We see notable ongoing success in Egypt with Marlboro IQOS share at +.\n3.5 points to almost 9% and in Santo Domingo, our leading Latin America city.\nWith offtake share around 8%.\nMost promising is the 3.1% offtake share in Europe and Japan where IQOS is only available via the IQOS Club members program.\nWe continue to see robust offtake.\nVolume growth across this important future market.\nDespite seasonal effect on sequential share metrics.\nI'd like to spend a moment now on combustibles where our portfolio delivered strong.\nOrganic net revenue growth of +6.2% in Q3 and +5.6% year to date.\nThis reflects another strong quarter of pricing.\nWith notable contribution from Germany and Indonesia.\nWith better than expected pricing in Q3.\nof 9% and plus 8.6% year to date.\nWe now forecast a full year increase.\nOf +8% to +8.5%.\nOur cigarette category share grew by plus.\n0.6 points in Q3 and plus 0.3.\nPoints year to date. This reflects notable contribution from Egypt, Poland, and Turkey resulting in only modest volume declines.\nOur leadership in Combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of.\nStable Category Share over the last two.\nYears despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.\nThis combustible share performance combined with the.\nStructural growth of IQOS supports robust overall market share gains. We captured +0.9 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q3 and +0.7 points year to date as.\nCovered at Investor Day.\nOur superior share of Marlboro product give us a formidable platform for sustainable market share gains with superior unit economics.\nNow let me update you briefly on our exciting innovation and expansion activities.\nWhich will be critical as we aim.\nTo reach over two-thirds smoke-free net revenue by 2030, including 60 markets over 50%, and 40 markets over 75%.\nAs we covered at Investor Day, the global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues. We.\nLaunched ILUMA in four markets in Q3, reaching 27 markets in total, which represent around 75% of our IQOS business by volume.\nIluma continues to generate excellent growth with.\nUpgrades from existing user and new user acquisition.\nWith a further six market launches already.\nThis month, we expect ILUMA to be present in around 50 markets by year-end and to essentially complete the rollout next year.\nAs also mentioned during Investor Day, superior.\nTobacco taste is critical to our ongoing success, and we are further exploring complex.\nNew test spaces to enhance our tobacco flavor experience.\nOn the other end of the consumer.\nPreference spectrum, we will be offering zero-tobacco consumable for non-tobacco flavor discovery.\nUnder the LEVIA brand.\nJust as nicotine pouches are an evolution.\nFrom snus to make the oral category relevant to more adult smokers, LEVIA is.\nA similar non-tobacco evolution for IQOS.\nAs we broaden our offering to increase switching away from combustibles.\nThe US represents.\nThe most significant opportunity to drive accelerated.\nSmoke-free growth at both the top and bottom line. We are continuing to invest behind dean and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities.\nFor the launch of IQOS in Q2.\n2024 and a scaled up rollout with Iluma.\nOnce authorized, we remain on track to file for IQOS ILUMA's PMTA and MRTPA this month.\nThe international extension of nicotine pouches remains a key need to long-term focus, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand. During Q3 we relaunched ZYN.\nIn Switzerland and following positive regulatory developments.\nRolled out ZYN in Finland.\nMoving now to sustainability, addressing the product.\nHealth impact of combustible product by switching adult smokers to smoke-free product which are designed and marketed for adult use.\nRemains our most critical priority.\nThis transformation is at the core of our strategy as we become a more.\nSustainable business with accelerated growth and returns.\nOver time with regard to tackling climate change.\nI am delighted to report that the Science Based Targets initiative validated our forecast.\nLand and agriculture emission reduction target, a recognition achieved by very few companies.\nWe pledged to reduce the absolute Scope.\n3 emissions by 33% by 2030, which.\nIs significant given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy.\nIn September, almost 27 employees in over 60 countries participated in World Cleanup Day, showcasing our commitment to raising awareness around.\nLittering as part of our wider strategy to reduce post-consumer waste.\nWe have long expressed our support for.\nMore rigor in sustainability-related reporting, and welcome recent moves towards greater consistency in standards and a strong governance framework as part of our ongoing work.\nWe provided responses to consultation requests from.\nThe International Sustainability Standards Board to help shape the development of their work plan.\nUpdate to the SASB standards. PMI continues to be recognized by organizations such as the World Business Council for.\nSustainable Development as a leader in non-financial reporting. We have much more to share on our sustainability efforts and transformation.\nJacek will be presenting at the CECP CEO Investor Forum in New York on 14 November and the event is open.\nTo all those who would like to attend.\nTo conclude today's presentation, we continue to.\nDeliver sustainable growth through our transformation.\nThe powerful trajectory of our smoke-free.\nBusiness give us confidence in strong full-year results based on volume growth, positive mix, pricing, and cost management.\nConsidering the headwinds faced notably in the.\nFirst part of the year, we believe this speaks strongly to the fundamentals of our growth model. Notably, the outstanding performance of IQOS and.\nZYN continues further enhancing our position as.\nThe global smoke-free champion.\nWe have exciting plans to accelerate our.\nSmoke-free future in both the US.\nThe largest smoke-free market and internationally. We are confident in our 2024-2026 CAGR target of +6% to +8%.\nof organic top line growth, +8% to +10% organic operating income growth, and +9% to +11% currency neutral adjusted EPS growth.\nWe also have a clear guiding objective with our new ambition to be substantially.\nsmoke-free by net revenue in 2030.\nAs another key milestone on our journey.\nTowards a smoke-free future. Finally, with our latest dividend raise.\nIn September, we have delivered 16 years of continuous dividend increase since our 2008 spin. Despite the ups and downs of economic and currency cycles.\nThis translates to a cumulative 183% increase.\nCAGR of 77.2% since August 2020 with.\nAn annualized dividend of $5.20.\nAs this demonstrates our commitment to shareholder.\nReturn through progressive dividend remain steadfast.\nThank you very much, and we are.\nNow, extremely happy to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference. Again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please please press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep to a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow up questions may be taken. You may rejoin the queue by again pressing star one. Our first question will come from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Vivien.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nI'd like to start with ZYN please. Clearly a very impressive result with continued acceleration in the top line. Emmanuel, you talked about distribution gains. I was hoping you could just level set. How much more runway do you see from a distribution standpoint? Certainly this remains a velocity driven story, I would say. So that would be question one. Then the follow up will just beat on the margins, which came in way ahead of expectations. You called out very strong cost management. That's clearly apparent. I'd love to hear your perspective on the durability of the current margin level for ZYN, please. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Vivien. So on ZYN and of course every quarter will bring its I would say lot of news, and I think we have been seeing in Q3 another great quarter of acceleration in the velocity. That means that where the brand is already even nicely present, we see the consumer of tech accelerating. It just show that these products are becoming more relevant for a growing number of adult user, and that there is also the geographical dimension on which we elaborated at the time of our investor day, and which is showing that while the brand has a certain level of presence on the western part of the US doesn't mean that it isn't going to grow further, but it's, of course, bigger than the rest of the country.\nThere seems to be a trajectory that is saying that the rest of the country is going to adopt it progressively, and that is indeed giving also a nice, I would say, trajectory on further growth in the coming quarters and years. Of course we talk here about probably years of very nice growth. So it's great that we have behind ZYN's engine, which is really where the brand is already the biggest presence. We don't see any decrease in the consumer adoption. We see increase what we call the velocity, and we see progressively, I think as well, quarter after quarter this geographical momentum building up as expected now on the margin.\nYes, it's true that the growth of ZYN is extremely positive when it comes to margin. Of course we are going to continue to invest behind this growth potential in the US and we will put the necessary commercial resources to make sure that we maximize the growth potential. But I said it. ZYN is really best in class in terms of growth margin for our product at a good level. I'm talking about ZYN in the US but globally nicotine pouch enjoy now margin that ZYN in the US is best in class and that means of course that growing ZYN is an excellent means for top line but also for bottom line. I think that in the growth of the adjusted earnings per share over the quarter, this is absolutely visible.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question will come from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you. Good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning Bonnie.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nI had a question on your HTU shipment volumes for the year. You know, you mentioned you're now expecting to come in within the lower half of your guidance, and then you highlighted a few reasons for this, including you know, the uncertainty related to inventory levels in Europe given the upcoming flavor ban.\nCould you give us a sense of maybe where inventory levels are at right now, and then, you know, maybe how many quarters you expect some of this unwind to happen? Then you know, just thinking about the trade, you know, is this being offset in any way with, you know, I'm just thinking about combustible cig inventories, or you know, really how is the trade responding to the span?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes. So, I think it's of course something on which we will be able to elaborate once we have ended the year after the ban put in place on where the countries are implementing it at the end of October. It's not the case in all countries.\nOne of the questions we have is with some reduction, with some skills use, does it mean that they are globally going to reduce the level of inventory and can this impact the level of shipment toward the year end? So I think we're flagging that because of course we continue to be with the view that this ban should not ultimately bring major disruption. And we've been elaborating on many occasions on why we think that this ban is not going to ultimately change the dynamics in the category.\nIt's true that we have some question mark on the lending for the reason I've just been describing on the level of inventory. That's why we are mentioning to make sure that we are as clear as possible on the possible temporary effect that this could generate.\nNow when I look at our shipments for the year, so we are clarifying the lending area. When I look at the 2023 performance versus 2022 performance, that would mean even the low end of the bracket an acceleration in terms of growth versus the growth that we experienced in 2022 in terms of incremental billion of steel being sold. And of course shipments are, as we know, what we are selling. What is possible, probably more important is the consumer of tech.\nHere frankly we see the momentum continuing with no change. I think the Q3 number, where we have seasonality. But when we look at Q2 and what we expect for Q4, we are very much with the same strong 15% to 16% IMS growth, and we are in line with what we have experienced last year. That shows, and by the way, it's a percentage on a higher base. In fact, in volume, that means that the volume growth is higher. We don't see any change in the momentum. We see a lot of strength in the growth, and that's visible in the volume in the market share that we are reporting today with this Q3.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just another question I just wanted to ask on your new IQOS users in the quarter, it did come in a bit late. You highlighted that this is normal quarterly seasonal trend. So maybe could you talk through that a bit further for us? And then maybe what other drivers might be impacting this? And essentially how much visibility do you have in terms of Q4? You mentioned you expect a substantial acceleration in user growth this quarter. So just kind of wanted to verify what you're seeing so far in October gives you that confidence. And, you know, is it realistic to assume, you know, a typical 1 million average quarterly run rate moving forward? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Bonnie. So actually last year we were flat in terms of user acquisition. So we're doing better this year than last year in terms of user evolution. And I think we are in line with what we experienced in 2021, if I remember. Well, I think we've been showing the numbers. So that's a typical pattern for Q3, which is due to the methodology on how we calculate the user growth. I think we have today. As I said, the element of the momentum that we are seeing on people buying the device, on people registering, that is pointing to the fact that we see the same momentum and that there is no change.\nLast year we finished the year with a strong user growth, and we target to do the same this year. I have to say it's remarkably stable in the strength, if I can use this expression.\nAnd as I said, we could be at the end of the day, in fact, growing in shipments and in IMS volume more than last year. So if the percentage is about the same, again, the basis being higher, it means that we're going to increase in terms of volume differential year on year.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gaurav Jain with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi. I have a question on the US cigar side of things. So, clearly, the FDA sent this rulemaking process to ban flavored cigars to the OMB. So, first, how will you address that? And secondly, if I look at the reported numbers on cigars, it seems that the revenue had a pretty steep decline this quarter. Can you help us understand what's happening there?\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nSo on the trend we've been improving price. The cigar had been below a certain threshold for a period of time, and we decided to move above this ratio, which was $1 for two. There is a time for adaptation, and that explains why onboarding we are impacted this year. But I don't think it reflects what's going to happen on the long term where we continue to have very good brands and a lot of consumer support, frankly, on the flavor, will you allow me not to speculate? I mean, I don't know exactly what, what are the plans, what it's going to mean, how long it will take, what is decided. And again, nobody knows what could be decided, how long it's going to take to be implemented. So I'm not going to speculate at that stage on what would be our answer and what we would do because I'm not going to be relevant on anything I could be saying at that stage.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you. Then my second question is on FY 2024 EPS and what's the base we should use to project that? Because I heard in common that the Argentine balance sheet revaluation impact, which is about $0.06, that will not recur in FY 2024, we should add that to FY 2023 EPS. Then could you also just comment on Russia exposure in this year's EPS?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes. So this is a technical comment on Argentina. Gaurav, you're absolutely right. This is a Forex impact that is a kind of runoff if you want, because that is impacting this year but next year we're not starting with the base on our profit that is decreased by that. It's just something that you need to look on your balance sheet exposure. But what is taken is taken, I mean, of course depending on the evolution of the Argentine Peso in the future.\nBut I don't have anything to say at that stage. I think I just wanted to clarify the technical impact on Russia, frankly versus when we met three weeks ago, there is nothing new to report on the Russian situation. This is a market where, of course. We are being very significantly impacted on the profit reported in dollars because of the very strong weakening of the Russian ruble versus the dollar. That is one of the, if not the biggest impact this year on Forex. That is of course, I would say mechanically reducing our exposure to Russia in our profit. That's mechanical.\nWe are, as we already said, we are seeing very limited growth in Russia. That is a market where, as we've been saying, we've been reducing our commercial activity. That's a market where we're investing. That is concluding, of course, on the performance of this market.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, Barclays\n\nThank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Gaurav.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Pam.\nGood morning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nI have a question on the Combustibles business. It's been exceeding expectations, and you've taken up your guidance for volumes on the Combustibles strength. Can you talk about what's driving the performance in this category despite the acceleration in pricing growth?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nI'm happy to do that. Yes, combustibles is being resilient. We have a decline, but it's a modest decline in Q3. Let's be clear, this is driven by a few markets where we see a nice share gain. One is Turkey, the other one is Egypt. As you can imagine, they are not markets with great profitability per stick. So let's be very clear. We have a nice performance on combustibles, on volume to some extent on revenue. All the great work that we are doing now on increasing OI and growing margin is first and foremost driven by our smoke-free products IQOS first, ZYN second.\nNot by the CC. So yes, great performance when it comes to volumes, great performance versus the decline that we have seen in the past few years. Good impact on revenue. We've been doing good on price increase as well. But remember, that's a category on which we've seen a lot of inflation on our costs and part of the growth is generated by markets with low profitability.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. And then on ZYN, when do you expect to hear a decision from the FDA on ZYN's PMTA applications? And how are you thinking about the prospects for ZYN flavor approvals considering the FDA has recently issued unfavorable decisions around flavored e-cig products?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, we discussed that three weeks ago, and there is nothing new on the PMTA. We don't know what's going to be the timeline for the decision of the FDA. And we see that a lot of things are taking a significant time to the decision to be taken. Let me make a couple of comments on this PMTA process. Nevertheless, the first one is that we have, with our ZYN product and in general, an MRTPA of level one. So the FDA has been recognized that these products are representing reduced risk versus combustible cigarettes and with very clear health benefit claim.\nWe believe that by nature this product should be considered as equally good if not better. We believe that they have the potential to really convince millions of smokers to move away from combustible cigarettes to have a better way of consuming nicotine. So we are really hopeful that the FDA will really take that as a very important element, and that it's important to make this product available for nicotine user in the US now on the flavor, because I think that was probably one of your questions. For the same reason we believe it is important that the consumer has the choice of flavor if it is a reason for them to move away from combustible cigarette to this better product.\nHaving said that, we have the example of a ban on flavor in California, and the reality is that there was an adjustment during a couple of months. And then the growth resumed without flavor in California. We are today very, very significant. I think we are close to 30% above the pre-ban level in California. So it shows that these products are extremely attractive and resonate with the nicotine user, with the smokers and with other nicotine users beyond the flavor, which is very good news.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat, thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you Pam.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Matt Smith with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning, Matt Smith.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nIf we take the full year organic profit margin guidance, that's down 150 basis points or so and the year-to-date performance, along with your commentary around kind of a flattish year-over-year performance in the fourth quarter, can you talk about some of the factors in the fourth quarter? I understand there's a lot of crosswinds here, but you get the benefit of Swedish Match rolling into the organic base. And then you mentioned you've completed the shift back to sea freight for HTU consumables into Japan. So can you talk about some of the headwinds to margin in the fourth quarter? Maybe some detail around your expectations around the incremental ILUMA launches or any other factors would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure. So indeed there are going to be some mixed impact in Q4 and notably on the devices as we are rolling out ILUMA in a significant number of new markets. We're also launching some new innovation in some markets on the Edoma device that's going to generate, I would say significantly accelerated activity on our device sales, and that is having a negative impact on the margin. That's going to be clearly one element. On top of that, there will be certainly some investment during the fourth quarter, and that is having an impact on the margin. You can have some mix coming from geographies, and other mix elements. That is what is today behind the guidance of 1% flat. It doesn't mean that it can be a bit positive. But today we are seeing this around stability situation for our OI margin year on year organically for Q4.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. Just as a follow-up, when you talk about investments in the fourth quarter. Should we think of that as a sequential step up in investment relative to the level in the third quarter, or is that more of a year-over-year higher investment compared to Q4 2023? And I'll leave it there.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nI think you should expect certainly continuation of significant level of investment as we are accompanying the growth of our star product IQOS and VEEV. That should probably mean quarter on quarter. I would say sequential increase and still significant growth versus last year.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nThank you for that.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our next question comes from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nMorning Emmanuel. Hope all well.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning Owen.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nI just wanted to ask also ZYN, very, very strong in the US but wanted to ask about pouches ex-US. So volumes only flat vs. Q2 for Scandi and ex-Scandi. And you mentioned you also had relaunches in Switzerland and Finland during the quarter. So I was just wondering how you see the near-term outlook for volumes ex-US. Do you expect any meaningful acceleration over the next several quarters? And then a second question linked to that. There's some increasing chatter now that the EU is looking to potentially ban pouches as part of the new TPD. Does this impact how you think about investing in the space in the US near term? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Yes. So we have this situation in Scandinavia on nicotine pouch where the product is already present mainly in Sweden where et cetera, a nicely growing market. That's not where we enjoy the biggest market share. So we are globally year to date growing on nicotine pouch in Sweden, but we're not talking about big volumes here as we have our strong leadership in Sweden on snus outside Scandinavia. We are just at the beginning. So yes, we are launching. So we explained that we've been launching in Switzerland, Finland as well in the Nordics. There will be more market to come now. It's going to be, hopefully nice, but it's going to be small versus what we see in the US. You see what I mean? So it's going to be difficult to see given the strength that we are seeing in the US to see volume outside the US.\nShowing their strength now. Yes, it's going to add very nicely additional numbers, but again it's not going to be huge compared to the US. We'll see with TPD if there is any decision taken around nicotine pouch. Of course, if there is anything decided that in that respect, which we don't know today, that will influence the way we invest on this category in the EU. But frankly at that stage it's too early to say, because we don't know what's going to be discussed, if anything, on that one, and therefore we'll see.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nSenior VP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nOkay, thank you sir. I appreciate it.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. Our last question will come from Andrei Condrea with UBS.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nHi, good morning Emmanuel. Just one from me, please. I know it's a bit of a topic today, but the GLP-1 drug, obviously there's been talk about it having anti-addictive properties. Do you think this could be an issue for PMI in the long term? Rather. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, frankly I've been hearing things about that. I mean, as always the assumption is everybody going to be under GLP-1 and therefore we're going to drive massive change in consumer behavior. I'm not even able to tell you what would be the impact for somebody who is a nicotine user and is going to take GLP-1. I'm not sure we have any serious study on human behavior on that is going to say that. So first of all, I don't know how broad the usage of this medicine as drug is going to be. Second, I don't know what's going to be the potential impact. So, I'm not sure that today we can say anything relevant and that makes sense on that topic. Frankly.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nEquity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nNo, that makes sense. Thank you very much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Emmanuel for closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, this is James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow up questions, please contact the investor relations team. Thank you again, and have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Talk to you soon. Bye bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's call.

As such, figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until 11 November 2023. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. Our business delivered outstanding performance in Q2 2023, exceeding our expectations to reach a record-high quarterly adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60. This was driven by impressive ZYN and IQOS growth, coupled with strong combustible results. We delivered total cigarette and HTU shipment volume growth of +3.3%, putting us well on track for our third consecutive year of positive volumes. This excellent result underpinned double-digit organic top-line growth, and high teens currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. We also expanded our leadership in smoke-free products in the period. Firstly, IQOS' strong momentum continued, with adjusted in-market sales volume ahead by +16% and shipments up by +27%. This reflects very good user growth of +1.4 million in the quarter and continued strong traction across the world.\nThis is increasingly driven by IQOS ILUMA, which is now available in 23 markets, representing around two-thirds of our IQOS business by volume. Secondly, and now two full quarters after the Swedish Match acquisition, ZYN is delivering an exceptional acceleration to our smoke-free business. US volumes grew by over +50%, including a notable step up in June. We are delighted with this performance. Our combustible business also delivered better-than-expected results, with over +7% organic net revenue growth after a very robust quarter for pricing, and resilient volume. This was a key contributor to the strong +7% organic operating income growth, with a +200 basis point sequential improvement in our adjusted operating income margin. Turning to the headline numbers, positive volumes supported very strong organic top-line growth of +10.5%, with continued excellent IQOS momentum, and a further acceleration in combustible pricing.\nThis does not include the remarkable +19% pro forma ex-currency top-line growth of Swedish Match, led by ZYN, with combined pro forma ex-currency net revenues increasing by +11.1%. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenues grew by +19%. Our organic net revenue per unit grew by +7%, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix and combustible pricing. Due to these positive factors, adjusted operating income grew by a very robust +7% organically, despite continued inflationary headwinds. This excludes the tremendous growth of ZYN, and starting in Q4, our organic result will include Swedish Match. Adjusted OI margins improved +210 basis points sequentially, and while still organically lower year-on-year by 140 basis points, this better-than-expected performance was notably supported by combustible strength and favorable timing of certain costs.\nWe also increased our participation in the below-tier-one segment in Indonesia, which now represents close to 40% of its industry volumes and is slightly diluted to our margins. This organic delivery, including the favorable timing of cost, combined with exceptional June ZYN volume and a lower tax rate, allowed us to outperform our most recent Q2 forecast. We delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60, representing +16.9% growth, excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.13, notably due to the Japanese yen. While the Q1 of the year contained some exceptional headwinds and distortion due to timing and comparison effects, our business delivered a strong first half, including volume growth of +1.1%. Organic net revenues grew by +6.8%, with Swedish Match excellent ex-currency pro forma net revenue growth of +17% for H1, demonstrating its growth accretion to our business.\nCombined pro forma currency-neutral net revenue increased by around +7.5%. Following peak margin headwinds and a notable operating income decline in the first quarter, the strong improvement in Q2 narrowed the H1 organic decline to -2%. As in Q2, this excludes Swedish Match, which delivered an excellent profit performance and made a significant contribution to our adjusted OI margin. We expect continued strong reported and organic operating income growth in the second half. Despite these headwinds, we delivered +5.9% growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to $2.98 in H1, providing a strong platform for the second half of 2023 and beyond. Let me now walk through the mechanic of our Q2 net revenues. While not included in our reported shipment volume growth of +3.3%, Swedish Match smoke-free volume grew by +15%, providing impressive accretion to our overall growth profile.\nCombustible and HTU pricing contributed +6 points of growth. This primarily reflects combustible strength, partly benefiting from timing effect. As in Q1, HTU pricing was impacted in Japan and Germany by the annualization of 2022 excise tax increase, and in the case of Japan, the transition to ILUMA. These factors will have less impact in the second half as annualization recedes. We also continue to expect greater visibility on the likely outcome of the court ruling related to the German tax surcharge toward the end of the year. The increasing proportion of HTUs in our business again contributed positively, reflecting higher net revenue per unit, partially offset by unfavorable geographic mix. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth, and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. Let's now turn to gross margins.\nWhile the year-on-year trajectory remained negative, we saw improvement versus the first quarter driven by strong growth fundamentals. Indeed, we achieved sequential improvement of 1.2 percentage points despite increased inflationary pressures, as top-line growth accelerated and supply chain disruption, and ILUMA-related factors, started to dissipate in the quarter. In addition, cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movement, notably for HTU in Europe, increasingly normalized after an adversely affected Q1. Our IQOS business contributed positively to our gross margin in Q2, and we expect this to continue, partly mitigating combustible. We expect further improvement in our year-on-year gross margin trajectory in H2 as headwinds continue to subside, ZYN's outstanding growth continues, and the underlying driver of our transformation accelerates. As expected, SG&A growth was much closer to net revenue growth in Q2 and at a more normalized growth rate with regard to our full-year expectation.\nIndeed, with such a strong top-line in Q2, SG&A costs were lower as a percentage of net revenues. While we continue to invest in IQOS and ZYN, our successful cost efficiency program continues to deliver, helping to finance growth investment and mitigate inflation, which remains a headwind. With $1.9 billion of gross savings realized to date, including $820 million from SG&A, we are on track to achieve our 2021-2023 $2 billion target ahead of plan. Turning now to the 2023 outlook, we are raising our currency-neutral top and bottom-line growth forecasts. We aim to be a growth company starting with volumes. In 2023, we expect to grow total volume for the third year in a row, even before factoring in the excellent progress of Swedish Match portfolio.\nAs part of this growth, we are reiterating our targeted HTU shipment range of 125 to 132 billion, while we expect a cigarette volume decline of 1.5% to 2.5%. We are increasing our organic net revenue growth forecast to 7.5% to 8.5%, reflecting the continued momentum of IQOS, the resilience of our combustible business, and the ongoing excellent growth of ZYN, which we expect to contribute positively in Q4. We expect strong organic operating income growth in the remainder of the year to support H2 margin expansion despite the headwinds previously mentioned and certain technical impact. These relate to the increased use of third-party manufacturing in a few markets such as Indonesia and Ukraine, and the related growth of the below-tier-one segment in Indonesia, I already mentioned.\nThe full-year estimated impact of this factor is around 40 basis points on our adjusted OI margin, and without this impact, we would expect to be broadly in the middle of our forecast organic margin range. On top of this organic evolution, we expect Swedish Match to add around 50 basis points of accretion. Our strong top-line and OI outlook allows us to raise our forecast for currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth to +8% to +9.5%. This translates to a revised range of $6.13 to 6.22, including $0.33 from unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rate, notably due to the Japanese yen and Russian ruble. This forecast continues to assume around $150 million for incremental investment in the US and our wellness and healthcare business.\nIt also assumes around $1.2 billion in net finance costs, which includes higher interest on variable debt, partly offset by better returns on cash deposits. As previously mentioned, our forecasts do not assume any contribution from a potential favorable ruling on the Germany tax surcharge. Focusing on the second half in more detail, we expect strong performance on all key metrics as smoke-free product deliver an increasingly positive impact. In Q3, we forecast high single-digit organic top-line growth with HTU shipments of 31 to 33 billion units and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.60 to 1.65, including $0.06 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rate. Looking ahead to Q4, we expect notably strong reported and organic OI growth as certain inflationary impacts are annualized, and we increasingly benefit from an optimized ILUMA supply chain and consumables.\nAs I mentioned, Swedish Match will also be included in our organic figures during the quarter. The exceptional growth of ZYN is clearly margin accretive as visible in our adjusted H1 figures. Turning back to our results, our total shipment volume increased by +3.3% for Q2 and +1.1% year-to-date. HTU shipment volume grew by +26.6% in Q2 to reach 31.4 billion units, notably driven by continued strong performance in Europe and Japan. In addition to fundamental strength, HTU shipment to Japan were boosted in Q2 by around 2 billion units as we increased sea freight, with corresponding increase in inventory level. As I mentioned earlier, total PMI adjusted IMS volume of HTUs increased by +16% in Q2, continuing the excellent trends in Q1. H1 shipment volume grew by +18.5%.\nNotably, this does not include the excellent growth prospect of oral nicotine, for which shipment volume grew by +14% in Q2 and +12% in H1 on a pro forma basis. Cigarette volume declined by a modest 0.4% in Q2, with notable support from Turkey and Egypt, and by 1.7% for H1, reflecting a solid category share performance in a resilient category despite stepped-up pricing. Our smoke-free transformation continues to progress rapidly. Due to the continued impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprise 16.4% of our total shipment volume in H1 as compared to 14% in the first half of 2022, despite a resilient cigarette category. Including all smoke-free product, this would be close to 18%. Powered by IQOS and ZYN, smoke-free product made up 35% of our adjusted net revenue in H1, compared to 30.9% for the same period in 2022.\nIQOS devices accounted for approximately 4.5% of our H1 inhalable smoke-free net revenue. Focusing now on combustible, our portfolio delivered strong organic net revenue growth of +7.4% in Q2 and +5.2% in H1. This reflects strong Q2 pricing with a notable contribution from Indonesia and the Philippines. While we don't expect the exceptionally strong Q2 pricing of 9.4%, which benefited from timing factors, to be fully replicated in H2, we now forecast a full-year increase of +7% to +8%. Our cigarette category share grew by +0.7 points in Q2 on a year-over-year basis, including contribution from Duty-Free, Egypt, and Turkey, and by +0.1 point in H1, resulting in only modest volume declines.\nOur leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we have fully achieved our ongoing objective of stable category share over the last 18 months, despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. The combination of a stable share in combustible and the continued growth of our leading smoke-free brands positions us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured +1.1 points of international cigarette and HTU share in Q2 and +0.5 point in H1, with notable contribution from Turkey and Japan. Impressively, despite increasing competition in many markets, our volume share of the growing heat-not-burn category remains stable at around 75%. This is supported by ongoing ILUMA market launches and increasing focus on our two-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes.\nPMI HTUs again strengthen their position as the second-largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, with a sequential share gain in Q2 of +0.2 points to record 9.2% share. We estimate there were 27.2 million IQOS users as of 30 June. This reflects excellent growth of +1.4 million adult users in Q2, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. While fundamentals remain very strong, I remind you that Q3 user growth can often be below the average for the year due to the seasonal factors evident in prior years. I will now turn to IQOS in the Europe region, where we are approaching a milestone of 12 million users. This reflects the further rollout of ILUMA, which is now available to around 70% of IQOS users in the region, and the expansion of our two-tier portfolio.\nAs an illustration of its progress, TEREA is already close to 100% of our HTU in-market sales volume in the first launch markets of Spain and Switzerland. Our second quarter HTU share increased by +1.6 points year-over-year to 9% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. While sequential share is, as usual, optically affected by the seasonality of the cigarette category, adjusted IMS volume continued to exhibit robust sequential growth and reached a record high on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects strong year-on-year growth of +20% in Q2, outstripping the +11% growth in HTU shipments, which were affected by some residual effect from the inventory dynamic seen in Q1. We expect robust growth in HTU shipments, adjusted IMS, and overall region organic revenue in the second half.\nWe continue to be encouraged by the increasing number of European countries adopting multi-year excise tax plans with clear differentiation of smoke-free product. Over half of EU member states have now passed multi-year plans. Also in the EU, a number of member states are currently transposing the delegated directive, withdrawing the heated tobacco product exemption from the flavor ban into national legislation. The ban is scheduled to come into effect on 23 October, and we will be adjusting our HTU portfolio as required in line with this transposition. While short-term volatility is possible, we do not expect a significant change in the structural growth of the category. To give some further color on our continued progress in the region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares.\nThe success of IQOS continues across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Despite the denominator effect of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. We are very pleased with trends in Rome showing a sequential step-up to 28% share following the ILUMA launch. Robust progress in London and Munich also bodes well for these two key markets. While the Q2 2022 comparison for share in Vilnius was helped by the popularity of certain bundle offers, the share of over 40% remains impressive, and underlying offtake continues to grow. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA continues to drive impressive growth momentum. Smoke-free product made up over 75% of our Japan net revenue in H1, clearly showing the path for the broader company.\nAdjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by +3.4 points in Q2 to 26.3%, further strengthening TEREA and SENTIA's position as the clear number one and two heat-not-burn brands, despite intensified price competition for mid- and low-price offering. Importantly, adjusted IMS volume again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average as IQOS outgrew the heat-not-burn category. In addition to this excellent consumer trend, our Q2 shipments to Japan also benefited from progressively switching back to sea freight during the quarter. In addition to strong IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low- and middle-income markets. These slides highlight a selection of Q2 key city off-take shares across markets in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America.\nNotable ongoing successes include Egypt, with category HTU shares surpassing 8.5%, and Bulgaria, with offtake share in Sofia exceeding 15%, despite the usual impact of seasonality that I mentioned. We continue to see robust off-take volume growth across these important future markets. Now, moving to Swedish Match, which is meaningfully accelerating our smoke-free growth trajectory. As covered earlier, the business delivered outstanding currency-neutral net revenue growth of 19% in Q2 and 17% in H1. This means that in the first half of the year, Swedish Match has added 70 basis points of currency-neutral growth to our pro forma top line and 60 basis points to our adjusted OI margin. In the US, ZYN delivered another exceptional quarter with volume growth of over 50%, reflecting positive momentum across the country.\nElsewhere in smoke-free, recent trends of share gain in US small snuff, as well as category mix headwinds in Scandinavia, broadly continued. The cigar business performed well with Q2 organic net revenue growth of +16%. This reflects ongoing share gains despite being an early mover on category pricing. I would like to again congratulate and thank all the Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver terrific results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities, which is progressing very well. Looking at ZYN US performance in more detail, exceptional year-over-year volume growth in cans of +53% also reflects a +22% sequential increase versus Q1 2023. This accelerated growth reflects progressive increase in distribution and a broad nationwide step-up in store velocity as the category gained strong traction with adult nicotine users for its convenience and pleasurable experience. This includes California, which implemented a statewide flavor ban in December.\nWhile such elevated rates of growth may not continue indefinitely, the structural indicators remain very encouraging. Impressively, ZYN category volume share grew plus 2.2 points compared to prior year and plus 1 point sequentially, despite continued discounting from less premium offerings. Retail value share also grew to 76.8%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity. Now, let me provide an update on our innovation and expansion plan as we further accelerate our smoke-free transformation. First and foremost, the global rollout of IQOS ILUMA continues to be a top priority. We launched ILUMA in six markets in Q2, and with HTU manufacturing constraints now normalized, we aim to be present in around 50 markets by the end of the year. The most significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth is in the US.\nWe are investing behind ZYN and readying our organizational and commercial capabilities for the launch of IQOS in Q2 next year. As mentioned in today's release, we are also on track for IQOS ILUMA PMTA and supplemental MRTPA submission in Q4 2023. Our philosophy on the US remains unchanged. We will seek to accelerate our top line with IQOS and ZYN, supported by disciplined investment and leveraging both our extensive experience in smoke-free product and Swedish Match infrastructure and knowledge, while continuing to deliver strong bottom-line growth for PMI. Our pilot city launches for BONDS in the Philippines and Colombia continue to progress well. The learning from these markets will be integrated as we roll out more broadly starting next year. The international expansion of nicotine pouches remains a key medium-term opportunity, notably for ZYN as the world's leading brand.\nWe are now preparing for the launch of relaunch of ZYN in several markets. In e-vapor, our refocused approach in select markets is progressing with VEEV ONE, our newly designed pod-based system introduced in four markets, and VEEV NOW, our disposable product in six markets. Now, let me discuss our wellness and healthcare segment, starting with its first clinical trial result for our inhalable Asprihale product. While it was observed that the experimental product had a rapid onset of effect, which is a key medical advantage sought, there was significant variability in inhaled dose among subjects. The study was therefore deemed unsuccessful, and as a result, product design improvements are required. Our plan was to finalize this product with the FDA later this year. However, additional time is now required, and the outcome is therefore less certain. In addition, the CDMO business has been facing slower than anticipated development, including cost-related challenges.\nConsequently, we recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment from our annual assessment, as detailed in today's release. While these elements will postpone the achievement of our 2025 aspiration to reach over $1 billion of net revenue from wellness and healthcare product, they will result in a corresponding decrease in the level of investment in 2024. Our ambition to build and monetize our product pipeline is unchanged. As in the early days of developing IQOS, certain headwinds are to be expected, and the 2021 acquisition in this segment has provided us with unique and enabling R&D capability. We remain committed to developing our wellness and healthcare business and continue to see attractive mid- and long-term growth potential on many fronts, such as inhalable drugs, NRT, and consumer wellness products, including non-recreational cannabinoids, in line with applicable regulatory requirements.\nWe also aim to accelerate Vectura's growth and will be exploring potential partnerships to enhance its CDMO business. We plan to discuss all these topics, including our plan for IQOS in the US and a full update on our wellness and healthcare business, at our investor day on 28 September in Lausanne, Switzerland. Moving now to sustainability. Addressing the product health impact of combustible products by switching adult smokers to smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, remains our most critical priority. This transformation is at the core of our strategy, driving accelerated growth and returns over time from a more sustainable business. In addition, we remain committed to delivering best-in-class progress in other key sustainability areas. With our extensive agricultural and manufacturing supply chain, human rights are a very important responsibility for our company.\nWe released our first dedicated report on the topic last month, detailing our strategy to promote, respect, and protect human rights and the progress to date in implementing our human rights commitments. Our performance on human rights is included in the 19 KPIs of our sustainability index, which comprises 30% of executive long-term equity compensation weighted towards our product transformation. Our goal is to conduct comprehensive human rights impact assessments in our 10 highest-risk markets by the end of 2025. These help us better understand and address our impacts, and we are making excellent progress with seven completed to date. Addressing climate change is another priority for us, and I am pleased to share that PMI was included in the Forbes first-ever Net Zero Leaders list, ranking seventh overall for all US public companies, higher than any other consumer product or service company.\nTo conclude today's presentation, we delivered a very strong first half despite a number of headwinds, putting us on track for the third consecutive year of positive volume and organic net revenue growth of over +7%. The powerful trajectory of our smoke-free business gives us confidence in a strong full-year performance with excellent operating income growth. Outstanding momentum continues for IQOS and ZYN, the world-leading heat-not-burn and oral nicotine brands, and we have exciting plans to further grow oral nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year. Importantly, we remain steadfast in our commitment to generously reward our shareholders, including through our progressive dividend policy. In short, our smoke-free transformation continues to deliver sustainable growth. We look forward to sharing more with you on the next phase of our transformation at our Investor Day on 28 September.\nThank you very much, and we are now delighted to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. Again, in order to ask a question or make a comment, please press the star key followed by the one on your touchtone phone. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep to a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow-up questions may be taken. You may rejoin the queue again by pressing star and one on your touchtone phone. Our first question comes from Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst for Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nMorning, Pam.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst for Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nI wanted to ask about your full-year guidance. You exceeded your own Q2 guidance by at least $0.13 but did not flow through the EPS beat to the full-year outlook, even when factoring the greater FX headwinds. What's tempering the flow-through of Q2 upside, and how much does this reflect conservatism around the balance of the year versus a more cautious outlook on the second half or higher investments? Thanks.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Pam. When we look at the driver for beating our initial expectation for Q2, I think we can probably make three buckets. One is the outperformance of ZYN versus our expectation. That's something that we are, of course, taking into account as we see a better trajectory for ZYN than initially anticipated. Remember that we'll only contribute to our organic growth on revenue in Q4, but that is, of course, helping the adjusted EPS growth, excluding Forex. We also see some costs that have been moved to H2, and that is, if you want, costs that we're going to see in H2, so it's not a net addition for the year.\nThere was, as we said, some better news on financial costs, cost on our debts. There was also some element on tax. And, of course, this one is more uncertain and more difficult to predict for the second part of the year. But I think, as always, we are building scenarios for the full year. We've been including in a clear way what we see a real change in the trajectory and on which we have visibility for the second half on things where we have postponement or things with good news, but, of course, we still have uncertainty on H2. Of course, we have to be a bit more cautious when we take them into scenarios.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst for Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nOkay. Thanks. And then just on operating margins, you pointed to operating margins closer to the lower end of your initial guidance range of down 50 to 150 basis points for the year. Can you discuss the puts and takes impacting your margin performance in the second half?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure. When we look at the margin, really, things are happening as expected, I would say. So after Q1, which was not coming as a surprise to us, we said from now on, we're going to see an improvement of the margin trajectory. We knew that inflation would still be there for the rest of the year, although in the second part of the year, we're going to be facing comparisons where inflation was starting to kick in, so that's going to have some impact. But we knew that a number of other headwinds would start to abate.\nAnd here, I'm talking about the disruption on the supply chain and, among other things, things connected with air freight, the costs attached to the launch of ILUMA, and the fact that not everything was optimal. So we started to see improvement in Q2 as expected, and we're going to continue to see improvement in the rest of the year. And then what we see playing in Q2 that we expect to see playing in the rest of the year are the fundamental positive drivers that we have for our margin. First of all, the fact that IQOS growth is having a positive impact on our margin. We said it since the beginning. We expect a positive contribution on margin evolution for the year from the heat-not-burn business. Remember, we have a higher gross margin rate on our consumables for IQOS.\nSo as we are growing IQOS, that is having a positive impact. There is now, when it comes to our smoke-free business, another driver that is positioning for our margin, which is ZYN and ZYN in the US, which is also accretive to the margin. You don't see it in the organic reporting so far, but it's going to start to kick in in Q4, and we expect to have another nice positive. And then the third element that I think you see, of course, nicely in Q2 is our pricing power. We see it today very clearly on combustible. We have some headwinds that are temporary coming from Germany and Japan on heat-not-burn, but we retain pricing power, which is positive for the long term. And these are good elements. Of course, in front of that, we will keep investing and making sure that we are maximizing the growth potential. But that's really what is behind the margin development for the year.\nNow, on top of it, and I think we've been flying that during this quarter, we have the development of businesses that are coming with lower margin because we are buying to third parties, and that is a different margin dynamic. And also, this business, which we called Below V1, which is, in fact, with reduced excise duty in Indonesia, that is coming with lower margin. It's more a technical effect, I would say. And as mentioned, without that, we would have been, in fact, in the middle of the bracket that we gave, the 50 to 150 negative. And again, this is not reflecting the positive contribution for ZYN. So I would say, as a summary, things are happening as expected, and we start to see the fact that we have, on the long term, some fundamental positive drivers for our margin that I summarized.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nExecutive Director and Equity Analyst for Packaged Food and Tobacco, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. That's very helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Vivien Azer with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nHi. Good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Vivien.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nSo I wanted to follow up on the commentary on ZYN, certainly consistent with the very robust trends that we're seeing in the Nielsen scanner data, accelerating growth, strong market share gains. You've spoken in the past about the opportunity to offer some incremental investment to that business unit to expand the sales force, improve distribution, and drive velocity. Can you just talk to us about where you are in that investment time horizon for ZYN, please? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Vivien. Yeah. ZYN is, of course, I mean, we knew that the brand was great. I think we are seeing something that is above our initial expectation, to be very clear, for the time being at the time of the acquisition of Swedish Match. There is clearly a growing awareness of this category. We see a lot of poly usage. So you have a percentage that is fully converted, but a lot of poly usage. We talk about people discovering that they can enjoy their nicotine in moments where they cannot enjoy, whether they're combustible cigarettes or other inhalable products. That is certainly playing. I think there is a very positive lifestyle element around the development in the US that is gathering momentum.\nSo that is, I think, explaining the success of ZYN that is the icon of the category and, of course, taking today the lion's share of the growth of this nicotine pouch progression in the US. Now, that is very good news, of course, because that means that we have a very dynamic business in the US. To be very clear, it's not marginal at the group level. So you will see and you already see in the performance impact of this ZYN US performance. So that's great to have another driver for our smoke-free performance and globally for the financial performance of the company. But it's setting the scene very well for IQOS because, on top of what is successful, we're going to be able to build a very efficient commercial engine. You said it increased sales force. We're in the making of that. It's happening progressively.\nIt's, of course, going to help both ZYN and IQOS. But that also bodes very well for our capacity to develop IQOS successfully in the future in the US. We're going to have a convergence of strengths between ZYN and IQOS. So to be very clear, we haven't been suddenly increasing, at that stage, by several hundred people the sales force. It's happening gradually as we build the capacity for IQOS starting Q2 next year. There is other investment that we are doing in our digital capacity and the digital commercial engine. Again, just the beginning. So I don't think it is really today behind the growth that we see behind ZYN. But these are additional strengths and capacity. And again, I think we are very excited about the amazing team that IQOS and ZYN can be in the future in the US.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThat's really helpful. Thank you for that. And then just moving to the wellness and healthcare segment for my second question, please. You know, understanding some of the challenges around the clinical trial, I was wondering if you could just comment on your aspiration to deliver the balance sheet post the Swedish Match transaction versus the potential need for incremental M&A as you think about an ultimate $1 billion revenue target, understanding that you've pushed out the date for that. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. And I want to be very clear. I mean, the focus is on delivering the balance sheet. We are focusing on extracting the great potential that we have in our smoke-free business. I mentioned IQOS and ZYN together. We certainly want to grow VEEV as well. But I think there is so much potential on IQOS and ZYN that it's, of course, the key focus today. And we are spending our time, energy on maximizing the potential there. And that's going to generate delivering. So the time today is not for us to think about, I would say, structural moves on M&A in other spaces. We are very much focused on optimizing this great potential that we have in our smoke-free business today.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Gaurav with Barclays. Your line is open.\nHi. Good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Gaurav.\n\nGaurav Sharma\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nHi. Emmanuel, a question on ZYN in the US. So the volumes are coming in much ahead of where I think consensus is, where we were. We also know that US cigarette volumes have persisted at very weak rates despite easy comps. So what do you think is the cannibalization rate of ZYN on US cigarettes today? As you project out IQOS growth over the next seven years, if ZYN's cannibalization is higher than what is thought of, then does it mean that the cigarette universe is smaller, which implies that the IQOS opportunity is smaller?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nIt's, Gaurav, an excellent question. I believe, first of all, I'm not going to be able to give a precise answer, as you can imagine. I believe that there is probably some cannibalization for the reason I mentioned. We see behaviors developing of people that probably are or were combustible users, and they discovered that they can enjoy their nicotine in a different manner with certainly positive perception on when they can do it and the impact on them. Now, I'm not able to tell you whether this is something very material. So I don't have any data at that stage.\nI'm sure we'll try to elaborate on the ZYN driver on 28 September. But at that stage, I'm not able to share with you any hard data on how it's materializing. Frankly, I don't think that this is going to be really relevant for IQOS because maybe in a kind of super marginal manner. But here we talk about, with IQOS, smokers who want to enjoy, when they are still enjoying today, combustible cigarettes, a different product that is mimicking very closely their pleasure with clearly personal benefits on their health, but also on their lifestyle. So I don't see the ZYN moment as something that is going to compete with IQOS in a meaningful manner. So I think that that's not something that we see as a risk to undermine IQOS' potential in the future.\n\nGaurav Sharma\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you. And the second question I have is on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban. And you mentioned that there could be some volatility. Now, the experience in California has been pretty bad for the menthol cigarette ban, in that only 70% of the menthol smokers seem to have been retained in the cigarette market. So what is the precedence? Is there any precedence of a flavored heated tobacco ban anywhere, which helps you form the view that the impact will be quite minimal?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, there is, Gaurav. So I will take two examples. One in Europe, when there was the menthol flavor ban in May 2020, where it had minimal impact on the combustible business, very, very small. So that's one illustration. And the other one is actually because here we talk about growing products. The other one here is the ban on flavor in California that impacted ZYN at the end of 2022. There was a few weeks with a blip on the volume, and then the momentum came back on non-flavored products, actually with even more intensity. The blip has been swallowed, and you don't see today any impact of this ban. So I think here you have two element experiences that show that this is having minimum impact. Again, we're comparing in California with growing category, which maybe is more appropriate. But referring to combustible in Europe in May 2020, the impact was de minimis.\n\nGaurav Sharma\n\nDirector, Barclays\n\nOkay. Sure. Thank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right. Thank you. Hi, Emmanuel. Hi, Em.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Bonnie.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nCircle back to your guidance, which is maybe a quick follow-on question. Your full year guidance implies, I guess, more riding on Q4. So just hoping you could help us understand maybe your level of conviction and/or visibility that your business really will strengthen so much later this year. And then I know it's early, and I don't expect you to guide next year, but is there anything we should think about that you're investing in this year that really could position you for even greater growth next year and beyond?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So, Bonnie, trying to be back on H2, I think you see it already in Q2. I mean, the momentum behind IQOS is there. We see it 1.4. We estimate 1.4 million user growth in Q2. That's an excellent number. We see in-market sales going up. We know that there is seasonality, but it doesn't mean that the consumer of tech is going to decrease. There is more launch of ILUMA, and some of them that happen in the end of H1 that is going to contribute as well in the second part of the year. So we see very robust momentum there. We see the work that we've been doing, and as we said, the highest intensity of price increase has happened in Q2. It's going to be lower in H2, and we've been defending our market share well in a market that is resilient.\nWe may discuss why CC is so resilient, but the fact is that combustible is proving to be resilient in many geographies. And then there is the ZYN moment, clearly the ZYN momentum, which we're not saying we're going to keep growing at 50%, of course, but clearly we expect momentum to continue super nicely on ZYN. And starting Q4, that will also contribute to the organic growth, but in any case, it's going to fully contribute to adjusted EPS growth, excluding Forex. So all that gives us the confidence that we are set for a very, very good and very strong H2 in terms of performance. Now, when we look towards 2024, we believe that the growth drivers are going to stay the same. So IQOS with, of course, the launch in Q2 in the US, but let's be clear, it's going to be the beginning.\nSo it's not going to immediately have a huge impact. It's going to be a ramp-up, as we explain. But there will be a number of countries where ILUMA will be fully delivering. Look at Japan. That's quite interesting what happened in Japan. In fact, we've seen a kind of another acceleration on market share and volume one year after the launch of ILUMA. So it's not as if the whole positive impact was happening in the first weeks. I would say it takes some time to create the awareness, the understanding, and the positive appreciation. And then we're going to have ZYN and nicotine pouches. ZYN, first of all, starting in the US, but a number of exciting launches outside the US as well. So that is boding well for 2024. But, of course, it's premature to talk about 24, and we'll give guidance in due course.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay. That all makes sense and helpful. And then just for my second question, I was hoping for some more color on Japan. And it looks like your shipment volume was really strong in the quarter, and then your market shares increased nicely. Excuse me. So could you talk through key drivers of this? And then I believe BAT is cutting their prices on Glo Hyper starting in August. So could you talk through the current competitive environment, and then maybe how you expect it might change in light of these actions, as well as how you may need to respond, if at all? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Bonnie. So Japan, of course, is a matter of great satisfaction. I was alluding to it on the fact that one year after the launch of ILUMA, we see a further acceleration of our market share. We are now above 26%. And as I said, that shows that the brand keeps doing inroads, converting more people, making a big difference versus competition. And actually we've seen our capture share of the growth of the category that continues to grow increasing. We have a two-tier strategy between TEREA and SENTIA that is proving to be very efficient. So we have the premium range, TEREA, with a lot of innovation, great flavor experience. And then we have SENTIA, which is, of course, at a lower level in terms of positioning. But with these two, I would say, ranges, we managed to really reach the broadest possible number of ILUMA users, and that's clearly showing some great success.\nWe are back in Japan to see HTU progressively. So that was expected. Last year, the shipments were lower than the consumption of HTU. This year, that is, of course, we're going back to the normal situation. That was absolutely planned. We see indeed competition while trying to fight. They see the category that keeps having a lot of traction and gaining share. They are fighting to keep growing when ILUMA is clearly doing well. So far, they believe that their way forward is to come with cheaper consumables. That's, of course, their decision. I won't comment on that. It's clear that despite that, we managed to grow the share. But it's good to see that there is a clear growing commitment from the whole industry behind the category in Japan. All right.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nManaging Director, Goldman Sachs\n\nThank you again.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Bonnie.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Matt Smith with Stifel. Your line is open.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director for Food & Tobacco, Stifel\n\nHi. Thank you for taking my question\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Matt.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director for Food & Tobacco, Stifel\n\nI wanted to ask about the pacing of the rollout of ILUMA to 50 markets from the 23 markets where it's available today. Do you expect that to be fairly evenly spread across the second half? And could you talk about the rollout or the expansion, the impact on your operating margin in the second half, as well as your gross margin?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, Matt. So there will be a progressive, difficult for me. I mean, there will be events in Q3 and Q4 of launch of ILUMA in a number of countries. It's difficult for me to tell you whether it's evenly spread because I would have no problem to do that depending on the size of each market, but it's going to be relatively well spread. Let's be clear.\nWe have already two-thirds of the IQOS volume that are exposed or benefit from ILUMA's presence. So it's not marginal, but a big part of it has already been done. And as we said, at the beginning of ILUMA, we were not fully optimized on the product, on the productivity. It doesn't mean that everything will be done at the end of the year, but we expect to certainly see an acceleration of productivity, reduction in the weight in the second part of the year, and that will have a positive impact on margin evolution, absolutely in line with what I explained, a number of headwinds that are receding in line with expectations. But that's really what you can expect for ILUMA in the second part of the year.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director for Food & Tobacco, Stifel\n\nThank you for that. And if I could ask just a follow-up question on the combustible performance, it's been stronger in terms of both volume and organic revenue contribution. You've made a couple of comments about the demand environment holding up better than your expectation relative to the elevated pricing. Can you talk about the factors that are allowing the consumers to hold up elasticity better than your expectations? Do you expect that to continue now that you're going to lap some pricing action?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, so far, I think that we've seen that pricing up doesn't mean that the consumer is going away. I'm not able to tell you how it's going to further evolve in the future. I think what we see globally on the combustible market is, first of all, a few markets where, because of the demographic, we see the consumption of combustible going up. I could certainly mention India, probably Egypt, Turkey, probably Vietnam, even if it's not a big market for us, where we see combustible business going up. The resilience is also coming from a number of markets where there is a ban on smoke-free products. So, of course, that is, to some extent, protecting the combustible business. As you know, that's clearly not something that we like. We think that it's a big mistake, but that is probably providing some resilience to the category overall. So that would be my analysis on combustible.\n\nMatt Smith\n\nManaging Director for Food & Tobacco, Stifel\n\nThank you for that, Emmanuel. I'll pass it on.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Matt.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\n\nOwen Bennet\n\nSVP for Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nAfternoon, Emmanuel. Hope you are well.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Owen.\n\nOwen Bennet\n\nSVP for Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nAnd yeah, I'll just quickly.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Yeah.\n\nOwen Bennet\n\nSVP for Equity Research, Jefferies",
    "content2": "Related to heated competitive dynamics, all three of your major tobacco peers now appear to be in a better spot, at least versus the past, with regard to product offerings, at least, and money they're investing into this. I was just wondering if you could comment on IQOS trends in some of the more competitive heated markets where all three of your major peers now have a presence, so like Italy, for example. So how is IQOS share holding up? Is ILUMA having less traction in these markets than others? Are you seeing trial of other brands and consumers coming back to IQOS? Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nSure, Owen. Actually, you may have seen that our share of the category has remained stable in Q2 at around 75%. So it shows that indeed there is increased competition, but the quality of IQOS, and notably ILUMA, but not just ILUMA, the overall IQOS proposition is allowing us to, even if we are more premium, to maintain our share of the category, which is very good news. Here, I'm talking about volume. You can imagine in terms of value that is even higher. Now, let's be clear. Since the beginning, we knew, and I can say we were hoping for the whole industry to embrace heat-not-burn as the category of the future for inhalable nicotine product. And it's great to see a growing commitment from all the players behind that. So no doubt that they will come with innovation. Ourselves, as you can imagine, we're going to continue to innovate as well. And we will see, certainly, innovation and maybe new things coming in the future.\nNow, after six, seven, almost eight years of launch of IQOS, I think in terms of franchise, in terms of impact, in terms of strength, in terms of brand power, I think we are really second to none. And we made a clear gap and differential. And I think that this is exactly what we did with Marlboro in the past, which Marlboro was a superior product, and recognized for the brand that was unique. But on top of that, we managed to create a unique brand that was extremely appealing. And I think with IQOS, that's what we are repeating today. So IQOS products are clearly better, recognized as such. It's a different customer experience. But then the IQOS brand is also iconic, and people are seeing that as part of lifestyle and product they want to associate themselves with, which is a recipe for long-term success.\n\nOwen Bennet\n\nSVP for Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nCool. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Owen.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will take our final question from Jared Dinges with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nJared Dinges\n\nEquity Research Analyst for European Staples, JPMorgan\n\nYeah. Hi, guys. So you talked about the ability to use sea freight finally to supply Japan as you progress throughout Q2. Would you be able to confirm that you're no longer capacity constrained on the TEREA sticks?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes. So we can confirm that for the market where we've been launching today, we have no constraint. And therefore, that's the reason why we've been able to move to sea freight. Now, there is still a ramp-up for the remaining markets that do not have ILUMA today. And this ramp-up is, of course, accompanying the growing capacity. So it doesn't mean that today we could serve on the 1st of July 100% of all the IQOS markets with ILUMA consumable, but we have no longer pressure or restriction, and the fact that we are back to sea freight. And we have a plan to accompany the growth of the remaining markets in the coming months.\n\nJared Dinges\n\nEquity Research Analyst for European Staples, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. And maybe just to follow up on that, so you guys did call out Europe with IQOS saw some further negative inventory move in Q2. Should we expect that to reverse in H2? Because actually, it's been on the whole in H1; it's been somewhat sizable, the negative inventory impact.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. In fact, that's sure. In fact, that's Japan was finishing with lower shipment volume than consumer offtake in 2022. That has been reversing in 2023. And Europe went the other way around. Remember, we had to load because of uncertainty on availability of product and energy supply in the manufacturing site. That was expected, but the catch-up has been happening mostly in Q1, but still a little bit in Q2. Now we expect to move to normal pattern of shipment versus consumer offtake or in-market sales. Therefore, we expect to have a strong H2, both in terms of shipment progression and in-market sales in Europe. Back to normal.\n\nJared Dinges\n\nEquity Research Analyst for European Staples, JPMorgan\n\nThat's clear. If I can just follow up, just one last one. On Russia, given the news last week or this week, just can you give an update on if that business is fully ring-fenced at this point?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, on Russia, we have nothing new to say. We've been explaining in the past communication that the situation was complex. There is no new element. I'm not going to comment on the situation of companies that I know nothing about. We have nothing new to report on Russia at that stage.\n\nJared Dinges\n\nEquity Research Analyst for European Staples, JPMorgan\n\nGot it. Maybe just in terms of supply, Russia is not supplying any neighboring markets at this point, right?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nWell, we are, as you can imagine, complying with all regulation restriction sanctions today, and we are obviously fully compliant.\n\nJared Dinges\n\nEquity Research Analyst for European Staples, JPMorgan\n\nPerfect. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nIt appears we have no further questions on the line at this time. I will turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nVP of Investor Relations and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team. Have a great day.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nTalk to you soon. Thank you. Bye.\n\nOperator\n\nThis does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation.

I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. I am pleased to report that Q1 performance exceeded our expectations with strong underlying momentum from IQOS, ZYN and our combustible business. As mentioned at our full year earnings in February, we expected this quarter to be the weakest of the year due to a confluence of transitory factors impacting our top and bottom line.\nIn this context, our business delivered robust results, and we look forward with confidence to the remainder of the year. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 35% of total PMI, despite the impact of adverse timing factors on HTU shipments with an increasing number of markets crossing the 50% threshold. IQOS continued to deliver strong share and user growth across its geographies, both with the blade version and ILUMA.\nWe have launched ILUMA as excellent traction with both existing IQOS user and legal age smoker is boosting growth, demonstrating the dynamism and importance of our ongoing innovation. ILUMA's progress is especially notable in the first launch market of Japan, where share growth has accelerated in recent quarters. In combustibles, accelerated pricing across a range of markets helped to deliver robust organic net revenue growth. Swedish Match delivered impressive results, with a standout performance from ZYN's plus 47% U.S. shipment's volume growth compared to the first quarter of 2022.\nFollowing an encouraging start to the year, we are well set up to deliver strong performance in 2023, including excellent top and bottom line growth for the remainder of the year. Turning to the headline numbers. Our Q1 organic net revenues saw a robust growth of plus 3.2% against a very strong prior year quarter with organic growth of plus 9%. This reflects the continued strength of IQOS as a step-up in pricing, but was partially offset by expected HTU inventory movement, which I will come back to.\nThis organic figure does not include the excellent plus 14% ex currency top line growth of Swedish Match led by ZYN. Our total reported currency-neutral net revenue grew by plus 9.6%, with combined pro forma adjusted net revenue increasing by around plus 4%, also excluding currency. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 4.4%, with strong combustible pricing of plus 7.4%, partially offset by HTU dynamic in Japan and Germany, which I will come back to momentarily.\nWe delivered Q1 adjusted diluted earning per share of $1.38, well above our previous expectation. This reflect a strong underlying delivery from our existing operations, excellent Swedish Match performance and favorable phasing on interest costs. Compared to a record high prior year quarter and with a number of one-off or accentuated margin headwind from inflation, supply chain efficiency and timing factors as flagged previously, our adjusted diluted EPS contracted by minus 4.4%.\nLet me now walk through the mechanics of our Q1 net revenues. We delivered overall adjusted net revenue growth of plus 4.6% on an organic shipment volume decline of minus 1.1%. What was included in this number, Swedish Match smoke-free volume grew by an excellent plus 10%, adding impressive accretion to our overall growth profile. Combustible and HTU pricing, excluding Germany and Japan HTUs, contributed plus 5.3 points of growth, including positive HTU pricing in a number of markets.\nThis was partly offset by a negative 1.3 point HTU impact from Germany and Japan. The larger of the 2 was Germany, reflecting a full quarter of the 2022 excise tax increase for which we await a court ruling later this year. In Japan, the October 2022 excise tax increase and transition to ILUMA were also a drag on our top line, and we expect some of this impact to phase out in the second half. While the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit continues to positively impact our performance, lower shipments in Europe this quarter due to wholesaler and distributor inventory movements limited the benefit. This was also the main driver for the difference between our smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment volume growth.\nWe expect this positive mix shift to accelerate as both smoke-free organic net revenue growth and HTU shipment growth align more closely with offtake trends for the year as they also did in 2022. The positive mix impact of HTUs, overall volume growth and pricing are powerful drivers of our transformation and growth. As expected, the first quarter was impacted by peak margin headwinds at both the gross margin and adjusted operating income level.\nOur gross margin contracted by 0.6 percentage points due to the net impact of COGS inflation, pricing, volume, mix and productivity savings. We expect the positive elements of pricing, productivity and favorable HTU category mix to increasingly compensate and ultimately outweigh inflation as we progress through the year. Supply chain disruption and the accelerated transition of consumers and our business to ILUMA accounted for a further 0.6 percentage point impact.\nWe anticipate these items to abate as we progress with ILUMA launches and gain efficiencies in our supply chain, including a return to sea freight. In addition, specific cost phasing and the geographic mix of inventory movement, notably for HTUs in Europe, impacted our gross margin by 1.8 percentage points in the quarter. Despite these exceptional Q1 dynamics, we continue to forecast the full year 2023 margin impact of our heat-not-burn business to be favorable as inventory movement and ILUMA-related factors dissipate.\nTherefore, and as explained previously, we expect a progressive improvement in our gross profit and OI margin notably weighted towards H2 as headwinds subside and the underlying driver of our transformation accelerate. At around 26% of adjusted net revenues, our Q1 SG&A costs are at a similar ratio to the full year 2022. However, as expected, there was a notable increase compared to Q1 2022, given lower commercial spend at the beginning of last year, the inflationary environment, cost phasing and front-loaded commercial investments.\nOur successful cost efficiency programs continue to deliver, enabling ongoing investment and helping to mitigate inflation with $150 million of gross savings realized in Q1, of which almost $50 million were from SG&A. Importantly, we expect a significant slowdown in SG&A growth to a level below the rate of net revenue growth for the remainder of the year, which will support OI margin improvements.\nThis brings me to the outlook for 2023. Our robust Q1 performance supports visibility on strong full year growth. We continue to expect plus 7% to plus 8.5% organic top line progression with a targeted acceleration in HTU shipment volume growth versus 2022. As detailed in this morning's press release, our other operating assumptions remain unchanged. And we remind you that our organic metrics do not include the contribution from Swedish Match for the large majority of the year.\nOur updated full year adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $6.10 to $6.22 includes an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.30. Positive estimated impact from the euro and a number of other currencies are outweighed mainly by the weakness of the Japanese yen as well as the significant depreciation of the Russian ruble and the Egyptian pound. This range continues to reflect plus 7% to plus 9% currency-neutral growth and does not include any contribution from a potential favorable excise tax ruling in Germany, which we would expect to add around 3 points to our adjusted diluted EPS related to 2023 tax payment.\nWe continue to expect Swedish Match to be low single-digit accretive to our 2023 adjusted diluted EPS after financing and for an increase of around $200 million in our non-acquisition-related interest costs despite a relatively modest increment in Q1. As discussed at full year earnings in February, this year's bottom line results are expected to be notably H2 weighted. However, we expect our organic net revenue growth to already accelerate in the second quarter into the high single digit.\nWe forecast second quarter HTU shipment volume of between 30 billion and 32 billion, with adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $1.42 to $1.47, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.30. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect close to double-digit organic top line growth and a return to margin expansion. Looking now at our full year forecast through a different lens. After the temporary headwinds in Q1, we expect very strong performance for the remainder of the year.\nDespite ongoing margin headwinds and investment, we expect organic top line growth of plus 8% to plus 10%, improving margin with expansion in H2 and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10% to plus 13%. This reflects the strong underlying driver of our transformation with IQOS and ZYN driving volume at a higher net revenue per unit, combined with stepped-up pricing on combustible.\nTurning back to our results. Our HTU adjusted in-market sales volume grew by an estimated plus 16%, demonstrating continued strong growth momentum. HTU shipment volume of 27.4 billion units were towards the higher end of our forecast range, with growth of plus 10.4%, which was well below actual offtake trends as anticipated, due to distributor and wholesaler inventory movement. As implied by our full year HTU shipment forecast, we expect the rate of shipment growth to accelerate for the rest of the year as shipments convert with consumer offtake and to grow at a faster pace in 2023 than in 2022.\nBefore detailing this inventory impact, it is important to note that in certain markets, such as Germany, IMS sales volumes are not measured at the point of distributor sales to the retail trade as the data is not available. In these cases, we instead use our shipment as the proxy. This means that shipment fluctuations can impact both IMS volume and reported market share and may not be representative of offtake dynamic.\nGiven the volatility seen over this quarter and from now on, where there is a significant difference between estimated offtake performance and IMS data, we may choose to provide market share metrics based on adjusted IMS to better reflect offtake, where adjustments reflect the total estimated impact of distributor and wholesaler inventory movement. As you may note in the appendix to today's earnings release, this is the case for Germany this quarter where we also provide historical figures.\nComing back now to Q1. HTU shipment volume in several European markets were below consumer offtake. This is explained by the reversal of some inventory buildup at the end of Q4 2022 to meet the needs of ILUMA launch, as mentioned at our full year results in February, and also to create some safety stock to mitigate the risk of production and distribution constraints due to energy shortages.\nAs anticipated, we were able to adjust the safety stock in Q1 as the risk receded. We also decreased the level of IQOS blade HTU inventory in several markets to reduce the risk of upside stock, given the rapid transition to ILUMA. Notably, impacted markets include Italy and Germany, where underlying market share and offtake trends remain strong.\nItalian Q1 in-market sales volume grew by plus 21% compared to the prior year, with market share increasing from 15.4% in Q4 to 17.4% in Q1. In Germany, adjusted Q1 IMS volumes increased over 30% from the prior year, with adjusted market share up from 4.7% in Q4 to 5.3% in Q1. Now turning back to the overall picture, while total Q1 cigarette and HTU shipment volume declined by minus 1.1%, our total IMS volumes were essentially stable and grew excluding total estimated inventory movement.\nOur cigarette shipments declined by minus 3.1% with resilient trends in many markets. The decline includes a notable impact from a high prior year comparison in Japan and the introduction of an abrupt excise tax increase in Pakistan, resulting in an increase in illicit trade and an industry contraction of over 30%. Volumes also declined in the Philippines following industry pricing with consumer purchasing power facing ongoing pressure.\nWe continue to target stable to positive combined cigarette and HTU shipment volume for the year following growth in 2021 and 2022. This notably does not include the excellent growth prospects of oral nicotine for which shipment volume grew by plus 10% in Q1. Most importantly, the exciting growth combination of IQOS and ZYN presents an unrivaled platform for growth over the coming years.\nFocusing now on combustible, our portfolio delivered robust Q1 organic net revenue growth of plus 3%. This reflects strong pricing of plus 7.4% with a step-up across many markets, including Germany, Indonesia and the Philippines. With over 80% of planned 2023 combustible pricing implemented or announced, we have good visibility on the full year delivery, although some of the positive Q1 variance reflect earlier pricing compared to 2022. We now forecast a full year variance of plus 6% to plus 7%.\nOur cigarette category share declined by 0.3 percentage points in Q1, which was essentially all attributable to geographic mix as the total industry decline in large volume markets, such as the Philippines and Pakistan. The impact of share movements within market was neutral with gains, including Egypt, Poland and Turkey, offset by decline in markets such as Ukraine, the Philippines and Iraq.\nImportantly, we continue to target a stable category share in 2023 and over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Moving now to our smoke-free product. We estimate there were 25.8 million IQOS users as of March 31. This represents growth of close to 1 million adult users since December, with notable progress in Japan and Europe, in addition to a broad range of other geographies. IQOS ILUMA has been a positive catalyst for volume and share growth across a broad range of launch market, both supporting our strong position in the heat-not-burn category with a super user experience and fostering further category growth.\nFor existing IQOS users, ILUMA drives an accelerated upgrade cycle. This enhances retention and full conversion for the future with a temporary margin impact from concentrated device sales. Indeed, we are now approaching an estimated 10 million ILUMA users with ILUMA taking over 85% of HTU volume in the first launch market of Japan, Switzerland and Spain. ILUMA is also enabling better acquisition and conversion of legal age smokers with market share acceleration visible in both earlier and more recently launched markets, such as Italy and Korea.\nSince the introduction in these 2 markets in Q4, we are seeing encouraging trends in initial launch area and expect this to be increasingly visible at the national level over time as it is in Japan and Greece after a seasonal inflection in the latter. Our main focus in Q1 was on ensuring the success of ILUMA in the 16 markets launched by the end of 2022, which cover over half of our IQOS business by volumes. In addition, we launched ILUMA on a limited basis in Indonesia in February via our IQOS Club Member program.\nThis IQOS Club was introduced in 2019 and now has over 100,000 estimated users across 10 cities with a notable boost from the launch of ILUMA. We expect to progressively launch ILUMA in more markets this year. With ILUMA accelerating IQOS growth were launched, PMI HTUs continue to strengthen their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present with a record high share of 9% in Q1.\nImpressively, as of Q1 PMI HTUs are now the #1 nicotine brand in 10 markets with the addition of Italy and Greece during the quarter. Focusing now on Europe, which under our new regional structure include additional markets such as Ukraine, our first quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.7 points to reach 9.2% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume adjusted for estimated wholesaler and distributor inventory movement, such as those I mentioned earlier in Germany and Italy.\nOn the same adjusted basis, IMS volume continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 11.1 billion units on the 4-quarter moving average. This reflects strong progress across the region. We expect our Europe HTU volume to grow strongly in the remainder of the year, while as in the past, our quarterly HTU share of market can be impacted by seasonality of cigarette consumption during Q2 and Q3.\nTo give some further color on our outstanding progress in the region. Slide 16 shows the selection of the latest key cities offtake share. The success of IQOS continue across a diverse range of geographies from Western, Southern, Central and Eastern Europe, including markets with and without ILUMA. Notable standout include Budapest with over 35% offtake share as well as Rome and Athens reaching the high 20s. To my earlier comments, we are very pleased with performance in Germany, where offtake share in Munich surpassed 10% for the first time. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory developments in Greece, where the Ministry of Health approved differentiated health claim for heated tobacco product. Greece is the first country outside of the United States that permitted health-related statements following a robust scientific assessment.\nIn Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents over 35% of total tobacco with IQOS driving category growth. The acceleration seen in recent quarters continued in Q1. Adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 3.4 points to 26.2%, with offtake share surpassing 32% in Tokyo and 30% in Sendai. Adjusted IMS volume again grew sequentially, reaching a record high of 9 billion units on the 4-quarter moving average.\nStrong performance in Japan further highlight the importance of continuous innovation and a broad consumable portfolio. Our premium priced TEREA HTUs and mainstream price SENTIA HTUs continue to grow through Q1, strengthening their position as the 2 largest heat-not-burn brand. We are delighted with the progress in Japan. And as we look forward to further robust volume growth in the coming quarters, we would also like to remind you of the seasonality impact on quarterly share metrics.\nIn addition to stronger IQOS gains in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income market, which are now approaching 30% of our total HTU volume. This slide highlights the selection of Q1 key city offtake shares across markets in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Latin America. Notable successes include Bulgaria with offtake share of over 16% and Egypt, where offtake share in Cairo reached 7.5%. We also continue to see robust offtake volume growth across these important future markets.\nNow moving on to Swedish Match business, which delivered an excellent Q1 performance with currency-neutral net revenue growth of plus 14% and smoke-free product comprising 77% of total net revenues. Most impressive was the continued outstanding performance of ZYN in the U.S. with plus 47% volume growth to 73 million cans. While volume growth benefited from inventory movement, including restocking in California following the December flavor ban, underlying growth in volumes was very strong, estimated well above plus 30%.\nWe are also pleased with the Q1 performance in other U.S. smoke-free categories, including moist snuff, which gained plus 0.8 percentage point category share and delivered shipment volume growth of plus 3%. The smoke-free category in Scandinavia continued to grow, driven by nicotine pouches, albeit at a slower rate following January's new excise tax increase in Sweden and Norway with destocking accentuating the volume decline for Swedish Match premium skewed portfolio.\nIn cigars, the business delivered positive pricing and robust shipment volume growth of plus 4% in a declining category, driven by the strong development of natural leaf varieties. Finally, I would like to congratulate Swedish Match employees for continuing to deliver excellent results as we thoughtfully integrate our activities. The integration is progressing very well, and we look forward to sharing more on our combined growth plan later this year.\nNow let's examine ZYN's recent U.S. performance in more detail. Super progress continued with a record increase in 12 months rolling shipment volume of 23 million cans, which equates to plus 40% growth. Category volume share remained essentially stable, despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offerings. Importantly, retail value share for ZYN also remained strong at 75.6%, highlighting its premium positioning and superior brand equity.\nThere are 2 key engine driving the U.S. growth of ZYN as covered at CAGNY. First is a progressive increase in distribution with a number of stores plus 13% higher than Q1 2022 at around 140,000. There remains ample opportunity to further increase this over time. Second, our velocity or the number of cans sold per store per week, ZYN velocity is going to grow sequentially and by an impressive plus 21% compared to prior year as the brand continued to resonate with adult nicotine users.\nNow let me update you on our exciting plans to further accelerate our smoke-free journey. As previously mentioned, the full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority. We are on track to make substantial progress this year as HTU manufacturing constraints continue to ease. We continue to work on our IQOS U.S. commercialization plan for launch in Q2 2024 in line with the principle outlined at the recent CAGNY Conference.\nWith the benefit of the expertise and commercial tools from launching IQOS successfully in over 70 international markets and the U.S. market with a clear regulatory framework and the ability to communicate with adult smokers, we remain very positive about the opportunity. Importantly, we believe we can make the necessary investment in the U.S. business, generating additional top line performance while continuing to deliver strong bottom line growth for PMI during the investment period.\nIn addition to our premium offerings, we are continuing to focus on BONDS, our latest heat-not-burn innovation, that is especially relevant for low- and middle-income consumer. Pilot launches in the Philippines and Colombia are progressing well, and we intend to continue taking the learnings from this market before deploying on a wider scale. Another key midterm opportunity from the Swedish Match combination is the international expansion of nicotine pouches, notably within the world's leading brand.\nAt CAGNY, I mentioned we are targeting up to 10 launches or relaunches this year as we look to develop the category with adult smoker who value the convenient, specific use occasion, test and satisfaction. We expect this to commence in a few markets this summer, including both developed and emerging countries. While staying clearly focused on the heat-not-burn and nicotine pouch category, which present the largest and most accretive growth opportunities, we are adjusting our VEEV e-vapor portfolio approach. We intend to focus on commercializing in select markets and prioritizing profitability, given the known category challenges.\nVEEV 1 is a new pod-based system providing an enhanced user experience with fully outsourced manufacturing of devices and consumables to optimize cost. VEEV 1 will replace the current VEEV product. And as a result, we no longer intend to file a PMTA for the former technology. Instead, we will focus our near-term FDA engagement on IQOS and ZYN. We will come back on future e-vapor FDA authorizations in due course.\nFor this possible, the fastest-growing e-vapor segment, we are rebranding VEEBA to VEEV now. All of our e-vapor product will now be under the single recognizable brand VEEV for a seamless consumer experience. We will introduce a new VEEV 1 platform in Canada later this month and will apply an agile and disciplined approach for further VEEV rollout later this year.\nMoving to sustainability. I want to first draw your attention to our 2022 integrated report published earlier this month, which outlines the progress we are making towards achieving our purpose and smoke-free future. The report provides a comprehensive run-through of all our most material sustainability topic. This includes those in focus for investors such as post-consumer waste, use access prevention, decarbonization and our resource allocation towards advancing our smoothly transformation.\nIn conjunction with the integrated report, we also published an updated ESG KPI protocol, providing even more robust criteria on how we define success and measure ESG performance. It focuses on the KPIs included in our Sustainability Index, which, as outlined in our 2023 proxy statement, continue to represent 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation.\nI am also proud to announce that we released our first TCFD report yesterday, which updates and comprise our previous disclosure on how we are implementing the recommendation of the task force on climate-related financial disclosures in 1 document. This will be an important topic for many companies as reporting regulations evolve. Lastly, we are also pleased that following CDP's AAA recognition, PMI was again included in CDP's Supplier Engagement Leaderboard, contributing towards achieving our Scope 3 ambitions.\nTo conclude today's presentation, we are on for a strong performance in 2023, despite margin headwinds. Our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong, and we expect these headwinds to progressively ease through the year. Indeed, we delivered higher-than-expected Q1 results, which put us on track for the third consecutive year of high single-digit organic net revenue growth. Continued excellent IQOS and ZYN performance further enhances our position as a global smoke-free champion with leadership position in the largest category of heat-not-burn and the fastest-growing category of oral nicotine.\nWe are taking actions through pricing in combustible and our cost-saving initiatives to recover cost inflation as we progress rapidly towards our ambition to become the majority smoke-free business. Finally, we remain a highly cash-generative business with an unwavering commitment to our progressive dividend policy. We look forward to further rewarding our shareholders as our transformation delivers sustainable growth.\nThank you, and we are now extremely happy to answer your questions.",

Please go ahead, sir.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Philip Morris International\n\nWelcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on PMI.com. A glossary of terms including the definition for smoke-free products as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable US GAAP measures and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results excluding acquisitions and disposals. As such, figures and comparisons presented on an organic basis exclude Swedish Match up until 11 November 2023. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022 and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. I'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer, and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, James, and welcome everyone. We had a remarkable year for our smoke-free transformations in 2022. Despite the exceptional challenges of the war in Ukraine, severe supply chain disruptions, and global inflation, we delivered very strong financial performance and took two major strategic strides towards a smoke-free future. I would like to express my deepest thanks to all my colleagues who spared no effort to drive excellent business results during these unprecedented times.\nOur thoughts also continue to be with those affected by the war in Ukraine and the recent tragedy in Turkey and Syria.\nIn 2022, PMI delivered its second consecutive year of total volume growth, reflecting continued IQOS progress and broadly stable cigarette volumes.\nFull-year smoke-free net revenues reach almost 1/3 of total PMI and over 50% in 17 markets. This is impressive progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by net revenues. In 2025 IQOS outstanding results continued with over 21% full-year growth in both shipment volumes and in-market sales excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects broad-based momentum in the European Union region, Japan, and emerging markets. IQOS ILUMA continues to generate excellent growth in its launch markets with upgrades from existing users and new user acquisition outperforming our initial expectations.\nThe success is supported by the increasing deployment of a two-tier heated tobacco units portfolio providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and highly and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes.\nIn fuels, we delivered a robust performance with 3.7% growth in organic net revenues and 0.3 percentage points higher share of segment excluding Russia and Ukraine. Despite the impact of adult smokers moving to smoke-free products.\nWe also achieved two critical strategic milestones this year, reaching an agreement to take full control of IQOS in the US in 2024 and successfully completing the acquisition of Swedish Match. These achievements will accelerate our smoke-free journey and further position us to lead the transformation of the wider industry.\nClearly, currency headwinds were extremely strong and weighed on our US dollar performance, but although volatility remains, I am pleased that they seem to significantly abate in 2023.\nOverall, 2022 was a pivotal year and we look forward with confidence to 2023 and beyond. Let me now take a moment to cover our key strategic priorities for the coming year.\nWith the acquisition of Swedish Match and securing the rights to IQOS in the US, we are now a global smoke-free champion. The addition of the world's biggest market and the leading nicotine pouch brand ZYN alongside IQOS provides us with significant untapped opportunities to further accelerate the growth of smoke-free products.\nAs the strength of our IQOS business continues to grow rapidly. The full global rollout of IQOS ILUMA is a major priority, and we expect to make substantial progress on this in 2023.\nThe success of ILUMA in launch markets so far demonstrates the importance of groundbreaking consumer-centric innovation, and we continue to broaden our portfolio with new science-backed offerings. This includes BONDS by IQOS, our latest heat-not-burn device aimed at low and middle-income adult smokers. Pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines in the last quarter of last year show encouraging early results, and we intend to take the learnings from these markets before deploying on a wider scale.\nFollowing a successful first three years of partnership with KT&G, we also recently extended our long-term agreement to commercialize their innovative smoke-free portfolio outside South Korea.\nI am very pleased to welcome Swedish Match to the PMI family. In particular, the fast-growing potential of ZYN is an incredibly exciting addition to our company. We are focused on supporting the Swedish Match team to continue and accelerate ZYN's outstanding success in the US while also leveraging PMI commercial capabilities to prepare for international expansion of nicotine pouches.\nIQOS and ZYN are premium brands leading the global categories in the US. ZYN is helping American smokers leave cigarettes behind and offers great growth prospects for IQOS. The world's biggest smoke-free market is a fully untapped opportunity, and our plans are well underway in anticipation of our commercialization in second quarter of 2024.\nWe will be leveraging the sales and distribution capabilities of Swedish Match and deploying our commercial model, digital engine organization, and infrastructure for a successful rollout. We continue to expect to file an FDA application for ILUMA in the second half of 2023.\nLogically, the international expansion of pouches, US IQOS penetration, and the replacement of IQOS 3 with ILUMA entail additional investments this year, which combined with inflationary pressure will weigh temporarily on our margins. Indeed, many of the ILUMA-related costs, a one-off in nature, as Emmanuel will explain shortly.\nIn fuels, we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization while taking judicious pricing actions. As we have explained previously, maintaining our leadership in fuels helps us maximize switching to smoke-free product through the connection to adult smokers and the retail trade.\nIn terms of our financials, the strength of our business provides a robust operating cash flow, which we intend to maximize to provide reinvestment in our smoke-free business, deleveraging, and growing dividend.\nFinally, and importantly, shaping tobacco harm reduction by providing better alternatives to smokers and advocating for science-based regulation is critical to accelerate the end of smoking. Harm reduction is also at the core of our transformation as we lead on sustainability to achieve a positive impact.\nWe will be expanding on some of these topics at the Cagney conference on February 22 and we also plan to host an Investor Day in September this year where we will go into great detail on our strategies and future vision, particularly with regard to the US.\nNow I will hand it over to Emmanuel to discuss our results in 2023 and outlook in more detail.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Jacek. Our business, driven by the strength of our innovative and expanding smoke-free portfolio, generated excellent top- and bottom-line 2022 growth despite a very difficult operating environment and currency headwinds. Our full-year net revenues grew organically by +7.7% excluding Russia and Ukraine and by +7.1% for total PMI despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey. This reflects the continued strength of IQOS, accelerating pricing, and the recovery of fuels in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison. Notably in H1, IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of our full-year smoke-free net revenue both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine. Our net revenue per unit grew +4.4% organically excluding Russia and Ukraine and by +5.5% in total.\nThis was driven by fuel pricing of +4% excluding Russia and Ukraine, and +5% overall, and the positive mix impact of an increasing proportion of HTUs, heated tobacco units, in our overall volumes. At higher net revenue per unit, our 2022 operating income margin contracted organically by 60 basis points excluding Russia and Ukraine, and by 70 basis points in total due to a number of headwinds which I will come back to. These headwinds were partially mitigated by the growth of IQOS pricing and ongoing cost savings. In 2022, we delivered gross savings of $800 million with over $1.6 billion in the first two years of our cost efficiency program. This puts us well on track to exceed our target of $2 billion over 2021-2023 and mitigate recent inflationary pressures.\nDespite margin pressures, our excellent top-line growth and diligent cost management enabled us to deliver currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of ±11.9% to $5.34 excluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes unfavorable currency of $0.85 and a small contribution from Swedish Match net of financing cost. For the 50 days of consolidated results for total PMI, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $5.98.\nWe also had a strong finish to the year. We delivered excellent Q4 organic net revenue growth of +7.9% excluding Russia and Ukraine, again reflecting continued strong IQOS performance and robust fuel pricing. Our Q4 operating income margin expanded organically by 80 basis points excluding Russia and Ukraine, mainly due to a favorable comparison on a total PMI basis. Organic margins were flat including the impact of a challenging comparison in Ukraine and shipment timing in Russia. Fourth quarter currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by +20.8% to $1.23 excluding Russia and Ukraine and by 15.3% in total to $1.39. An excellent performance.\nBefore discussing our 2023 guidance, I would like to provide an update on our Ukraine and Russia businesses. We continue to support our employees in Ukraine. I would like to personally thank them for their tremendous efforts to secure our business continuity during these extremely difficult times in Russia. The environment for divestment has become increasingly challenging and complex, especially given recent December 2022 regulatory developments. To provide more clarity to investors on the full extent of our business, we will now include both Ukraine and Russia in our 2023 outlook and reporting.\nNow turning to the 2023 outlook, we expect to deliver very strong organic net revenue growth of +7% to +8.5%, supported by a step up in fuel pricing and another year of rapid progress from IQOS. This would represent the third consecutive year of organic top line growth above +7% and exclude the impact of Swedish Match for the large majority of the year. Including Swedish Match, we expect our reported currency neutral net revenues to grow into the teens as its business continue to deliver strong performance.\nWe expect excellent IQOS momentum to increase our HTU volume growth on a total PMI basis supported by the growing presence of ILUMA across our key markets. We forecast between 125 and 130 billion HTU shipment volume volumes representing 15% to 19% growth. This reflects an acceleration compared to the total PMI growth rate in 2022 despite an expectation of no significant progress in Russia given our decision to restrict investment and innovation. As mentioned previously, the pace of ILUMA launches has also been constrained by supply chain disruption, and the outstanding take up in initial launch markets. We expect this constraint to gradually improve through the first half as we progressively roll out to more geographies.\nWe expect organic smoke-free net revenue growth to have an aligned progression with the rate of HTU volume growth this year, with less distortion from device revenues including Swedish Match, and at constant currency, we expect to deliver around $13.5 billion in smoke-free net revenue compared to $10 billion in 2022 and to approach 40% of total PMI net revenues this year. While our top-line outlook is very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant margin pressures from the intensifying inflationary environment, in addition to a number of specific transitory factors and investment, which I will come back to shortly. As a result, we expect our adjusted operating income margin to contract between 50 to 150 basis points organically. Accordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7% to 9%.\nThis includes a full year's positive contribution from Swedish Match net of the related interest expense. However, this benefit is offset by the increase interest cost on our non-Swedish Match debt and plan investment. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.25 to 6.37 including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates.\nThis forecast notably does not factor any potential favorable court ruling in Germany regarding the legality surcharge on the existing excise tax on heated tobacco product effective in Germany as of 2022. We continue to account for the excise surcharge in our results and outlook. However, the obligation to pay the surcharge is currently suspended. If favorable, the difference to our forecasted 2023 excise payments would increase our net revenue by around 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth by around 3 points, thereby increasing our forecast currency neutral growth range to +10 to +12%. In this scenario, we would expect our operating cash flow would move towards the upper half of our forecast range. We expect a judgment toward the end of the year.\nThere are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect total international industry volume of cigarette and heated tobacco unit excluding China and the US to decline by -1% to -2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product and the growth of the category, we expect to gain share and target total PMI shipment volume to be flat to +1%, which would represent a 1/3 consecutive year of growth.\nWhile we seek to maintain our share of the fuel category, given the current inflationary environment, we assume fuel pricing will accelerate to around 6% on an organic basis compared to the +5% realized in 2022. We also expect full year capital expenditure of around $1.3 billion as compared to $1.1 billion in 2022 reflecting increased investment behind our smoke-free platform including ILUMA, and Swedish Match Portfolio.\nLet me now come back to the various factors impacting our margins in 2022. Total PMI gross margin contracted by 220 basis points organically, while growing inflationary pressures were a drag. The largest impact came from the combination of the rapid growth of ILUMA and transitory factors such as supply chain disruption, and the need to use air freight. ILUMA drove accelerated device replacement from existing user in Japan and other launch market. Such devices are positive for acquisition, retention, and full conversion. However, devices are margin dilutive, and this dynamic is likely to continue on a temporary basis as we roll out to more markets this year and consumers upgrade from IQOS blade. The initially higher weight and cost of ILUMA consumable also played a role, and this meant that the overall of our heat-not-burn business including devices was margin dilutive in 2022.\nImportantly, average gross margin on HTUs remained around 10 percentage points higher than for cigarette on the higher net revenue per unit. This is a fundamental long-term positive margin driver through the growing HTU volume mix in our business, and this had a plus 110 basis point favorable impact in 2022. Our two other key long-term margin drivers of pricing and productivity also continued to contribute favorably. Gross margin headwinds were mitigated at the operating income margin level by SG&A cost, which declined by 150 basis points of net revenues due primarily to cost efficiency, operating leverage, and comparison effect.\nThe picture for 2023 is quite different. While our gross margin will face increased inflationary pressure, this is now primarily due to COGS for the cigarette business as lease, assets, ETOW, salaries, and energy costs increase. An acceleration in fuel pricing and lower air freight costs will serve to mitigate this exceptional inflation. However, the timeline is built into our projections. Importantly, while cost inflation is also a headwind for IQOS, the 2023 margin impact of our heat not burn business is expected to be favorable due to the positive impact of increased HTU volume at higher net revenue per unit, planned ILUMA efficiency, and a more measured increase in device volumes. Overall, these underlying strengths from IQOS combined with pricing will not be sufficient to offset fuel cost inflation in 2023.\nHowever, we expect a lower organic gross margin decline compared to last year and for our non-fuels business to have an increasingly visible positive impact as we approach 2024. 2023 SG&A cost will include incremental investment to drive future growth, including in the commercialization of ILUMA. Also included is around $150 million with a broadly even split between the US, where we are preparing our organizational capability for the launch of IQOS, and wellness and healthcare investment in product development, and clinical trials. In addition to inflation, this means an SG&A cost increase. More in line with net revenue growth is likely, with limited margin impact.\nA few words now on 2023 phasing. We expect margin pressures to be weighted to the first half, particularly given a challenging Q1 2022 comparison and a progressive decrease in air freight cost throughout the year. In addition, investments are expected to be front-loaded, and we know that the rollout of ILUMA can lead to a short period of slower user acquisition as consumers wait for the launch. Combined with the timing of shipment and cost saving, we expect our 2023 top- and bottom-line delivery to be heavily H2-weighted. Indeed, we expect the first quarter to be the most challenging with low single-digit organic top-line growth and soft margin. Shipment timing and ILUMA launch impact are expected to be pronounced, and we accordingly expect HTU shipment volume of around 26 to 28 billion HTUs.\nWe also face a comparison with a significantly lower impact from war-related disruption. We forecast adjusted diluted EPS of $1.28 to 1.33 including $0.10 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. Importantly, we expect margin to improve as we approach 2024 as headwinds relent and the fundamental margin-accretive driver of our smoke-free transformation continue in the form of heated tobacco unit growth, pricing, and cost optimization on ILUMA.\nOur cash flow generation remains strong. We delivered $10.8 billion in 2022 operating cash flows, representing +3% growth on a currency-neutral basis. This includes a favorable timing of certain financing items of around $0.3 billion given non-recurring item and working capital movement benefited 2021 by around $1 billion. This was an excellent result. In 2023, we forecast $10 to $11 billion in operating cash flow despite a notable expected impact from higher working capital requirements due to growth, global inflation, and the reversal of one-off timing benefit. This put us on track to deliver our 2023 target of around $35 billion given in February 2021 at then-prevailing rates.\nWhile our net debt is 2.9x adjusted EBITDA on a 12-month trailing basis, this reflects only 50 days of Swedish Match result. Including a full year contribution for Swedish Match would clearly result in a lower ratio. We target robust EBITDA growth, which combined with strong cash flow allows us to focus on deleveraging while continuing to invest in innovation and the growth of our business. In addition, our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders.\nTurning back to our 2022 results, both our HTU and in-market sales volume increased by around 21.5%, supporting total volume growth of +3.2% excluding Russia and Ukraine. Q4 HTU shipment volume grew by +37.5%, partly reflecting the replenishment of inventory for ILUMA in Japan following lower shipment earlier in the year and favorable shipment timing in the EU, notably in advance of new ILUMA launches, supported by very solid seaguide performance. We delivered total volume growth for the second consecutive year both including and excluding Russia and Ukraine.\nFocusing now on fuels, our portfolio delivered robust organic net revenue growth of +3.7% for the full year excluding Russia and Ukraine. fuel pricing increased in H2 as we continue to adjust to the inflationary environment. This resulted in Q4 organic pricing of +4.8% excluding Russia and Ukraine and yielded full year pricing in line with our expectation of with notable contribution from Germany, the Philippines, and Turkey. Despite the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in 2022, our share of the cigarette category increased by +0.3 percentage points excluding Russia and Ukraine, following category share decline in 2020 and 2021 exacerbated by the pandemic. This includes sequential growth in every quarter of 2022. Marlboro remains extremely resilient despite pressure on disposable income and the impact of IQOS cannibalization, with +0.2 percentage point share of segment growth.\nIn addition, while we have not yet seen any meaningful acceleration in down trading, our share in the low price segment increased by +0.6 percentage point excluding Russia and Ukraine. As Jacek mentioned earlier, maintaining our leadership in the cigarette category is a key enabler in accelerating smoker switching to better alternatives.\nOur robust cigarette share combined with the growth of IQOS delivered an overall market share gain of +0.6 points in 2022 excluding Russia and Ukraine, with notable contribution from Egypt, Italy, Japan, and Poland. PMI heated tobacco units continue to strengthen their position towards becoming the largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present, and reached the number two position in 2022 with a record high share of 8.5% in Q4.\nNow focusing on IQOS user growth, there was an estimated 20.3 million IQOS user as of 31 December 2022 excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects growth of around 3.5 million for the full year. For total PMI, we estimate there were almost 25 million IQOS users as of year end. Consistent with comments in our recent disclosure, user growth in October and November was slower due to higher than expected impact from Morris commercial activity, and lower acquisition for IQOS blade product in anticipation of the launch of ILUMA in 7 key markets. However, we saw a strong rebound in December as ILUMA launches continued, delivering robust user growth of plus 0.8 million for the quarter. This was actually close to our initial expectation, and we look forward with confidence to 2023 as ILUMA continues to be deployed.\nILUMA is driving volume and share growth across its market, supporting our strong position in the heated-tobacco category. We launched in eight new markets in Q4 including the Czech Republic, Italy, Portugal, and South Korea bring the total to 16 markets with ILUMA launched now represents more than half of our total HTU volumes. ILUMA delivers a superior consumer experience as evidenced by net promoter scores which on average increased by more than 10 points across its different market archetypes, and higher conversion rate compared to IQOS 3 Duo. While the rates of acceleration differ by market in both Switzerland and the more recently launched United Arab Emirates, ILUMA share has almost doubled since launch. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, the benefit of scale and optimization should allow us to bring down the cost of ILUMA over time starting in H2 2023.\nFocusing now on the European Union, where smoke-free net revenue exceeded 40% of the region for the full year, our fourth quarter HTU share increased by +2.4 points to reach 8.8% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, with a modest flattening effect from timing factor. Our volume continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 9.3 billion units on the four-quarter moving average. This reflects success across many markets and key cities, including Vilnius with over 43% share, as well as Athens, and Rome with over 25%.\nIn Japan, the heat-not-burn category now represents close to 35% of total tobacco with IQOS increasingly driving its growth in Q4. The adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by +2.6 points to 24.5% with F-tech share in Tokyo surpassing 30%. Our two-tier consumable portfolio continues to deliver strong results. IMS again grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.8 billion units on the four-quarter moving average as the number of Japanese IQOS users crossed a remarkable 7.5 million adult consumers.\nIn addition to strong IQOS gain in developed market, we continue to see very promising growth in low- and middle-income market. In 2022 our HTU shipments grew by almost 50% excluding Russia and Ukraine. This robust performance reflects success across many markets including Egypt, where IQOS share surpassed 7%, Bulgaria, and Malaysia, where Q4 IQOS share reached 14% in both capital cities.\nLet's now move on to Swedish Match which finished the year strongly, further confirming our belief that this combination will be accretive to our growth and margin profile over the coming years. Please note for housekeeping purposes that my comments on Swedish Match financial results are based on publicly available information through 30 September and from 11 November when it was consolidated in PMI's financial statement. Swedish Match delivered excellent performance following the acquisition with strong net revenue and adjusted operating income. Most impressive was the phenomenal US growth of ZYN, which I will come back to on the next slide. In other US smoke-free products, moist snuff also performed well, gaining almost 1 percentage point share of segment and growing 2022 volume within a declining category.\nIn Scandinavia, the overall smoke-free market and Swedish Match continued to grow, albeit helped by year-end trade inventory movement ahead of a January excise tax increase. In Sweden.\nThe cigar business delivered robust performance to end a challenging year with growth in volume and category share. We are very pleased with the strong 2022 result from Swedish Match, which also included positive pricing across all smoke-free category. We look forward to reporting our combined results going forward.\nNow let's discuss ZYN's recent US performance in more detail. Excellent progress continues with shipment volume growth of ±37% in 2022 and ±35% in Q4 reaching a record quarterly high. ZYN's category volume share grew sequentially by one percentage point compared to Q3 and by 2.2 percentage points compared to the prior year, further strengthening its position as a clear number one nicotine pouch brand despite continued heavy competitive discounting from less premium offering. Importantly, retail value share for ZYN remains strong at 75.7%, highlighting its premium positioning and high brand equity.\n2023 promises to be a very exciting year. We are thrilled to have welcomed Swedish Match employee and leading overall nicotine portfolio into the PMI family to create a global smoke-free champion, and we will work together to create value as we accelerate toward our shared vision of a smoke-free future. In particular, bringing ZYN and IQOS together in both the US and international markets presents a significant opportunity to drive accelerated growth and switching of adult smoker to better alternative.\nAs a well-run and successful business, we expect continued strong performance from Swedish Match's existing operation. A key focus this year will be supporting and further driving strong ZYN growth in the US. In addition, we are now preparing for the international expansion of nicotine pouches, leveraging Swedish Match's rich product portfolio and PMI's extensive smoke-free commercial infrastructure. In parallel, we will be actively enhancing Swedish Match's US distribution and commercial capability for the launch of IQOS in 2024.\nMoving now to sustainability as we transform our company, our business and sustainability strategy are advancing hand in hand with increasing momentum. PMI and Swedish Match have a shared vision and values. The combination helps us further accelerate toward achieving our purpose. Transforming for good to make cigarette obsolete and maximize the benefit of smoke free products. Our goal for best in class ESG performance is aligned as we seek to address the environmental impact of our product, eradicate child labor, reduce our carbon footprint, and provide a more inclusive and empowered working environment for all our employees. In December we publish a standalone report detailing our new biodiversity and water ambitions. For biodiversity, we aim to achieve no net loss on ecosystem connected to our value chain by 2033 and contribute towards a net positive impact on nature by 2050.\nFor water stewardship, we aim to scale solutions towards a positive impact on water resources by 2033 and contribute toward a positive impact on water resources by 2050. I am also proud to share that for the third consecutive year we have been awarded CDP's AAA. CDP score, nearly 15,000 on their climate change, forest, and water security disclosures, of which only 12 received this prestigious score. In addition, I am excited to share that we are included in the 2023 Bloomberg Gender Equality Index for the third year running. I'll now turn it back to Jacek for concluding remarks.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. Overall, our business delivered both a strong fourth quarter and full-year performance despite many challenging headwinds. We achieved excellent top- and bottom-line growth with double-digit currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth and almost $6 of adjusted EPS for total PMI.\nThe consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottom line delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last three years.\nMost impressive was the continued outstanding performance of IQOS, which is now complemented by the remarkable growth of ZYN combined with Swedish Match. We have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership positions in heat-not-burn, and the fast-growing category of oral nicotine.\nWe expect 2023 to be a landmark year.\nFor our smoke-free transformation with smoke-free net revenues of around $13.5 billion at constant currency approaching 40% of our compound.\nWe have exciting opportunities for growing nicotine pouches in the US and internationally, along with the US commercialization of IQOS next year.\nWe expect margin headwinds will persist in 2023 before improving in 2024. However, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong and we look forward with confidence.\nWith an excellent performance over the past two years and our strong 2023 outlook, we expect to comfortably exceed our three-year minimum CAGR targets of more than 5% organic net revenue growth, more than 9% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth, and broadly stable shipment volumes.\nFinally, our strong growth outlook and highly cash generated business enables us to deleverage while maintaining our steadfast commitment to our progressive dividend policy.\nThank you for your attention. Emmanuel and I will be happy now to answer your questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference again. In order to ask a question or make a comment, please press the star key followed by one on your touchtone phone. In the interest of fairness and time, we ask that participants keep to a maximum of two questions each. If time allows, follow up questions may be taken. You may rejoin the queue again by pressing star, then one on your touchtone phone.\nWe'll take our first question from Chris O'Cull with Stifel.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Chris,\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\ngood morning. I want to ask you, first of all, you give some great color there and detail in your remarks. As I look at the EPS growth.\nIn 2023, just understand some of the.\nBurdens on that growth.\nWe know about $150 million of investment you've outlined for the US and your.\nHealth and Wellness Division. What other costs do you foresee in some of these? Supply chain costs and use of AI.\nFreight, for example, how much are those?\nBurdening your costs for the year? If you can give some color on that.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nMaybe I start, then Emmanuel will chip in, I guess. Yes, it's $115 million between the US and the wellness health care, almost evenly spread between the two. Now you have the air freight, and this is more of the thing which I think we should start seeing some improvements in 2023 and especially as we go towards the second half of the year. I think we should start normalize the use of the air freight, which will then obviously continue to the 2024. Now you have the inflationary pressure on the COGS. I think Emmanuel mentioned in his remarks the leaf. Leaf, obviously due to our.\nDuration of inventories of the leaf and the way the leaf prices are rolling through the P&L, that's something which lasts usually longer. You have three years about the duration of inventory. So on a moving average.\nInflation that spreads over the period of time you have energy, which is obviously the big hit across the number, directly or indirectly through the materials. Now we start seeing energy prices easing, at least at this stage. But also you bind it by some contractual arrangements, etc. So I don't think that's going to help in 2023, but I remain cautiously optimistic that as of 2024 we should start seeing reversal of those. Obviously you have a cost of the IQOS ILUMA rollout, right? Because we are at the year end, we'v\nWhich obviously are the drag on the margins, and we're essentially accelerating replacement of the devices at the existing consumers level, but with the very clear view now that we have a very nice payback going forward with the accelerated acquisition, better consumption, better conversion rates, and that's the key items. Emmanuel, if I miss something important.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nNo, I think you were very exhaustive. Clearly, Jacek, just to add a couple of further details, clearly in 2023 we've been flagging it. We expect our non-fuels business to contribute positively at the level of the gross margin rate evolution. So in 2023 it's really inflation impacting us very negatively at the level of all cost of goods. But on fuels we're going to increase price, but it's not going to be so sufficient to offset this impact. And just to give you a color, Jacek was alluding to energy price. We're not talking about even double-digit inflation, I mean energy price between 2023 and 2021 we are talking about close to a 3x factor. So it's a big increase with a big impact on the P&L. Overtime. With price increase we're going to overcome that.\nBut there is just a lag, as we said, on matching that. Then there is a big difference also on our SG&A cost evolution. In 2022, we were flat because we've been generating a lot of efficiencies. Inflation was not as hard as it's going to be in 2023 with a lot of salary increase and probably the basis of comparison were more favorable. In 2023, we expect to grow our SG&A in line with top line more or less, which one would expect. We continue to invest a lot in.\nOrder to support the growth of the.\nBusiness to acquire new user digital investment. We talk about the US, wellness, and health care, and there will still be efficiency, but not at the same level. Last element that I have to add, the cost of the debt. I'm not talking about the debt of acquisition of Swedish Match because for Swedish Match, we are in line with expectation, that is a low single-digit accretion on the EPS. But clearly, for the existing debt, there is also an increase in the cost, and that is having an impact on the evolution of the adjusted EPS. I think with that, Chris, we are giving all the information we can on what we are facing in terms of.\nEvolution on our cost.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThat was sure exhaustive. Thank you for that, it was very helpful. I had just one quick follow-up which would be that you have heated tobacco unit growth expectation of that 15% to 19%. I just want to get an understanding on two facets of that. Is Russia, Ukraine down likely in 2023, given you're not investing there, and then just to what degree it's capacity-limited today.\nIf you had more ILUMA capacity, could.\nThat grow even faster? Thank you for your time.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nOkay, so actually the Russia in Ukraine and obviously Russia, due to its weight even more, there were drag on our performance.\nBoth in 2022 and will be, as far to assume, will be a drag in 2023. As you know, our strong decisions to invest and essentially eliminate, for example, is the key technology advancements which we decided not to roll out in Russia has an impact. Right. So the numbers which we now just for the visibility to the investors of the business as it stands today were including Russia and Ukraine. But the bottom, both very much Russia, not contributing to the growth. So one could think opposite. You know, put in Russia and Ukraine our growth rates would be at the higher level on a comparable level capacity. We, I think, are guiding the market that we expect the better results in the second half of the year.\nThat partially reflects the moment when we think we will be beyond the bottleneck with regards to the capacity around ILUMA. So we're really managing the business on a very tight supply chain through Q3 this year. Sorry, 2022 and for H1 2023 and H2 2023 we should be. We should be okay, that's a gate. You know, I can bridge back to the famous air freight etc. Because all of these things are consequences of us running on a very narrow very tight supplies.\n\nChris O'Cull\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nThat makes sense. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Bonnie Herzog with Goldman Sachs.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nAll right, thanks. Hi,\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning, Bonnie.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nGood morning. My first question is on your Op margin guidance and the implied deleverage. Maybe you could break down the headwinds you highlighted just a bit further, and, you know, think about in the context of what you can control, like the investment you're making to drive future growth. Could you help frame that for us? You know, just trying to think through how big of a step up the investments will be this year versus last year. And then how do we think about the investments required next year and beyond? I guess, you know, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of the investments required to, you know, essentially roll out IQOS in the US will take place this year versus next year.\nI'm well aware of the investments you need to roll out ILUMA, but anything there would be helpful.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHappy to take that one, Bonnie. So, I think on the US, we've been clear on the fact that we expect something like above $150 million. Of course, it's a rounding of extra investment in the US as we prepare the launch of IQOS in the US. That is for 2023, when we have a plan for the coming years, and of course, with more detail, we'll of course come to you, elaborate, and detail that. Now, for the rest of the business, I think we are, and that was the sense of my comment on ZYN evolution. On a relatively regular basis, we are investing an extra few hundred million, and please allow me not to be more specific, because of course that is sensitive information behind the acceleration of IQOS. And it's going to come, of course, behind IQOS ILUMA in 2023.\nSo the growth, you know, when we say we expect ZYN to grow broadly in line with top line, there is a huge impact of inflation. I mean, I don't need to explain that inflation is in most countries around high single digit, and we need to reflect that on salary increase. We have efficiency on cost in front of that, and that is enabling us to, on top of the inflation impact, to keep investing on the growth of the business. And we do that in a rather consistent manner, of course. Very much focus behind ILUMA in 2023.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's helpful. And then just a second question if I may. It's just related to the user growth in Q4 on IQOS. Could you maybe talk through some of the puts and takes that you saw in the quarter? I mean it seemed to accelerate relative to Q3 despite some of the headwinds you had recently highlighted. And then you did mention that ILUMA drives higher conversion rates than IQOS 3 DUO. So could you possibly quantify that for us? I guess I'm trying to think through when that platform scales; do you expect your overall conversion to grow meaningfully, possibly above your current 70% rate?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah. So I may be taking ILUMA conversion rates in the markets at this stage versus a run-rate conversion rates before the IQOS blade, will be somewhere up in the range of 10 percentage points.\nOkay.\nSo, obviously, different markets. There is some difference between the markets. But the rule of thumb is about the 10% use points, which essentially means the way we measure conversion, that 10% of the devices sold through acquisition of new users are in the use and they should on the ad generating the recurring demand for the consumables. So this also has a better productivity on the user acquisitions and the devices sold.\nI want to just bridge back to your previous question, Bonnie, if you allow me. When we look at the US investment we highlighted, including the wellness health care, about $150 million. But we shouldn't just look at the investment from the lenses of IQOS because part of the investment which we already started, what we committed to make this year I believe will also benefit further growth opportunity for ZYN for Swedish Match. So it's not that we're really running this as a two separate type of businesses. We try to look at this from the leveraging and further enhancing capabilities of Swedish Match. And I believe that the opportunities for ZYN in the US look, they had a spectacular or phenomenal growth. Depends which adjective you like better. But I think there is more to come on this one.\nSo the way we're looking allocating the resources that it is not just going to prepare us for the IQOS stake back in 2024, but also in the meantime can be a further boost to the ZYN. Now to your question also about the future rollout of IQOS alone in the US. I think you know, September when we met, I hope during the investors they will be in a position to give a more precise plan. So we obviously take into considerations the expected timelines for vis-à-vis or from FDA. We said that we're going to file IQOS ILUMA which is our best flagship and the best propositions we have today. Obviously our prime objectives would be to enter US markets with the very big, you know, momentum coming from international and the best what we have.\nBut I think by September this year, we should have more details and more visibility about this.\n\nBonnie Herzog\n\nAnalyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nOkay, that's super helpful. I appreciate it.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Bonnie.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Gaurav Jain with Barclays.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good morning. A couple of questions. Hi, Emmanuel. So you know, the first is on the step up in cigarette pricing. So it was 5% last year.\nYou're saying it will be 6% in FY23.\nNow Japan had 5% pricing last year. This year it will be zero. So clearly ex Japan cigarette pricing is accelerating from four to seven approximately. So where exactly is this biggest step?\nWhat's happening in cigarette pricing?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nJapan. You'll be pretty good in a single out Japan in this case. Right. It's the biggest in a pricing front unknown. Right. It's difficult to make any assumptions in Japan. But we have already this year working pretty well with good results on reversing the pricing trend in Indonesia, as you may recall. I believe we really turned the corner in Indonesia, which always due to volume underlying size of that, and the weight of the business to us is very important. I think we have a stronger Philippines. Plus, the European markets also come with a strong pricing. So that 6% which we assume in the, you know, for this year is just the reflection of this. Now depends what's happened in Japan.\nI mean, all of these things will be coming, but actually, Japan, from the large geographies, is the only market where visibility, for obvious reasons, is very limited.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nSure.\nThank you.\nAnd then, on this EU heated tobacco flavor ban, which is expected to come later this year, how should we think?\nAbout it, and how is it factored in your guidance?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nI mean, it's one of the events which nobody ever experienced. We have some sort of a similarity with the flavor bans including menthol and the fuel cigarettes. You may recall the few years ago, and frankly speaking, that has not had any material sort of impact on the cigarette volume. So I think here. Okay, we'll see what's going to happen. We think it's going to be manageable.\n\nGaurav Jain\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nSure. Thank you so much.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Gaurav.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nHi, good morning.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi, Pam.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nGood morning.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nCan you discuss your strategy for the US market this year for Swedish Match and what your key priorities are, and then what are your plans for the international rollout of ZYN and the timeline?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah.\nObviously, you know, the focus is to continue and enhance the spectacular momentum of pouches ZYN growth in the US. I mentioned this before answering another question that, you know, part of the investments we are allocating to US, I believe also will benefit the current.\nBusiness of a Swedish Match.\nI think there should be a better pricing, especially on the cigar business, although it is not really our strategic focus, but still obviously helps the.\nOverall business performance and the strategy in terms of a long-term. The big question obviously is, you know, how we will approach IQOS commercialization the moment when we fully take it back.\nIn 2024, we, you know, we know what sort of capabilities are missing at the Swedish Match level, so we adding them. But the real big commercial spend, I mean, it will depend on the timing, the density, and the intensity of our rollout plans which, you know, we will share I guess around the September during the investor September this year around the Investors Day when it comes to the pouches.\nOn international.\nI think, you know, Swedish Match and us now together, you know, have, you know, plans how to start addressing some share pressure, especially in the Nordics. Okay. But on the bigger international scale, we have quite a few markets which we will start rolling out the pouches this year. But obvious reasons, I will not mention which markets, but there was the whole purpose of, you know, acquisition of Swedish Match, you recall, leverage the base and of growth opportunity in the US. It's, you know, a huge relief in a sense of a preparedness for IQOS. But also I believe the category has quite the potential.\nIn the RRP in the reduced-risk product space on international markets. We have infrastructure in most of the markets. It's not releasing or disclosing any, you know, strategic confidential matters. Obviously IQOS is present in 70+ markets. This is where the developed infrastructure is most developed. Very likely the markets for ZYN products will be within the list of these markets.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks. Then, can you just talk about your strategy with the ZYN product that you launched in test markets, what your early observations are, and then how are you thinking about a broader rollout over time?\n\nJacek Olczak",
    "content2": "CEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I mean, it was broader rollout of the ZYNs is more the more strategically planned for the 2024. So the next year we will have some volume, but you know, nothing compared to, to be very frank, to what we have about the IQOS and ILUMA products. This is by far the prime focus. But I think the early results which we get from the Philippines and the Colombia.\nThey're very strong, actually. They're very strong. Obviously, you know, our expectations after seven or so years of experience with IQOS products are much higher than we ever had. So bonds have to come in and meet that expectations as well. The proposition essentially we knew that the moment when we will be going more into the emerging markets, lower income, when they afford consumer affordability, you know, might be at a bottleneck in achieving our, you know, smoke-free ambitions. We had to also come up with a technology both on a consumables and on the device which somehow adjust the cost of the propositions to the potential pricing we can, we can offer to the market. So obviously the focus will be on the, on the emerging markets.\nBut I do believe that that proposition also nicely will help in some developed economies because, you know, across the spectrum of the small.\nObviously they are also a group of people who, for whom therefore the ability might create some constraints. So that will be a very nice complementary proposition in our portfolio. And essentially it also helps IQOS to continue on its, you know, extremely successful history of occupying this a premium or medium class space. This is this mega brand which we're trying to build while preparing ourselves that, you know, billion plus smokers in the world. I mean, are they going across the different various price segments from the premium, mid-low, super low, etc. And we need to provide the relevant propositions there. So I think ZYN is on the track and this is how we're going to play strategically in the portfolio.\n\nPamela Kaufman\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you. That's very helpful.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Pam.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Vivien Azer with Cowen.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you. Good morning.\nHey, I was hoping to talk about the IQOS outlook, please. In terms of the sticks and in particular, what impact is the removal of characterizing flavors on HTUs in the EU impacting your outlook? How are you accounting for that, and what's the expected timing of that, please? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, I partially answered that question before, Vivien, but you know, the characterizing flavor, you know, we had had an experience with cigarettes, fuel cigarettes in the past and it's the only, you know, reference point we might have today. And you know, as you recall, you know, the menthol and others ban in Europe didn't really impact in any material way the volumes of the cigarette. So I think here, you know, one can expect a similar sort of a manageable impact, if you like, of that. But the second thing, it's worth also reminding everyone that IQOS, by far today, is the best tobacco flavor proposition. Yes, there are some flavors which we have in our portfolio in the market that proportions might be different, but by far IQOS on the pure tobacco flavor.\nThis is, by the way, where the bulk of the cigarette market rests in essentially all geographies. I mean, this is an IQOS trend. So, there is a portion of a portfolio which will be impacted. But I think for the vast majority of the smokers.\nExisting, compared to IQOS users and the smokers which are still on a fuel, I mean IQOS still offers today best in class taste and a flavor experience which is in the core of the tobacco flavor.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Cowen\n\nThank you for that and I apologize if I missed this, but is there any way that you can provide an update on kind of the infrastructure buildout for IQOS in the US ahead of your reacquiring the commercial rights to that proposition both in terms of the consumables as well as the devices? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I think there is, you know, we're also looking at this not only on IQOS on a standalone basis, but IQOS, the ZYN, and other parts of the Swedish Match business. I believe, you know, the obvious, the questions of the optimal distribution, and I believe this can occur very well. Any enhancements or the distribution.\nServes not only in a future IQOS but, you know, can and will serve actually in growth opportunities today. There is the whole digital aspect. There is a, you know, a better management of the.\nPricing, promotions, the whole consumer piece. Right. Which is so strong behind the IQOS's success. I mean, that's the something which we are preparing the infrastructure for.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Cowen\n\nOkay, thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Owen Bennett with Jefferies.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nAfternoon, Jacek.\nHope all well.\nYeah.\nMy question is more a bigger picture longer term one around the US and the overall RRP space. Now you've got control of your own destiny. I was hoping to get your thoughts on how you see RRP overall develop longer term across the different categories, whether you see some more attractive than others. And do you still think heated can be sizable when reintroduced into the US? Obviously bearing in mind the limited traction it got with Altria, and then just linked to these US RRP plans. Any update on timing for a PMTA submission with your vape product? Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYes, I start with the last one. We plan to submit IQOS ILUMA to PMTA to FDA in the second half of this year.\nNow, with regards to the potential, we think that the nice IQOS strength, which is really, if you go to the core of the smokers today when they really, you know, enjoy this pure, unaffected by any flavors, etc., tobacco flavor and so on, is undisputed. Every market you go, IQOS exactly delivers on the flavor taste expectations to this audience. And that's also, I believe, a critical factor in IQOS high conversion rate. I know how many people fully adopt IQOS, and not only that, they're leaving cigarettes fully behind them. They don't even attempt, on an occasional basis, to go back to cigarettes. Okay. That's the core, and I believe for the audience, which was the smoking audience which we have in the US, IQOS perfectly fits into this whole thing.\nObviously, the other platforms which offer you the different ritual, different experiences, the e-cigarettes and the pouches, e-cigarettes usually.\nMore driven by the flavors, obviously, absent the pure tobacco natural type of a flavor. That's the challenge, which partially, in our opinion, is behind.\nMore of the dual consumption than the full conversion, but also the products are.\nUnder development, that they're getting better and pouches actually on the risk continuum of the product. I mean, now it's important offering for the consumers who really want to reduce significantly exposure and potentially harm while enjoying the product. So, I think there is this complementary, there is this complementary role of each of these platforms. You know, also that we're working on our platform forward which is and the VEEV products. The electronic cigarette segment going through the own dynamics is this mix of the flavors, disposable, et cetera, is not necessarily great for the economics, but partially also because of this lower conversion rate compared to the other platforms. So, we have said it from the very beginning of our transformation transformations if you follow us.\nor eight years ago, I recall at one of the first investor conferences when we announced, you know, the purpose that we want to go smoke-free. We have said that there is room for every platform at different moments for different consumers, and our job is at the right time to deploy these platforms and the leverage, the opportunities, and the benefit to the smoker.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Fantastic. Just, sorry, to follow up, the question on the PMTA was not for ILUMA. I think previously for VEEV you'd said you targeted H1 2023. Just any update on VEEV PMTA submission?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I think we're also thinking about 2023, but now having also the ZYN and knowing what ILUMA can do and knowing that the P4 will also need to, you know, make sure that we have the right PMTA submission strategy.\nRight.\nBecause an effort behind each of we need to prioritize. But I mean, we are thinking. Well, sorry, thinking it's more than a thinking. We're working on bringing our people to the US as well.\n\nOwen Bennett\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat.Thanks guys.Appreciate it.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Owen.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our next question from Andrei Condrea with UBS.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nHi everyone.\nThank you for taking my question.\nJust one from me.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nHi Andrew.\n\nVivien Azer\n\nManaging Director and Analyst, Cowen\n\nSticking to US IQOS, we know that the US menthol ban from the FDA-proposed standards allows potentially will allow for some exemptions to it, and thinking that your IQOS has the MRTP designation, which is rather unique versus all its peers.\nWere you factoring this in when you set out your ambition of, I believe, 10% market share by 2030, if I'm not mistaken?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I think you're quoting my words. This is Jacek here. Yeah, I still do believe that IQOS by 2030, you know, knowing how it performs on the many other international markets. The 10% is not out of, you know, it can be a realistic ambitious ambition or realistic dream. Now to be very frank, when we look into this, we have not been trying to.\nFactor in that there might be some flavor, some menthol bans on our products. But you're right, you know, to notice that IQOS today, today is two variants of IQOS authorized with that, with the menthol, the menthol flavor. Will this be an accelerating flavor factor or not? Look, I mean, the future will tell, but I still believe that IQOS does in the current environment due to its strength and the satisfactions it gives to smokers, etc. That has, you know, big potential in front of us.\n\nAndrei Condrea\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nI see. Very clear. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you, Andrew.\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll take our last question from Jared Dingas with J.P. Morgan.\n\nJared Dingas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nYeah, thanks.\nHi guys.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Hi.\n\nJared Dingas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nA couple for me please.\nFirst, given the CapEx step-up in CapEx that you expect for this year, I just wanted to ask how we should be thinking about CapEx levels beyond 2023? Is next year kind of a one-off given the planned international expansion plans?\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nLook, I think you should expect us, of course, to accompany the growth. We are growing volume within more capacity.\nThe CapEx will reflect that.\nThere is certainly, when it comes to ILUMA, a moment where we build the capacity for ILUMA and that is translating into a significant.\nInvestment. So you see that in the 1.3, I would say we are going to certainly regularly invest on the capacity for the Swedish Match overall business.\nI'm not able yet at that stage.\nI'm not giving guidance on 2024. I certainly believe that there is this transition moment where we are building the capacity on ILUMA. Then of course that will be accompanying the growth of ILUMA, and we are very ambitious, as you know, on growing overall product, so that will come with investment.\nBut of course they are not of.\nThe same magnitude as the one that we've been making in order to build the capacity on IQOS. Smaller volumes, smaller base. So not with the same impact on the long term anyway.\n\nJared Dingas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGot it, that's clear. And for the second one, maybe just on the Healthcare and Wellness segment, 2023 will be another investment year. I know you guys have talked about that probably being a multi year investment cycle, but I don't know if you can give any indication on when you think that business could potentially start to contribute to growth. And maybe also, could you guys talk about your learnings so far in those businesses that you have acquired?\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nYeah, I mean, look, they've obviously been very clear about this from the very beginning. I mean, in order to develop and of bring to the market a couple of the programs or products which we have in mind. I mean, I have to go for the investments we talk about. Asprey Health also have a very promising investment.\nIn a medical or.\nIn a medical space of cannabinoids, etc. So all of these programs, they are great established milestones in terms of the, you know, the development of these products including the, you know, the series of clinicals and you know, meeting the different regulatory expectations. So that's about what's going to be. We have set historically ambitious target of achieving this a $1 billion revenue by 2025.\nThere is a pipeline of the product, but you know the more interesting actually is you know what's going to happen with that business beyond 25 because it's a longer term, longer term investment. Obviously when we allocate the capital we look first, you know we allocate the capital behind those things which are in the near and the midterm for us, and there's obviously heat-not-burns and IQOS ILUMA expansions to the US, and I can go on for the long list of opportunities, but keeping also in mind that these businesses have acquired their wellness and health care offers us very interesting opportunities in the longer run when we very well leverage both our scientific life science expertise capabilities combined with the commercial etc. So this is how I would look on this thing.\nI think when we meet on the 10th in September of this year for the Investors Day, we will start, you know, obviously opening a much more longer-term horizon, how the management, how we see the future of PMI not just in the next year or two, but with a longer time of a perspective, and this is the moment when, I guess, we will share more details, by the way. Also, I think we'll be able to answer more precisely first questions to Emmanuel about the CapEx, because obviously if we open a 10-year horizon for Philip Morris, we'll have to touch upon that capital allocation component as well.\n\nJared Dingas\n\nAnalyst, JPMorgan\n\nGreat, that's helpful. Thank you.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nIt appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nSVP of Investor Relations, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you. Before closing our call, I would like to remind you that we'll be presenting at the CAGNY conference on 22 February and, as we mentioned earlier, we plan to host the September Investor Day in Switzerland. We hope you will be able to join these events either in person or virtually. That concludes our call today. Thank you again for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the investor relations team. Thank you.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO, Philip Morris International\n\nTalk to you soon.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThat concludes today's teleconference.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. James Bushnell, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead.\n\nJames Bushnell\n\nDirector of IR, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nWelcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 third quarter results. You may access the release on pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional smoke-free volume and net revenue data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.\nUnless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflects currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI's operations in Russia and Ukraine.\nAs mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022 and on a comparative basis, PMI excludes amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results. Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nI'm joined today by Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Jacek will join us for the question-and-answer session. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, James, and welcome, everyone. Today marks a historic day in our journey towards a smoke-free future with the certainty that we will have full control of IQOS, the world-leading smoke-free product in the United States, the world's largest smoke-free market, from April 30, 2024. Indeed, today's agreement with Altria removed the potential of a protracted legal process to regain the U.S. right to IQOS, which Altria previously held, subject to performance milestone until 2029.\nWe have ambitious plans for the full scale launch and rapid expansion of IQOS in the U.S. market, as soon as we take over an efficient time during the transition period to put our commercial model and related organization and infrastructure in place using our wealth of experience from international markets.\nWe see IQOS as the primary vector for establishing a leadership position in the U.S. smoke-free industry, and it will be followed by the other product in our smoke-free portfolio. In this context, Swedish Match offers an immediate position in the oral segment and mutually beneficial synergy at sales force level.\nHowever, should we sale, we can certainly build a robust sales force as part of our commercial deployment engine during the transition period. Under both scenarios, we see an accelerated path to profitability with an attractive payback period on our IQOS investment given super U.S. unit economic and the absence of a legacy cigarette business. I will cover this in more detail later.\nWith regard to Swedish Match, we announced this morning an update to our offer with our best and final price of SEK 116. Our updated offer retained 90% acceptance condition, which is critical to allow us to capture the full potential of the combination. Now that we are close to the end of the offer period, the increased offer is primarily intended to fairly reflect the higher net value to us of the portion of Swedish Match cash flow, which are in U.S. dollars, given currency movements since our initial offer was announced in May.\nEquity markets, the global economy and interest rates have also moved unfavorably since then. As such, we believe the updated price with a premium of 52.5% to the undisturbed share price prior to the initial offer strengthen the attractiveness yet further for Swedish Match shareholders while maintaining strong value creation for PMI shareholders.\nThis is our best and final price and we hope to complete the transaction next month to achieve full ownership. Turning now to our Q3 earnings. We delivered another very strong performance this quarter with HTU volumes ahead of our forecast and robust growth in total volumes, market share and combustible net revenues.\nWith adjusted operating income margin in line with expectation. This resulted in total Q3 adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53, close to our all-time high quarterly high despite notable currency headwinds. IQOS's excellent performance continued with plus 22% growth in pro forma HTU shipment volume, a testament to the continued strengthening of our heat-not-burn portfolio and broad-based growth across key regions.\nIQOS ILUMA continued to drive growth in its launch market. In combustibles, we delivered robust performance with Q3 organic pro forma net revenue growth exceeding plus 4%, driven by accelerated pricing of almost plus 5%.\nCigarette shipment volume was essentially stable and category share grew supported by Marlboro, showcasing the resilience of the brand despite current economic conditions.\nTurning now to the headline numbers. Our Q3 volumes grew by plus 2.3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 0.6% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.9% and by plus 6.7% for total PMI. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 4.5% on a pro forma basis and by plus 6.1% in total, despite lower device revenues. This reflects the increasing weight of IQOS in our sales mix and a step-up in combustible pricing.\nOur Q3 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 100 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 90 basis points in total consistent with our expectations. As previously communicated, this reflect the recovery in device volume, the investment in launching ILUMA, including initially higher unit cost, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine and increasing global inflationary pressures.\nDespite these headwinds, our strong top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enabled us to outperform our currency-neutral guidance to deliver adjusted diluted pro forma EPS of $1.33, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing plus 8.3% currency-neutral growth, including Russia and Ukraine, we delivered adjusted diluted EPS of $1.53.\nOur strong third quarter, combined with a robust H1 supported an excellent delivery for the year-to-date. I would highlight our strong pro forma volume growth of plus 3.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 7.7%, again, reflecting continued strong IQOS performance, pricing and the recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic-affected comparison.\nSmoke-free net revenue made up around 30% of our year-to-date pro forma total putting us on track to reach our ambition of over 50% by 2025. Our year-to-date operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis. driven by the factors mentioned previously.\nWe remain on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion over 2021, 2023. $1.5 billion of gross savings have already been delivered, including over $200 million in Q3. This allows us to reinvest in the business and mitigate increasing inflationary pressures. Year-to-date, currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 9.7% to $4.11 on a pro forma basis and by plus 8.8% in total to $4.59, an excellent performance.\nNow let's turn to the pro forma full year outlook. Given the continued growth of IQOS and robust trends in combustible, we are revising our top line forecast upwards to plus 2% to plus 3% growth in total shipment volume and plus 6.5% to plus 8% growth in organic net revenues. While our top line outlook remains very strong, like many other global companies, we are facing significant inflationary forces in the world economy, and this is reflected in our updated adjusted OI margin forecast.\nInflation in our cost of goods remain mid-single digits in the third quarter. However, inflationary pressures are growing as we renew pricing arrangements, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy and transportation costs.\nIn addition, the very strong growth of ILUMA in Japan and other launch markets has an initial negative margin impact, given the higher weight of the consumable and increased cost of both the device and consumable in the first 12 to 18 months of activation. As mentioned previously, the combination of strong demand, global supply chain disruption and the impact of canceling induction HTU production in Russia means our supply chain is not fully optimized.\nThis has resulted in reduced productivity and a number of additional costs, including an approximate $300 million impact from a significant increase in the use of airfreight. As a result, while we continue to expect a rebound in our Q4 adjusted OI margin, partly reflecting higher commercial investment in the prior year. We are now forecasting less expansion than previously expected, with pro forma adjusted organic operating income margin flat to slightly negative for full year.\nDespite this change to margin expectations, our top line momentum is strong, and we continue to forecast pro forma adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 10% to plus 12% for 2022. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS forecast of $5.22 to $5.33, including an estimated and favorable currency impact of [$0.87] at prevailing rates, notably due to the euro and Japanese yen.\nThere is a slide in the appendix with further detail on the estimated exchange rate impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of almost $6, including an estimated $0.80 unfavorable currency impact.\nLastly, given the continued success of ILUMA and the cancellation of (inaudible) production in Russia, I just referenced. We are working to further accelerate our production of induction consumable. As we convert and transition capacity from blade to induction, we incur certain inefficiencies and limits on the availability of ILUMA HTUs.\nWe are optimizing our inventory level where possible to minimize any impact on consumer availability. However, these factors are a constraint on our shipment and we are updating our HTU shipment volume forecast to 89 billion to 91 billion units for the year. Importantly, this is a short-term supply dynamic.\nConsumer offtake trends remain strong, and HTU in-market sales volume are expected to further accelerate their growth to over plus 25% in Q4 while also growing sequentially compared to Q3. The cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional, as shown through the challenges of recent years. Our balance sheet and cash flow remained strong. We delivered operating cash flow of $7.7 billion year-to-date, representing growth of plus 6.5% on a currency neutral basis.\nToday, we reconfirm our forecast of around $10.5 billion in operating cash flow for the full year despite an estimated currency headwind of around $1.3 billion. This means we expect to deliver an excellent $22.5 billion over 2021 and 2022. Cash flow was flatted somewhat in 2021 by $0.5 billion from one-off impact and the timing factors of certain cash flow, which benefited 2021 at the expense of 2022 and by a further $0.5 billion of working capital improvement.\nHowever, our 2022 forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year. I would also like to highlight that U.S. dollar strength has a positive impact on our net debt, given that more than 60% of our financing is in euro, including derivative overlays.\nThis serves to offset the impact on our earnings and combined with strong cash generation, contributed to a $1.5 billion reduction in our net debt since December 2021, which is now below 1.6x adjusted EBITDA on a 12-month rolling basis. This delivery highlights our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt and invest in the growth of our business.\nIn addition, we recently increased our annualized dividend for the 15th consecutive year in line with our long-term commitment to return cash to shareholders. Turning back to our results. Our total pro forma shipment volume increased by plus 2.3% for Q3 and plus 3.4% year-to-date, putting us comfortably on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis.\nPro forma HTU shipment volumes grew by plus 21.9% for the third quarter and plus 15.8% year-to-date. While our shipments have been more volatile this year, reflecting the current supply chain dynamic, HTU IMS growth has been consistently strong with plus 18.2% growth in Q3 and plus 19.2% year-to-date with robust performance in the EU region, Japan and low and middle income market.\nAs I mentioned, we expect a further acceleration of IMS growth in Q4. Focusing now on combustibles. Our portfolio delivered robust pro forma organic net revenue growth of plus 4.1% in Q3 and essentially stable pro forma shipment volume. Our pro forma pricing accelerated to plus 4.9% in Q3 as we progressively adjust to the inflationary environment. This reflects notable contribution from Australia, Germany and the Philippines and a positive quarterly variance from Indonesia for the first time since Q4 ['29].\nWe now expect full year pricing to be around 4%. Our pro forma share of the cigarette category increased by plus 0.2 points year-to-date. This was supported by Marlboro where volumes grew by almost plus 4% for total PMI. With the premium position in a challenging consumer environment, this represents an impressive performance from the world's leading cigarette brand. Our leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.\nThe positive combination of stable share in combustible and the continued growth of IQOS positioned us to deliver total market share growth over time. We captured plus 0.5 points of pro forma share gains in Q3 and plus 0.6 points year-to-date with notable contribution from Italy, Indonesia, Japan and Poland. Despite increasing competition in many markets, our leading share of the growing heat-not-burn category has remained stable since the start of the year at around 75% and grew sequentially in the third quarter.\nThis remarkable achievement is supported by the increasing deployment of a 2-tier HTU portfolio, providing adult smokers with an expanding range of innovative and high-quality alternatives to cigarettes. PMI HTUs again strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brands in markets where IQOS is present with a sequential share gain in Q3 of plus 0.2 points to a record 7.7% share excluding Russia and Ukraine.\nFocusing now on IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 19.5 million IQOS users as of September 30, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects growth of around plus 0.5 million users in Q3 and plus 2.7 million year-to-date.\nAs shown on the right-hand side of the slide, the third quarter of each year typically experiences slower pro forma user growth due to seasonal factors. The growth of plus 0.5 million this quarter was very robust in the historical context, noting that the high growth in Q3 2020 benefited from a catch-up effect following the relaxation of COVID restriction on retail location and mobility.\nImportantly, we expect a strong acceleration in user growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. In the EU region, smoke-free net revenue comprised almost 40% of regional net revenue year-to-date with a number of markets well above 50%. This performance clearly shows the way towards our ambition to be predominantly smoke-free by 2025.\nOur EU third quarter HTU share increased by plus 2 points compared to Q3 last year to reach 7.3% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. I would also highlight the plus 0.2 point sequential increase, which is a notably strong performance given the usual seasonality of the convertible market. Most importantly, adjusted IMS volume continued to grow sequentially and reached a record high of 8.7 billion unit on the 4-quarter moving average.\nWe expect IMS volume growth to continue in Q4 with a corresponding increase in market share. Please refer to the appendix for additional key city and market share data. With regard to regulation in the EU, we are encouraged by the increasing number of countries adopting multiyear fiscal framework with clear differentiation of smoke-free product such as the recent legislation in Romania. We expect the proposal on the EU Tobacco Excise directive to be published by year-end and hope for a similar approach.\nAs a reminder, the Tobacco Excise directive will require unanimous support for approval by all 27 EU member states. Now let's focus on the performance of ILUMA in the EU region. ILUMA continue to drive user acquisition, switching of existing users and accelerated category growth in both Spain and Switzerland.\nIn Q3, both markets experienced another quarter of strong sequential IMS volume growth with offtake exit volume of Altria, now the clear majority of HTU sales in both markets. We also launched ILUMA in Greece at the end of June with promising initial results, and introduced the product to Portugal earlier this month.\nIn Japan, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus 2.8 points versus the prior year quarter to 23.6%. As in the EU, Q3 last year saw an optical sequential share decline due to combustible seasonality, making the plus 0.7 point sequential increase this quarter, a notable achievement. IMS again, grew sequentially to reach a record high of 8.3 billion unit on the 4-quarter moving average. This was driven by the impressive performance of IQOS ILUMA and the continued growth in key cities such as Tokyo.\nThe heat-not-burn category now represents over 1/3 of total tobacco in Japan, with IQOS increasingly driving the year's growth. IQOS ILUMA celebrated its first anniversary of the Japan National launch in September and continues to exhibit strong growth due to excellent conversion, consumer satisfaction and retention rates.\nOur premium price area HTUs continued to grow strongly in Q3 and strengthen their position as both the second largest nicotine brand and largest RRP brand in Japan, reaching an exit of tech share of 14.9%. Encouragingly, since HTUs have also grown rapidly since the initial launch in April and national expansion in mid-July, driving consumer acquisition in the mainstream price segment.\nWe exited Q3 with a 25% HTU offtake share, a record high and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan over the coming quarters. In addition to strong IQOS gain in developed countries, we continue to see very promising growth in low and middle income market, which drove around 30% of the company's pro forma HTU growth in Q3. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress.\nStrong growth in IMS volume continued and the pro forma share of our HTU brand group plus 0.9 points versus the prior year quarter to 2.8% in Q3, a robust performance considering the impact of seasonality. This reflects success across many markets with notable progress in Lebanon where Q3 of texture in Beirut increased by plus 7 points to 18% and Egypt where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 6%. Further [TCT] data can be found in the appendix. We are also encouraged by recent positive regulatory development in the Philippine where the government passed a new law clearly differentiating combustible and noncombustible tobacco product.\nSmoke-free products will be regulated separately with different health warnings, permitted product testing or guided trials and rules to be established for product communication and point-of-sale activity that will support the switching of adult smoker to better alternatives. In addition, the latest development from our smoke-free innovation pipeline is a new heat-not-burn device that is especially relevant for low and middle-income market. It is a simple convenient and affordable proposition, which can cater to local test preferences without compromising on the reduced risk profile of the product.\nWe are planning a pilot city launches in Colombia and the Philippines during the fourth quarter as we further extend our portfolio of smoke-free products to serve different consumer needs. As we continue to innovate, it's critical to integrate sustainability through ecodesign principles, circularity and efforts to minimize and manage post-consumer waste. Addressing the environmental impact of our product is a key pillar of our sustainability strategy, which is reflected in our Sustainability Index and form part of our executive compensation scheme.\nOur approach to reduce waste related to cigarette, RRP consumable, device and packaging is covered in the report, case studies and campaign published last month and available via a dedicated microsite on pmi.com. For example, we are progressing well towards our 2025 aspiration of having at least 80% of our shipment volumes covered by markets with anti-littering program in place for cigarette and for over 1 million cumulative smoke-free device to be refreshed or repaired.\nMoreover, during September, more than 10,000 stakeholders from more than 60 markets join cleanup initiatives around the world. I am proud of our ESG performance which continued to be recognized worldwide. Our 2021 low carbon transition plan and our business transformation strategy were recently nominated for sustainability prices. And our Chief Sustainability Officer, Jennifer Motles was nominated for CSO of the Year at the World Sustainability Award.\nMoving now to perhaps most impactful news of today. We are delighted to announce that we will soon have full control of IQOS, the world's leading smoke-free product in the United States the world's largest smoke-free market. As previously communicated, following the ITC decision last year prohibiting the import of IQOS into U.S., we have been in discussion with Altria to find the best path forward.\nPMI's priority has always been to find a solution that best position IQOS to realize its full potential in the U.S. as quickly as possible. I am excited to report that we have now reach an outcome that achieved this goal. Let me start by briefly summarizing the key terms of the agreement. From April 30, 2024, PMI will have full control over the commercialization of IQOS in the U.S., allowing us to distribute and sell the product and critically engage directly with adult tobacco users.\nAs part of the agreement, we will pay a total cash consideration of around $2.7 billion to Altria. We believe this agreement represents excellent value to our shareholders. As with the previous agreement potentially stretching to 2029, this solution provides certainty by avoiding what could have been the protract and uncertain legal process that would have severally held back the development of IQOS. It provides a clear near-term path to commercializing at scale in the U.S. with the unencumbered backing of PMI full strategic and financial commitment to the product success.\nIQOS is the world's leading smoke-free product with remarkable and rapid growth achieved across a wide range of international markets. From a standing start in 2015, IQOS is already $9 billion annual net revenue business having created the attractive heat-not-burn category and driving its growth.\nThe U.S. is the world's biggest accessible nicotine market by retail value. The estimated retail value of its growing smoke market is already around 60% of all international markets combined, excluding China. We have spoken before about our plan to bring a leading portfolio to the U.S., and we expect IQOS to be at the very core of our U.S. smoke-free future just as it already is elsewhere. The U.S. opportunity for IQOS is particularly encouraging given the clear demand from American adults smoker for credible smoke-free alternative to cigarettes.\nMoreover, current smoke-free products have had limited success in fully switching adult smoker away from cigarette. In the U.S., there are ample opportunity to build adult smoker awareness and understanding of smoke-free product offers something that is particularly true for IQOS given our MRTP authorization.\nWe are ready to invest behind IQOS to bring it to market at scale across the U.S., starting with full-scale launches in key cities and regions with a plan to progress rapidly to national penetration. IQOS remains the only inhalable smoke-free nicotine product to have received a modified risk tobacco product authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. We know from our experience in over 65 markets worldwide, but IQOS appeal to adult smokers who have tried the product is strong, as demonstrated by high full switching rate.\nWe have a strong commitment to build awareness and invest behind the category to drive product trial among American smoker. The true potential for IQOS in the U.S. is substantial, as illustrated by the double-digit national shares achieved in just a few years across a number of Asian, European and other markets, all with varying demographic profiles and adult smoker test preferences. We believe the volume share of 10% of cigarettes and HTUs by 2030 is very achievable with potential to go much further. Importantly, the return on investment for IQOS in the highly profitable U.S. tobacco market is company.\nWe estimate the total U.S. industry profit pool at over $20 billion. And with average unit margin on U.S. cigarettes more than 3x greater than for the PMI average, the payback over the next few years on the consideration paid to Altria looks very attractive. As we do not have a legacy cigarette business in the U.S., the opportunity is purely incremental. This also reflects a current excise tax system with no differentiation for heated tobacco product versus cigarette at the federal level and differential on a limited basis in only a handful of state thus presenting a clear additional opportunity over time.\nWe are already advanced in our plan for IQOS in the U.S. as we prepare for domestic manufacturing and for important regulatory submissions, including for IQOS ILUMA, where we plan to file a PMTA in H2 2023. As mentioned previously, we target the first half of next year for the resumption of IQOS domestic supply, which will be available to Altria under our current arrangement up until PMI assumes full commercial reasonability in April 2024. Our proposed combination with Swedish Match would provide certain U.S. sales and distribution capability.\nHowever, in the case of failure, we have a clear path forward for IQOS and the rest of our smoke-free portfolio. Indeed, the most critical part of the IQOS commerce model centered on converting adult smokers rather than distribution. In addition, the U.S. has an established distribution and retail landscape with a clear route to market. We, therefore, also have concrete plan to proceed autonomously in building fully controlled and managed U.S. sales and distribution capabilities over the next 18 months leading up to April 2024 in order to ensure a successful IQOS rollout and the introduction of older smoke-free products should our Swedish Match offer fail.\nIndeed, we believe today's agreement is fundamental to unlock the U.S. smoke-free market. As we have shared previously, we expect the heated tobacco category to remain the largest and fastest growing in dollar terms internationally. While the e-vapor and to a lesser extent, nicotine pouch category has paved the way for smoke-free products in the U.S. We know that heated tobacco comes closer to replicating the experience that smokers enjoy with higher conversion and very low unintended use.\nConclude today's presentation, our business delivered strong third quarter and year-to-date performance despite some challenging headwinds and we expect to deliver another excellent year of double-digit adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma currency-neutral basis. Most impressive was a continued excellent IQOS performance with strong shipment volume IMS growth, reflecting broad-based momentum in the region, Japan and emerging markets. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA, our rich pipeline of smoke-free innovation and plans for further launches of both ILUMA and (inaudible) In the fourth quarter and in 2023.\nWe continue to accelerate investments in our commercial program, digital engine and R&D for long-term growth as well as behind a number of growth opportunities across category and geography. The return from such investments remain compelling as demonstrated by the exceptional top and bottom line growth delivered over recent years. In addition to growth in smoke-free products, our combustible business continued to perform well with organic net revenue growth and essentially stable pro forma shipment volume. Despite accelerated pricing in the current inflationary environment, temporary margin pressure from inflation and supply chain inefficiency is likely to continue in the coming quarters.\nImportantly, our underlying growth fundamentals remain strong, and we look forward with confidence. We have secured our near-term access to the substantial U.S. opportunity for IQOS, also forming the backbone for introducing our broader smoke-free portfolio. We are now advancing on our plan to launch at scale with or without Swedish Match.\nAnd finally, we have increased the dividend every year as a public company to the ups and downs of economic and currency cycles. We continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders as we advance towards our ambition to become predominantly smoke-free by 2025.\nThank you. And before we start the question-and-answer session, please note that we are not able to comment on our offer for Swedish Match beyond what has been announced. All materials related to the offer can be found on the website smokefreeoffer.com. And Jacek Olczak and I, we are now more than happy to answer your questions.",

A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.\nUnless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions and disposals. Consistent with last quarter, figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI's operations in Russia and Ukraine. As mentioned previously, starting in the second quarter of 2022, and on a comparative basis, PMI will exclude amortization and impairment of acquired intangibles from its adjusted results.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to introduce Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Emmanuel.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, James. Welcome to you in your new role, and welcome, everyone. Before I begin, I want to reiterate our focus on supporting our employees and their families affected by the war in Ukraine and above all on the safety of our people. We continue to deploy pledge humanitarian support and additional benefits for our Ukraine employees. As previously announced, we intend to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner, as the complexities of continuing to operate in Russia increase such as supply chain challenges and financial and banking sector restriction.\nWe continue to actively work on options for doing so in the context of an increasingly complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment, including the requirement to obtain certain governmental approval for any transaction.\nTurning to our business. We demonstrated strong underlying momentum in the second quarter of 2022 with another quarter of positive volume supporting better-than-expected top and bottom line growth. Most impressive was the continued excellent IQOS performance and strong Q2 pro forma user growth of more than 1.1 million, demonstrating further sequential acceleration compared to Q1 as device limitation and COVID restrictions continue to ease. This reflects strong momentum in the EU region, Japan and developing market. Q2 RP pro forma net revenues grew by plus 11% despite the adverse shipment timing impact due to supply chain constraints highlighted last quarter, while HTU IMS volumes grew by plus 20%.\nIQOS ILUMA delivered further impressive results in its first 3 markets of Japan, Switzerland and Spain. The acceleration in category growth in these diverse geographies highlight the exciting future growth opportunity across the world, including in the latest launch market of Greece. In combustible, robust Q2 pro forma volume growth of plus 2.4% and organic net revenue growth of plus 4.2% were driven by Marlboro share gains, stronger pricing and the continued recovery of the markets.\nMaintaining leadership of the cigarette category allows us to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives and accelerate our transformation into a predominantly smoke-free business by 2025. We expect the strong underlying momentum of our business in H1 to continue, and we are from an organic growth outlook for the year. We are now well on track to deliver 2 consecutive years of volume growth, confirming our status as a growth company in terms of volumes, organic net revenues and margins.\nDespite a substantial currency headwind in 2022, we expect to deliver full year adjusted diluted EPS of around $6, including Russia and Ukraine. The proposed addition of Swedish Match would further boost our future financial profile. This is a value-creating offer for both set of shareholders with a compelling strategic and cultural fit, providing an additional opportunity to accelerate our smoke-free future.\nTurning to the headline numbers. Our Q2 volumes grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 1.1% in total, including Russia and Ukraine. Pro forma net revenues grew organically by plus 6.2% and by plus 5.3% for total PMI, reflecting both the continued strong growth of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against a pandemic affected comparison. As we anticipated and indicated previously, less unfavorable timing of cigarette shipment also played a role, notably due to replenishment of duty-free inventories. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew by plus 3% on a pro forma basis and by plus 4.1% in total despite the expected delay of HTU shipments to Japan as we manage through global supply chain disruption.\nThis incorporates combustible pricing of plus 3.5% on a pro forma basis or almost plus 5% excluding Indonesia. Our Q2 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 190 basis points on a pro forma basis and by 150 basis points in total. As expected and communicated in our Q1 quarterly results, this reflects 4 main factors: first, investment to further expand and match the speed of growth in our smoke-free portfolio. This includes the initial higher cost of ILUMA devices and HTUs and the transitory dilutive margin impact of higher device sales as we roll out ILUMA and replenish distribution channel as device constraint ease to support reaccelerating IQOS user growth.\nSecond, the impact of supply chain disruption, notably due to the war in Ukraine, including around $80 million in additional air freight expenses. Third, inflation of around 4% in our cost of goods driven by the global pandemic recovery and exacerbated by the war, notably for certain direct materials, wages, energy and transportation costs. And last, a challenging prior year margin comparison, which included substantial cost of goods sold productivity savings.\nDespite these typical margin challenges, our robust top line growth and ongoing cost efficiency enable us to deliver plus 5.6% growth in pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS ahead of expectation to $1.32 and plus 3.8% growth for total PMI to $1.48, including Russia and Ukraine. Looking at the first half of the year now, our volumes grew by plus 4% on a pro forma basis and by plus 2.2% for total PMI. Pro forma revenues grew by plus 8.1% and by plus 7.1% in total, also driven by strong IQOS performance and the recovery of the cigarette category.\nWe delivered organic net revenue per unit growth of plus 4% on a pro forma basis and plus 4.7% in total, again, reflecting the positive impact of growing HT volumes and pricing. Our H1 adjusted operating income margin contracted organically by 110 basis points on a pro forma basis and 90 basis points in total, driven by the factors mentioned previously. We expect better margin performance in H2, a topic I will review it shortly.\nCurrency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS grew by plus 10.4% to $2.79 on a pro forma basis and plus 9.2% in total to $3.06, an excellent performance given the circumstances.\nReflecting this strong momentum, we have our guidance for 2022. With strong IQOS growth and robust trends in combustible, we foresee an acceleration in our currency-neutral growth expectation relative to our previous forecast. First, we now expect to grow our total pro forma shipment volume by plus 1.5% to plus 2.5% for 2022, achieving another year of volume growth. For pro forma net revenue, we expect to deliver between plus 6% and plus 8% organic growth as compared to the plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% announced previously, despite a greater-than-anticipated drag from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey.\nWith a strong recovery in device volume, the increasing contribution of ILUMA with initially higher unit cost and ongoing global inflation, we are narrowing our forecast for pro forma adjusted organic OI margin expansion to between 0 and plus 50 basis points.\nWe are also raising our growth outlook for pro forma currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to between plus 10% and plus 12%. This reflects a range of $5.23 to $5.34, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of $0.80 at prevailing rates notably due to the euro and Japanese yen. We'll include a slide in the appendix with further detail on this estimated impact. For total PMI, which assumes a full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $5.90 to $6.05, reflecting similar dynamic to the pro forma basis and including an estimated $0.69 unfavorable currency impact.\nPlease note our 2022 forecast assumes no contribution from the proposed combination with Swedish Match which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholder acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals. The outlook for IQOS growth is excellent, and we now expect to deliver full year pro forma HTU shipment volume of 90 billion to 92 billion units, representing the upper half of our previous forecast range.\nWith growth momentum very strong, the main constraint for not further raising our HTU volume target is our production capacity, notably for ILUMA HTUs due to their outstanding initial success and the cancellation of production in Russia as we convert existing production line for induction consumable. We continue to expect excellent HTU growth in the coming quarters with a progressive improvement in ILUMA HTU capacity through the first half of 2023. We are prioritizing ILUMA launch markets accordingly with further launches plan in Q4 as communicated previously.\nA notable further update to our outlook is an increase in our operating cash flow forecast to around $10.5 billion as compared to around $10 billion previously despite notable currency headwinds. This includes our accelerated pro forma earnings growth forecast and an assumed full year contribution from Russia and Ukraine. We delivered robust operating cash flow growth in H1 of plus 14%. And as shown through the challenges of recent years, the cash generation capacity of our business remains exceptional. While flatted somewhat in 2021 by favorable timing and one-off impact, our revised full year forecast demonstrates underlying growth against this exceptional year after also accounting for higher inflation driven working capital requirements and currency. This underlines our ability to maintain a strong balance sheet, pay down debt and invest in the growth of our business.\nOur net debt of $23 billion on June 30, 2022, decreased compared to both June and December 2021, despite H1 capital expenditure of $0.5 billion and ongoing dividend payment. Our commitment to our progressive dividend policy is unwavering and we look forward to the additional cash flow, the proposed combination with Swedish Match would bring. We also continue to expect around $1 billion in full year capital expenditure.\nMoving now to the pro forma outlook for the second half. We expect to deliver strong top line growth, organic adjusted OI margin expansion and further acceleration in bottom line growth. For Q3, we expect mid-single-digit organic top line growth driven by IQOS with around $22 billion in pro forma HTU shipment volumes. While there is a tougher comparison for cigarette and a modest negative impact expected from shipment timing, we expect combustible volume trends to remain resilient by historical standards. Net revenue growth will also continue to be impacted in both Q3 and Q4 by the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey.\nWhile the temporary cost headwinds in Q2 are expected to ease somewhat in the third quarter, we expect this to be broadly offset by a step-up in smoke-free commercial and R&D investment as compared to a device constraint in Q3 2021. This results in an expected Q3 pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $1.23 to $1.28, including an estimated adverse currency impact of $0.24 at prevailing rates. We expect a strong Q4 with a rebound in HTU shipment volume due to phasing to the most pronounced as HT capacity constraint improve. The H2 recovery in our pro forma adjusted OI margin is also expected to be Q4 weighted.\nTurning back to our results. Pro forma HTU in-market sales volume grew strongly by plus 20% for both the second quarter and the first half, notably driven by strong performance in the EU region. As expected, Q2 IMS pro forma growth was significantly ahead of shipment volume growth reflecting the later timing of shipments I mentioned earlier. Our total pro forma shipment volume increased by plus 3% for Q2 and plus 4% for H1. As I touched on earlier, this put us well on track to deliver total volume growth for the second consecutive year on both a pro forma and total PMI basis.\nWith the impressive performance of IQOS, heated tobacco units comprised 12.6% of our pro forma shipment volume in H1 or 14% in total despite the anticipated HTU shipment timing impact in Q2. Our sales mix is also changing rapidly as we aim to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up almost 30% of our pro forma total and exceeded 30% for total PMI in the first half of the year. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 5% of the $4.2 billion of pro forma H1 RRP net revenues. This reflects higher device volume at a lower average price than last year as we expand our device portfolio with VEEV and ILUMA ONE and price ladder, our blade device portfolio in preparation for the launch of premium position in ILUMA.\nThe positive momentum of IQOS continues and is further accelerating in many geographies, providing a powerful driver of revenue and margin growth. We delivered organic growth of plus 8.1% in H1 pro forma net revenues and shipment on growth of plus 4%. This reflects between engine driving our top line in addition to volume. The first is pricing led by combustible. The second is the increasing mix of RRPs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continued to deliver substantial growths. This is an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerate.\nLet's now turn to the drivers of pro forma adjusted OI margin which contracted organically by 110 basis points. Pro forma gross margin decreased by 280 basis points organically, reflecting the factors I mentioned previously, as we invest in our smoke-free business and manage temporary supply chain disruption and cost inflation. This margin headwind was partially offset by better pro forma adjusted marketing administration and reserve costs, which improved by 160 basis points organically. This was driven by the positive operating leverage of RRP growth and successful cost efficiency program where we generated around $420 million in gross cost savings, of which approximately $170 million came from COGS productivity and over $250 million from SG&A.\nWith more than $1.2 billion of savings realized by this halfway point, we are well on track to deliver cost savings of $2 billion for 2021, 2023. This allows us to reinvest in top line growth and mitigate inflationary pressures while continuing to deliver margin expansion. We continue to accelerate investment in our commercial programs, digital engine and R&D for long-term growth as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. As reflected in our full year outlook, we expect our operating margin trajectory to improve in the second half of the year as temporary headwind and tough comparison in. Focusing now on combustible, our portfolio again delivered growth in pro forma volume and organic net revenue in Q2. Our pro forma shipment volume grew by plus 2.4% against a pandemic affected comparison notably driven by Indonesia, Poland and Turkey. In addition, we saw a continued recovery in international duty-free outside Asia as passenger traffic increases.\nPro forma combustible pricing of plus 3.5% was slightly ahead of our expectations. And while we remain cautious on the economic outlook, the pricing environment has been gradually improving. We expect to deliver a similar level of pricing for the full year. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product and both the positive Q2 and H1 segment share demonstrates the strength of our portfolio. We continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Marlboro becoming the world's leading cigarette brand. With the return of social consumption occasion, Marlboro volumes grew plus 7% year-over-year in H1, with category share again surpassing 10% on a pro forma 12-month rolling basis. Of course, our long-standing success in building Marlboro's brand equity is the strength we are now a smoke-free product as we make excellent progress with IQOS as the undisputed global smoke-free leader.\nThe positive combination of a stable share in combustible and the continued growth of IQOS positions to deliver total market share growth over time. We capture plus 40 basis points of pro forma share gain in Q2 including gains in duty-free, Italy, Japan and Turkey. Moreover, PMI HTU strengthened their position as the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present with a 7.5% share, excluding Russia and Ukraine.\nMoving now to IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 19 million IQOS users as of June 30 on a pro forma basis. This reflects very strong growth of over plus 1.1 million users in Q2 and plus 2.2 million in H1, a record first half high on this basis. The acceleration of IQOS user growth compared to both Q1 and last year was driven by the reactivation of acquisition and retention program in many markets as device supply constraint receded as well as the impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. While device supply constrained has eased in recent quarter, this is largely due to the success of our own proactive effort. The global supply of semiconductors remain tight, and we continue to closely monitor and manage the situation.\nIn the EU region, we are now approaching the milestone of 9 million IQOS users, reflecting stepped-up commercial activities to drive acquisition and retention, along with the launch of ILUMA in Switzerland and Spain. Our second quarter HTU share increased by plus 1.6 points to 7.1% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume. As noted in prior years, sequential share compared to Q1 was affected by the usual seasonality of the combustible market with the additional element of a strong year-over-year combustible recovery this quarter.\nMost importantly, IMS volume continued to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second half. The strong performance includes excellent user and volume growth across the region with notable contribution from Italy and Poland. Now to give some further color on our progress in the region. This slide shows a selection of the latest key city of Texas in Q2. Despite the denominator effect of the combustible category I just mentioned, share results remain very strong. Most impressive is Vilnius, the first city in the world to surpass 40% share while Athens, Budapest and Rome are in the mid- to high 20s.\nElsewhere, we are especially pleased by the results in London, Vienna and Zurich. In Japan, IQOS ILUMA is [driving] and our share of market continues to increase in key cities such as Tokyo. Most importantly, our IMS volume trends remain strong with continued sequential growth. As indicated last quarter, Q2 shipments were lower due to timing factors and should recover in the second half with a weighting towards Q4. The adjusted share for our H2 brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.9% in Q2 despite seasonality.\nWhile we are very pleased with these results, our share performance could have accelerated even further. The combustible category was notably resilient in the quarter and our rollout of mainline price [entire] HTUs for use with ILUMA was slightly slower than initially planned. However, early results were encouraging. (inaudible) is designed to cater to its consumers switching to ILUMA and more price-conscious legal-age smokers. We also observed an increase in legal-age users switching from low price competitive heat-not-burn product. We estimate users of competitive offering to have less average daily consumption due to lower full conversion, which we believe ILUMA should improve over time. The heat-not-burn category now represents around 1/3 of total tobacco in Japan with IQOS increasingly driving this year's growth.\nIn addition to strong progress in developed countries, we continue to see very promising IQOS growth in low and medium income market. The pro forma share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, continued to grow and reach 2.9% in Q2, reflecting sustained growth in IMS volume. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the existing IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents outstanding progress. A prime example of this are Lebanon where Q2 of take share in Beirut increased by plus 8.1 points to 17.4%, and Egypt where offtake share in Cairo reached around 5% after launching less than 1 year ago. Other notable successes include the recently launched market of Morocco and Tunisia, as well as Georgia, Jordan, North Macedonia and the Philippine despite pandemic restriction in Manila.\nMoving now to IQOS ILUMA, which continued to drive increased conversion and retention rate across initial launch market. In Japan, ILUMA continued to exhibit strong growth with premium priced TEREA HTUs growing rapidly to become the second largest tobacco brand, reaching an offtake share of 14.6% within 9 months of national launch. Encouragingly, SENTIA offtake share has already surpassed the level of HEETS in (inaudible) prefectures covering around 45% of industry volume.\nThe expansion of our device portfolio with ILUMA ONE in Q1 has also seen robust traction with legal-age smokers. We exited Q2 with a record high of tech share and continue to see a long runway of growth in Japan for ILUMA over the coming quarters.\nILUMA and TEREA HTUs also continue their superb start in Spain and Switzerland. We launched ILUMA in Spain in March 2022 with very positive initial results, notably in key cities such as Barcelona and Madrid. Sequential IMS volumes grew by 27% in Q2. TEREA exited the quarter, making up over 50% of HTU sales only 4 months after commercialization and our national HTU share has grown to plus 1.7%. This is especially encouraging as Spain has been a market where regulatory restriction had limited the speed of IQOS growth.\nIn Switzerland, the demand for ILUMA remains very strong. IMS volume continued to grow sequentially, increasing plus 13% in the second quarter. A significant proportion of existing users have upgraded to ILUMA and the offtake exit volume of TEREA now exceeds 70% of our HTU sales. We continue to expand our global smoke-fee portfolio through our rich pipeline of innovation. We launched ILUMA in Greece in late June with further market launches planned for Q4.\nWith regard to our new heat-not-burn device tailored to low and middle income market, we continue to plan pilot launches in the fourth quarter, further expanding our portfolio to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. In e-vapor, IQOS continued to deliver encouraging results, and for example, is now the established #2 [closed pod] brand in Italy with offtake share growing sequentially to around 20%. This is a premium proposition with an average price premium to competitive devices of 20% to 30% as we pursue differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time.\nIn Q2, we expanded into 3 additional geographies, including France, and are now present in 10 markets. The latest addition to our e-vapor portfolio is the Viva disposable device, responsibly marketed disposable e-vapor product can play an important role as a convenient hassle-free entry into the smoke-free category for legal-age smokers. Viva was recently launched in Canada with 9 varieties. Our geographic expansion of smoke-free products also continued in Q2 with the launch of IQOS in Bahrain. Of course, the biggest potential near-term addition to our smoke-free portfolio is the proposed combination with Swedish Match. This would deliver a major acceleration in our transformation to becoming a smoke-free company. The visions of our 2 companies are aligned in working towards a smoke-free future without cigarette and would create a global smoke-free champion.\nIf completed, we would have a comprehensive global smoke-free portfolio with leadership position in heat-not-burn and the fastest growing category of oral nicotine with potential for accelerated international expansion.\nAnother competing rationale for this deal is a large, attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market. Swedish Match as the leading nicotine pouch franchise within and a substantial U.S. operational platform, which would help us unlock the significant polity across other smoke-free categories over the coming years. This would be a strong strategic and cultural fit, offering significant shareholder value creation over the medium and long term. As stated in the offer document published on June 28, the waiting period for the transaction under the U.S. antitrust process has expired, meaning that we have satisfied our requirement in the U.S. to proceed with the transaction. We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to Swedish Match shareholders acceptance and the necessary regulatory approvals.\nMoving to sustainability. I want to first draw your attention to our 2021 integrated report published in May which outlines our new sustainability strategy and ESG performance in detail as we continue to transform for good. Included in the report is our new sustainability index comprised of 19 KPIs across our most material sustainability issues. The index is weighted towards product transformation and now represent 30% of our long-term performance-based equity executive compensation. The definitions, methodology and scope of each of these KPIs are included in our recently published ESG KPI protocol providing further transparency on how we define success and major ESG performance.\nWith regard to tackling climate change, I am delighted to report that the science-based target initiative as today validated our 2040 net-zero target. The initiative also revalidated our near-term 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gas emission and our new 2025 target for 15% of our suppliers by [then] to have their own science-based target by 2025 a very positive development, given that Scope 3 remains the most challenging aspect of any company decarbonization strategy. To support the achievement of these targets, we are accelerating progress to decarbonize our chain, and we have made 8 more factory carbon neutral this year, more than doubling from last year and placing us on track to meet our goal of all factories by 2025.\nFinally, product health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free product compared to smoking. We continue to support policy and fiscal framework that recognize a positive impact tobacco harm reduction policy can have on public health. Recent examples include a further multiyear tax plan with differentiated treatment for smoke-free products in Romania and statement from the Belgian Super Health Council on the whole e-vapor product can play in switching adult smokers away from cigarettes.\nTo conclude today's presentation, we have delivered a strong first half despite some challenging headwinds, placing us well on track to deliver robust volume growth and an accelerated currency-neutral pro forma financial performance in 2022. We remain excited by the promising results of IQOS ILUMA. Increased consumer satisfaction is driving higher retention and conversion, and we look forward to further market launches later this year. Our combustible business continues to perform well with pro forma volume and organic net revenue growth, maintaining our share of market over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternative and to invest for long-term growth in the development of innovative wellness and health care product will seek to deliver a net positive impact on society.\nWe continue to enrich our pipeline of smoke-free innovation, such as ILUMA and Viva to expand and grow across new and existing category and geography. We are raising our pro forma growth guidance for the full year and expect to deliver around [$6] in total adjusted diluted EPS, including Russia and Ukraine despite currency headwinds.\nImportantly, with an excellent 2021 performance and our strong 2022 outlook, we now expect to comfortably exceed our 2021-2023 minimum CAGR target on a pro forma basis of more than plus 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than plus 5% in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Our ambition to become a majority smoke-free business by net revenue in 2025 also remains fully intact. We are confident in the rapid pace of our transformation.\nFinally, we continue to be steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders. Our top priority for capital allocation remain reinvestment in the business and our progressive dividend policy, underpinned by strong cash flow generation. Thank you, and we are now more than happy to answer your questions.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Private -- Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nNicholas Rolli\n\nVP of IR and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2022 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.\nUnless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products, and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs. Growth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral adjusted results, excluding acquisitions. Figures and comparisons presented on a pro forma basis entirely exclude PMI's operations in Russia and Ukraine.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we acquired Fertin Pharma, Vectura Group and OtiTopic. On March 31, 2022, we launched a new Wellness and Healthcare business, Vectura Fertin Pharma, which consolidates these entities. The operating results of this new business are reported in the Other category. Business operations of our Wellness and Healthcare business are managed and evaluated separately from the geographical segments.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO & Director, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone. I hope you are all safe and well. Recent months have been extremely challenging for many of us given the tragic events related to the war in Ukraine. I would like to express our sadness and solidarity for the people of Ukraine.\nOur primary concern is for our employees and their families, and we have been doing everything we can to support them with 3 priorities. First, evacuating our colleagues. We have evacuated over 1,000 colleagues and family members from the country and supported more than 2,700 hours to move from conflict zones to locations away from the heaviest fighting. Second, we are delivering critical aids to people that cannot leave or who decided to remain in Ukraine. And third, we are providing accommodation, immediate assistance and a path forward to those who left the country.\nIn addition, we have already contributed around $10 million in funds and donated essential items across the country directly to humanitarian organization and through our own employee-led initiative, Projects with a Heart. This includes providing medicine, food, clothes and a variety of other items to our colleagues and to the broader population; the purchase of 25 ambulances and the setup of a mobile hospital. Based on our current visibility, we estimate an additional cost of around $25 million for additional support to employees this year.\nOur colleagues in neighboring countries continue to provide vital support to all people arriving from Ukraine to seek refuge. Our heartfelt gratitude goes to everyone involved in this generous efforts to help at such a difficult time.\nIn terms of the impact on our business operations, the production at our Ukraine manufacturing facility in Kharkiv remains suspended. While business activities in Eastern Ukraine have been mostly heavily impacted, we have seen some resumptions in areas where conditions allow as we seek to maximize product availability and service to consumers using existing inventories on hand. We are also now planning to import products from other manufacturing location, although this may involve higher costs.\nWe continue to pay salaries to all our Ukrainian employees and to provide substantial in-kind support to them and their families. As communicated in our March 24 press release, PMI's Board of Directors and senior executive team are working on options to exit the Russian market in an orderly manner in the context of a complex and rapidly changing regulatory and operating environment. This is no easy task in view of recently introduced complex legislation, but we are committed to seeking a viable path to exit the market while supporting our employees in Russia for this period.\nIt is also clear that we cannot continue business as usual in light of regulatory and supply chain disruption, which has already impacted the Russian business in Q1. We have taken concrete steps to scale back our operations such as the cancellation of all new investments and product launches, including IQOS ILUMA and IQOS VEEV. We are delisting 25% of our cigarette products, including Marlboro and Parliament SKUs. We have also canceled $150 million investment in capacity to ultimately manufacture more than 20 billion TEREA sticks for IQOS ILUMA in our Russian factory.\nClearly, the impact of the conflict has also created disruption in global supply chains and exacerbated inflationary pressures in certain materials and services. However, the Q1 performance and outlook for our business, excluding Russia and Ukraine, remains strong. On a reported basis, our outlook conservatively assumes no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. To provide a consistent view given the uncertainty and volatility of these 2 markets, we will now also provide adjusted results and guidance on a pro forma basis, excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the prior and full current year.\nI will now hand over to Emmanuel to cover this in more detail.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacek. We delivered a very strong performance in Q1 with a double-digit organic net revenue and currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth on a pro forma basis, excluding Russia and Ukraine from both the current and prior year quarter. Overall currency-neutral results were also ahead of our expectations.\nOur IQOS business delivered an excellent quarter, continuing the reacceleration seen last quarter as device supply constraints continue to ease. Our IQOS user base grew by more than 1 million excluding Russia and Ukraine, marking a very strong performance. RRP pro forma net revenues grew by plus 23%, with pro forma smoke-free net revenue over 30% of the total company. Importantly, pro forma HTU shipment volumes grew plus 18% compared to the prior year quarter. This reflects excellent progress in the EU region, continued growth in Japan as well as over plus 50% growth in low- and middle-income market.\nPMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in markets where IQOS is present as our efforts on innovation, portfolio and geographic expansion drive consumer trial and adoption. The impressive start for IQOS ILUMA continues in Japan and Switzerland with very encouraging initial take-up in our latest launch market of Spain. The initial success in these 3 very different markets reaffirms our confidence in ILUMA as an exciting future growth driver for our company.\nMeanwhile, our combustible business performed robustly, exceeding our objective of stable category share and delivering positive volume and organic net revenue growth. In addition to supporting strong financial performance, this also enhances our ability to maximize the switching of adult smokers to smoke-free alternatives. Overall, our business is off to a strong start. And while currency is unfavorable in 2022, we expect to deliver another year of robust organic top and bottom line growth.\nTurning now to the headline numbers. Our Q1 net revenue grew organically by plus 9% in total and plus 10% on a pro forma basis. This reflects total volume growth driven by the underlying strength of IQOS, the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets against pandemic-affected comparison and some positive timing impact, including inventory movements. Our total organic net revenue per unit grew plus 5.3% and by plus 4.9% on a pro forma basis, driven by the increasing proportion of IQOS HTUs in our sales mix, higher device volumes and pricing. Combustible pricing was above expectation at plus 2.9% pro forma or around plus 6% excluding Indonesia.\nOur total Q1 adjusted operating income margin declined organically by 30 basis points and by 40 basis points, excluding Russia and Ukraine. This reflects a lower gross margin compared to a tough prior year comparison, where productivity was higher mostly due to timing factors. Flagged in our full year earnings, Q1 margins were impacted by higher device sales or increasing IQOS user acquisition, channel replenishment and IQOS ILUMA. As mentioned previously, the unit cost and weight of ILUMA consumable and device cost is initially higher as we ramp up production with improvement expected from next year. Inflation in certain elements of our supply chain, including energy, wages and direct materials and an increase in the use of air freight was also exacerbated by the impact of the war in Ukraine.\nDespite these temporary margin challenges, we saw positive effects of the increasing size of IQOS, pricing and cost efficiency combined with our strong net revenue growth. This enabled us to deliver adjusted diluted EPS of $1.56, including unfavorable currency of $0.23, representing plus 14% currency-neutral growth. This was comfortably ahead of our currency-neutral expectations even accounting for timing benefit of around $0.06. Excluding Russia and Ukraine, our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.46 grew by plus 16%.\nTurning now to our 2022 outlook. As Jacek mentioned, given the lack of visibility in Russia and Ukraine, we are now providing an adjusted outlook on a pro forma basis excluding these 2 markets for the entire year. With our underlying business reaccelerating, our growth fundamentals remain strong. Importantly, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth of plus 4.5% to plus 6.5% compared to 2021 pro forma adjusted net revenue of $29.2 billion. This is both our previous forecast trajectory for total PMI, despite an approximate 0.5-point drag from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey.\nThis range incorporates the risk of supply chain disruption for certain materials, a somewhat slower TEREA production capacity buildup due to the production cancellation in Russia, part of which was designated for export, the remaining uncertainty on full device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. We expect our pro forma adjusted operating income margin to be organically 0 to plus 100 basis points higher for the full year.\nAs mentioned at full year results, we expect a lower gross margin as we invest in new innovation and incurred temporarily higher unit and transportation costs for the fast growth of ILUMA. Since then, we have observed increased inflation in raw material and energy prices and additional supply chain costs due to war-related disruption including a temporary increase in air freight for both HTU and select cigarette products.\nHigher expected device sales from the tremendous uptake of IQOS ILUMA and easing of device supplies constraint also have an initial dilutive margin impact. Despite this added headwind and the further expected COGS increase of around $300 million compared to our initial expectation, we remain confident that we will achieve organic pro forma margin expansion as our strong revenue growth, favorable product mix and cost saving initiatives deliver sustainable accretion. We forecast pro forma currency neutral-adjusted diluted EPS growth of plus 9% to plus 11%, also above our prior total PMI full year guidance. This translates into a pro forma adjusted diluted EPS range of $5.35 to $5.46, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.63 at prevailing rates. This compared to our previous 2022 adjusted diluted EPS guidance of $6.12 to $6.30 provided in February, with the difference primarily reflecting the exclusion of Russia and Ukraine and an incremental unfavorable currency impact.\nThe underlying IQOS growth outlook remains excellent. On a pro forma basis, we expect to deliver between 88 billion and 92 billion HTU shipment volumes, representing plus 20% to plus 25% growth over the pro forma prior year of 73.5 billion units. This excludes the nearly 5 billion unit shipped in Russia and Ukraine in Q1. And while we conservatively assume no further such contribution from April 1, this imply a total outlook of 93 billion to 97 billion units for the year. We continue to expect pro forma HTU shipment to be modestly ahead of IMS for the year after lagging behind in the second quarter, as I will explain later.\nAs outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarette and HTUs excluding Russia, Ukraine, U.S. and China, to decline by up to minus 1%. Given our leadership in smoke-free products, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business as well as stabilizing share in combustible, we expect to gain share. We therefore target positive total PMI pro forma shipment volume within the range of flat to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pro forma pricing of around plus 3%, now\n(technical difficulty)\nadverse impact from hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey.\nThe pricing environment is improving, including in Indonesia, although challenges remain due to ongoing pandemic-related impact and disposable income pressures. Our other assumptions include around $10 billion in operating cash flow and an effective tax rate of 21% to 22%. We continue to expect full year capital expenditure of around $1 billion. Despite the impact of the war in Ukraine, our balance sheet remains strong and we remain steadfastly committed to returning cash to shareholders through dividend and opportunistic share repurchases.\nWith regard to the phasing of pro forma performance this year, we expect a robust H1 overall with margin expansion and adjusted diluted EPS growth weighted to the second half. In large part, this reflects the reacceleration of IQOS as device supply constraints ease, with a sharp recovery in device volume as we replenish channel inventory for user acquisition and we supply the accelerated ILUMA replacement cycle in Japan. In addition, our average device\n(technical difficulty)\nthan the prior year, reflecting stepped-up commercial activity to drive acquisition, including the broadening of our device portfolio with LIL and ILUMA ONE.\nWhile our devices continue to be priced at a meaningful premium to heavily discounted competitive offering, we have already seen encouraging signs in stabilizing our high category share. Moreover, as we adjust our supply chain flows to prevailing global disruption in various material and logistic services, combined with the effect of the war in Ukraine, there may be a risk of short out-of-stock situation on certain cigarette SKUs in select markets. And we are making adjustment to some product to reflect the availability of specific material. The reorganization of supply chain flows will contribute to the later timing of shipments to certain markets.\nWe notably expect Q2 to be impacted by a number of temporary or specific factors, including the reversal of certain Q1 timing benefit. Organic pro forma net revenue growth is expected to be low single digit with other notable factors, including the delayed timing of HTU and cigarette shipment to Japan with an approximate 2-point drag on growth and a further impact from the shift to hyperinflationary accounting in Turkey, where the Q2 exchange rate comparison is accentuated. We expect total PMI pro forma HTU shipment of around 20 billion in Q2, partly reflecting around 3 billion less HTU shipment to Japan than originally planned. This compared to 18.7 billion pro forma in Q2 2021. We expect this 3 billion unit to move to H2, generating a further growth acceleration in the third and fourth quarters.\nFor Q2 pro forma operating margin, the\n(technical difficulty)\n\nOperator\n\nPlease stand by. We're experiencing technical difficulties. The backup line has now been placed.\n(technical difficulty)\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty) currency-neutral growth of 5% to 7% compared to $2.86 in the prior year. In combination with our strong first quarter, H1 pro forma top line performance is expected to deliver organic growth of 5%\n(technical difficulty)\noverall. In H2, the powerful drivers of pricing, scale and efficiencies and the receding of temporary cost headwinds should outweigh inflationary pressures to deliver strong top line growth, organic margin expansion and an acceleration in bottom line growth.\nOur strong 2022 outlook places us firmly on track to deliver our 2021-2023 CAGR targets on a pro forma basis of more than 5% in organic net revenue growth and more than 9% in currently in currency-neutral adjusted EPS growth.\n\nOperator\n\nPlease stand by, we're experiencing technical difficulties.\n(technical difficulty)\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\n(technical difficulty)\npercent of the $2.1 billion of Q1 RRP pro forma net revenue, reflecting higher year-over-year device volume as supply constraint ease and ILUMA performed strongly.\nWe delivered organic growth of plus 10% in Q1 pro forma net revenue on shipment volume growth of plus 4.9%. This growth reflects the twin engine driving our top line. The first is pricing led by combustible; the second is the increasing mix of reduced-risk products in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continue to deliver substantial growth, an increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates.\nLet's now turn to the driver of our Q1 pro forma OI margin, which declined by 40 basis points. Our pro forma gross margin\n(technical difficulty)\nSoutheast Asia region this year. Increased travel also supported volume growth in Spain and Duty Free. Our share of the combustible category continued to recover with a plus 0.4-point pro forma gain in Q1 on a year-over-year basis. This includes gain in Japan, Turkey and Duty Free as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and social consumption resumed with Marlboro share plus 0.3 points higher.\nWhile the category is declining over time. Our leadership in combustibles helps to maximize switching to smoke-free product, and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.\nIn terms of our overall market share now, ongoing gains for our IQOS portfolio creates continued positive momentum. We delivered pro forma share growth in Q1 as expected, including gains in Italy, Duty Free, Egypt, Germany and Poland. PMI HTUs are now the second largest nicotine brand in the market where they are present, with a 7.5\n(technical difficulty)\nexcluding Russia and Ukraine. This includes the #1 position in 6 markets.\nMoving now to the IQOS performance. We estimate there were approximately 17.9 million IQOS users as of March 31, excluding Russia and Ukraine, which had an estimated 4.8 million users at December 31, 2021. This reflects pro forma growth of more than 1 million users, a phenomenal performance by historic standards. This was driven by the resumption of consumer program in many markets, as device\n(technical difficulty)\nreceded, capitalizing on the strong underlying demand for the brand, as also evident in the very impressive start of IQOS ILUMA. We estimate that 71% of total IQOS users outside Russia and Ukraine, or 12.7 million adult smokers, have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking, with the balance in various stages of conversion.\nWe were also very encouraged by the FDA's recent MRTP order for IQOS 3, with the full range of authorized IQOS products now classified as modified risk tobacco product.\nIn the EU region, first quarter HTU share reached 7.6% of total cigarette and HTU industry volume, representing a first quarter share gain of 2 points, including a small benefit from the timing of inventory movement. Adjusted IMS volume also continue to exhibit robust sequential growth, and we expect this to continue in the second quarter, noting that the usual seasonality of the combustible market combined with the reversal of Q1 inventory movement, is expected to result in a lower sequential share in Q2. This very good performance include strong user and volume growth across the region, with especially notable contribution from Italy and Poland. I also want to again highlight Hungary and Lithuania where our Q1 national HTU share exceeded 25%.\nTo give some further color on our progress in the EU region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city offtake shares. While Vilnius continue to lead the way, approaching 40% share, Budapest, Rome and Athens are also well into the mid- to high 20s. Elsewhere, we are especially pleased by Vienna more than doubling to 5%, the strong traction in London at over 6% share, and a further acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of ILUMA.\nIn Japan, the adjusted share for our HTU brands increased by plus 1.9 points to a record 22.7% in Q1. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which is also driving notable gains in Tokyo and other key cities. We expect strong offtake trends to continue in Q2, reaching around 24% market share despite seasonality effect. Conversely, as I touched on earlier, supply chain constraints will likely result in Q2 HTU shipment below the prior year. With HTU inventory consequently reduced in the second quarter, we expect the replenishment in H2 to deliver a substantial recovery.\nNotwithstanding such quarterly volatility with substantial commercial activity planned and excellent underlying momentum, we expect strong double-digit HTU shipment volume growth in Japan this year.\nIn addition to strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low-and middle-income market. The share of our HTU brands in the 28 such markets launched by December 31, 2021, excluding Russia and Ukraine, grew by plus 0.8 points compared to the prior year to reach 2.7%. Given the large size of this market, the premium positioning of the exiting IQOS portfolio and the relatively early stage of commercialization, this represents excellent progress. As mentioned last quarter, we also intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn devices and HTUs tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year.\nA prime example of this is Egypt, where offtake exit share in Cairo is approaching 5% within 8 months of launch as compared to total Q1 share of 4.3%. Other notable successes, including the recently launched market of Morocco as well as Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines, despite pandemic restriction in Manila.\nMoving now to IQOS ILUMA. We are delighted to report the further outstanding success since its launch, with sales performance and consumer reactions still exceeding our expectation. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal-age smoker has been rapid, with more than 30% of the large user base up-trading since the August 2021 launch, and over 20% of sales remain to legal-age smoker new to IQOS. Moreover, the enhanced and consistently high-quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rates, retention rates and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volumes with premium-priced TEREA consumables, the fastest-growing launch in the smoke-free category, reaching an offtake share of 12% within 6 months of national launch, overtaking Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS combined to become the #1 smoke-free brand.\nWe now have all 3 IQOS ILUMA devices in the market following the launch of ILUMA ONE, which provides multiple consecutive use at a more affordable price point. We are also introducing a new HTU brand called SENTIA for use with ILUMA in select prefectures at a mainline price point comparable to HEETS.\nResults in Switzerland have again been even more remarkable with significant sales to new user and TEREA making up almost 2/3 of HTU sales after only 5 months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated from less than 6% in Q3 to 9% this quarter, with notable success in the German-speaking majority of the country. Our newest ILUMA launch was in Spain last month. While very early days, the signs are also very positive with device sales to new user increasing plus 50% compared to the prior run rate, 10% of existing users upgraded within the first month and TEREA exiting March at over 1/4 of total HTU offtake.\nThese results across 3 markets with differing consumer characteristics and level of RRP maturity are clearly very encouraging for the wider rollout of ILUMA around the world. While device supply constraints are easing, the timing of HTU availability for new ILUMA market has been somewhat delayed given the rapid uptake in the initial market and the resulting need for greater supply for each new market than was originally anticipated. In addition, the cancellation of our investment in the production of TEREA HTUs in our Russian facility has a short-term impact. As a result, further market launches are now mostly expected towards the end of H2.\nWith ILUMA, IQOS 3 DUO and LIL, we now have 3 heat-not-burn technology under the IQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables at different price tier.\nIn e-vapor, IQOS VEEV's promising results in the first group of markets continue. VEEV is a premium proposition with an average price premium to competitive device of 20% to 30%, making these results especially encouraging as we pursue a differentiated and profitable category leadership position over time. We see further success in Italy, reaching almost 20% offtake share of closed-system pods, with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within 8 months of launch.\nIn the Czech Republic after some temporary supply disruption at the start of the quarter which affected Q1 share, rapid growth has resumed. VEEV was present in 7 markets at March 31, and we plan to add more this year with timing subject to device availability. Separately, our relaunched commercialization of nicotine pouches under the Shiro brand in the Nordics is progressing well with positive consumer feedback.\nMoving to sustainability and our ESG priorities. I'm happy to share 2 important development published in our 2022 proxy statement. Firstly, our Board of Directors updated our company's statement of purpose, expanding it beyond smoke-free to better reflect the role of wellness and health care in our corporate strategy and transformation. Second, the introduction of a bespoke Sustainability Index explicitly links our ESG performance to 30% of long-term compensation. Further details will be shared in our Integrated Report on May 17 and further dedicated disclosures.\nProduct health impact remains one of our most critical ESG priorities, and the growing penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarette as legal-age smokers switch to better alternative. There is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial risk reduction potential of smoke-free products compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal framework that recognize the positive impact tobacco harm reduction policies can have on public health. A recent example of this is Italy, which has established distinct excise tax category for heat-not-burn, e-vapor and nicotine pouches.\nThank you. And I will now turn it back to Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO & Director, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. Despite the challenges in Russia and Ukraine, we have delivered an excellent start to the year with a strong recovery in IQOS user growth, an exceptional initial results from the groundbreaking innovation of IQOS ILUMA. As we covered recently at CAGNY, we have a rich pipeline of further smoke-free innovations to expand and grow across new and existing categories and geographies.\nOur combustible business is now stabilizing category share despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization, which allows us to accelerate further switching of smokers to better alternatives.\nWe also continue to invest for long-term growth through the development of innovative wellness and health care products, which seeks to deliver a net positive impact on society. Our 2022 fundamentals are strong, with a pro forma expectation of 4.5% to 6.5% organic net revenue growth and 9% to 11% currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth. Despite the significant inflationary pressures and disruptions in the global supply chain affecting first half and the full year, we also expect our organic operating income margin to expand to up by 100 basis points.\nIn addition, we have taken the conservative assumption in our reported guidance of no further contribution from Russia or Ukraine from April 1. Overall, we are very confident in the near- and midterm growth outlook and remain committed to sustainably rewarding shareholders over time as we continue our transformation.\nThank you. And we are now happy to answer your questions.\n\nNicholas Rolli\n\nVP of IR and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nOperator, this is Nick Rolli.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nNicholas Rolli\n\nVP of IR and Financial Communications, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2021 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures and additional heated tobacco unit market share data are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.\nUnless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products and all references to smoke-free products are to our RRPs.\nGrowth rates presented on an organic basis reflect currency-neutral underlying results. Following the acquisitions of Fertin Pharma, OtiTopic and Vectura Group, PMI added the other category in the third quarter of 2021. Business operations for the other category are evaluated separately from the geographical operating segments.\nToday's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. Please also note the additional forward-looking and cautionary statements related to COVID-19.\nIt's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Executive Officer; and Emmanuel Babeau, our Chief Financial Officer. Over to you, Jacek.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO & Director, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Nick, and welcome, everyone. I hope you all say on well. Our business delivered an excellent performance in 2021, reaching record net revenues, adjusted diluted EPS and cash flow with growth in overall volumes, high single-digit organic net revenue growth and strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth.\nThe Zelustrates, the sustainable nature of our growth, there is a new product and innovation as demonstrated by continued strength of IQOS, which delivered 31% full year organic growth in RRP net revenues. Smoke-free products surpassed 30% of total net revenues in Q4 as we progress towards our ambition of becoming a predominantly smoke-free company by 2025. We are especially pleased by the acceleration of our business in Q4 to deliver a better-than-expected result. This reacceleration was visible in organic net revenues IQOS user growth, heated tobacco unit market shares across developed and emerging markets, innovation in devices and consumables and commercial investments and combustible market share. IQOS user growth recovered in Q4 to reach an estimated 21.2 million total users, despite ongoing tightness in device supplies in the second half of the year.\nFull year heated tobacco unit shipment volumes grew 25% to reach 95 billion units with broad-based growth for both our volumes and the category across key geographies, with an especially positive rebound in the EU. The growth outlook for IQOS remains very positive with outstanding initial results from IQOS ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland the only 2 launches so far and growing traction for IQOS deal in early launch markets. In combustibles, we essentially reached our goal of stable category share in the fourth quarter despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization.\nDuring the year, we laid the foundation for our long-term growth ambitions beyond nicotine in wellness and healthcare, including the milestone acquisition of Fertin and Vectura, which provides essential capabilities for future product development. And last, bolstered by strong operating cash flow, we continue to prioritize returns to shareholders for a 4.2% increase in the dividend and ongoing repurchases.\nTurning to the headline numbers. Our full year adjusted net revenues grew organically by 7.6% or 10.3% in dollar terms, including positive currency. This reflects the continued underlying strength of IQOS and the ongoing recovery of the combustible business in many markets compared to the pandemic affected prior year.\nOur net revenue per unit grew 5.3% organically driven by the increasing proportion of iQOS in our sales mix and pricing. Combustible pricing was in line with our expectations at 2.7% or around 4%, excluding Indonesia. Our adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points on an organic basis, in line with our expectations, with continued positive effects from the increasing size and profitability of IQOS, pricing and productivity savings.\nThrough first half expansion -- although strong (inaudible) expansion was tempered in the second half by the expected initial higher unit cost of iQOS ILUMA, geographic and category expansion investment and the Q4 resumption of consumer programs in a number of markets.\nOur resulting adjusted diluted EPS of $6.08 represents 17.6% growth in dollar terms and 15.3% currency-neutral growth, which is well above our prior guidance as IQOS user growth, the launch of Illuma and total industry volumes exceeded our expectations. Finally, we generated operating cash flow of $12 billion, reflecting excellent underlying cash conversion in addition to strong Q4 business results and certain timing factors.\nLooking at our Q4 performance, net revenues grew by 8.4% organically. This reflects the sequential improvement in IQOS user acquisition the initial success of ILUMA in Japan and strong overall volumes, including a further recovery in combustibles. We delivered a robust organic net revenue per unit growth of 4.1%, again reflecting our shift in business mix. We achieved this despite softer pricing on combustibles of 1.4% due to the factors flagged previously of continued pandemic-related challenges in certain markets as well as comparison effects in Germany and Australia.\nOur Q4 adjusted operating income margin declined by 10 basis points on an organic basis, primarily due to the same factors mentioned for the second half as accelerating business performance opened more opportunities for investment in future growth. Despite that, our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS, again grew strongly by 11.9%, also reflecting a lower interest cost and effective tax rate.\nTurning now to 2022 guidance. After the temporary slowdown in IQOS user growth in the second half of 2021, the device supply situation is gradually improving. While the situation remains fluid, we now expect a more limited impact, allowing us to gradually return to prior rates of user progression over the coming quarters. With the remarkable success of ILUMA in its first market, a number of other innovations planned and promising growth for IQOS in low and middle income markets, our 2022 growth fundamentals are strong, and we look forward to an exciting year.\nWe note that the slower user growth in the second half of 2021, particularly in the third quarter, will have an estimated carryover effect on our growth this year of around 4 billion to 5 billion cubic tobacco units. This is reflected in our 2022 expectations of 113 million to 118 billion HTU shipment volume.\nGiven this continued growth, we expect our full year HTU shipments to again be ahead of IMS volumes. We expect to deliver between 4% and 6% organic net revenue growth keeping us well on track to deliver our 2021 -- 2021, 2023 compound annual growth rate target of more than 5%. This range prudently incorporates the continuing uncertainty on full device availability and the pace of the ongoing pandemic recovery. For Duty Free, we assume no meaningful pickup in Asian travel, but a continued gradual recovery in other geographies.\nWe expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand between 50 and 150 basis points as the positive effects of our product transformation continues, despite the expectation of a moderately lower gross margin. This is essentially attributable to temporary ILUMA related factors such as the higher initial weight and cost of TEREA consumables and the cost of devices, which we expect to decrease over the 18 to 24 months post launch as we have experienced in previous -- with previous major innovations.\nWe also account for higher logistic costs, where the tremendous uptake of ILUMA in Japan has led to increased use of air freight investments to grow capacity across our smoke-free platforms and inflation in certain supply chain elements.\nOperating income margin expansion and continued reinvestment in attractive smoke-free growth opportunities and in wellness and healthcare R&D will again be supported by our ongoing efficiency programs. We remain on track to deliver around $2 billion in gross savings by 2023.\nAccordingly, we forecast currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth of 8% to 11%. This translates into an adjusted diluted EPS range of $6.12 to $6.30, including an estimated unfavorable currency impact of around $0.45 at prevailing rates. This is primarily due to translation effects, and this currency impact reflects notably the appreciation of the euro, Japanese yen and Turkish lira versus the dollar. This guidance includes the impact of $785 million of share repurchases made in 2021, which were somewhat restricted by blackout periods. It does not reflect the impact of repurchases in 2022 as we continue to take an opportunistic approach within our target of between $5 billion to $7 billion over 3 years.\nOur guidance also reflects the impact of acquired businesses, which we expect to generate underlying operating income in line with our business plan, but with an operating loss of around $150 million or approximately 1% of adjusted diluted EPS, which we'll come back to explain later.\nAs outlined in today's release, there are a number of other assumptions underpinning our outlook. We expect the total industry volume of cigarettes and to cubic tobacco units, excluding the U.S. and China to decline between minus 1% and minus 2%. Given our leadership in smoke-free product, the structural growth of the category and its growing proportion in our business, we expect to gain share a target broadly stable total PMI shipment volumes within the range of minus 1% to plus 1%. We assume full year combustible pricing of 3% to 4% with a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year, and this is clearly above 2021 levels. The pricing environment is improving but still challenging central markets with ongoing pandemic related impacts.\nOur balance sheet is strong. We delivered excellent operating cash flow of $12 billion in 2021, reflecting robust underlying cash conversion in addition to favorable timing and one-off impact of around $0.5 billion. With further strong organic profit growth expected in 2022, we expect to generate around $11 billion of operating cash flow, subject to year-end working capital requirements and after accounting for the reversal of timing benefits and using prevailing exchange rates.\nAs a result, we raised our 2021 to '23 operating cash flow target communicated at the February 2021 Investor Day at then prevailing rates from around $35 billion to the range of $36 billion to $37 billion. We also expect full year capital expenditures of around $1 billion, reflecting increased capacity investments behind our smoke-free platforms, including ILUMA and enhancing our digital commercial engine in addition to certain projects, which were delayed due to the pandemic.\nLastly, looking specifically to the first quarter of 2022, we expect adjusted diluted EPS of $1.50 to $1.55, including $0.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing rates. We expect robust organic top line growth and operating margins comparisons, which reflect above the very strong prior year quarter, which benefited from a high level of productivity savings and relatively low levels of investment and the Q1 of 2022 dynamics of increased device sales, commercial investments, ILUMA related costs and increases in some inputs such as freight.\nLet me now hand over to Emmanuel, who will give you more details of our performance in 2021.\n\nEmmanuel Babeau\n\nCFO, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Jacek. Turning back to our 2021 results. Total shipment volumes increased by plus 4.2% in Q4 and by plus 2.2% for the year. This reflects continued strong broad-based growth from HTUs of plus 25% or 18.9 billion units for the full year, comfortably exceeding the decline of 3.6 billion cigarettes. The plus 2.4% increase in our Q4 cigarette volumes reflect the continued sequential recovery of the total industry and of our category share, in addition to a 2.7 billion stick favorable inventory movement, which mainly reflects inventory reduction in the prior year quarter.\nDue to the remarkable performance of IQOS. Inter tobacco units comprised almost 14% of our total shipment volume in the fourth quarter and 13.2% for the year. As compared to 11% in full year 2020, 8% in 2019 and 5% in 2018. Our sales mix is evolving rapidly, putting us on track to become a majority smoke-free company by 2025. Smoke-free net revenues made up over 30% of our adjusted total revenue in Q4 and 29% for the year as compared to 24% in 2020.\nIn 10 markets, we have already surpassed 50%. IQOS devices accounted for over 6% of the $9.1 billion of 2021 RP net revenues with a step up in H2, reflecting the IQOS ILUMA launch, outweighing the effect of supply constraint on the IQOS versions.\nWe delivered plus 7.6% organic growth in 2021 net revenues on shipment volume growth of plus 2.2%, reflecting the twin engines driving our top line. The first is pricing on combustible and in certain markets on HTUs. Second is the increasing mix of HTUs in our business at higher net revenue per unit, which continues to deliver substantial growth and increasingly powerful driver as our transformation accelerates.\nLet's now turn to the driver of our 2021 margin expansion. Our gross margin increased by 190 basis points on an organic basis due to product mix, pricing and cost savings, while our adjusted marketing, administration and research costs were 10 basis points better as a percentage of adjusted net revenues. We generated over $800 million in gross cost savings in 2021 with around $550 million in manufacturing and supply chain productivity and more than $250 million in SG&A efficiency before inflation. This represents strong progress towards our target of around $2 billion for 2021, 2023 and allows us to reinvest in top line growth while continuing to deliver robust margin progression.\nWhile OI margin expansion was lower in H2, this reflects the positive dynamic of our business and the ability to return to normalized investment levels compared to the pandemic affected prior year. ILUMA device and HTU shipments commenced with higher initial unit cost and we reaccelerated investments in our commercial program, digital engine and R&D as well as a number of growth opportunities across categories and geographies. We intend to continue investing in such opportunities in 2022. But with the benefit of scale, operating leverage and accelerated efficiencies we continue to target organic SG&A increases below the rate of sales growth.\nMoving now to market share. Our share of the combustible category recovered and was essentially stable in Q4 on a year-over-year basis, as our portfolio initiatives bear fruit and pandemic-linked restrictions received in many markets. Our leadership in combustible helps to maximize switching to smoke-free products and we continue to target a stable category share over time despite the impact of IQOS cannibalization. Aside consumer growth, we accelerate, we target at first a slightly decline in 2022.\nFor the combustible category overall, the improving total market backdrop includes notable Q4 recoveries in Indonesia, Mexico and Turkey, close to stable industry volume in the EU region and a modest recovery in duty free driven by sales outside Asia. Daily consumption remains below precoded level in certain markets such as the Philippines, where our share of market is influenced by mobility and social consumption.\nIn Indonesia, our share was again broadly stable on a sequential basis despite the continued growth of the below Tier 1 segment and our volumes grew over 4% for the year. The reduction from 10 to 8 excise tax year in 2022 represents a step in the right direction, and the industry weighted average excise increase of around plus 13% is slightly below the prior year. However, the playing field remained unequaled between industry players and the pricing environment remains challenging.\nIn terms of our overall share, ongoing gain for our IQOS portfolio create positive momentum going into this year, and we expect to resume overall share growth as well as achieving broadly stable total shipment volume. PMI HTUs now have a 7.1% share in the markets where they are present, making them the third largest tobacco brand. This includes the #1 position in 5 markets, and the #2 in a further 6 markets.\nMoving now to IQOS performance. We estimate the were approximately 21.2 million IQOS users as of December 31. The improved user growth of plus 0.8 million in Q4 reflects our agile commercial model, which allowed us to rapidly adjust our consumer program and assortment. As demonstrated by the performance of ILUMA in Japan and Switzerland, the underlying momentum of the IQOS brand remains strong. While we don't yet have full visibility over the full year of 2022, iDevice shortages ease, we expect to gradually return to user growth at or above the prior run rate of around 1 million per quarter. We estimate that 72% of total users or 15.3 million adult smokers have switched to IQOS and stopped smoking with the balance in various stages of conversion.\nIn the EU region, Fourth quarter HTU share reached 6.4% of total cigarette and HTU industry revenue, 1.4 points higher than Q4 last year. Underlying IMS growth trends remain excellent. This very good performance included strong growth across the region, with Italy reaching the milestone of 2 million users and positive contribution from Germany and Poland. I also want to highlight Hungary where our Q4 national HTU share exceeded 20%, following Japan and Lithuania enriching this important threshold.\nTo give some further color on our progress in the EU region, this slide shows a selection of the latest key city of Tech shares. While Vilnius continued to lead the way with 7.5% share. The 20% level was also reached in Budapest, Rome and Athens. With strong progress across the region, we are especially pleased by Vienna, almost doubling to 4%, the strong traction in London at almost 6% share, and an acceleration in Zurich with the introduction of IQOS ILUMA. We show further HTU share data in the appendix to these slides.\nShare growth continued in Russia with our Q4 HTU share up by plus 0.8 points to reach 8%. For both Russia and the overall region, sequential growth in adjusted IMS slowed in the last 2 quarters, partly reflecting the more acute device shortage and lead on commercial program. In addition, the region was affected by the halting of sales in Belarus, which impacted sequential IMF growth in Q4.\nIn this context, as mentioned in last quarter, we have seen some increased consumer trial in Russia of discounted competitor offerings and disposable e-vapor products. We continue to see high interest in the category and with a pipeline of exciting innovations plan, including the launch of ILUMA, we aim to resume strong growth this year.\nIn Japan now, the adjusted total tobacco share for our HTU brands increased by plus-1.7 points to a record 21.8% in Q4. And an offtake exit share approaching 23%, with Q4 adjusted IMS sequential trends, incorporating the pull forward of consumer uptake into Q3 before the price increase. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the launch of IQOS ILUMA, which I will come back to 4.\nThe overall tobacco category continues to grow, making up over 31% of the adjusted total Japanese tobacco market in Q4, with IQOS maintaining a high share of segment and capturing the majority of the category's 2021 growth. In addition to the strong progress in developed countries, we see very promising IQOS growth in low and middle income market. A prime example of this is Egypt where offtake share in Cairo is approaching 4% within 6 months of launch with other notable successes, including Lebanon, Jordan, the Dominican Republic and the Philippines despite funding in retraction in Manila. This low and middle-income market key city performance is especially encouraging as we achieved it despite the premium position of the current IQOS portfolio.\nWe do intend to bring a new complementary range of heat-not-burn products tailored to emerging markets towards the end of this year, which I will come back to.\nWith this potential in mind, we continue to drive the geographic expansion of our smoke-free products as we aim to be in 100 markets by 2025. During the quarter, we launched IQOS in both Morocco and Tunisia. This takes the total number of markets where PMI smoke-free products are available for sale to 71, of which 30 are in low and middle-income markets. We plan to add more market this year as we also meaningfully broaden our product offer and price segmentation within existing geography. This includes the expansion of feel and feet, which are now available in over 20 markets across multiple regions and our expansion of e-vapor and nicotine pouches.\nFollowing the implementation of the ITC importation ban, IQOS is not currently available in the U.S. We continue to work on contingency plans, including domestic manufacturing and hope to be able to resume U.S. supply in the first half of 2023. It is important to remember that the ITC decision on this patent is an outlier. We were encouraged by the U.S. patent office recent invalidation of 1 of the 2 patents included in the ITC ruling, and we expect a decision on the second patent by April 2, though this decision are subject to an AP process. BAT has been universally unsuccessful in asserting the same 2 patent family against IQOS in Europe.\nSeparately, in December, a German court ruled that BAT blow hyperfocal (inaudible) device infringes our patents and that we are entitled among other things to an injunction against BAT sales cells of the device.\nMoving now to IQOS ILUMA. We are delighted to report the outstanding success since its launch in Japan and Switzerland with sales performance and consumer reaction exceeding our expectation. In Japan, the uptake of ILUMA devices and consumables among both existing IQOS users and legal age smoker has been rapid with more than 20% of the large user base switching since the August launch and over 20% of sales to legal age smokers due to IQOS.\nMoreover, the enhanced and consistently high-quality user experience, better reliability and no need for cleaning has led to significant observed increases in conversion rate, retention rate and Net Promoter Score. This bodes well for volume growth and indeed, premium-priced TEREA consumables have been the fastest-growing launch in the small free category reaching an offtake share in the 3 main convenience store shares change of 8% within 3 months of national launch and driving the growth of the (inaudible) category following the October tax-driven price increase.\nEarly results in Switzerland have been even more remarkable with over 1/3 of sales to new user and TEREA making up over 1/3 of HD sales after only 2 months of commercialization. Our HTU share growth has accelerated accordingly from 6% in September to 7.9% in December. These results are very encouraging for the wider rollout of ILUMA in the EU region and around the world, and we plan to roll out gradually to more markets this year, mostly in H2.\nWhile we continue to manage device supply constraints, the unprecedented growth in Japan also means we have had to accelerate both the supply of TEREA consumable using airfreight and the conversion of our production line to support new market launches. With ILUMA, IQOS and (inaudible) of 3 (inaudible) technology under the iQOS umbrella to serve different consumer needs and segment the market. We have an exciting pipeline of innovation on devices and consumables across our technology at different price tiers.\nAs I mentioned, we also plan to enhance our portfolio for future growth with the introduction of a new complementary technology towards the end of this year. This will be targeted at smokers in low and middle income market, catering to the consumer need of simple high-quality, affordable devices and consumable and specific local test performances.\nIn terms of HTUs, after launching over 15 new ILUMA SKUs in Q4, we plan to continue expanding our portfolio across platforms, geography and price point this year. We continue to commercialize IQOS VEEV with very promising results in the first group of markets where we started in our own channel with a limited range of test variants and nicotine levels. ICOS VEEV is a premium product, providing a superior experience and the commercial faster of IQOS allows us to deploy efficiently and our scale through a bespoke route-to-market approach.\nAs we start to expand distribution and the consumable offering, we observed signs of increased uptake and clear positive consumer feedback relative to competitive product. We see encouraging success in Italy and the Czech Republic, reaching double-digit offtake shares of close to 10 points with rapid progress also visible in Croatia within 3 months of launch. After launching in Canada and Ukraine in the fourth quarter, we plan to add more markets in 2022 with timing subject to device availability. We also continued preparation to apply for a PMTA from the U.S. FDA and now prudently assume readiness for filing in early 2023, given further clarity on the required preparatory steps.\nAn additional exciting midterm growth opportunity is in the nicotine pouch category, where we aim to become a leading player with a hero brand. nicotine pouches provide convenient smoke-free alternative for adult smokers. And while still early in many markets, we see so playing an important role in our smoke-free portfolio over the coming years.\nFollowing the acquisition of AG Snus and Fertin Pharma, we have established a base of product development and manufacturing expertise. Although we are still learning about the promising category, our IQOS commercial infrastructure allows for a fast rollout and we plan a number of launches over the coming quarters.\nThe first major activity is the full relaunch of the revitalized Hero portfolio in the Nordic this month from its more limited prior presence with full commercial activity and a broad portfolio of flavors and strength variance. Separately, following feedback from the 2021 consumer test of our Platform 2 carbon product, the design of our current technology has been discontinued. We are assessing alternative design for this consumer segment.\nTurning now to our nascent business beyond nicotine, the 2021 acquisition of 13 Vectura and OtiTopic provide the base for building critical respiratory and overall product development capabilities in tandem with our existing expertise. This opened up opportunity to deliver the positive effect of existing wellness and healthcare molecules in a fast and effective manner. For the time being, our reported number in the other segment showed the existing acquired business, which delivered $101 million in net revenue in the fourth quarter and a marginal operating loss of $1 million. The underlying performance is in line with our expectation with reported operating expenses reflecting the amortization of intangible, deal-related items and our planned investments. Around 39% of Q4 revenue were derived from 13 smoking cessation product and nicotine pouch operations.\nWhile we intend to continue the CDMO activities of the acquired companies, the most significant value to PMI is in this ability to develop and commercialize new products in the wellness and healthcare segment over time. We plan important R&D investment over the course of the coming years to support the aim of delivering meaningful incremental revenue starting 2 to 3 years from now as we pursue our ambition of at least $1 billion of net revenue from wellness and healthcare products by 2025.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we expect an operating loss of around $150 million in 2022, with revenue of around $250 million, including smoking cessation products. We recognized investor interest in our future product line in these new areas and plan to provide more color at our CAGNY conference presentation on February 23.\nMoving to sustainability and our ESG priorities. I'm happy to share that we recently completed a new sustainability feasibility assessment to update and recalibrate our priorities in accordance with our biggest impact on society, double maturity and extensive stakeholder inputs. While addressing the health impact of our product remained by far the biggest focus, we also identified a number of topics, which are emerging in importance or required an evolved approach. We will publish the results next week. It is increasingly important to align management incentives with sustainability materiality, performance and impact. We will strengthen this link in 2022 with the new sustainability index and plan to provide more details in the near future.\nOur progress on sustainability continues to be recognized by leading external stakeholders with repeated inclusion in both the Dow Jones Sustainability Index North America and the Bloomberg Generic Quality Index. And receiving CDP's AAA score for the second year running. We also published an agricultural labor practices report, making 10-year -- marking 10 years of the program. Since its introduction, we have successfully eradicated systemic issue related to child labor, while improving living condition of farmers and farm workers. It also outlined our ambition targets such as 100% farmers supplying tobacco to PMI, making the leasing income by 2025.\nOn our most critical priority of product impact, the grown penetration of smoke-free products around the world is accelerating the end of cigarettes as legal age smokers reach to better alternative. I am also pleased to report further recent positive regulatory development. For example, as part of its beating cancer plan, the European Parliament special committee recognized and featured harm reduction in its last report for which the plenary vote will take place next week.\nIn New Zealand, the government published its more action plan, expressly excluding small free product from the proposed measures. In addition, the number of countries, including Poland and Russia have announced new multiyear excise tax plan with taxation of smoke-free products clearly differentiated from cigarettes, making 15 markets globally with such plans.\nThere is a growing body of scientific and real-world evidence of the substantial reduction potential of smoke-free product compared with smoking. While challenges in some markets are to be expected, we continue to support regulatory and fiscal framework that recognize this critical arm reduction opportunity.\nI will now turn back to Jacek for some concluding remarks.\n\nJacek Olczak\n\nCEO & Director, Philip Morris International Inc.\n\nThank you, Emmanuel. Overall, we are very pleased to have delivered excellent growth in last year in 2021 with a strong underlying momentum for IQOS as well as the record adjusted EPS, net revenues and cash generation. In the consistent quality and sustainability of our organic top and bottom line delivery has been clearly demonstrated over the last 2 years, which I believe we all acknowledge with pretty to volunteers. With an improving outlook for device supply, although still were an element of agility, the exceptional initial success of ILUMA and the number of innovations and growth initiatives. We look forward to 2022 with a tremendous excitement.\nAt the same time, we're building -- we will be building our development capabilities in wellness and healthcare for targeted investment in order to support the next driver of our long-term growth. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have increased cash returns to shareholders through a higher dividend and our share repurchase program, in line with our objective to deliver sustainable value and returns to investors as we continue our smoke transformation. In short, we continue to see a bright future of our business. Following a very strong 2021, we remain confident in our '21 to '23 growth targets and in our ambition to be majority smoke-free by net revenues in 2025.\nThank you all for your attention. Emmanuel and myself will be happy to answer your questions.",

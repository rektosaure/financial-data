Welcome to the Synchrony Financial Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website. During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.\nFinally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong financial performance in the third quarter of 2025 that included net earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.86 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 3.6% and a return on tangible common equity of 30.6%. We generated $46 billion of purchase volume in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of plus 2% as trends across our 5 platforms improved even as the effects of our previous credit actions continue to impact average active accounts.\nSpend across our digital platform increased 5%, driven by higher spend per account and reflecting strong customer response to our enhanced product offerings and refresh value propositions. Diversified value purchase volume grew 3%, reflecting strong retailer performance and growth in out of partner spend. Purchase volume in health and wellness also grew 3%, reflecting growth in pet and audiology, partially offset by lower spend in cosmetics.\nMeanwhile, purchase volume in home and auto was down 1%, generally due to selective spending in home specialty and purchase volume in our lifestyle platform was down 3%, reflecting lower spend in Outdoor & Specialty as consumers continue to manage discretionary spend. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 46% of total purchase volume in the third quarter, an increase plus 8% versus last year, driven by higher broad-based spend across these card programs and Synchrony's branded general purpose card.\nOut to partner spend on our Dual and co-branded cards generally reflected year-over-year improvement in the mix of discretionary spend as the quarter progressed, with continued points of strength coming from restaurants and electronics. And as highlighted on Slide 3 of our earnings presentation, average transaction values for the portfolio were approximately 40 basis points higher than last year, building on the improving trend over the last 4 quarters. This trend occurred across all credit grades and generations within our portfolio, with particular strength coming from nonprime, pointing to the efficacy of our credit actions as we strengthen the mix of that cohort.\nCustomers of [indiscernible] credit grades and generations also increased their spend frequency during the third quarter, up about 3.4%. Collectively Synchrony's portfolio spend trends suggest that the utility and value we offer for a variety of product offerings are resonating with our customers and driving stronger engagement as they navigate the continued uncertainty in the broader environment. We are a trusted partner to almost 70 million customers, many of the nation's most respected brands and hundreds of thousands of small and midsized businesses across the country. It is both a privilege and an opportunity to connect them through our financial ecosystem and empower them with financial flexibility and choice. And given how our credit actions have outperformed our expectations, we've begun gradually reversing some of our tightening in areas where we see strong risk-adjusted growth opportunities. We're monitoring our portfolio closely and expect to make similar incremental adjustments gradually over the coming months as supported by broader macroeconomic conditions.\nIn the meantime, Synchrony has continued investing in our business and executing across our strategic priorities. We added renewed or expanded more than 15 partners during the third quarter, including the TORO Company, Regency showrooms, LOWE's commercial program, including the pending acquisition of its co-branded credit card portfolio, and dental intelligence.\nSynchrony's launch of the TORO Company credit card to deliver a variety of our promotional financing options to their extensive network of independent dealers across the outdoor environment solution space. Our multiyear renewal with Regency Furniture provides access to Synchrony financing across more than 95 furniture stores across the Northeast under the brand names of Regency, Marlow, Value City of New Jersey and Ashley. And Synchrony is also proud to build on our more than 45-year relationship with Lowe's by enhancing our existing commercial program and acquiring our commercial co-branded credit card portfolio. We look forward to relaunching the Lowe's Business Rewards credit card with enhanced value and a seamless customer experience as we help Lowe's pros pay for the tools and supplies they need.\nIn addition, we announced our strategic partnership with Dental Intelligence, a leading patient relationship management and analytics platform used by over 9,000 dental practices. That joined Synchrony's more than 40 health care software solution partnerships designed to strengthen patient provider relationships and enhance practice operations through innovative technology. Our new seamless integration was done to our credit financing options, including hair credit status tool. Providers can offer CareCredit to patients more intuitively through simple automated payment communications and make it easier for patients to understand their payment options.\nOur integration process is faster and more efficient than ever, strengthening care processes, driving administrative efficiency and empowering patients to get the care they need when insurance is not sufficient. Synchrony's recent acquisition of versatile credit is yet another example of how we are driving expanded access to flexible financing while also enhancing the value we deliver to small and midsized businesses across the country. Versatile is a leading multisource financing platform with more than 30 integrated lenders across the full credit spectrum that helps merchants and providers empower their customers with smarter financing options across online, in-store and mobile point of sale. They're able to deliver seamless integrations, higher approval rates and detailed reporting to drive sales across home, auto and elective medical merchants and providers.\nMoving forward, Versatile we'll continue to operate its existing business strategy and maintain its data integrity to continue to provide financing through their existing lender integrations for their merchants. Synchrony will receive referral revenue and leverage our scale and underwriting expertise in combination with Versatile's innovative technology to accelerate our embedded finance strategy. And while we do not expect versatile to be material to Synchrony's near-term financial performance, we do expect our collaboration to contribute to Synchrony's profitable growth for years to come.\nLastly, albeit early, the momentum and execution in the first month of our Walmart program launch is off to a great start and the initial results have been very encouraging. We believe that the combination of such a compelling value proposition, innovative customer experience and highly prominent product placement should position this product as a top-of-wallet card and drive deeper engagement for Walmart customers across the country.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's third quarter financial results were highlighted by continued strength in our credit performance and acceleration of our purchase volume trends which was broad-based across our 5 sales platforms and all generations. We generated $46 billion of purchase volume during the third quarter, which was up 2% year-over-year and continue to be affected by the credit actions we took between mid-2023 and early 2024 and continued selectivity in customer spend behavior. Ending loan receivables decreased 2% to $100 billion in the third quarter due to the combination of lower prior period purchase volume and average active accounts as well as higher payment rate.\nThe payment rate increased by approximately 60 basis points versus last year to 16.3% and was approximately 120 basis points above the pre-pandemic third quarter average. Net revenue of $3.8 billion was flat versus last year as higher net interest income was offset by higher RSAs driven by program performance. Our net interest income increased 2% to $4.7 billion reflecting a 14% decrease in interest expense, partially offset by a 16% lower interest income on investment securities.\nOur third quarter net interest margin increased 58 basis points versus last year to 15.62%. There are 2 key drivers of this net interest margin improvement. One, a 58 basis point decline in our total interest and liabilities costs versus last year, which contributed approximately 49 basis points to our net interest margin; and two, a 35 basis point increase in our loan receivables yield which contributed approximately 29 basis points to our net interest margin. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes or PPPs, partially offset by lower benchmark rates and lower SaaS late fees. These improvements were partially offset by another 2 key drivers of net interest margin.\nOne, an 88 basis point reduction in our liquidity portfolio yield which reduced our net interest margin by 14 basis points. The decline generally reflected the impact of lower benchmark rates; and two, a 35 basis point decrease in the mix of loan receivables as a percent of interest-earning assets which reduced our net interest margin by approximately 6 basis points.\nMoving on. RSEs of $1 billion were 4.07% of average loan receivables in the third quarter and increased $110 million versus the prior year, primarily reflecting program performance, which included lower net charge-offs and the impact of our PPPCs. Other income increased 7% year-over-year to $127 million which include the impact of PPPC related fees. Provision for credit losses decreased $451 million to $1.1 billion driven by $255 million and a reserve release of $152 million versus a build of $44 million in the prior year. The current year reserve release included the impact of a $45 million reserve build for the pending acquisition of the lowest commercial co-brand credit card portfolio, which is expected to close during the first half of 2026.\nOther expense increased 5% to $1.2 billion generally reflecting higher employee costs and costs related to technology investments, partially offset by preparatory expenses related to the proposed late fee rule change in the prior year. The third quarter efficiency ratio was 32.6%, approximately 140 basis points higher than last year due to higher overall expenses and the impact of higher RSAs on net revenue as credit performance improved.\nTaken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $1.1 billion or $2.86 per diluted share and delivered a return on average assets of 3.6% or return on tangible common equity of 30.6% and a 16% increase in tangible book value per share.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.39%, a decrease of 39 basis points from 4.78% in the prior year and 23 basis points below our historical average for the third quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our [indiscernible] plus delinquency rate was 2.12%, a decrease of 21 basis points from 2.33% in the prior year, in line with our historical average from the third quarter of 2017 to 2019 and our net charge-off rate was 5.16% in the third quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points from the 6.06% in the prior year and 7 basis points above our historical average for the third quarter of 2017 to 2019. Net charge-off dollars were down 8% sequentially. This compares favorably to the 2017 to 2019 average sequential dollar decline of 7%.\nWhen evaluating our credit performance, our portfolio delinquency and net charge-off trends reflect both the efficacy of our credit actions and the power of our disciplined underwriting and credit management strategies. These trends reinforce our confidence in our portfolio's credit positioning as we move forward and provides a strong foundation for us to execute our business strategy.\nFinally, our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.35%, which decreased approximately 24 basis points from 10.59% in the second quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the third quarter, Synchrony's direct deposits remained sequentially flat as broker deposits declined by $2.4 billion. At quarter end, deposits represented 85% of our total funding, with unsecured debt representing 7% and secured debt representing 8%. Total liquid assets decreased 7% to $18.2 billion, and represented 15.6% of total assets, 94 basis points lower than last year.\nMoving to our capital ratios. Synchrony ended the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%, [indiscernible] 13.1%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.9%, 60 basis points higher than last year. Our total capital ratio increased 60 basis points to 17%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio increased to 25.1% compared to 24.5% last year.\nDuring the third quarter, Synchrony returned $971 million to shareholders, consisting of $861 million in share repurchases and $110 million in common stock dividends. Recognizing the strength of our balance sheet, our strong capital generation capacity and resilience of our business from both our sophisticated underwriting and retailer share arrangements, Synchrony's Board approved an incremental $1 billion in share repurchases in September, bringing our total authorization to $2.1 billion at the end of the third quarter. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and our capital plan.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025 on Slide 10. Our baseline assumptions for the full year outlook continue to include minor modifications we made to our PPPCs this year as well as our September launch of a Walmart One Pay program. Exclude any potential impacts from a deteriorating macroeconomic environment or from the implementation of tariffs and potential retaliatory tariffs as the effects remain unknown and now also included the acquisition of Versal Credit which is not expected to have a material impact on our 2025 financial performance.\nFocusing on our outlook in more detail. We continue to expect flat ending receivables versus last year, reflecting the ongoing impact of selective customer spend and the continued effect of our past credit actions on purchase volume and payment rate. the latter which remains elevated relative to our pre-pandemic average. While we made certain modifications to our credit strategy in the third quarter and expect to make further adjustments in the fourth quarter, we do not expect them to have a material effect on growth in 2025. While our past credit actions have been traded to higher payment rate and slower loan receivables growth over the short term, they have meaningfully strengthened our portfolio's credit performance. We now expect our loss rate to be between 5.6 and 5[indiscernible] of our long-term underwriting tort of 5.5% to 6%. The combination of higher payment rates and improved credit outlook is contributing to lower interest and fees, which is expected to reduce net interest income and result in RSAs between 3.95% and 4.05% of receivables and net revenue between $15 billion and $15.1 billion. We expect our net interest margin to increase and average approximately 15.7% for the full second half of 2025 and reflecting lower funding costs due to lower benchmark rates, partially offset by lower-yielding investment portfolio and an increasing mix of loan receivables as a percent of earning assets, driven by the impact of seasonal growth and a continued reduction of our excess liquidity.\nAnd lastly, we're updating our efficiency ratio expectation between 33% and 33.5%, primarily reflecting the updated net revenue outlook. We continue to expect other expenses to increase approximately 3% on a dollar basis for the full year, which includes the Walmart program launch costs.\nIn summary, Synchrony's outlook for 2025 demonstrates the strength of our distinctive business model and delivers net interest margin expansion, stronger delinquency formation and net charge-offs and continued performance alignment through the RSA. This will drive higher risk-adjusted return and return on average assets that exceeds our long-term target of 2.5%.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Before I turn the call over to key [indiscernible] takeaways from today's discussion. First, the combination of Synchrony's credit expertise, discipline and credit actions have enhanced the resilience of our portfolio creating a strong foundation on which to grow in 2026 and beyond. We're encouraged by the trends we've seen in our customers and our portfolio and are optimistic that we will continue to adjust our credit actions subject to macroeconomic conditions.\nSecond, Synchrony is executing on our key strategic priorities to grow and win new partners, diversify our programs, products and markets and deliver best-in-class experiences for all those we serve. And as we continue to elevate the ways in which we connect our customers with our partners, providers and merchants, we're driving greater utility and value and deepening our position at the heart of American commerce. And third, Synchrony's differentiated business model, consistent prioritization of growth at strong risk-adjusted returns and robust capital generation position us uniquely well to drive considerable long-term value for our many stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Catherine to open the Q&A."

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you.

The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance.

The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered a strong financial performance in the second quarter of 2025 that included net earnings of $967 million or $2.50 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 3.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.3%. Despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, we executed at a high level across our strategic priorities to drive value for our many stakeholders. Synchrony's diversified portfolio of products and spend categories, industry-leading value propositions and expansive network of distribution channels enabled us to connect approximately 70 million Americans with a broad range of small and midsized businesses and national brands.\nIn our continued credit discipline and previous credit actions drove better-than-expected delinquency and net charge-off performance reinforcing our ability to drive sustainable growth and strong risk-adjusted returns as we look forward. And while our credit actions, in combination with selective consumer spend behavior, have had a short-term impact on our year-over-year growth in purchase volume and receivables, we have begun to see some encouraging signs within the portfolio.\nSynchrony generated $46 billion of purchase volume in the second quarter. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 45% of that purchase volume and increased 5% versus last year, primarily reflecting growth from our CareCredit Dual Card as well as broad-based growth across our other dual card programs. Outer partner spend on our Dual and co-branded cards generally continue to reflect a discerning customer with the mix of discretionary spend down slightly compared to last year. That said, we saw a gradual growth in the mix of discretionary spend as the quarter progressed with points of strength coming from restaurants, cosmetics and electronics.\nWe also saw continued improvement in average transaction values during the second quarter, which were down only about 50 basis points compared to last year, a clear improvement from the 1.7% decline in the first quarter and a 2.4% decline in the fourth quarter. Customers across credit grades contributed to this trend, but particular strength came from our nonprime credit segment. Customers across credit grids continue to transact with relatively consistent frequency over the last several quarters, up about 3% in the second quarter versus last year, which partially offset the impact of lower transaction values.\nOverall, we feel good about the resilience we've seen in our customers thus far, and we'll continue to leverage our core strength as we navigate this operating environment. Of course, Synchrony has built a long track record of driving powerful outcomes for our customers and partners with constantly changing market conditions. This has earned us both the opportunity and privilege to be a partner of choice for hundreds of thousands of businesses across the country.\nAnd during the second quarter, we added or renewed more than 15 partners including the addition of our program with Walmart and OnePay and our renewed relationship with Amazon. We are proud to announce our partnership with OnePay, a leading consumer fintech to exclusively power a new industry-leading credit card program with Walmart, one of the most iconic and largest retailers in the world. Together, we will leverage our respective expertise to launch a general purpose card and a private label card, both featuring a seamless digital experience embedded inside the OnePay app and compelling value propositions. We expect the program to launch this fall and are excited to deliver even greater innovation and choice to better serve the millions of consumers that seek to maximize our purchasing power.\nSynchrony's new relationship with Amazon builds on more than 15 years of collaboration and financing innovation, which is why we are also proud to announce our recently completed launch of Synchrony Pay Later at Amazon. Our Buy Now Pay Later offering is available for all transactions of $50 or more for approved Amazon customers.\nSynchrony continuously seeks to evolve and enhance the customer experience and the ways in which we drive utility and choice for our customers and loyalty and sales for our partners. And in today's world, that often means providing access to flexible financing anywhere that a customer is seeking to make a purchase, whether that's online or in person.\nOne of our offerings with PayPal called PayPal Credit has been a popular choice among consumers for many years and historically has been a digital-only product. Over the last several years, however, we've seen increasing demand for a physical PayPal credit card so that customers could utilize their favorable financing more broadly in their day-to-day lives. Together, PayPal and Synchrony sought to deliver a more innovative payment solution that would enable our customers to take PayPal Credit anywhere and still have access to 6-month promotional financing on qualifying PayPal purchases.\nWe are currently rolling out the physical PayPal credit card to U.S. customers, which can be added to mobile wallets for fast and easy tap to pay and includes a limited time promotional offer to pay for qualifying travel purchases like flights, hotels, cruises and ride shares.\nAs we look ahead, Synchrony is in a position of strength. We've been consistently executing across our business to reinforce our resilience amidst an ever-changing economic backdrop. We've been investing in our continued evolution to deliver the right products at the right time and for the right purchases as customer preferences and needs change. We are also driving customer loyalty, sales and lifetime value for the many small and midsized businesses, local merchants and providers and major national brands that we serve.\nIn the last quarter alone, Synchrony launched new products with 2 of our top 5 partners and announced a new partnership with a previous top 5 partner. We also renewed one of our topline partners. With this renewal, the current exploration date of our program agreements with our 5 largest partners range from 2030 through 2035. In addition, 22 of Synchrony's 25 largest program agreements have an expiration date in 2027 or beyond, and those 22 programs represent 98% of our interest and fees attributable to the top 25 as of year-end '24.\nSynchrony is clearly building upon our long track record of delivering truly differentiated outcomes for our many stakeholders and solidifying our position as the partner of choice within the heart of American commerce.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter performance showcased the strength of our differentiated business model, which has been built to deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns through evolving market conditions. We generated $46 million of purchase volume during the second quarter, which was down 2% year-over-year and include the effects of the credit actions we took between mid-2023 and early 2024 and continued selectivity in consumer spend behavior. Purchase line at the platform level range between down 7% year-over-year in [indiscernible], reflecting discerning customer spend and [indiscernible] uncertain macroeconomic backdrop and up 2% in digital as growth in both new accounts and spend per active was partially offset by lower average active accounts.\nEnding room receivables decreased 2% to $100 billion in the second quarter due to the combination of lower purchase volume and higher payment rate. The [indiscernible] rate increased by approximately 30 basis points versus last year to 16.3% and was approximately 100 basis points above the pre-pandemic second quarter average. The higher payment rate primarily reflects the impact of our previous credit actions, which contributed to approximately 1.5 percentage point sequential increase in our super prime credit card mix and an almost equivalent decrease in the proportion of nonprime.\nPayment rate was also impacted by a reduction in the percentage of promotional financing loan receivables, which generally carry a lower payment rate. We expect the mix shift to gradually revert to the historical mean over time. Net revenue decreased 2% to $3.6 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of higher RSAs driven by program performance. Net interest income increased 3% to $4.5 million as a 10% decrease in interest expense and a 1% increase in interest and fees on loans was partially offset by lower interest income on investment securities.\nOur second quarter net interest margin increased 32 basis points versus last year to 14.78%. The increase was driven in part by a 53 basis point increase in our loan receivable yield which was primarily driven by the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes or PPPC and partially offset by lower benchmark rates and lower SaaS late fees. This contributed to approximately 43 basis points of our net interest margin.\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities cost decreased 45 basis points versus last year and contributed approximately 38 basis points to our net interest margin. Our liquidity portfolio yield declined 95 basis points, generally reflecting the impact of lower benchmark rates and reduced our net interest margin by 16 basis points. In our loan receivables mix, as a percentage of interest earning assets decreased by 194 basis points, which reduced our net interest margin by approximately 33 basis points. [indiscernible] $992 million were 4.1% of average loan receivables in the second quarter and increased $182 million versus the prior year, primarily reflecting program performance which included lower net charge-offs and the impact of our PPPs and other income increased 1% year-over-year to $118 million, driven by the impact of our PPPC related fees and partially offset by the $51 million gain from the DSA B1 share exchange in the prior year.\nExcluding the impact of this gain, other income would have increased 79% versus last year. Provision for credit losses decreased $545 million to $1.1 billion, driven by a $265 million reserve release in the second quarter compared to the prior year reserve build of $70 million and a $210 million decrease in net charge-offs. Including the reserve relief is $12 million relating to the movement of approximately $200 million in loan receivables to held for sale. Other expenses increased 6% to $1.2 billion, generally reflecting higher employee costs, partially offset by lower operational losses and preparatory expenses related to the late [indiscernible] in the prior year.\nThe second quarter efficiency ratio was 34.1%, approximately 240 basis points higher than last year, driven by the higher expenses and the impact of higher RSAs on net revenue as credit performance improved. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $967 million or $2.50 per diluted share and delivered a return on average assets of 3.2% and return on tangible common equity of 28.3% and an 18% increase in tangible book value per share.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.18%, a decrease of 29 basis points from the 4.47% in the prior year and 10 basis points below our historical average from the second quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquentry was 2.06%, a decrease of 13 basis points from 2.19% in the prior year and 5 basis points above our historical average from the second quarter of 2017 to 2018. Our net charge-off rate was 5.7% in the second quarter, a decrease of 72 basis points from 6.42% in the prior year and 10 basis points below our historical average for the second quarter of 2017 to 2019.\nNet charge-off dollars were down 11% sequentially. This compares favorably to the 2017 to 2019 average sequential trend of essentially flat. And as highlighted on Slide 3 of our presentation, Synchrony sequential net charge-off trends have generally outperformed our quarterly average sequential movement between 2017 and 2019. When evaluating credit performance, our portfolio delinquency and net [indiscernible], reflect both the efficacy of our credit actions and the power of our disciplined underwriting and credit management and reinforce our confidence in the portfolio's credit positioning as we move forward.\nFinally, our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.59% which decreased approximately 28 basis points from the 10.87% in the first quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the second quarter, Synchrony's deposits decreased by approximately $310 million and brokered deposits declined by $863 million. At quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, with both secured and unsecured debt, each representing 8%. Total liquid assets increased 9% to $21.8 million and represented 18.1% of total assets, 145 basis points higher than last year.\nMoving to our capital ratios. Synchrony ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.6%, 100 basis points higher than last year's 12.6%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.8%, 100 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 110 basis points to 16.9%. In our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio increased to 25.2% compared to 23.9% last year.\nDuring the second quarter, Synchrony returned $614 million to shareholders, consisting of $500 million in share repurchases and $114 million in common stock dividends. Ticker remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and our capital plan.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025 on Slide 10. Our baseline assumption for the full year outlook now includes the minor modifications we expect to make to our PPPC this year as well as the impact of the launch of a Walmart OnePay program in the fall and exclude any potential impact from the deteriorating macroeconomic environment or from the implementation of tariffs or potential retaliatory cash as their effects remain unknown.\nTurning to our outlook in more detail. Our current expectation is that ending loan receivables will be flat versus last year. This expectation includes the continued impact of selective consumer spend and the ongoing effects of our past credit actions on purchase [indiscernible] payment rate. Previously, we expect pay rates to generally remain flat relative to 2024. However, we now expect to be elevated in 2025, reflecting the credit and promotional finance mix shift discussed earlier. While our past credit actions may have impacted our growth trajectory over the short term, they have [indiscernible] the strength and the trajectory of our portfolio's delinquency and net charge-off performance.\nWe now expect our loss rate to be between 5.6 and 5.8%, which is comfortably within our long-term underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%. This improved credit outlook will contribute to higher RSAs as partner program performance further improves. As a result, we now expect RSA as a percent of average receivables to be between 3.95% and 4.1% and which will also shift our net revenue outlook for the full year to be between $15 billion and $15.3 billion.\nNet interest income for the year will be impacted by lower receivables, but still expected to follow seasonal trends associated with growth credit performance and liquidity. We expect our net interest margin to increase to an average 15.6% in the second half of 2025, reflecting improving loan receivable yield related to credit seasonality and the building impact of our PPPC, lower funding costs due to lower benchmark rates, partially offset by lower-yielding investment portfolio and an increasing mix of loan receivables as a percent of earning assets driven by the impact of seasonal growth and a gradual reduction of our excess liquidity.\nAnd lastly, we're updating our efficiency ratio expectation to be between 32% and 33%, primarily reflecting the updated net revenue outlook as well as higher expenses associated with the launch of the Walmart OnePay program. We expect other expenses to increase approximately 3% on a dollar basis for the full year. In summary, Synchrony's difference in business model is expected to deliver net interest margin expansion, lower net charge-offs and continued performance alignment to RSA this year. This will drive higher risk-adjusted return and a return on average assets that exceeds our long-term target of 2.5%.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Before I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways from today's discussion. First, Synchrony's credit trends have outperformed relative to the industry, which is underscored by our current year outlook. Our portfolio's credit position will provide a strong foundation on which we can grow and deliver strong risk-adjusted returns. While we have begun to selectively unwind some of our credit actions on the margin, we are closely monitoring the environment in our portfolio and are evaluating further actions as we gain more clarity.\nSecond, Synchrony's unique business model delivers industry-leading value propositions, a diverse product suite and advanced digital solutions, empowering customers with financial flexibility and driving loyalty and sales for businesses, and our interests are closely aligned when our customers thrive so to our partners.\nAnd third, Synchrony is the nationwide leader in the private label and co-brand industry. It is positioned to deliver market-leading returns for our shareholders. We consistently earn and win new and existing partners including more than 25 partners in the first half of 2025 alone. And we have built a long track record of execution through our intense focus on delivering outstanding outcomes for our customers and partners. This is what drives deep, long-lasting relationships and meaningful long-term value for all.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. ."

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered a strong financial performance in the first quarter of 2025 that included net earnings of $757 million or $1.89 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.5% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.4%. These results were driven by Synchrony's ability to leverage our core strengths in order to empower our customers with prudent financial flexibility and enduring value when they need it most, while also delivering loyalty and sales to the many partners, providers and small businesses that form the foundation of our economy.\nDuring the first quarter, Synchrony engaged with approximately 70 million customers and generated $41 billion of purchase volume. Year-over-year trends in both active accounts and purchase volume continued to be impacted by the credit actions that Synchrony previously implemented as well as continued moderation in customer spend as they navigated the challenges of affordability and economic uncertainty in their day-to-day lives. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 45% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 2%, generally reflecting the growth from our CareCredit Dual Card launch which began last year and has been contributing to out of partner spend ever since.\nPurchase volume at the platform level ranged from between down 1% and down 9% year-over-year. as customers generally remain selective in their discretionary spend and bigger ticket purchases, particularly in categories like furniture, dory, outdoor, dental and cosmetics.\nSlide 3 of our earnings presentation provides a closer look at our weekly purchase volume during the first quarter as well as the first 2 weeks of April. Our week-to-week sales were generally consistent throughout the quarter, as was the weekly variance to prior year, including in March when news of government layoffs and tariffs began to intensify. And as you can see by the generational mix of weekly sales, we saw consistent engagement across the customer base throughout the quarter. with no discernible shift between generational cohorts. These portfolio spend trends, in combination with our credit actions contributed to the 2% year-over-year decline in ending receivables.\nFrom a payment behavior perspective, payment rate remained flat compared to last year but increased sequentially by 10 basis points, generally in line with pre-pandemic seasonality. This sequential increase in payment behavior occurred across all credit grades as the proportion of above minimum payments increased unless the minimum payments decreased. In aggregate, the proportion of lessen minimum payments on our portfolio remained below the 2017 to 2019 average across all credit segments. Synchrony monitors our customers' behavior very closely across our portfolio through a comprehensive set of real-time indicators and data points, which range from cash usage and utility payment data to credit bureau and auto payment changes. And when viewed in combination with the spend and payment behaviors we've observed, we believe that customers are continuing to manage their spending needs and payment obligations amidst the challenges of a persistent inflationary environment and an uncertain economic backdrop. Of course, our customers, partners and small and mid-sized businesses rely on Synchrony for access to financial products and flexibility with attractive value propositions and utility for wherever life may take them.\nOur track record of leveraging our proprietary data sophisticated underwriting and analytics, diverse product suite and channel distribution to drive sales and enhanced loyalty has reinforced Synchrony's position as the partner of choice, and we are proud of the consistently strong partner pipeline that has resulted from this execution.\nDuring the first quarter, Synchrony added or renewed more than 10 partners, including some country, Texas A&M veterinary hospital, Ashley, Discount Tire and American Eagle. Synchrony is always seeking opportunities to expand access to flexible financing across the wide range of spend categories we serve, particularly those where customers seek to maximize value. Our new co-brand program with Sun Country Airlines a Minnesota-based hybrid low-cost air carrier is a great opportunity to deliver compelling utility and rewards for flights throughout the United States and to destinations in Mexico, Central America, Canada and Caribe.\nWe have also continued to expand our CareCredit acceptance across the veterinary space and are excited to announce that CareCredit has been named a preferred financing partner for the Texas A&M University veterinary medical teaching hospital. This new partnership reflects a significant milestone in solidifying CareCredit's acceptance at all 29 public veterinary university hospitals in the country as well as Synchrony's commitment to supporting a veterinarian community and ensuring pet tons have access to care for their beloved pets.\nIn addition, our program renewal with Ashley, the #1 furniture selling brand in the U.S.A. and one of the world's largest furniture manufacturers, extends our nearly 15-year partnership. We are excited about the opportunity we see to help drive retail growth and enable customers to access flexible financing solutions to purchase quality furnishings that fit their lifestyle and budget. Meanwhile, our program renewal at Discount Tire will provide their millions of cardholders with access to expanded utility at over 1 million U.S. locations through the Synchrony Car Care network for automotive services and repairs as well as for purchases like insurance, gas, oil changes and more. And finally, we're proud to build on our nearly 30-year partnership with American Eagle Outfitters through a multiyear extension that will continue to deliver exceptional value, enhance the customer experience and deepen customer relationships.\nThe real rewards by American Eagle and [ Aerie ] loyalty program was recognized as one of America's best loyalty programs by Newsweek for the fifth consecutive year. and the Real Rewards credit card was named my Best Retail Credit card in-store rewards for 2025. These awards reflect our collective commitment to delivering value to loyal customers and driving growth and we look forward to expanding access to these industry-leading financial solutions.\nSo as we look to the remainder of 2025 and beyond, Synchrony remains in a position of strength. We are focused on executing across our strategic priorities, and maintaining our differentiated approach to serving our customers and partners. Synchrony's ability to optimize the outcomes for our many stakeholders has been made possible by the incredible people here at Synchrony who deeply understand their evolving needs and expectations. Our team approaches each opportunity to deliver best-in-class experiences with a passion and a commitment to excellence that is inspiring. That's why I'm so proud to share that Synchrony was named as the #2 best company to work for in the U.S. by Fortune Magazine and Great Places to Work. This recognition is a testament to our unique culture, our company values that our employees embody every day. And our unwavering dedication to keeping our people at the heart of all that we do. And as our team continues to drive innovation, expand access to flexible financing and deliver compelling results for all those we serve. We also remain focused on building our leadership position and driving significant long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance continued to demonstrate the strength of our differentiated business model, which has been built to deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns through evolving market conditions. We generated $41 billion of purchase volume during the first quarter, which was down 4% year-over-year when compared to a record first quarter last year include the effects of the credit actions we took between mid-2023 and early 2024, continued selectivity in customer spend behavior and one less day in the quarter, which had approximately 1% point impact.\nEnding loan receivables decreased 2% to $100 billion in the first quarter due to lower purchase volume. Our portfolio payment rate remained flat versus last year at 15.8% and was approximately 60 basis points above the pre-pandemic first quarter average. Net revenue decreased 23% to $3.7 billion, primarily reflecting the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale in the prior year. Excluding this impact, net revenue was essentially flat as lower interest expense and higher other income were offset by higher RSA. Net interest income increased 1% to $4.5 billion as a 7% decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a modest decline in interest income.\nOur first quarter net interest margin was 14.74% and increased 19 basis points compared to last year. The increase was driven in part by lower interest-bearing liabilities costs, which decreased 26 basis points versus last year and contributed approximately 25 basis points to our net interest margin. Our loan receivable yield grew 24 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes or PPPCs and partially offset by lower benchmark rates and lower assessed late fees. This contributed approximately 20 basis points to our net interest margin.\nOur liquidity portfolio yield declined 88 basis points, generally reflecting the impact of lower benchmark rates and reduced our net interest margin by 15 basis points. And the mix of our interest-earning assets decreased by 62 basis points and reduced our net interest margin by approximately 11 basis points. RSA is of $895 million or 3.59% of average loan receivables in the first quarter and increased $131 million versus the prior year, primarily reflecting the program performance which included the impact of our PPPCs. And other income decreased 87% year-over-year to $149 million due to the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale in the prior year.\nExcluding that impact, Other income increased 69% primarily driven by the impact of our PPPC related fees. Provision for credit losses decreased to $1.5 billion, driven by a $97 million reserve release in the first quarter compared to the prior year's reserve build of $299 million, which included $190 million reserve build related to our Allied Lending acquisition. Other expense increased 3% to $1.2 billion generally due to the costs associated with the technology investments and included a $15 million charitable contribution and a $12 million restructuring charge related to the Allied Lending business and the expected completion of its integration in the second quarter. Excluding the charitable contribution and the restructuring charging packs, other expense would have been up 1% versus last year.\nThe first quarter efficiency ratio was 33.4%, and approximately 110 basis points higher than last year when excluding the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $757 million or $1.89 per diluted share. and delivered an average return on assets of 2.5%, a return on tangible common equity of 22.4% and a 15% increase in tangible book value per share.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8, which highlights the efficacy of our credit actions that Symphony took from mid-2023 through early 2024, it gives us confidence in our portfolio trajectory towards our long-term net charge-off target of 5.5% to 6%. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency was 4.52%, and a decline of 22 basis points from 4.74% in the prior year and 4 basis points below our historical average for the first quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.29%, a decrease of 13 basis points from 2.42% in the prior year and 1 basis point above our historical average for the first quarter of 2017 to 2019. And our net charge-off rate was 6.38% in the first quarter, an increase of 7 basis points from 6.31% in the prior year and 54 basis points above our historical average in the first quarter of 2017 to 2019.\nNet charge-off dollars were down 4% sequentially. This compares favorably to the 2017 to 2019 average sequential increase of 9%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.87%, which increased approximately 43 basis points from the 10.44% in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 9. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continues to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the first quarter, Synchrony grew our direct deposits by approximately $1.7 billion and reduced our broker deposits by $338 million. In addition, we executed both secured and unsecured deals and attractive credit spreads when compared to historical deals. In the secured market, we issued $750 million of 3-year bonds with a coupon of 4.78%. In the unsecured market, we issued $800 million of 6-year non-call 5-year note at a coupon of 5.45%.\nWe also achieved a credit rating upgrade from Fitch, holding our long-term issuer default rating up to BBB with a stable outlook. We are proud of this rating action as it reflects Synchrony's strong balance sheet the resiliency of our business model and strong execution as a public company over a decade since our IPO. At quarter end, deposits represented 83% of our total funding was secured and unsecured debt representing 9% and 8%, respectively. Total liquid assets increased 9% to $23.8 million and represented 19.5% of total assets 12 basis points higher than last year.\nMoving to our capital ratios. As a reminder, Synchrony elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. We made our final transitional adjustment of approximately 50 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics in January 2025. Our capital metrics now fully reflect the phasing effects of CECL. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, 60 basis points higher than last year's 12.6%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.4%, 60 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 70 basis points to 16.5%. In our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 25.1% compared to 23.8% last year.\nDuring the first quarter, Synchrony completed our existing share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025, and returned $697 million to shareholders, consisting of $600 million in share repurchases and $97 million in [ Collin ] stock dividends. Given our strong capital position, we announced today that as part of our capital plan, a board approved a new share repurchase authorization of $2.5 billion for the period ending June 30, 2026, and increased our regular quarterly dividend by 20% to $0.30 per common share beginning in the second quarter of 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan.\nTurning to our baseline outlook for 2025 on Slide 10. Given the court order entered last week in the litigation and ultimately vacate [indiscernible] rule, Synchrony will begin the process of assessing next steps and engaging with the partners regarding the performance of our implemented PPPCs to determine if any adjustments are warranted. Our baseline assumptions exclude any potential impact from the changes to the PPPCs as well as any potential impact from a deteriorating macroeconomic environment or from the implementation of tariffs and retaliatory tariffs as they are unknown at this point.\nTurning to our outlook in more detail. We continue to expect purchase volume growth to be impacted by our previous credit actions and selective customer spend behavior that payment rate will remain generally in line with 2024 levels. As a result, we are maintaining our full year expectation of low single-digit growth in ending loan receivables. We continue to expect net revenue between $15.2 million and $15.7 billion for the full year. Net interest income is expected to follow seasonal trends associated with growth, credit performance and liquidity and will ultimately be determined by a number of factors, including year-over-year growth in both interest income and other income as the impact of our PPPC's build, partially offset by the [indiscernible] effect of lower average benchmark rates on our variable rate receivables. Lower assessed late fees as delinquency performance improves, a lower-yielding investment portfolio due to lower benchmark rates and finance charges and late reversals associated with the seasonality of our credit performance.\nLower average benchmark rates should also continue to contribute to lower funding costs as our CDE maturities reprice, although this will be influenced by competitive deposit beta trends in response to any additional rate cuts that may occur. In addition, we continue to expect higher level of liquidity in the second quarter given our desire to prioritize our deposit customer relationships and prefund future growth. We anticipate reducing our excess liquidity portfolio gradually as growth begins to build in the back half of the year. As a result, our liquid assets as a percent of total assets will average approximately 17% for the full year, which is higher than our historical average over the prior 3 years.\nWe now expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be between 3.70% and 3.85% driven by improving program performance as our net charge-off outlook has improved to be between 5.8% and 6.0%. Our revised net charge-off range expectation for the full year is now inside our long-term financial framework of 5.5% to 6%, driven by our prior credit actions and differentiated approach to underwriting and credit management. And lastly, we are maintaining our expectation of an efficiency ratio between 31.5% to 32.5%.\nBefore I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you three key takeaways from today's discussion. First, our customers have remained stable. They've been consistently making choices that align their day to day needs and seeing value and flexibility to prudently manage their financial situations amid an inflationary and highly fluid environment. Second, Synchrony's credit trends continue to outperform relative to the industry which is underscored by our current year outlook. Our sophisticated underwriting and credit management strategy have enabled a lower relative net charge-off peak than most of our peers and swifter expected return to our long-term target range. And while our credit actions create near-term impact on growth, our portfolio's credit position should provide greater long-term resilience as market conditions continue to evolve. And third, Synchrony's robust capital remains a clear strength. Our new capital plan reflects the confidence of our board and our company that Synchrony is well positioned to continue to drive progress towards our long-term financial targets and deliver significant long-term value for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kathryn to open to Q&A."

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to first take a moment to acknowledge all those who have been affected by the devastation of the California wildfires. Synchrony has colleagues, customers, partners and providers that were impacted. And while we do not expect a meaningful financial impact on our business, we are monitoring the situation closely and offering support in a number of ways to all those affected.\nMoving to Synchrony's fourth quarter performance. We added 5 million new accounts, generated $48 billion of purchase volume and grew ending loan receivables by 2%. In addition, we continue to see improvement in our portfolios year-over-year delinquency trends. Our RSA continued to align the interest of both Synchrony and our partners, and we maintain our cost discipline to deliver fourth quarter net earnings of $774 million or $1.91 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.6% and a return on tangible common equity of 23%. These fourth quarter results enabled a strong close to 2024 during which Synchrony acquired almost 20 million new accounts and financed more than $182 billion of purchase volume. This year marked our second highest level of purchase volume and serves as an important testament to the lasting appeal of our diverse and flexible financing solutions and compelling value propositions that we offer.\nSynchrony deeply understands the needs of our many stakeholders. And so even as customers became more discerning in their spending choices and the impacts of persistent inflation and our credit actions took hold as the year progressed, Synchrony leveraged our scale, our data analytics and deep lending expertise and our advanced digital capabilities to remain nimble and responsive in a rapidly changing environment. As a result, Synchrony generated full year 2024 net earnings of $3.5 billion or $8.55 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.9% and a return on tangible common equity of 27.5%.\nThe financial performance included both the positive and adverse impacts of several nonrecurring events in our business, ranging from the sale of 1 business and the acquisition of another to the undertaking of an unprecedented multiphase plan to prepare for a potential regulatory change with far-reaching implications for the consumer lending industry. And yet through all the complexities of these opportunities and amidst an ever-evolving landscape, Synchrony executed at a high level across all our key strategic priorities to optimize our business and position us for sustainable growth at strong risk-adjusted returns for the long term.\nDuring 2024, we added more than 45 new partners, including iconic brands like Virgin, Gibson and BRP as well as technology-oriented relationships like [ Adit ] practice management software and service Titan. Each of these additions further diversified the industry's products and services for which Synchrony can provide flexible financing solutions while also extending our customer reach. Synchrony also grew and expanded existing partnerships during the year with the renewal of more than 45 programs, including Verizon and Generac and more recently, 2 of our top 5 partners Sam's Club and JCPenney. We're excited to announce that in January, we renewed and extended our more than 30-year relationship with Sam's Club, which builds upon our strong focus of delivering member-centric digital experiences and value.\nSynchrony's partnership with JCPenney has also evolved over nearly 25 years through both collaboration and innovation as our customers' needs have changed. Our long-term program extension and expansion will now include the introduction of Synchrony Pay Later, our Buy Now Pay Later financing solution with 6-, 12- or 24-month installment payments. Customers can scan a QR code in store to complete an application on their own device, and is approved select their preferred financing option and make their purchase immediately.\nAnd just a Synchrony is evolving and expanding the ways in which we deliver value through partner programs we offer, we are also focused on diversifying the programs and markets we serve and the breadth and utility of the products we offer. In 2024, we completed the acquisition of the Ally Lending Business and are in the process of transitioning merchants to Synchrony Pay Later. We're excited to continue further developing our multiproduct capabilities and continue the expanded integration of this vertical in 2025.\nWe also finalized the sale of Pets Best, independent pet Holdings, and in addition to a significant financial gain, we extended our reach in the rapidly growing pet industry through an equity interest in IPH. We're excited about the recent launch of Better Together with CareCredit and Pets Best, a patent pending, simple and seamless innovation that connects the 2 solutions by directly reimbursing insurance claims to the CareCredit Health and Wellness card. We believe this streamlined payment process will deliver a unified experience for pet parents and support our growth in the pet care financing industry.\nAnd we launched CareCredit into wellness markets to finance fertility, nutrition and dietitian products and services, which supported almost 15% growth in wellness-related purchase volume during 2024. In addition, Synchrony enhanced the utility of a number of our private label credit cards by broadening their acceptance and expanding their distribution channels. An evolution made possible by the delivery of our financial ecosystem through more of our merchant acquirer partners. For example, the Amazon store card can now be used at all Whole Foods locations via mobile QR code and for 1 medical memberships. The results have exceeded expectations and build upon our strong foundation of acceptance, including Amazon.com, Amazon Pay and Audible.\nIn addition, CareCredit can now be used to pay for select health and wellness products and services across a growing list of approximately 18,000 retail acceptance locations, including Albertsons Companies, Sam's Club, Walgreens and Walmart. And in keeping with our strategy of broadening product utility, we continue to roll out our CareCredit Dual Card over the past year, which grew open accounts by 16%, thanks to its strong value proposition in utility, about 60% of this product's out of partner spend in 2024 was outside of traditional health and wellness categories.\nToday, Synchrony delivers a wide variety of innovative financing products and services that are designed to responsibly address each customer's needs whenever and however they are looking to make a purchase, an opportunity that is increasingly occurring digitally, whether that's on a mobile device or at the physical point of sale through wallet apps and digital payments.\nSo throughout the past year, Synchrony has been on a journey to bring our customer experience to life through more engaging and cohesive content across our digital footprint. From our native apps to our marketplace and website, we are expanding and deepening the role that Synchrony plays with our customers and partner relationships. In fact, through our efforts to expand Synchrony's digital presence, we've enhanced our cross-marketing capabilities and strengthen partner and product awareness for our customers. We're also seeing customers engage with Synchrony more extensively, visiting our sites more often and while they are engaging longer on our properties, this engagement has contributed to incremental new accounts and sales as well as lower acquisition costs.\nIn the case of Synchrony Bank, we've more than doubled the number of new Synchrony Bank accounts acquired through our synchrony.com website with almost no associated acquisition costs. And thanks to the combination of our dynamic technology platform, our advanced analytics and our scale with more than 140 million reported trade lines and trillions of customer and spend data points, we can leverage proprietary insights throughout our digital financial ecosystem and across the customer journey to deliver highly personalized and engaging experiences. Synchrony's Marketplace is a growing part of that financial ecosystem, and drives greater connectedness between our customers and partners.\nOver the last year, we've launched curated campaigns and differentiated offers to our Marketplace that contributed to more than 600 million impressions and 1 million referrals across participating partners. In addition, Marketplace hosted almost 228 million customer visits and drove more than 17% growth in newly submitted applications within marketplace.\nSynchrony's digital wallet strategy also made great strides in 2024, driving stronger engagement, utility and purchasing power for our customers. In fact, Synchrony's unique active wallet users grew 85% compared to 2023 and contributed to more than double the digital wallet sales in 2024. This growth also supported a more than 200 basis point improvement in our dual and co-brand cards wallet penetration rate, which should enhance the stickiness of these products and provide natural tailwinds to Synchrony's mobile wallet share as we continue to invest in this strategy.\nWe're also excited by the opportunities we see to drive our digital penetration further in 2025. This includes our recent announcement that eligible Synchrony Mastercard holders can now choose to pay with the standard terms of their credit card or use a promotional offer that includes fixed monthly payments when checking out with Apple Pay Online, an in-app on an iPhone or an iPad. This enhances the way users pay and provides them with more choice and flexibility. And we plan to expand on this Apple Pay integration even further later this year by bringing users the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony issued cards.\nSynchrony also plans to work with our Apple Pay-enabled partners to expand this capability across our portfolio. And if Synchrony continues to innovate and drive still greater financing experience and value for all those we serve, we're maintaining our discipline and leveraging our core strengths to sustainably grow and deepen our leadership position. Our sophisticated approach to customer lifetime value is driving incremental and deeper connections between approximately 70 million customers and hundreds of thousands of partners, providers in small and midsized businesses that we serve.\nOur diversified portfolio of products, programs and spend categories is empowering our customers with financing flexibility in whatever moment of life they're in. Our expansive distribution channels and omnichannel capabilities are increasingly delivering our financial ecosystem anywhere a purchase can be made. And our differentiated approach to underwriting and credit management is driving the stability of our portfolio's post-pandemic credit performance compared to most other lenders in the industry.\nAll of this has been made possible with an incredible team of people and culture that earned Synchrony, the honor of being ranked fifth among best companies to work for in the U.S. by Fortune magazine and Great Places to Work in 2024. So as we look to 2025 and beyond, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength. We're executing across our key strategic priorities and powering strong outcomes for the many stakeholders we serve. We're deepening our role within the heart of American Commerce and priming our business for profitable growth for years to come, and we're driving considerable long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's fourth quarter performance reflected the inherent resilience that comes from our diversified portfolio of products and spend categories, our balanced approach to underwriting and credit management and our sophisticated technology platform. This differentiated combination of strengths enable our business to swiftly adapt to the evolving landscape.\nDuring the fourth quarter, customers continue to seek out our flexible financing solutions as the strong value propositions and broad utility of our product offerings generate lasting value against a persistently inflationary environment. As a result, we added 5 million new accounts, maintained approximately 70 million active accounts and generated $48 billion of purchase volume despite the continued impact of the credit actions we took between mid-2023 and early 2024. Any receivables grew 2% to $105 billion as payment rates continue to moderate down approximately 10 basis points compared to last year.\nPurchase volume and receivables at the platform level reflected the continuation of the trends we discussed over the course of the year as customers remain selective in their spending behavior and generally prioritize nondiscretionary and seasonal holiday items. Platform purchase volume growth range between down 1% and down 6% year-over-year generally reflecting the lower spend per account as customers moderated both bigger ticket and discretionary spend, particularly in categories like furniture, electronics, cosmetic and outdoor as well as the impact of Synchrony's credit actions.\nReceivables growth across the platforms range from flat to 6% higher year-over-year, primarily due to slower purchase volume growth and payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 44% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 1%, reflecting the benefit of these products broad-based utility offset by the combined impacts of selected customer spend and Synchrony's credit actions.\nNet revenue grew 4% to $3.8 billion, resulting from higher interest and fees and higher other income, partially offset by higher RSA and interest expense. Net interest income increased 3% to $4.6 billion as interest and fees grew 3%, primarily reflecting higher interest and fees on loans, partially offset by an increase in interest expense from higher interest-bearing liabilities. Our loan receivables yield grew 8 basis points, primarily driven by our pricing actions, including the impact of our product, pricing and policy changes or PPPCs as well as lower payment rate, partially offset by higher reversals and a lower late incidents.\nTotal interest-bearing liabilities cost was 4.58%, an increase of 3 basis points versus last year. RSA of $919 million or 3.57% of average loan receivables in the fourth quarter and increased $41 million versus the prior year, primarily reflecting program performance, which includes the impact of our PPPC. Other income increased $128 million, primarily related to the impact of our PPPC related fees, which were partially offset by the impact of our Pets Best disposition.\nProvision for credit losses decreased to $1.6 billion, primarily reflecting a $100 million reserve release in the fourth quarter compared to a reserve build of $402 million in the prior year, partially offset by higher net charge-offs. Other expenses decreased 4% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by the prior year restructuring costs and other notable expenses as outlined on Slide 17 of our earnings presentation, and lower operational losses in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by costs related to the Ally Lending acquisition and technology investments. The efficiency ratio was 33.3% for the fourth quarter, an improvement of approximately 270 basis points versus last year, reflecting the combination of Synchrony's cost discipline and revenue growth. Taken together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $774 million or $1.91 per diluted share and delivered a return on average assets of 2.6%, return on tangible common equity of 23% and a 23% increase in tangible book value per share.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.70%, a decline of 4 basis points from 4.74% in the prior year and 8 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.40%, an increase of 12 basis points from 2.28% in the prior year and 16 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 6.45% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 87 basis points from 5.58% in the prior year and 96 basis points above our historical average from the fourth quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.44%, which decreased approximately 35 basis points from the 10.79% in the third quarter.\nAs shown on Slide 12, the credit actions we've taken from mid-2023 through early 2024 are improving our delinquency formation as the rate of year-over-year growth in both 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates continued to decelerate. These trends give us confidence in our ability to return to our long-term net charge-off target.\nTurning to Slide 13. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. During the fourth quarter, Synchrony grew our direct deposits by approximately $716 million and reduced our broker deposits by $938 million. At quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding with secured and unsecured debt, each representing 8% of total funding, respectively. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 billion, essentially flat versus last year and represented 16.6% of total assets, a 26 basis point decrease from last year.\nFocusing our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will make a final transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025, which will reflect the fully phased-in effects of CECL. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%, 110 basis points higher than last year's 12.2%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 14.5%, 160 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 160 basis points to 16.5%.\nIn our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 24.3% compared to 22.1% last year. Synchrony returned $197 million to shareholders during the fourth quarter, consisting of $100 million in share repurchases and $97 million in common stock dividends, totaling $1.4 billion of capital returned during the full year 2024. At year-end, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan.\nTurning to our outlook for 2025 on Slide 14, our baseline assumptions include a stable macroeconomic environment, full year GDP growth of 2.2%, a year-end employment rate of 4.1%, a year-end Fed funds rate of 4.25% and full year deposit base is approximately 60%. In addition, given the uncertainty with regard to the litigation process and the political landscape surrounding the [indiscernible] rule, our outlook assumes no impact from the potential late fee rule change, but does include the impact of our PPPCs. If the [indiscernible] rule were to go into effect, this outlook would no longer be applicable.\nStarting with ending loan receivables, we expect purchase volume and new account growth to continue to reflect the impacts of our credit actions and selective customer spend behavior. We also expect payment rate in 2025 to generally remain flat with 2024 levels as a result of our past credit actions, which have stabilized the mix of customer payment behaviors. As a result, we expect low single-digit growth in ending loan receivables for the full year 2025. We expect net revenue for the full year to be between $15.2 billion and $15.7 billion end of all seasonal trends. We expect the year-over-year growth in both interest income and other income as the impact of our PPPC's build, partially offset by the flow-through of lower average prime rate on our variable rate receivables, lower [indiscernible] as delinquency performance improves, lower-yielding investment portfolio due to lower benchmark rates and finance charge and late fee reversals associated with the seasonality of our credit performance.\nLower average benchmark rates should also contribute to lower funding costs as our CD maturities reprice, although this will be influenced by competitive deposit beta trends in response to any additional rate cuts that may occur. In addition, we generally expect to maintain higher levels of liquidity of approximately 17% for the next few quarters, given our desire to prioritize our deposit customer relationships and prefund future growth. Finally, RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables should be between 3.60% and 3.85% driven by improving program performance as net charge-offs declined and the impact of our PPPC's increase. We expect our portfolio net charge-off rate for the full year to be between 5.8% and 6.1%, primarily reflecting the benefit of our prior credit actions and our differentiated approach to underwriting and credit management. And we expect our efficiency ratio to be between 31.5% and 32.5% as Synchrony remains focused on driving operating leverage in our business.\nBefore I turn the call over to Q&A, I'd like to leave you with 3 key takeaways from today's discussion. First, Synchrony is well positioned to reaccelerate our growth. Our investments we've made and credit actions we've taken were designed to prioritize sustainable profitable growth through evolving market conditions. Our performance since exiting the pandemic in 2021 demonstrates our discipline with average ending loan receivables growth of approximately 9%, while delivering an average return on assets of approximately 3% and average return on tangible common equity of approximately 25%. Second, the outperformance of our portfolio's credit trends relative to the industry has enabled this track record and our recent delinquency formation trends give us confidence in both our credit outlook and our ability to reaccelerate profitable growth. We are watching for continued stability in the macro environment, more confident consumer spend behavior and continued improvement in our delinquency performance to support the gradual reversal of our credit restrictions.\nAnd third, Synchrony's robust capital position is a clear strength. It will enable our growth while also supporting greater capital returns to our shareholders in the years ahead.\nIn summary, Synchrony's high-level execution in 2024 has positioned us well for 2025 and beyond as we drive progress towards our long-term financial targets. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to 1 primary and 1 follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session."

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call.

The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong second quarter results including net earnings of $643 million or $1.55 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.2%. This performance is a testament to our differentiated business model. We continue to leverage our diversified portfolio of products and sales platforms, disciplined approach to credit underwriting and management and innovative digital capabilities to further progress on our strategic objectives and to deliver sustainable risk-adjusted growth and returns over the long term.\nCustomer demand for Synchrony's product and value propositions remained strong during the second quarter as Synchrony added 5.1 million new accounts grew average active accounts by 2%, generated $47 billion of purchase volume and delivered receivables growth of 8% compared to last year. Synchrony's proprietary data and analytics, in combination with our flexible financing solutions and dynamic technology platform, have been core drivers of our performance through evolving market conditions, particularly as we seek to responsibly address the needs of our customers and partners.\nAnd while our credit trends relative to pre-pandemic levels have outperformed most of the industry today, we have leveraged these strengths to take action in our portfolio where we have seen indications of higher probability of default. These credit actions, along with a more selectively spending consumer have contributed to lower new account and purchase volume growth in the second quarter but have also improved our recent delinquency trends and should strengthen our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2024 and beyond.\nAt the platform level, purchase volume and receivables trends were generally consistent in the second quarter. Purchase volume growth ranged from up 2% to down 3% year-over-year, broadly reflecting lower consumer spend on bigger ticket items, particularly in categories like furniture, jewelry and vision as well as the impact of the credit actions. Meanwhile, receivables growth across the platforms ranged from 6% to 15% higher versus last year, driven primarily by payment rate moderation. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 2%.\nSynchrony's out-of-partner spend gives us deeper insight into recent customer trends as the broad utility of our offerings and compelling value propositions attract purchases across a range of categories, industries and products. Our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases, particularly in larger ticket categories, such as home furnishings, travel and entertainment. They have been spending more restaurants though and continue to spend at the pharmacy and on health and wellness needs and contributing to nondiscretionary spend growth more broadly.\nThat said, our customers are spending slightly less per transaction across most categories and credit grades as average transaction values declined about 2% versus last year. Only our top credit segment saw growth in average ticket values during the second quarter. Customers across credit grades are transacting more frequently, however, which has generally offset most of the impact of lower transaction values. Altogether, we view these spend behaviors as appropriate and consistent with the payment rate moderation that began in our portfolio in 2023 and has continued sense.\nOver the first 6 months of 2024, however, the pace of this payment rate moderation has decelerated across credit grades. And according to the external deposit data we monitor, there continues to be relative stability in balances compared to the rapid tapering that occurred through the middle of last year. When taken together, we believe the spend, payment and savings trends support our view that consumers are making healthy decisions to actively manage their cash flows. And these trends, coupled with the impact of our credit actions, give us confidence that Synchrony's net charge-off rate should be lower in the second half of this year than in the first half.\nAs we continue to monitor the health of the consumer, our portfolio credit performance and that of the broader industry, synchrony is also utilizing our proprietary insights and lending expertise to position our business for sustainable risk-adjusted growth for many years to come. During the second quarter, we added or renewed more than 15 partners, including a program expansion and extension with Verizon and the addition of Virgin Red. We are excited about our continued partnership with Verizon and the opportunity we see to deliver maximum customer value on purchases made with Verizon.\nWe are also proud to be the exclusive issuer of Virgin Red's multi-category travel card, the first ever Virgin Red Rewards World Elite MasterCard, which will connect members across the Virgin family from flights to cruises, hotel and experiences with points that never expire. Cardholders will earn Virgin points on all their Virgin Red Rewards card spend, which can be used for a range of gifts and rewards, all while enjoying a first-rate digital experience from application to servicing.\nAnd as Synchrony continues to extend our reach and further optimize outcomes for both our customers and partners, we are incorporating strategic and technology-oriented partnerships to power more seamless digital experiences. Synchrony selectively works with second-look financing solutions to enhance the customer experience and our partner relationships. We recently announced an expanded relationship that will utilize a fully integrated solution spanning the full customer apply and buy experience across all points of sale. Synchrony will own the point-of-sale platform and connect to the second source provider in a way that's seamless to both the partner and the customer that's applying. This collaboration will utilize our innovative technology and data to responsibly expand access to credit to more consumers while also driving stronger loyalty and sales for the many small businesses, health care providers and retail partners we serve.\nMeanwhile, Synchrony launched our partnership with Installation Made Easy a leading enterprise software and services company that supports retail-based home improvement programs. This partnership will enable Floor & Decor cardholders to use our Synchrony-issued credit card to finance both the materials and the installation service required for their home improvement projects through one streamlined process. We're excited about the opportunity we see to strengthen our position in the home improvement market and plan to scale this capability to additional retailers over time.\nSo whether it's through the continued expansion of our distribution networks, the addition and renewal of programs that span most consumer spend categories or the enhanced functionality at point-of-sale, Synchrony is leveraging our proprietary data and analytics, our diverse product suite and our innovative technology to drive greater access, flexibility and utility for both our customers and partners.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results continue to demonstrate the resilience of our differentiated business model through an evolving environment. While consumers are managing their cash flows and consumption and the impact of our credit actions are beginning this season, we remain focused on driving sustainable risk-adjusted growth.\nTurning to our financial performance. Ending loan receivables grew 7.9% to $102 billion in the second quarter, benefiting from an approximately 80 basis point decrease in the payment rate and reflecting growth across each of our sales platforms. Net revenue increased 13% to $3.7 billion, reflecting higher interest and fees, lower RSA and an increase in other income. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.4 billion as interest and fees grew 10%, primarily reflecting growth in average loan receivables.\nOur loan receivable yield grew 14 basis points, benefiting from product repricing actions and lower payment rate, partially offset by the higher reversals as our net charge-offs increased. RSAs of $810 million in the second quarter were 3.21% of average loan receivables, down $77 million versus the prior year, driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. And the increase in other income primarily reflected a $51 million gain related to the exchange of our Visa B-1 shares as well as initial fee related impact of our product, pricing and policy changes, or PPPCs.\nThese benefits were partially offset by the impact of the Pets Best disposition. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.7 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $70 million reserve build. Our expenses grew 1% to $1.2 billion, which was driven by technology investments, preparatory expenses related to late fee rule change and servicing costs related to newly acquired businesses, partially offset by the operational losses and cost discipline resulting from lower employee and marketing costs. The preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule changes reflected $23 million of incremental costs related to both the execution of our PPPCs and the implementation of the rule itself should it become effective.\nEven with these incremental costs, Synchrony's efficiency ratio was 31.7% for the second quarter, an improvement of approximately 380 basis points versus last year. In sum, Synchrony generated net earnings of $643 million or $1.55 per diluted share. This produced a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 20.2%.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 9. At quarter end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.47% versus 3.84% in the prior year and 19 basis points above our historical average for the second quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.19% versus 1.77% last year and 18 basis points above our historical average in the second quarter of 2017 to 2018. And our net charge-off rate was 6.42% in the second quarter compared to 4.75% in the prior year and 62 basis points above our historical average from the second quarter of 2017 to 2019.\nOur allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.74%, up 2 basis points from 10.72% in the first quarter. The reserve build in the quarter primarily reflected loan receivable growth.\nAs shown on Slide 10, the credit actions we've taken thus far are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate of year-over-year growth continues to decelerate. We will continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance and a credit trends for the broader industry given our shared consumer, and we will take additional credit actions as necessary. While these actions are reducing new account and purchase volume growth in the short term, we expect they will strengthen our portfolio's positioning as we exit 2024 and support our ability to deliver our targeted risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\nTurning to Slide 11. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity remain a source of strength. We grew our direct deposits in the quarter as consumers responded to our strong offerings while reducing our brokered deposits. Deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end, and our secured and unsecured debt each represented 8% of total funding. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $23 billion, up $3.6 million from last year and represented 19.1% of total assets, up 124 basis points from last year.\nMoving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. [indiscernible] will make a final transitional adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points in January 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under CECL transition rules, we ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.6%, 20 basis points lower than last year's 12.8%. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8%, 20 basis points above last year. Our total capital ratio increased 10 basis points to 15.8%. And our Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 23.9% compared to 22.8% last year.\nDuring the second quarter, we returned $400 million to shareholders consisting of $300 million of share repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, we had $1 billion remaining of our share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 30, 2025. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan.\nCombining those results, Synchrony delivered a second quarter performance largely within our expectations. We remain focused on taking appropriate actions to prepare our business for years to come, including our ability to deliver our long-term party loss rate between 5.5% and 6% and average return on assets of at least 2.5% on average over time. We've been closely monitoring our performance and taking prudent credit actions in support of these objectives. And in preparation for the pending new rule on late fees and our desire to offset the impact on our business as soon as possible, Synchrony has completed the first phase of our PPPCs. Most of these actions will begin to go into effect in the second half of 2024 and we'll continue to track their financial and operational impact on our customers, partners and portfolio to determine alongside our partners, whether any refinements to our strategies are wanted to achieve our share objective.\nAs a reminder, specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rules and our PPPCs, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late fee related litigation that was filed in March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the PPPCs we implement as a result of the new rule. Outcomes and actual performance related to these uncertainties could impact our outlook.\nWith that framework, let's turn the outlook for the second half of 2024. We expect the consumer to continue to manage their cash flows and consumption, which, when combined with our credit actions, should result in flat to low single-digit decline in purchase volume. We continue to expect payment rates to moderate which, when combined with our purchase volume expectations, should contribute to more moderate loan receivable growth in the second half. Excluding the impact of late fee rule implementation, we expect net interest income and other income to progressively grow in the third and fourth quarters as our PPPC take effect.\nFrom a credit perspective, delinquencies should continue to trend in line with or better than seasonality. We expect our net charge-off rate to be lower in the second half of this year than the first half. Our reserve coverage ratio at the end of 2024 is expected to be generally in line with our year-end 2023 reserve rate. RSA will continue to align with program and company performance. And finally, we expect other expenses to trend in line with the first half average on a dollar basis.\nWhen you combine these factors and include the impact of late fee rule, assuming an implementation date of October 1, 2024 along with the various offsets from the implementation of our PPPCs and $1.96 per share gain on the sale of our Pets Best business in 1Q '24, Synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between $7.60 and $7.80 for the full year. This consolidated and updated EPS range is in the upper end of our prior guidance and reflects Synchrony's dedication delivering optimized outcomes for our many stakeholders, including strong risk-adjusted return for our shareholders.\nI will now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony continues to execute at a high level in an evolving environment. We are leveraging our scale, our data analytics and credit management tools, our advanced digital capabilities and our deep lending expertise to remain nimble and responsive while powering still better experiences and greater value to the customers, partners, providers and small businesses we serve. We are consistently driving compelling results for our many stakeholders, and that momentum is increasingly attracting new and deepening existing opportunities for continued risk-adjusted growth, further embedding Synchrony at the heart of American commerce.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.\nOperator, please start the Q&A session."

The only authorized webcast are located on our website. On the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today's Synchrony reported strong first quarter results, including the successful completion of 2 previously announced transactions, the sale of our Pets Best insurance business which generated an $802 million after-tax gain in the quarter and will extend our reach in the rapidly growing pet industry through a minority interest in international pet holdings we received as part of that sale and the acquisition of Ally Lending's $2.2 billion point-of-sale financing business, which will augment the existing offerings in our home and auto and health and wellness sales platforms. Together, these transactions expand Synchrony's differentiated offerings in the market and strengthen our position as the partner of choice as we drive long-term value for our many stakeholders.\nExcluding the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, Synchrony delivered adjusted first quarter net earnings of $491 million or $1.18 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.7% and a return on tangible common equity of 16.8%. This performance highlights the resiliency of Synchrony's earnings power over time as we deliver results while positioning the business for strong risk-adjusted growth ahead. Our differentiated model enables us to assess and react quickly through cycles and environments as our broad product suite, compelling value proposition and innovative technology continue to resonate with both our consumers and partners. We opened 4.8 million new accounts in the first quarter and grew average active accounts by 3%. Our products and value propositions drove $42 billion in first quarter purchase volume, 2% above the prior year and our highest ever first quarter performance.\nHealth & Wellness purchase volume increased 8%, led by pet, dental and cosmetic and reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts. In diversifying value, purchase volume increased 4% driven by spend both at our partners and outside of our partners. Digital purchase volume increased 3%, reflecting continued consumer engagement through growth in average active accounts. In home and auto, purchase volume decreased 3% as the strong growth in home specialty and auto network and the impact of the Ally Lending acquisition was offset by a combination of lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices. and lifestyle purchase volume decreased 4%, reflecting the impact of lower transaction values. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume for the quarter and increased 6% as our value propositions continue to drive increased engagement and growth.\nSynchrony's out of partner spend reflects a comprehensive range of categories, industries and products and offers a deeper view into consumer behavior throughout the quarter. Spending in January was impacted by challenging weather conditions as average transaction frequencies declined 4% versus the prior year. In February and March, however, we saw a rebound, particularly in nondiscretionary categories. Overall, consumers focused on more nondiscretionary spend in the quarter and shifted out of certain discretionary categories like home furnishings, travel and entertainment.\nDespite the change in mix over, we continue to see broad-based growth in many discretionary and nondiscretionary categories. Across the business, Synchrony continues to see indications that nonprime borrower spend has slowed, and our portfolio's purchase volume growth continues to be driven by higher credit grade consumers. Average transaction values among super prime borrowers continue to increase. And similarly, we see average transaction frequency growth from our prime and super prime segments. The relative adjustments in consumer spend behavior generally reflect a financially healthy consumer who is continuing to become more selective in their purchases and align their cash flows. A trend which has also continued to take shape in Synchrony's credit performance.\nPortfolio payment rates continue to moderate and reached 15.8% for the first quarter, about 90 basis points lower than last year and about 60 basis points higher than the average payment rate level across our first quarters from 2015 to 2019. The relative pace of payment rate moderation has continued to slow from both a generational and credit grade perspective, which when combined with the spending trends we've observed reinforces our view that borrowers are generally reverting to spending and payment behaviors that are more consistent with pre-pandemic norms. These trends are also supported by a number of our other consumer financial health indicators, including a strong labor market and external deposit data that has shown relative stability across industry savings account balances.\nTaken together, these dynamics are contributing to Synchrony's recent delinquency performance highlighted on Slide 11, where the year-over-year rate of change has slowed as our portfolio has reached pre-pandemic ranges. The normalization and recent stabilization of our delinquency performance has occurred at a more gradual pace than the majority of our industry peers, underscoring the powerful combination of our disciplined underwriting, advanced analytics and sophisticated credit management tools. We're encouraged by these trends and continue to expect our portfolios net charge-offs to peak in the first half of this year. We continually monitor indicators across our portfolio, along with the broader industry's credit performance and continue to take credit actions to optimize our portfolio's positioning for 2024 and beyond.\nSynchrony utilizes a broad range of proprietary and external data, including payment behavior characteristics, billions of transactions and credit bureau alerts to deliver actionable insights that inform our underwriting, product and credit management strategies across the account, channel and port levels. Our ability to leverage these insights and deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers and partners even as needs evolve and market conditions shift is what enables Synchrony to consistently deliver the outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders and increasingly positions us as the partner of choice. To that end, Synchrony added or renewed more than 25 partners in the first quarter, including BRP and added 2 new technology partnerships with Adit practice management software and ServiceTitan.\nWe are excited about our new partnership with BRP, a global leader in [ powersports and marine ] products which will enable their U.S. dealers to offer secured installment loan products for their well-known line of power sports products, including the [ Ski-Doo, See-Doo, and Canam ] on and off-road vehicles. Synchrony will deliver our financing offers with flexible terms through their online or in dealership application process, highlighting our ability to address the diverse needs and preferences of our customers. And Synchrony's strategic technology partnerships Adit practice management software and ServiceTitan each represent opportunities to drive seamless customer experiences while also expanding access to our diversified suite of financial solutions and services.\nSynchrony's partnership with Adit, an industry-leading dental practice management software provider will expand CareCredit access to dental practices nationwide and includes integration with [ Adit Tech ] for patients, enabling a seamless and easy-to-use experience for both patients and practitioners. Connecting patients to payment solutions at their dentist office is an essential part of ensuring their care journey is as smooth as possible and dental practices benefit from more timely and effective revenue cycle management. Similarly, Synchrony will integrate with ServiceTitan, a leading software platform built to power trades businesses, enabling contractors to offer their home improvement financing through our direct-to-device application process.\nBy providing access to flexible financing at their fingertips, customers are empowered to make a choice that gets them closer to their goal while their contractors benefit from a frictionless sales experience. So whether we are building new relationships, or supporting and enhancing existing ones. Synchrony deeply understands what our customers need and expect and what our partners, merchants and providers are seeking to achieve. Our ability to deliver for these stakeholders and consistently achieved strong outcomes through varying conditions demonstrates the strength of Synchrony's business model and commitment of our incredible team. And speaking of our team, in today's world, it has never been more important for us to attract and retain the best talent, which we do to our unwavering commitment to our employees and our culture.\nSo I'm proud to share that we've been named among the top best companies to work for in the U.S. by Fortune magazine and Great Places to Work. Synchrony moved up 15 positions to #5 in the 2024 rankings, reflecting our unique and special culture and our relentless focus on putting people first, as we continuously strive to achieve best-in-class experiences for our many stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter results reflected the combination of our differentiated business model and a resilient consumer in an evolving macroeconomic environment. We generated $1.3 billion in net earnings or $3.14 per diluted share on a reported basis. Excluding the $802 million after-tax gain from the sale of our Pets Best business, we generated $491 million in net earnings or $1.18 per diluted share. Lending loan receivables grew 12% to $102 billion. This growth reflected the impacts of the continued purchase volume growth, an approximate 90 basis point decrease in payment rate and the completion of our Ally Lending acquisition.\nNet revenue increased $1.6 billion or 50%, driven by the Pets Best gain on sale of approximately $1.1 billion, which was reported through other income. Excluding the Pets Best gain on sale, net revenue increased $530 million or 17%. Net interest income increased 9% to $4.4 billion, driven by 50% higher interest and fees. This growth in interest and fees reflected the combined impacts of higher loan receivables, a lower payment rate and higher benchmark rates and was partially offset by higher interest expense from benchmark rates. [ Partly ] of $764 million in the quarter were 3.04% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $153 million versus the prior year, driven by higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.\nProvision for credit losses increased to $1.9 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $299 million reserve build, which included a $190 million bill related to the acquisition of Ally Lending. Other expenses grew 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs in support of growth and our continued investment in technology. Our efficiency ratio for the quarter excluding the impact of the gain on sale was 32.3%, an improvement of approximately 270 basis points versus last year. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10.\nAt quarter end, our 30-plus frequency rate was 4.74% compared to 3.81% in the prior year and 18 basis points above our average for the first quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% versus 1.87% last year and 14 basis points above our average for the first quarter of 2017 to 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 6.31% in the first quarter compared to 4.49% in the prior year, an average of 5.84% in the first quarters of 2017 to 2019. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.72%, up 46 basis points from the 10.26% in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of seasonal trends. The reserve build in the quarter largely reflected the addition of the Ally Lending portfolio.\nAs Brian discussed, Synchrony's credit performance has been consistent with our expectations. Given that Synchrony shares the consumer with our broader industry peers, we continue to monitor our portfolio and the broader industry's credit performance as we've done periodically since mid-2023, we've been taking incremental credit actions starting in March. Across specific segments of our portfolio that should reinforce our portfolio's performance for 2024 and beyond. As Slide 4 demonstrates, Synchrony has built a track record of achieving consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions. This performance has been enabled by the combination of our disciplined underwriting, which targets a 5.5% to 6% loss rate on average and RSA, which aligns program and portfolio performance. We will continue to leverage our deep consumer lending experience, our diversified product suite, sales platforms and verticals and our sophisticated data analytics and technology to further deliver on that priority.\nTurning to Slide 12. Synchrony's funding, capital and liquidity continue to provide a strong foundation for our business. Our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with our consumers as we grew deposits $2.4 billion in the first quarter. Deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end, and are complemented by our securitized debt and unsecured funding strategies, which each represent 8% of our total funding. During the quarter, we issued $750 million of secured funding included a preferred stock issuance of $500 million which served to more fully optimize our capital structure. Total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $24.9 billion, up $3.2 billion from last year and at quarter end represented 20.5% of total assets, up 38 basis points from last year.\nMoving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January through 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. Under the CECL transition rules, we ended the first quarter with CET1 ratio of 12.6%, 40 basis points lower than last year's 13.0%. The net capital impact of our Pets Best sale and Ally Lending acquisition added approximately 40 basis points to our CET1 ratio. Our Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.8%, unchanged compared to last year. Our total capital ratio decreased 10 basis points to 15.8%, and our Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 23.8% compared to 23% last year.\nDuring the first quarter, we returned $402 million to shareholders, consisting of $300 million of share repurchases and $102 million of common stock dividends. As of March 31, 2024, we had $300 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. As part of our capital planning approved by the Board of Directors, our share repurchase authorization was increased by $1 billion, bringing our total authorization to $1.3 billion for the period ending June 30, 2025. Furthermore, the Board intends to maintain our current quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share. Synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan.\nTurning to Slide 13 for a review of our 2024 business trends. As a reminder, Synchrony previously filed an 8-K on March 5, 2024, with a revised financial outlook, including EPS guidance for the full year 2024, specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rule change and our product, policy and pricing changes, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of the late fee related litigation that was filed in March, the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule changes and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the product, policy and pricing changes we implement as a result of the new rule.\nOutcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties could impact the EPS outlook. Looking at the remainder of the year. Synchrony will continue to execute across our key strategic priorities and prepare our business as we navigate an evolving operating environment. We have commenced the implementation of our product, policy and pricing changes the majority of which will be completed over the next 2 to 3 months, and we anticipate having greater clarity on the impacts of these changes likely in the second half of the year. In the meantime, we continue to expect our business to demonstrate typical season patterns in many of our key metrics. We expect net charge-offs to peak in the first half of the year and that the reserve coverage at year-end should be lower than the year-end 2023 rate.\nFinally, we expect that the RSA will continue to align program performance and continue to function as designed. In closing, Synchrony is focused on leveraging our core strengths to optimize our business position and build our long history of delivering steady, growth and strong risk-adjusted returns. Our depth of consumer lending experience informs our go-to-market and product strategies. Our investment in sophisticated credit management tools empower our agility and our RSA supports our financial resilience. Together, our differentiated model continues to consistently deliver value to each of our stakeholders through changing environments. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony's first quarter results were driven by our differentiated business model and our commitment to delivering sustainable, strong results for our customers, partners and stakeholders. We are leveraging our proprietary industry and consumer insights, our diversified products and platforms and our advanced data analytics to consistently provide access to responsible financing solutions for our customers, sales and loyalty for our partners and sustainable growth as strong risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders. We're confident that Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we navigate the year ahead.\nWe're excited about the opportunities we see to drive still greater long-term value as we continue to partner with hundreds of thousands of small and midsized businesses and health providers to provide access to credit to our more than 70 million customers for their everyday needs and wants. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A."

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today, Synchrony reported strong fourth quarter results, including net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5% and a return on tangible common equity of 14.7%.\nThese fourth quarter results contributed to a full year 2023 net earnings of $2.2 billion or $5.19 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2% and a return on tangible common equity of 19.8%.\nThis strong financial performance was supported by continued consumer resilience and powered by our multiproduct strategy and diversified sales platforms.\nWe achieved another year of record purchase volume totaling $185 billion for the full year and up 3% from last year.\nOur compelling products and value propositions helped drive the origination of almost 23 million new accounts in 2023 and also helped grow our average active accounts by 2.5%.\nThe broad utility and value of our product offerings continue to resonate deeply with our customer base, leading to another year of record purchase volume. This, combined with the continued moderation in payment rates to drive loan receivables growth of 11.4%.\nPrint continued to normalize this fourth quarter net charge-offs reached prepandemic levels, in line with our expectations, and contributing to a full year net charge-off rate of 4.87%, still below our target underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%.\nWe also drove continued progress toward our target operating efficiency ratio, demonstrating cost discipline while maintaining investments to ensure the long-term success of our franchise.\nAnd through strong execution and prudent capital management over time, Synchrony continued our long history of capital returns, including $1.5 billion returned to shareholders this year. Since 2016, we have paid $3.6 billion in dividends and reduced our outstanding shares by 50%.\nSynchrony's ability to consistently generate and return capital to our shareholders is enabled by our differentiated business model, which prioritizes the sustained delivery of attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions and economic cycles.\nOur focused execution across key strategic priorities enable Synchrony's resilient returns by reinforcing our core strengths and facilitating our ongoing evolution to meet changing preferences and needs. With that in mind, Synchrony continued to grow and win new partners over the past year. With the addition of more than 25 partners and over 30 renewed relationships.\nAmong our new partnerships, we were excited to announce that J.Crew selected Synchrony to launch its first co-branded credit card, which will be a digital-first program with mobile wallet provisioning, robust preapproval capabilities, scan to apply and direct-to-device credit applications. This competitive win is a testament to our culture of innovation, consistent investment in our digital ecosystem, and our strategic focus to empower our customers and partners to connect seamlessly through best-in-class omnichannel experiences.\nWe also continue to diversify our programs, products and markets during 2023, broadening the utility of our offerings and extending our reach. Synchrony believes in the power of choice, choice for our customers and partners, providers and merchants, as they engage in person and digitally across a full suite of everyday financing options.\nThis year, we launched multiproduct prequalification and began presenting customers with side-by-side offers of both revolving and installment solutions to bring choice to the forefront. These enhancements empower customers to weigh the benefits of various options in real time and make the decisions that best suit their financing needs in that moment.\nWe continue to scale our Pay Later solution, which is now offered at over 200 provider locations in our Health & Wellness platform and at 18 retail partners.\nFor our partners and providers, Pay Later seamlessly integrates into the broader partner relationship and product offering, and provides another tool for deepening engagement with customers. And the response has been strong.\nSince we launched partners who have offered these solutions have seen a 20% lift in new accounts, with 95% of Pay Later sales coming from net new customers.\nSynchrony's continued diversification and expansion of our offerings over the last year benefited from opportunities to extend our reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced the sale of our Pets Best insurance business, and through a minority interest from that sale, the opportunity to build a strategic partnership with Independence Pet Holdings, or IPH, one of the leading pet-focused companies in North America.\nSince acquiring the Pets Best business in 2019, we've grown pets in force by over 45% per year on average, more than double the industry's growth rate, and become a leading pet insurance provider in the U.S. We're very proud of what we've been able to achieve with such a great business and team, which enabled us to gain considerable insight into the pet industry, more broadly over the last 4 years. We are confident that IPH will be able to use its pet insurance expertise to unlock new opportunities for Pets Best and offer still greater value for Pets Best customers.\nAnd through the strategic relationship forged between IPH and ourselves, Synchrony is positioned to gain still greater exposure on insights into the rapidly growing pet industry, as we seek to expand access to flexible pet care financing across the country.\nMore recently, Synchrony announced still another opportunity to expand our business and accelerate our growth with the acquisition of Ally Lending's point-of-sale financing business. This $2.2 billion loan portfolio consists of partnerships with nearly 2,500 merchant locations and supports more than 450,000 active borrowers in the home improvement services and health care industries.\nThrough this acquisition, Synchrony will create a differentiated solution in the industry, simultaneously offering both revolving credit and installment loans at the point of sale and the home improvement vertical.\nThis multiproduct presentation furthers our product diversification strategy, delivering consumer choice, while maximizing conversions and sales for our partners. This opportunity also enables Synchrony to expand our home specialty financing in roofing, windows and electrical services.\nWe are excited about the natural synergies we see between Ally Lending and Synchrony's Home and Auto and Health and Wellness platforms. We look forward to leveraging our industry expertise and scale to drive operating efficiency and accelerate growth across platforms, with attractive market opportunities and return profiles over time.\nAnd of course, Synchrony's ability to successfully deliver a breadth of financing solutions across an expansive distribution network is reliant on delivering best-in-class experiences with each customer interaction.\nThis year, we continue to elevate the presence and utility of our offerings across in-person and digital transactions by adding digital wallet provisioning capabilities for [ 8 ] partners, including PayPal and Venmo, Verizon, TJX and Belk. And our digital sales continue to grow at an outsized pace, climbing 9% to nearly 39% of our total 2023 sales.\nOver the last year, Synchrony launched the first phase of our marketplace on synchrony.com and within our native app, which shoppers can find hundreds of offers showcasing our partner brands, cared with Synchrony's tailored multiproduct financing solutions.\nIn fact, as Synchrony leverage our analytics and marketing capabilities to develop compelling cross-shopping opportunities in this initial launch. Marketplace attracted over 220 million visits by shoppers for our partners, providers and merchants, as we more than doubled the number of partners participating.\nIn summary, Synchrony is increasingly any where our customer is looking to make a purchase or a payment, large or small, in-person or digitally and across an ever-expanding range of markets and industries. We can meet them whenever and however they want to be met, with a variety of flexible financing solutions to meet their needs in any given moment.\nOur ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike, is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns, particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.\nSynchrony's fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated business and financial model, performing as designed. Our diversified sales platform in spend categories enabled record purchase volume growth, as our disciplined underwriting and credit management kept credit performance in line with our expectations. Our retail share arrangements ensured alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners.\nAs credit normalize towards historical prepandemic levels and funding costs increased from higher benchmark rates, our RSA payments were lower, providing a partial buffer to the economic environment enabling Synchrony delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns. And our strong balance sheet provides the flexibility to return capital to shareholders, while investing in opportunities to achieve our longer-term strategic goals, all while delivering for our customers and partners and their evolving needs today.\nOverall, our prudent business management and differentiated financial model have positioned Synchrony to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers, partners and shareholders, through an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop this past year and as we move forward in 2024.\nNow let's turn to our fourth quarter results. Purchase volume increased 3% versus last year, and reflected the breadth and depth of our sales platforms and the compelling value our products offer, combined with the resilient consumer.\nIn Health and Wellness, purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts led by dental, pet and cosmetic verticals.\nDigital purchase volume increased 5%, with growth in average active accounts and strong customer engagement.\nDiversified value purchase volume increased 4%, reflecting a higher end and out-of-partner spend.\nLifestyle purchase volume increased 3%, with stronger average transaction values in outdoor and luxury.\nIn our Home and Auto, purchase volume decreased 4%, as lower customer traffic, fewer large ticket purchases and lower gas prices more than offset growth in home specialty, auto network and commercial.\nPurchase volume across Synchrony, dual and co-branded cards grew 9% and represented 43% of total purchase volume for the quarter, reflecting the broad utility and value that these products deliver for our customers.\nAs we've discussed in the past, our out-of-partner spend is split roughly evenly between discretionary and nondiscretionary categories, and this trend held steady throughout the year.\nIn the fourth quarter, we saw some shift in categories, as consumers shifted from travel spend to clothing, for instance, and from gasoline and automobiles towards spend at grocery and discount stores. We have not seen any meaningful changes in the overall composition between discretionary and nondiscretionary spend.\nThe combination of broad-based purchase volume growth in approximately 110 basis point decrease in payment rates, drove ending loan receivables growth of 11.4%.\nOur fourth quarter payment rate of 15.9% still remains approximately 115 basis points higher than our 5-year pre-pandemic historical average.\nNet interest income increased 9% to $4.5 billion, driven by a 16% growth in interest and fees. The increase in interest and fees reflected the combined impact of higher loan receivables and benchmark rates as well as a lower payment rate.\nOur net interest margin of 15.10% declined 48 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease largely reflected higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 169 basis points to 4.55%, and reduced net interest margin by 138 basis points. This impact was partially offset by 66 basis points of growth in loan receivables yield, which contributed 55 basis points to net interest margin.\nHigher liquidity portfolio yield added 29 basis points to net interest margin. And our loan receivables growth improved the mix of interest-earning assets, contributing 6 basis points to net interest margin.\nRSAs of $878 million in the fourth quarter or 3.49% of average loan receivables, a reduction of $165 million versus the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.\nProvision for credit losses increased to $1.8 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $402 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables.\nOther expenses grew 14% to $1.3 billion. The increase primarily reflect the growth-related items as we continue to see strong growth in volumes as well as a return of operational losses to pre-pandemic average levels as a percent of our purchase volume.\nExpenses in the quarter also included several notable items, including $43 million in employee costs related to a voluntary early retirement program, $9 million in real estate-related restructuring charges, as we continue to adjust our physical footprint in favor of a hybrid working environment, $9 million for the FDIC special assessment, $7 million of preparatory expenses in anticipation of a potential late fee rule change and $5 million of transaction-related expenses related to the sale of Pets Best.\nOur efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter improved by approximately 120 basis points compared to last year, to 36%. Excluding the impact of the notable items in the quarter, our efficiency ratio would have been approximately 200 basis points lower in the fourth quarter.\nAll in, Synchrony generated net earnings of $440 million or $1.03 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 1.5% and return on tangible common equity of 14.7%.\nNext, I'll cover our key [indiscernible] trends on Slide 10. Overall, we see the consumer remaining resilient, as they manage through inflation and higher interest rates. The external deposit data we monitor also supports this view, as it shows average savings account balances returned closer to prepandemic levels during 2023 and remain relatively steady through the third and fourth quarters. At year-end, average industry savings balances remained approximately 9% above levels from 2020.\nOur discipline through cycle underwriting and active credit management has positioned us well as we entered 2024. Our delinquency ratios finished the year slightly above average levels from 2017 to 2019 prior to the pandemic. At year-end, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.74% compared to 3.65% in the prior year, and 12 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019.\nOur 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.28% versus 1.69% last year and 4 basis points above our average for the fourth quarters of 2017 to 2019. And consistent with our expectations, Synchrony's net charge-offs reached 5.58% in the fourth quarter compared to 3.48% in the prior year, at an average of 5.49% in the fourth quarters of 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nWe continue to monitor our portfolio and implement actions as necessary to proactively position our business for 2024 and beyond.\nMoving to reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.26%, down 14 basis points from 10.40% in the third quarter. The reserve build of $402 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth.\nTurning to Slide 12. Synchrony's balance sheet continues to be a source of flexibility and strength. Our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers in the fourth quarter, driving over $3 billion of growth in total deposits in the quarter or 13% compared to the prior year.\nAt quarter end, deposits represented 84% of our total funding, while securitized [indiscernible] comprised 7% and unsecured funding 9%.\nTotal liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were $19.8 [ billion, ] up $2.6 [ billion ] from last year and at quarter end represented 16.8% of total assets, up 42 basis points from last year.\nMoving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony will continue to make its annual transitional adjustments to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately 50 basis points each January until 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.\nAdditionally, in the fourth quarter, Synchrony made a change to its balance sheet presentation of contractual amounts related to our retailer partner agreements. At year-end, assets of approximately $500 million, which were previously classified as intangible assets, were reclassified to other assets and prior periods were reclassified to perform to this presentation.\nThis change in presentation had a corresponding impact to each of our regulatory capital metrics that resulted in an increase of approximately 50 basis points to our capital ratios in both the current and prior years.\nUnder the CECL transition rules and including this balance sheet change, we ended the fourth quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, 110 basis points lower than last year's 13.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 12.9% compared to 14.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 60 basis points to 14.9%. In a Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.1% compared to 22.8% last year.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders, consisting of $250 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends.\nAt the end of the quarter, we had $600 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization. We're well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow.\nSynchrony remains committed to our capital allocation framework, which prioritizes investment in organic growth and payment of our regular dividends, followed by share repurchases and investments in inorganic growth opportunities, where the rates of return meet or exceed that of our other potential uses of capital.\nTo that end, as Brian mentioned, Synchrony announced the acquisition of the Ally Lending point-of-sale financing business, which we view as a great opportunity to expand our leadership position in the Home Improvement and Health and Wellness verticals, while leveraging our industry expertise and scale to unlock still greater value. We've agreed to purchase approximately $2.2 billion of loan receivables at a discount.\nUpon closing the transaction and subject to the completion of purchase accounting, we expect our CET1 ratio to be reduced by approximately 50 basis points, inclusive of our provision for credit losses of approximately $200 million relating to the initial reserve builds.\nSynchrony expects this acquisition to be accretive to full year 2024 earnings per share, excluding the impact of the initial reserve build for credit losses.\nOn integration of our business, conversion to our Prism underwriting model and execution of our strategy, we expect to achieve attractive internal rate of return with approximately a 3.5-year tangible book value earn back.\nAdditionally, the sale of our Pets Best business will result in approximately $750 million gain net of tax in 2024, which will contribute to an approximately 80 basis point increase to our CET1 ratio, inclusive of the capital required to be held on the minority interest in IPH. Excluding the gain on sale, we expect the transaction to be neutral to earnings.\nWe're excited about the opportunities we have identified to continue to drive consistent growth and appropriate risk-adjusted returns, and have established a long track record of execution across both strategic and financial objectives.\nDuring 2023, we drove strong growth in purchase volume, which combined with the payment rate moderation to deliver solid growth in loan receivables. We are opportunistic in funding that growth and continue to expand our deposit franchise and in turn, deliver attractive net interest income. Credit normalized in line with our expectations and our RSA functioned as designed. And finally, we fuel our commitment to deliver positive operating leverage.\nTurning to Slide 14. Let's review our outlook for 2024. Our baseline assumption for this discussion include: a stable macroeconomic environment, full year GDP growth of approximately 1.7%, a year-end 2024 on [ unemployment ] rate of 4.0% and an ending Fed funds rate of 4.75%, with cuts beginning in the second half of 2024.\nThis outlook also assumes the closing of our Pets Best and Ally lending transactions in the first quarter of 2024. And given the uncertainty of timing and implementation of a potential final rule regarding late fees, we have not assumed any related impact to our 2024 financial outlook. In the event that a final late fee rule is published, we will provide an update with the associated impact to our financial guidance.\nStarting with loan receivables. We expect our compelling value propositions and the broad utility of our products will continue to drive purchase volume growth. We also expect payment rates to continue to moderate, although we anticipate they will remain above pre-pandemic levels through 2024. Together, these dynamics should deliver ending loan receivables growth of 6% to 8%.\nWe expect full year net interest income of $17.5 billion to $18.5 billion. Net interest income should follow typical seasonal trends through the year, adjusted for several impacts: one, higher interest-bearing liabilities expense as our fixed rate debt reprices with higher benchmark rates; two, the impact of competition for retail deposits and pace of deposit repricing once rate cuts begin. Our expectation is for betas to trend near 30% as rates begin to decline later in the year, thereby reducing impact to interest expense during 2024; and three, interest and fee yield growth, partially offset by higher income reversals.\nWe expect net charge-offs of 5.75% to 6% within our targeted underwriting range of 5.5% to 6%. Losses are expected to peak in the first half before returning to prepandemic seasonal trends, following the normalization of delinquency metrics in 2023.\nWe expect ROCs of 3.5% to 3.75% of average loan receivables for the full year. This reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, higher interest expense and the mix of our loan receivables growth, partially offset by purchase volume growth. The reduction in RSA demonstrates the functional design of the RSA and the continued alignment of our interest with partners.\nAnd finally, we expect to reach an operating efficiency ratio of 32.5% to 33.5% for the year, driven primarily by the optimization of our loan yields as credit normalization occurs. This outlook excludes the impact of the Pets Best gain on sale, which will be recognized in other income.\nWe remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year and continuing to invest in our long-term success of our business.\nAs demonstrated again this past year, Synchrony's purpose-built business and financial model is performing as designed. Through an evolving backdrop, our diversified portfolio of products and platforms continue to drive growth, our leading credit management ensures attractive risk-adjusted returns, our RSA provides a buffer against changes in economic performance and our stable balance sheet creates opportunity.\nTaken together, our business continued to deliver value for each of our stakeholders in 2023 and positioned well for 2024.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony delivered another strong performance in 2023. We executed on key strategic priorities that expand the breadth and depth of our customer acquisition and engagement, further diversify the products, services and value we provide and enhance the quality of the experiences we power for our customers, partners, providers and merchants.\nThis focus on deepening our core strengths, while continuing to evolve with the ever-changing world of commerce has enabled Synchrony to deliver strong financial results and returns to our shareholders, while also preparing our business for the future.\nWe are confident in our ability to continue to sustainably grow and deliver resilient risk-adjusted returns over time and are excited about both the near and longer-term opportunities we see ahead to deliver still greater value for our many stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A."

During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.\nFinally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties -- only authorized webcast are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today's Synchrony reported strong third quarter results, including net earnings of $628 million or $1.48 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.9%. These results highlight the strength of Synchrony's [indiscernible] model and the resiliency of our business through economic cycles.\nOur diversified product suite and advanced digital capabilities enabled Synchrony to continue to deliver consistently strong results in an ever-changing environment. We are increasingly at the center of customers' everyday financing needs, and position as the partner of choice for retailers, merchants and providers alike as they seek enhanced value, greater utility and best-in-class experiences.\nWe opened 5.7 million new accounts in the third quarter and grew average active accounts by 6%. We continue to drive growth with our $47 billion of purchase volume, representing a record third quarter and a 5% increase versus the prior year. This momentum is a testament to the power of our diversified portfolio. Health & Wellness purchase volume grew 14% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in [ active ] accounts led by Dental, Pet and Cosmetics. The 7% growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts as several of our newer programs continue to resonate with consumers and [indiscernible] value, purchase volume grew 7%, reflecting growth in out-of-partner spend and strong retailer performance.\nLifestyle purchase volume increased 8%, reflecting growth in average transaction values and outdoor and luxury. And in Home & Auto, purchase volume remained flat versus last year as growth in commercial products, home specialty and the auto network was generally offset by lower retail traffic in furniture and electronics and the impact of lower gas and lumber [indiscernible].\n[indiscernible] cards accounted for 42% of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 13% as several of our newer value propositions continue to drive greater customer engagement. Synchrony's range of products and platforms gives us a unique view into the health of the consumer. Through our monitoring, we see continued trends of behavior normalizing to pre-pandemic levels.\nAcross the portfolio, average transaction values leveled off through the quarter after modestly declining in the second quarter. Meanwhile, average transaction frequency, which had climbed throughout the year, showed some signs of stabilization towards the end of the quarter.\nLooking at our auto partners spend, our customers are becoming more selective in making larger purchases, including home furnishings and electronics and spending less on travel. Directionally, we see broad trends that are in line with our expectations across the portfolio with slowing spend growth, normalization payment rates and growth in balances, which is driving higher net interest income. While in the external deposit data we track, consumer savings balances remain approximately 8% above the average level in 2020.\nIn summary, these trends show a consumer that continues to benefit from a strong labor market while reverting gradually towards historical spend and payment norms. As we closely monitor the health of the consumer, we also continue to develop and deploy the compelling [indiscernible] value propositions that attract consumers and partners to Synchrony.\nWe announced earlier this month that both the PayPal and [ demo cards ] can now be provisioned in the Apple Wallet, representing our latest enhancement as we evolve to meet the demands of our increasing digital [indiscernible] customers.\nSynchrony's journey began with in-store financing options, which have long been valued tools for both retailers and consumers to build loyalty and drive value. Over time, we've broaden the utility of these products through our dual and [indiscernible] card strategies which enable customers to make out-of-partner purchases, accumulate rewards and extract even greater value. Increasingly, our [indiscernible] are taking that engagement even further as digital wallets enable everyday use functionality and extend our leading value propositions [indiscernible] be in a store. Active wallet users are up over 45% year-to-date and sales on wallets are over 70%. This trend is more than a simple technological enhancement\n[Audio Gap]\nSynchrony's strategy to deliver enhanced utility and best-in-class experiences requires seamlessly integrated, tailored solutions and our investments in technology allow us to meet this demand. When our customers combine the broad utility of our products and services with our digital wallet functionality, the impact is clear. Our digital wallet users spend nearly twice as much and have over double the transactions on average. More broadly, [indiscernible] the impact of expanded product utility in our results. Auto partner spend continued its outsized growth this quarter, up 12% compared to last year. We continue to develop our solution suite and extend the reach of our products meeting consumer demand for fast and secure shopping and opening new opportunities for customers to engage with their favorite brands.\nIn Health & Wellness, we were pleased to announce partnerships with veterinary hospitals at 3 additional universities. CareCredit is now accepted at 95% of the nation's public veterinary university hospitals in addition to more than 25,000 provider locations, expanding access to flexible financing tools that enable a lifetime of care for all pets. The power of Synchrony's continually evolving model, supported by our focus on technological innovation, continues to position Synchrony as the partner of choice as we deliver digitally powered experiences and compelling value for our many stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Synchrony's third quarter results reflected the strength of our financial model demonstrate to our consistent growth and strong risk deducted returns. The compelling value propositions of our broad product suite continue to resonate with our 70-plus million customers and drove broad-based growth across our sales platforms. [indiscernible] loan receivables grew 14% versus last year, benefiting from the combination of approximately 120 basis point decrease in payment rate versus last year and 5% growth in purchase volume.\nOur third quarter\n[Audio Gap]\nWas 16.3%, still remains approximately 130 basis points higher than our 5-year pre-pandemic historical\n[Audio Gap]\nto $4.4 billion\n[Audio Gap]\nthe prior year as higher funding costs more than offset the benefit of higher yields and favorable asset mix -- physically, loan receivables yield grew [ 114 ] basis points points and contributed 95 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional 46 basis points to net interest margin. These gains were more than offset by higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 229 basis points to [indiscernible] and reduced net interest margin by 185 basis points.\nRSAs of $979 million in the third quarter or 4.04% of average loan receivables, a $7 million decline from the prior year, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. Our RSAs continue to perform as designed. They provide a critical alignment with our partners as we navigate the evolving environment together and support greater stability in our returns.\nProvision for credit losses increased to $1.5 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $372 million reserve build, which largely reflected the growth in loan receivables. Other expenses grew 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by the growth-related items as well as technology investments and operational losses. Our efficiency ratio for the third quarter improved by approximately 330 basis points compared to last year to 33.2%.\nSummarizing our financial results, Synchrony generated net earnings of $628 million or $1.48 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and return on tangible common equity of 22.9%.\nNext, I'll cover our [indiscernible] on Slide 8. Our delinquency performance in the third quarter continued to reflect normalization towards prepaid net behavior with both the 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates approaching 2019 levels. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.40% compared to 3.28% last year and approximately 7 basis points lower than third quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.06% and versus 1.43% in the prior year and approximately 1 basis point lower than our third quarter 2019.\nOur net charge-off rate was 4.60% versus 3% last year. Synchrony remains approximately 115 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, where our risk-adjusted returns are more fully optimized. Overall, our credit performance remains within our expectations and has benefited from investments in our advanced underwriting platform as we expect to continue on a path towards our long-term operating targets.\nFocusing on our more recent vintages, they continue to perform in line with those from 2019. While we're pleased with how these [indiscernible] are developing, we're continuously monitoring our portfolio and have implemented further credit actions include some tightening of our origination criteria. These proactive refinements are intended to position our business for 2024 and beyond.\nMoving to reserves. Our [indiscernible] losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.40% up 6 basis points from 10.34% in the second quarter. The reserve build of $372 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth.\nTurning to Slide 10. Our stable funding model and strong management of capital and liquidity continue to position Synchrony well for any environment. In the third quarter, customers continue to be attractive to our consumer bank offerings as we grew both direct and broker deposits to fund our anticipated receivables growth, deposits represented 84% of our total funding at quarter end. The remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 7% and 9% of our funding, respectively. We completed a $1 billion securitized issuance in the quarter, and we'll continue to be active in both markets as conditions allow.\nTotal liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.5 billion, up $275 million from last year. At quarter end, liquidity represented 18.2% of total assets down 192 basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth.\nMoving on to our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL [indiscernible] rules issued by the Joint Federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis points in January, and we'll continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement balance sheet.\nUnder the CECL transition rules, we entered the third quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.4%\n[Audio Gap]\npoints lower than last year's level of 14% under the CECL transition rules compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 120 basis points to 15.3%.\nThe Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.5% and compared to 24.1% last year. During the third quarter, we returned $254 million to our shareholders, consisting of $150 million of share repurchases and $104 million of common stock dividends. And at the end of the quarter, we had $850 million remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\nSynchrony well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We will also continue to seek opportunities to complete the development of our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock as conditions allow.\nNow please [indiscernible] detail on an outlook for 2023. We expect our ending loan receivables to grow approximately 11% versus last year, reflecting the combined impact of payment rate moderation and slowing purchase volume growth. We expect a full year net interest margin of approximately 15.15%. Net interest margin in the third quarter benefited from strong growth in interest and fees and receivables in addition to payment rate moderation and lower deposit betas.\nIn the fourth quarter, we expect net interest margin to be impacted by higher average liquidity to prefund seasonal loan receivables growth impacting the mix of interest-earning assets, higher deposit betas driven by competition and movement in benchmark rates and interest and fee growth, partially offset by rising reversals.\nFrom a credit standpoint, delinquencies nearly reached 2019 levels at quarter end, and should file seasonal trends from this point. With the increased visibility into delinquency performance this year, we are tightening our forecasted with net charge-off rate to approximately [ 4.85% ], we continue to anticipate our loss rate reaching a fully normalized level between 5.5% and 6% on an annual basis in 2024. And as we noted, we will continue to monitor and position the portfolio for 2024 and beyond.\nWe expect the RSA to trend at the low end of our prior outlook and be approximately 3.95% of average loan receivables for the full year. This improved outlook reflects the impacts of the continued credit normalization, lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And as we generate higher-than-anticipated growth, we are maintaining our expectation for operating expenses at approximately $1.15 billion per quarter\n[Audio Gap]\nwhile we [indiscernible] credit management and our stable funding model, we're confident in our ability to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver market-leading returns over the long term.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony continues to demonstrate both the agility and consistency of our differentiated model. We remain focused on optimizing the outcomes for our many stakeholders by closely managing the drivers of our business, which we control, and intently monitoring and preparing for those which we do not. We are prioritizing sustainable growth to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted margins through changing market conditions.\nWe are prudently investing in the future and long-term growth of the business. so we are able to exceed the increasingly digital [indiscernible] of our consumers, and we are delivering on our financial commitments even as we ready the business for an evolving environment to ensure our continued ability to drive long-term value into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.\nOperator, please start the Q&A session."

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. In the second quarter, Synchrony delivered strong financial results, including net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.1% and a return on tangible common equity of 21.7%.\nSynchrony continues to demonstrate strong growth and financial performance as consumer behavior reverts to pre-pandemic norms and as our profit and value propositions resonate strongly across our diversified set of platforms and partners. During the second quarter, we opened 5.9 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 7% on a core basis. Once again, we set a new record as our $47 billion in purchase volume reached our highest level ever for the second quarter. These strong sales continue to demonstrate the value of our diversified products and platforms.\nHealth and wellness purchase volume grew 17% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts, along with higher spend per active account. The 8% growth in digital purchase volume was driven by higher average active accounts and reflected continued momentum in several of our new programs.\nIn diversified value, purchase volume increased 7%, reflecting higher out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance, and the continued impact of newer value propositions driving penetration growth. Lifestyle purchase volume increased 10%, reflecting growth in average transaction value in outdoor and luxury.\nAnd in home and auto, purchase volume was largely unchanged versus last year as the benefit of higher average transaction values and growth in commercial products was largely offset by lower retail traffic and a reduction in gas prices. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 41% of total purchase volume in the quarter and increased 14% on a core basis, with several of our newer value proposition continuing to drive elevated growth.\nOur view into the consumer informed by the billions of real-time transactional data that we regularly monitor shows continued normalization in consumer behavior toward pre-pandemic levels, which has progressed in line with our expectations. Average transaction frequency continued to grow in the quarter, while average transaction values declined modestly. This decline, however, was partly attributable to lower gas prices. A deeper dive into our auto partners spend shows continued stability in key discretionary categories such as restaurants and entertainment as well as in nondiscretionary categories like grocery and discount stores.\nThe reduction in average values was noted even among our highest credit quality borrowers, which was also accompanied by some modest slowing in transaction frequency. Following the trend from previous quarters, our younger borrowers as well as those in lower credit grades continue to reduce the pace of spend.\nThis quarter, given the seasonal impact of tax refunds, we saw a small sequential increase in our payment rates, largely driven by higher credit quality segments. Year-over-year, however, payment rates continued to decline across age and credit bands. Meanwhile, the external deposit data we track shows that the average consumer savings balances declined approximately 2% from the first quarter, but remain approximately 7% above 2020's average level. So taken together, the payment spend and savings trends we're watching suggests that consumers continue to be well supported by the constructive labor market and relatively healthy balance sheets as they gradually revert to their pre-pandemic norms.\nAnd as we continue to closely monitor the health of our consumers, we are also advancing the key strategic priorities of our business to position Synchrony for long-term success. One of our key priorities is the continued expansion of our multiproduct strategy across partners, distribution channels and markets, allowing us to meet our customers how and where they want to be met, and with a variety of financing solutions that address their specific financing needs in each interaction.\nWe recognize that our customers' needs change over time. And Synchrony can and should be their financing partner of choice throughout life stages. Whether applying in-person, online or through an app, we leverage our data and advanced analytics for our digital ecosystem to deliver fast, seamless offers designed to responsibly support each customer's particular purchase.\nFor customers who appreciate the simplicity in installment loan with flexible terms and payment schedules, Synchrony's buy now, pay later solutions have become popular options and are successfully attracting new accounts and driving deeper engagement. In fact, partners who have launched these products have seen a 29% lift in new accounts with over 95% of the sales coming from new customers. These solutions conveniently integrated into our broader partner relationships and product offerings and match with our deep insights into consumer clearly expand our reach beyond our traditional set of customers and offer our partners another effective tool for engaging with their most loyal shoppers.\nMost recently, we announced that our partner At Home selected Synchrony as its exclusive buy now, pay later provider integrating this installment product with its existing suite of payment options. Customers can select Synchrony Pay Later at checkout online and in-store. And thanks to our integrated data and leading underwriting capabilities, most can be prequalified without impacting their credit score.\nAt Home joins over 700 of our partners, providers and merchants that now utilize Synchrony's installment suite in the form of our Pay Later, Allegro and secured installment loans. We are excited to further roll out these offerings across more programs and through our proprietary distribution channels over the coming months.\nAs Synchrony continues to broaden our product suite and empower these offerings with our dynamic decision and capabilities, we are better able to acquire and deepen relationships with our customers. We see these new installment products leading to cross-selling opportunities and product upgrades across the business in helping partners build lifelong customers.\nIn campaigns across various portfolios, we have seen a 20% of private label cardholders are eligible for an upgrade to a dual card, which brings higher utility and better value proposition. And our customers respond to these upgrades, with nearly double the purchase volume at 1.6x the lifetime value to Synchrony. For our partners, these deeper relationships translate into more loyal, better-engaged shoppers. And so ultimately, the successful execution of our multiproduct strategy means better experiences for everyone, reinforcing a dependable and resilient model for all of our stakeholders.\nAs we head into the second half of 2023, Synchrony is well positioned to capitalize on these and other new opportunities while continuing to consistently deliver for our customers, our partners and our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's second quarter results demonstrate the power of our differentiated model. Our broad reach across industries and verticals and the compelling value propositions offered on our products were key drivers of our resilient purchase volume. These core Synchrony strengths, combined with our disciplined approach to underwriting, our diverse funding model and [indiscernible] arrangements continue to provide effective offsets to changes in the macroeconomic environment.\nOn a core basis, earnings receivables grew 15% versus last year. This was driven by a combination of approximately 130 basis points decrease in payment rate and a 6% growth in core purchase volume. Our second quarter pay rate of 16.8% remains approximately 150 basis points higher than our 5-year pre-pandemic historical average.\nNet interest income increased 8% to $4.1 billion, reflecting 19% growth in interest and fees from higher loan receivables and stronger loan receivable yield, partially offset by the impact of divestitures in the prior year period. On a core basis, interest and fees grew 25%, driven by loan receivables growth, higher benchmark rates and a lower payment rate as credit continues to normalize towards pre-pandemic levels.\nOur net interest margin of 14.94% declined 66 basis points as higher funding costs more than offset the benefit of strong loan yields. More specifically, loan receivable yields grew 145 basis points and contributed 124 basis points to net interest margin. Higher liquidity portfolio yield contributed an additional 53 basis points to net interest margin.\nOffsetting these improvements was higher interest-bearing liability cost which increased 263 basis points to 4.04% and reduced net interest margin by 215 basis points.\nFinally, our mix of interest-earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 28 basis points as continued deposit inflows allowed us to build liquidity and prefund anticipated receivables growth in the second half of this year. Our receivables $887 million in the second quarter were 3.85% of average loan receivables. The $240 million decline from the prior year reflected higher net charge-offs and the impact of portfolio sold in the prior year, partially offset by higher net interest income.\nThe RSA continues to provide critical alignment with our partners and stability in Synchrony's risk-adjusted returns as demonstrated through this period of credit normalization and higher funding costs. Provision for credit losses increased to $1.4 billion, reflecting higher net charge-offs and a $287 million reserve build which was largely driven by growth in loan receivables.\nThe decline in other income was driven by $120 million gain on portfolio sales recorded in the prior year period. Other expenses increased 8% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by growth-related items as well as operational losses and technology investments. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter improved by approximately 220 basis points compared to last year to 35.5%. In total, Synchrony generated second quarter net earnings of $569 million or $1.32 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.1% and and return on tangible common equity of 21.7%.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As payment behavior continues to revert towards pre-pandemic historical averages, our delinquency and net charge-off rates continue to normalize towards pre-pandemic performance. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.84% compared to 2.74% last year, which is approximately 60 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.77% versus 1.22% in the prior year, which is approximately 40 basis points lower than the second quarter of 2019. Our net charge-off rate was 4.75% versus 2.73% last year, which is approximately 100 basis points below the midpoint of our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, where Synchrony's risk-adjusted returns are more fully optimized.\nWhile credit continues to normalize in line with our expectations, we're actively monitoring our portfolio and have undertaken some proactive targeted actions to position our portfolio into 2024. These actions have been focused on certain types of inactive accounts as well as segments of the portfolio where we are seeing significant score migration into nonprime and are unlikely to have a material impact on purchase volume.\nFocusing on reserves. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.34%, down 10 basis points from the 10.44% in the first quarter. The reserve build of $287 million in the quarter was largely driven by receivables growth. Our provision did not include any material changes in our qualitative reserves or significant changes in our macroeconomic assumptions.\nTurning to Slide 10. Funding, capital and liquidity continue to be highlights of Synchrony's performance. During the second quarter, our consumer bank offerings continue to resonate with customers. We experienced positive net flows each week, culminating in direct deposit growth of $2.3 billion in the first quarter, which was partially offset by lower broker deposits. Deposits at quarter end represented 84% of our total funding. The remainder of our funding stack is comprised of securitized and unsecured debt at 6% and 10% of our funding, respectively. We remain focused on being active issuers in both markets as conditions allow.\nTotal liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $19.4 billion, up $521 million from last year. As a percent of total assets, liquidity represented 17.9%, down 198 basis points from last year as we manage our liquidity portfolio and fund strong loan receivables growth.\nFocusing on our capital ratios. As a reminder, we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points in January, and will continue to make annual adjustments of approximately 60 basis points each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.\nUnder the CECL transition rules, we ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.3%, 290 basis points lower than last year's levels of 15.2%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.1% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.1% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 220 basis points to 15.2%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 25% last year.\nContinuing our commitment to robust capital returns Synchrony announced approval of an incremental $1 billion share repurchase authorization for June of 2024 in addition to the $300 million remaining on the prior authorization. We also announced our intention to increase the company's common stock dividend by 9% to $0.25 per share from $0.23 per share beginning in the third quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we returned $399 million to shareholders, reflecting $300 million of share repurchases and $99 million in common stock dividends. At the end of the quarter, we had $1 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization.\nSynchrony will continue to execute on our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We also continue to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock. We have a strong history of capital generation and management which is empowered by our resilient business model. Given the uncertainties in both the macroeconomic environment and the financial services industry, Synchrony remains focused on actively managing the assets we originate and prudently managing the capital we generate to optimize our long-term value creation and resiliency.\nFinally, please refer to Slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full year 2023 outlook. We expect our ending loan receivables to grow by 10% or more for 2023, reflecting the combined impact of the payment rate moderation and purchase volume growth. We continue to expect payment rates to normalize or remain above pre-pandemic levels through the remainder of this year. We now expect our net interest margin within a range of 15% to 15.15% for the full year. The interest margin in the first half was influenced by higher liquidity due to stronger-than-anticipated deposit flows and receivables gross prefunding.\nDeposit betas has also trended better than expected in the first half but we have since seen growing competition for deposits. Our revised full year outlook incorporates these first half trends as well as the anticipated impacts of further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve and the possibility of higher deposit betas in the second half of the year. As a reminder, we expect our net interest margin to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, driven by higher liquidity as we prefund growth resulting in variation in the mix of interest-earning assets and interest and fee growth, partially offset by rising reversals as credit continues to normalize.\nTurning to our credit outlook. We now expect delinquencies to reach pre-pandemic levels during the second half of 2023 versus our previous expectation of an approaching peak in mid-year. Net charge-offs should follow a similar but lag progression through the year. Generally speaking, lost dollars will not reach a fully normalized level until approximately 6 months following the peak in delinquencies. Given the slightly more moderate pace of delinquency normalization, we now expect net charge-offs to trend towards the lower end of our prior outlook between 4.75% and 4.90%. We continue to anticipate losses reaching fully normalized levels on an annual basis in 2024.\nWe expect the RSA to trend below our prior outlook and be between 3.95% and 4.10% of average loan receivables for the full year. This improved range reflects the impact of continued credit normalization, lower net interest margin and the mix of our loan receivables growth. And given our higher-than-anticipated growth in the first half, we now anticipate quarterly operating expenses to trend at approximately $1.15 billion for 2023. We remain committed to delivering operating leverage for the full year.\nTaken together, Synchrony's differentiated model continues to power resilient financial results through a range of environments, and we look forward to delivering on our commitments as we close out the second half of 2023.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony's differentiated model has positioned the company well through evolving environments. We consistently power best-in-class experiences for our customers and strong outcomes for our partners even as their needs change. Our business generates strong capital. We are adept at putting that capital to work in an effective prudent manner to deliver sustainable longer-term growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. As I look ahead to the remainder of this year, I am confident in our ability to execute on our strategic priorities and deliver value to our many stakeholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session. ."

Please refer to the company's Investor Relations website for access to their earnings materials. Please be advised that today's conference call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nI will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Today Synchrony reported strong first quarter results, including net earnings of $601 million or $1.35 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 23.2%. Once again, the power of Synchrony's differentiated business model, match with the continued health of the consumers we serve, delivered consistent growth across our diversified set of partners and products.\nOn a core basis, we opened 5.2 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 8% and drove $42 billion in purchase volume, the highest ever for a first quarter. This milestone was achieved with results across each of Synchrony's 5 platforms, highlighting the strength of our diversified model. Health and wellness purchase volume grew 19% compared to last year, reflecting broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account.\nIn diversified value purchase volume increased 16% driven by strong out-of-partner spend, strong retailer performance and penetration growth. The 10% growth in digital purchase volume was broad-based, reflecting growth in active accounts and strong customer engagement. In lifestyle, purchase volume increased 9%, reflecting higher transaction values, primarily in outdoor and luxury. And in home and auto, purchase volume increased 6% due to strength in our commercial products and higher transaction values in furniture and home specialty.\nDual and co-branded cards accounted for 41% of total purchase volume and increased 22% on a core basis, reflecting continued strong response to several new value propositions. Synchrony's record first quarter purchase volume growth is a testament to the utility of our flexible financing solutions, the compelling value propositions we offer and the continued resilience of our customers as they navigate the impacts of inflation and higher interest rates.\nWe regularly monitor our customers' needs and their financial health through our billions of real-time transaction data. Our insights continue to show only minor variations in average transaction value and frequency across spend categories. At a high level, average transaction values and frequency increased in the quarter across both in-store and out-of-partner spend, reflecting the continued impact from ongoing inflationary pressure.\nHowever, growth in average transaction value slowed in March, possibly reflecting the early impact of lower tax refunds. More broadly, the data suggests that our customers are actively managing their budgets as the macro backdrop evolves. We also continue to see some minor seasonal category shifts within our auto partner spend, though the relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary spend remains essentially unchanged.\nMeanwhile, across the spectrum of credit segments we serve, our highest credit grade borrowers continue to shop more frequently and spend more when they do. In the sign of their relative health, the transaction frequency of super prime customers in certain platforms grew at rates lasting during the summer of 2022. Lower credit grade borrowers are shopping somewhat less often. This trend has remained relatively stable since the fourth quarter and follows the payment behaviors of this credit segment, which migrated toward pre-pandemic levels in the second half of last year.\nIn terms of payment behavior, we also continue to see normalizing payment rates across age cohorts and credit bands, which is to be expected as consumers spend their accumulated savings and begin to revolve their balances. Based on the external deposit data we monitor, consumer savings levels continued to decline through March 31, though at a slower pace than we saw through most of 2022. Average consumer deposit balances declined 2% this quarter, though they remain 10% above 2020. As accumulated savings continue to decline at this modest pace, we expect borrower payment revolve trends to further normalize. This, in turn, will drive continued growth in our interest-bearing loan balances, the return of delinquency and credit loss metrics to pre-pandemic levels and better optimize risk-adjusted margins for our business.\nSynchrony's business model is designed to support our customers and partners through changing macro conditions, and in particular, a more normalized operating environment than we've seen since the start of the pandemic. As this progression back to historical levels continues, we are managing the business prudently for the long term while watching trends. With that view and given the stable labor markets and the relative strength of the consumers' balance sheet, we remain positive on the state of the consumer today. Our confidence comes from our decades of experience managing through economic cycles. This experience delivers a model that sustainably serves all of our stakeholders.\nAt the crux of it all is our diversified partner portfolio and product suite, which gives us the tools to deliver consistent, high-quality products and results throughout varying environments. We continue to build on these strengths in the first quarter, as highlighted by our recently announced product launch and the addition of renewal of more than 15 partners. In particular, we launched the Synchrony Outdoors card, which was in direct response to customer and partner demand in our powersports business. Serving as an example of how our platform realignment is enabling Synchrony to rethink how we deliver for partners and customers.\nSynchrony has long provided valuable installment lending solutions for powersports equipment. However, in this market, which is projected to reach $131 billion by 2028, there are significant purchases that occur after the initial purchase, such as accessories, parts, garments, fuel, service and warranties that were not served by the installment lending model we have traditionally offered in powersports.\nOur dedicated platform team with combined experience across partners and products identified this opportunity to meet our customers' demand and drive still greater loyalty for dealers.\nTurning to our health and wellness platform. Synchrony extended relationships with the largest and second largest dental associations this quarter, solidifying CareCredit as the dental financing solution of choice. More specifically, we announced a 10-year partnership extension with the American Dental Association, distinguishing CareCredit as the only ADA endorsed patient financing solution. This endorsement, which dates back to 2001, includes special features and offers for more than 159,000 dentist members and their patients. We also extended our 20-year relationship with the Academy of General Dentistry, remaining the exclusive patient financing solution for the benefits program of the academy's more than 35,000 member dentists. These continued long-standing partnerships underscore the unique value that our integrated care credit offering delivers to both the providers and patients we support.\nAnd finally, we announced renewals across an array of partners this quarter in our home and auto platform, including with Havertys and Lovesac. Synchrony's ability to grow and win new partners as well as diversify our products, programs and markets enables us to drive greater flexibility, utility and value for our customers and partners alike, while also enhancing the resiliency of our business.\nIn summary, I'm proud of the many ways in which Synchrony continues to meet our customer wherever they are looking to make a purchase, a payment or a deposit, as their needs and priorities continue to evolve, Synchrony is ready. Ready to deliver flexibility, value and seamless experiences through more solutions and more locations, along with our industry-leading partners.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance highlighted the continued strength of the consumer paired with the power of our diversified sales platforms, compelling value propositions and prudent financial position. Consumers continue to deepen their engagement with our products.\nOn a core basis, ending loan receivables growth of 16% was fueled by 11% stronger purchase volume along with 3% higher spend per active account. Net interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion as the growth in loan receivables and an increase in loan receivable yields drove 15% higher interest and fees. This was partially offset by the impact of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022.\nOn a core basis, interest and fees increased 23% reflecting the impact of credit normalization as payment behavior trends toward pre-pandemic levels. Pay rate for the first quarter when adjusting for last year portfolio sales was 16.7%, approximately 85 basis points lower than last year and approximately 150 basis points higher than our 5-year pre-pandemic historical average.\nFirst quarter net interest margin of 15.2% declined 58 basis points, primarily reflecting the higher impact of interest rates on our funding cost, partially offset by better yield trends. Loan receivables yield declined 97 basis points and contributed 83 basis points to net interest margin. Incremental liquidity portfolio yield also contributed an additional 54 basis points. These gains were more than offset by higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 219 basis points to 3.43% and reduced net interest margin by 179 basis points.\nAnd our mix of interest-earning assets reduced net interest margin by approximately 16 basis points as we built liquidity to fund anticipated growth. RSAs of $917 million in the first quarter or 4.10% of average loan receivables. The $187 million decline from the prior year reflected the impact of portfolio sold in the second quarter of 2022 and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income. RSAs provide important alignment with our partners and continue to function as designed by providing a buffer to the financial results of the company and supporting greater stability in our returns. This was highlighted in the first quarter as RSA provided a buffer to increased net charge-offs and higher funding costs.\nProvision for credit losses was $1.3 billion for the quarter, which reflected higher net charge-offs and a $285 million reserve build. The build included a consideration for the potential macroeconomic effects of industry credit contraction and the potential impact on consumers, though we do not see any related impacts in our delinquency performance today.\nOther income decreased $43 million driven primarily by higher loyalty costs as well as the impact from investment gains and losses, partially offset by higher debt cancellation income. Other expenses increased 8% to $1.1 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, operational losses and technology investments. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 35% compared to 37.2% last year.\nIn total, Synchrony generated first quarter net earnings of $601 million or $1.35 per diluted share delivering a return on average assets of 2.3% and a return on tangible common equity of 23.2%.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. We continue to see credit metrics performing in line with or better than 2019 performance as credit normalization continues at a measured pace. Delinquency rates remain at approximately 80% of pre-pandemic levels and recent vintages continue to perform better than those of 2018 or 2019.\nThe continued tapering of accumulating consumer savings is contributing to a slow moderation of payment behavior towards prepandemic levels, -- as we noted last quarter, the trend of normalization has gradually shifted into higher credit grades, where balances tend to be larger.\nAs a result, we saw payment rate declines versus prior quarter of approximately 30 basis points while delinquencies and losses increased in line with our expectation. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.81% compared to 2.78% last year or 4.92% in the first quarter of 2019. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.87% versus 1.30% in the prior year or 2.51% in the first quarter of 2019. And our net charge-off rate increased to 4.49% from 2.73% last year, still approximately 100 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%.\nOur allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.44%, up 14 basis points from 10.30% in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase in the reserve rate primarily reflected the impact of the additional reserve discussed earlier and seasonally lower receivables. The allowance also reflects a previously announced $294 million reduction of reserves for troubled debt restructurings recorded through equity as we updated accounting guidance. This guidance has reduced our reserve coverage rate by approximately 30 basis points for the quarter.\nIn the quarter, Synchrony's management of funding, capital and liquidity remained a source of strength. We set and maintain appropriate target levels of common equity, liquidity and reserves. We generally manage our funding strategy to be interest rate neutral and to minimize duration risk. And the vast majority of our liquidity portfolio is in cash and short-term U.S. treasuries, largely maturing in under 1 year. So as depositors across the country navigate the uncertainty of several bank failures and pronounced deposit flows during mid-March, Synchrony Bank was well positioned as a reliable source of stability for both our customers and our business. Our stable direct-to-consumer deposit base is largely insured, with no concentration in geographic areas or high-balance accounts.\nOur outage depositor has banked with us for approximately 5 years, and nearly 80% of our deposit balances are more than 3 years old. The foundation of this loyalty is Synchrony Bank's award-winning platform and industry-leading customer satisfaction scores, depositors are attracted to our seamless digital first experience as well as our competitive rates. In fact, as customers sought to either balance exposure to their banks or remix their balances to take advantage of available FDIC insurance limits during the last 3 weeks of March, Synchrony Bank saw a net deposit inflows of nearly $700 million as we generated double-digit account growth sequentially. This contributed to first quarter deposit growth of 17% versus last year and $2.7 billion sequentially to reach $74.4 billion.\nAt quarter end, over 91% of Synchrony Bank direct deposits were fully insured. And looking at April trends, Synchrony Bank activity has returned to more seasonal flows, highlighted by continued growth in new accounts and deposits. Our deposit base provides a strong foundation for our business, representing 83% of our total funding and is complemented by our securitized and unsecured debt, which represented 7% and 10% of our funding, respectively, and increased by $1.7 billion versus the prior year. This increase included the issuance of 10-year subordinated debt, an important milestone as we continue to more fully develop our capital stack and reach target capital levels.\nTotal liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $21.7 billion or 20.2% of our total assets, up 148 basis points from last year as we grew deposits and prefunded our projected loan receivables growth.\nMoving on to discuss Synchrony's capital position. As we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint banking agencies, Synchrony made its annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics in January, and we will continue each year until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.\nFurther, the TDR reserve reduction mentioned earlier was recognized net of tax and equity adding approximately 25 basis points to our capital ratios. We ended the first quarter at 12.5% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points lower than last year's level of 15%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.3% of the CECL transition rules compared to 15.9% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 180 basis points to 15.4%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.5% compared to 24.5% last year.\nSynchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the first quarter. In total, we returned $500 million to shareholders through $400 million of share repurchases and $100 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $300 million. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan. We'll also continue to seek opportunities to complete our fully developed capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock.\nFinally, please refer to Slide 12 of our presentation for more detail on our full year 2023 outlook. Overall, first quarter purchase volume came in ahead of our expectations, which, when combined with slightly faster payment rate normalization than anticipated, deliver stronger receivables growth for the quarter. As a result, we now expect any receivables to grow by 10% or more by year-end, although we anticipate paying rates ending the year well above prepandemic levels.\nWe continue to expect net interest margin of 15% to 15.25%. This outlook reflects the benefit of favorable trend in our deposit betas and payment rates during the first quarter, balanced by anticipated impacts of the broader market uncertainty. These potential impacts include holding higher liquidity levels in anticipation of growth funding needs as well as competitive dynamics within the industry that could lead to higher betas.\nMeanwhile, credit normalization continues on track in line with our expectations in terms of both our delinquency and loss trends. As a reminder, we expect delinquencies to continue to rise and approach pre-pandemic levels by midyear. Net charge-offs should follow a similar but lagged progression relative to the normalization and delinquencies. Lost dollars will rise through 2023, but will not reach fully normalized levels to approximately 6 months following the peak and delinquencies. As such, we continue to expect the net charge-off rate for the full year 2023 of 4.75% to 5%, and that our portfolio will not reach an annual underwriting loss target range of 5.5% to 6% until 2024.\nGiven our unchanged outlook for net interest margin and net charge-offs, the RSA remains unchanged between 4% and 4.25% of average loan receivables. We remain committed to delivering operating efficiency for the full year with a target of approximately $1.125 billion in operating expenses per quarter.\nIn sum, Synchrony's model is built for sustainable performance at strong risk-adjusted returns as we grow to meet the needs of our customers, our partners and our shareholders. As conditions normalize, we remain on track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony's track record of execution reflects our differentiated approach to serving our customers and our partners and the consistency that generates for our stakeholders. Over decades, through economic cycles and waves of innovation, we prioritize strategies that deliver sustainable, long-term growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nSo as I look forward, I am confident in our ability to continue to adapt and deliver across environments, and I'm excited for the opportunities we see to deliver on our objectives in the year ahead.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn and open up the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nHead of IR, OneMain Holdings, Inc.\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session."

I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony closed the year on a very strong note with fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million, or $1.26 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.2% and a return on tangible common equity of 22.1%. These financial results contributed to full year 2022 net earnings of over $3 billion or $6.15 per diluted share, our second highest in company history, a return on average assets of 3.1% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.5%.\nThis performance was driven by continued strength across the fundamental drivers of our business and a high level of execution across our key strategic priorities throughout the year. We achieved record purchase volume of $180 billion for the full year, which surpassed our prior year's record and was 15% higher on a core basis. Spend per active account was 7% higher for the year, reflecting robust consumer demand across the broad range of products and services for which Synchrony offers flexible financing. We also acquired 23.6 million new accounts and grew average active accounts by 8% on a core basis. The combination of strong consumer spend and some moderation in payment rate contributed to ending receivables growth of 15%.\nAs expected, credit continued to normalize across our portfolio with full year losses of 3%, still more than 250 basis points below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, which is generally the level at which our risk-adjusted margin is more fully optimized. And finally, Synchrony continued to drive progress toward our long-term operating efficiency target, reflecting the combined impacts of our cost discipline, the inherent operating leverage in our highly scalable model and strong revenue growth. Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and strong returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio, our balanced approach to product and credit strategies, our compelling value proposition and the strength of our business model. As a result, Synchrony was able to return more than $3.8 billion of capital to shareholders during 2022, $3.3 billion of which was through share repurchase, a 17% reduction in our shares outstanding.\nWhen we look back on 2022 and the caliber of results, we were able to deliver for our customers, our partners and providers and our shareholders, it really all comes back to the dedication shared by the Synchrony team as we realize our ultimate goal, to power commerce by delivering a leading digital ecosystem, connecting our partners and customers through world-class technology, products and capabilities.\nOver the last year, Synchrony has built upon the core strengths of our differentiated business model by executing on the key strategic priorities that are driving progress towards that collective goal. We continue to expand and enhance our partner programs, including the addition of more than 30 partners and the renewal of more than 50 relationships, including most recently Lowe's, with whom we've partnered for over 4 decades to drive innovation and value to both their do-it-yourself and pro customers. Synchrony also continued to diversify our products, programs and markets during 2022, deepening our reach and expanding the utility and value we offer to our customers and partners alike. We continue to scale our diverse product suite with the launch of Synchrony's Installment and Pay in 4 products at a number of retailers and providers, including Belk and Discount Tire. These 6 pay offerings represent another financial tool that we can offer to qualifying customers while also driving incremental sales to our partners and providers.\nAnd whether it's delivering flexible financing offers in a dental practice, connecting a customer with a large partner through a seamless mobile transaction are driving incremental sales at small and midsized businesses. Synchrony meets our customers, partners and providers wherever they are in their digital or retail journey and deliver the right product at the right time. For this reason, we launched a number of strategic partnerships over the last year to expand our distribution channels and broaden customer access to our comprehensive product suite. Through integrations with point-of-sale and business management platforms like Clover, and practice management solutions like Cycle, Synchrony has added hundreds of thousands of small business locations and several thousand provider locations through whom we can seamlessly and responsibly offer access to flexible financing.\nAt year-end, Synchrony had more than 460,000 merchant provider locations and 71 million active customers. So when you think about the sheer size and scale of the constituencies we serve, and the wide range of financing needs we deliver through omnichannel experiences, it should come as no surprise that our dynamic technology platform is at the center of it all.\nDuring the last year, synchrony continued to innovate and scale our digital capabilities to ensure that we can remain at the forefront of the ever-evolving consumer financing landscape. We drove greater mobile customer engagement through a number of initiatives, including both our digital wallet provisioning and the Synchrony app. Accounts provision for digital wallet use in 2022 increased 75% compared to last year, contributing to 85% mobile wallet sales growth. And in terms of our mobile app, we upgraded our site pipelines to the latest version, which delivers new features, including a new user experience, freeze my card, e-statements, AutoPay, Apply and Apple Pay push provisioning. As a result, unique visitors and payments within the SiPay channel each grew by more than 20% compared to last year.\nIn today's tech forward world, a best-in-class customer experience is characterized by seamless, intuitive and hyper-personalized engagement. This, in turn, requires a more comprehensive understanding of each customer as we connect them with partners and providers and anticipate which products and services will optimize the experience. For that reason, we are constantly driving deeper integrations, leveraging more predictive and actionable insights throughout our digital ecosystem and developing solutions that are grounded in our customer experience insights.\nOver the last year, Synchrony achieved over 70% growth in the number of applications using our APIs and more than 80% growth in API transactions, including from our clients and partners leveraging Synchrony APIs to power their digital experience. Our partnership with PayPal is a great example of how together we continue to leverage more APIs to enhance our offerings and drive an even more seamless experience for their customer. In Q1, we launched PayPal Savings, which enabled instantaneous movement of funds between PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals.\nIn addition, existing PayPal customers are able to quickly and easily open their PayPal savings account inside PayPal's Super App. In Q2, we launched our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal Cashback credit card with a best-in-class cash-back offering and a fully integrated experience within the PayPal app, powered by native APIs. And in Q4, we enhanced our everyday value proposition on the Venmo co-branded card by introducing free person-to-person payments, the 3% fee is waived for the consumer when they use their Venmo Visa. We are really pleased with what the PayPal and Synchrony teams have been able to execute as we grow and evolve in new and unique ways, empower top of wallet products and best-in-class experiences for our customers.\nSynchrony also launched our new cardholder service platform across many of our largest portfolios in 2022. This new platform offers customers the ability to service their accounts in one dashboard, and enables a broad suite of account notifications across every aspect of the credit life cycle. These notifications include a range of instant transaction alerts, all enhanced within rich merchant data and a completely redesigned digital service experience.\nIn addition to text and e-mail alerts, we are able to deliver these notifications and alerts directly within our partners iOS and Android apps by leveraging our patented SyPi platform, continuing to enhance the customers' experience within our partners' brands. While this new account manager is still in its early stages, we observed some strong trends in response to the launch. 60% of those logging in have more than 1 account, and 80% of our users stated that their experience was easy or very easy to use and a top driver of their satisfaction.\nIn fact, this more dynamic interface has achieved a double-digit improvement in our transactional Net Promoter Score compared to our previous account management site. This new platform will span the broad set of financial products that Synchrony offers and will enable intuitive, self-service and highly customized and personalized experiences, increased speed to market of features and solutions for our partners and a more effective way for Synchrony to engage and power and deepen our relationships.\nAccordingly, as we continue to scale and integrate more of our products in the coming year, we believe this enhanced account manager will become an increasingly powerful tool to drive higher quality engagement and deeper value for our customers, partners and Synchrony alike. To that end, we also remain focused on driving greater connectivity across our vast customer and partner basis with the expansion of our Synchrony marketplace. Mysynchrony.com connects customers with information and relevant offers from brands that they trust. These offers are powered by proprietary insights at Synchrony has gleaned through a variety of resources, including online search activity within their shopping category and location to provide personalized offers to the right audience at the right time.\nAs we continue to enhance this level of personalization and launch capabilities, like prequalification within our marketplace over the last year, mysynchrony.com achieved a 25% increase in both new accounts and sales as well as 11% growth in referrals to our partners. This is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster. Synchrony's ability to leverage our marketplaces like mysynchrony.com or carecredit.com to drive new and existing customer traffic as well as incremental and repeat sales to our partners has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator and an important growth driver for our business longer term.\nIn summary, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customers looking to make a purchase or a payment. Big or small, in-person or digitally, we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment. This ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries, partners and providers alike is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow particularly as customer needs and market conditions evolve.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss fourth quarter financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong fourth quarter results demonstrate the power of Synchrony's purpose-built business model at work. The diversification of our portfolio across industries and spend categories supported by sophisticated underwriting and disciplined credit management enabled continued purchase volume growth that surpassed last year's record level. In addition, the alignment of economic interest between Synchrony and our partners through our retailer share arrangements is performing as intended. Excluding the impact of portfolio sales, our RSA declined as credit losses continue to normalize and funding costs began to rise, enabling Synchrony's delivery of consistent, attractive risk-adjusted returns as we have done for many years.\nThe scalability and efficiency of our dynamic technology platform is enabling operating leverage even as we invest in our business. And Synchrony's strong balance sheet continue to support our customers and partners as their own needs evolve. In combination, these business drivers have continued to uniquely position Synchrony in our ability to deliver sustainable outcomes for our customers and our partners and consistent returns to our shareholders even as market conditions change.\nLet's now discuss Synchrony's fourth quarter financial results in greater detail. Purchase volume grew 2% to $47.9 billion, reflecting a 3% higher spend per account versus last year. On a core basis, purchase volume grew 11%. This continued strength in purchase volume was broad-based across our portfolio, demonstrating the breadth and depth of our 5 sales platforms, the compelling value propositions we offer and continued consumer demand.\nAt the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our diversified value, health and wellness and digital platforms and single-digit growth in our home and auto and lifestyle platforms. More specifically, in diversified value, purchase volume increased 15% driven by higher out-of-partner spend in addition to partner performance and penetration growth. The 10% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume reflected the growth in average active accounts and greater customer engagement. Health and wellness purchase volume grew 15% compared to last year as we experienced broad-based growth in active accounts as well as higher spend per active account.\nIn home and auto, purchase volume increased 9%, generally reflecting strong spend in home and higher prices in furniture. And in lifestyle, purchase volume was 2% higher, driven by higher auto partner spend.\nTurning to Synchrony's dual and co-branded cards where we continue to experience strong growth. Core purchase volume on these products grew 21% versus last year and represented approximately 40% of our total purchase volume for the quarter. As we've discussed in the past, our customers derive great value from our dual and co-branded cards because they combine best-in-class rewards with broad utility. Generally speaking, approximately half of our add-on partner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend by billpay, discount store, drugstore, health care, grocery and auto and gas. And while we observed some minor category shifts during December, for example, from T&E related spend towards more clothing and other retail as well as a reduction in auto and gas-related spend towards more grossery and discount spend, Synchrony's relative mix of discretionary and nondiscretionary at-a-partner spend has remained essentially unchanged. Consistently strong consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in payment rate contributed to 10% higher average balances per account versus last year and 15% growth in any receivables. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of core receivables and increased 28% from the prior year.\nNet interest income increased 7% to $4.1 billion, primarily reflecting a 13% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables and higher loan receivable yields, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolio sold during the second quarter of 2022. On a core basis, interest and fees increased 21%. Payment REIT for the fourth quarter, when normalizing for the prior year impact of the portfolios recently sold, was 17%, approximately 75 basis points lower than last year and approximately 160 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average.\nThe net interest margin was 15.58% in the fourth quarter, a year-over-year decrease of 19 basis points. The primary driver of the decrease was higher interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 168 basis points to 2.86% and reduced net interest margin by 136 basis points. The mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 6 basis points. These headwinds were partially offset by a 92-basis-point improvement in loan yields, which contributed 79 basis points to net interest margin, and our liquidity portfolio yields, which contributed 44 basis points.\nRSAs were $1 billion in the fourth quarter and 4.68% of average loan receivables. The $224 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of portfolios sold in the second quarter of 2022 and higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher net interest income.\nProvision for credit losses was $1.2 billion for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a growth-driven $425 million reserve build and higher net charge-offs. Other income decreased $137 million, primarily reflecting the impacts of the prior year's venture investment gain and the current quarter's higher loyalty costs driven by our strong purchase volume. Other expenses increased 3% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by higher employee costs, technology investments and transaction volume, partially offset by $75 million of asset impairments and certain incremental marketing investments recognized in the prior period.\nThe fourth quarter employee cost included certain additional compensation items of $21 million, higher stock-based compensation and higher headcount driven by growth and in-sourcing. Total other expense included $12 million of additional marketing and growth reinvestment from second quarter's $120 million gain on sale proceeds. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, the $120 million gain on sale and reinvestment made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year were EPS neutral for the full year 2022. Our efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.2% compared to 41.1% last year.\nPutting it all together, Synchrony generated fourth quarter net earnings of $577 million or $1.26 per diluted shares. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.2% and return on tangible common equity of 22.1%.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. The external deposit data we monitor continues to reflect a slow reduction in consumer savings. Average deposit balances at the end of December were down approximately 5% from their peak in March of 2022, but still approximately 1% higher than 2021's average and 12% higher than 2020's average. On an annualized trend basis, the savings decline that began around that March 2022 peak appears to have started to slow in December, primarily in terms of its intensity.\nTurning to Synchrony's portfolio, credit normalization continued as expected during the fourth quarter. Fitages are still performing better than 2018 and delinquency entry rates remain lower than the historical average at approximately 80% of their prepandemic levels. That said, as consumer savings rates has decreased, borrower payment behavior is reverting towards prepandemic levels with normalizing entry rates into delinquency and higher roll rates in early delinquency stages following the charge-offs. This trend continued in the fourth quarter as payment rate normalization trends expanded from the nonprime segments of our portfolio into the prime and super prime segments, where the average outstanding balances tend to be larger.\nRelative to period end receivables, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.65% compared to 2.62% last year and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.69% versus 1.17% in the prior year. And our fourth quarter net charge-off rate increased to 3.48% from 2.37% last year, still remaining well below our underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%, at which point portfolio credit risk is better optimized relative to profitability. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.30%, down 28 basis points from the 10.58% in the third quarter, primarily reflecting the impact of an asset growth-driven reserve builds, which was more than offset by the impact of receivables growth in the denominator.\nMoving to another source of Synchrony's strength, our capital, liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of the fourth quarter reached $71.7 billion, an increase of $9.4 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources decreased by $316 million. Altogether, deposits represented 84% of our funding, while securitized and unsecured debt represented 7% and 9%, respectively, at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.2 billion or 16.4% of our total assets, consistent with last year. We maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base and our secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits.\nWe expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding. We manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow our deposit base, and given the level of interest rates, consumers are actively rotating from savings to CDs. This has had the effect of extending our deposit duration while making our balance sheet slightly liability sensitive.\nWe will continue to manage interest rate risk through term maturities. It's also important to note through its mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business.\nMoving on to discuss Synchrony's capital position. Note that we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. As a result, starting this past January of 2022, and continuing in January of 2023, Synchrony makes an annual transition adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics until January of 2025. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.\nIt should also be noted that the FASB CECL update for the accounting of TDRs becomes effective for Synchrony as of January 2023. This accounting standard update eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, which previously followed a separate process using a discounted cash flow methodology to quantify the TDR-specific reserve requirement. Synchrony is adopting this update on a modified retrospective basis as of January 1, 2023. Based on our current estimate, the adoption will result in approximately $300 million reduction to our reserve balance, which we recognize net of tax and equity. The net impact of the adoption will contribute approximately 25 basis point increase to our capital ratios.\nFrom a capital metric perspective, we ended the quarter at 12.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis points lower than last year's level of 15.6%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 13.6% of the CECL transition rules compared to 16.5% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 15%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 22.4% compared to 24.4% last year.\nSynchrony continued our track record of robust capital returns in the fourth quarter. In total, we returned $803 million to shareholders through $700 million of share repurchases and $103 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $700 million. Synchrony remains well positioned to continue to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance, market conditions, regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan.\nAs we make further progress toward our targeted capital levels, we look to develop our capital structure through the issuance of additional preferred stock and the issuance of subordinated debt.\nFinally, let's turn to our 2023 outlook for the full year, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation. We expect strong consumer demand for the wide variety of products and services we finance to support continued broad-based purchase line growth. As excess consumer savings continue to decline, year-over-year purchase line growth rates should slow. Payment rates should also continue to moderate, but we're still expected to remain above pre-pandemic levels throughout 2023. Together, these dynamics should contribute to ending receivables growth between 8% and 10%.\nWe expect our net interest margin to be between 15% and 15.25% for the full year and follow typical seasonal trends. This outlook is based on a peak Fed funds rate of 5.25% and incorporates the following 5 impacts during 2023. One, the increase in interest-bearing liabilities cost due to higher benchmark rates and the potential competitive pressures or higher retail deposit betas to address funding needs; two, higher interest and fee yields, partially offset by higher income reversals as delinquency and charge-offs continue to normalize; three, an increase in our liquidity portfolio yields, primarily reflecting the higher benchmark rates; four, the fluctuation of mix of average loan receivables relative to average interest-earning assets as driven by the seasonal growth trends and timing of our funding; and five, the full year impact of the portfolios sold during second quarter 2022.\nBefore we turn to our credit outlook, it's important to note there are a number of uncertainties that could change our expectations and the trajectory of credit normalization. We have greater visibility for the first half of this year and any significant changes in the medium-term macroeconomic backdrop would more likely impact portfolio credit trends in 2024. With regard to our portfolio's credit trajectory in 2023, we expect most of the portfolio delinquency metrics to have reached normalized levels or equivalent to prepandemic levels by midyear.\nAccordingly, the associated charge-offs will reach prepandemic levels approximately 6 months later.\nThe seasonal impact of tax refunds and bonuses in the first half and the third quarter's acceleration of receivables growth will likely lead to a decline in net charge-off rate for Q3 before credit losses rise and continue the normalization path through the fourth quarter. Given our expectation that delinquency metrics will reach their prepandemic levels by midyear, we expect net charge-offs to be between 4.75% to 5% for the full year, still considerably below our pre-pandemic annual loss rate target of 5.5% to 6%.\nWe run multiple economic scenarios to inform our credit outlook as part of our normal business process. Our baseline reserve assumptions include an unemployment rate of approximately 4.2% by year-end. We have qualitative overlays for the current uncertainty and possibility of a mild recession. In this scenario, we'd expect the unemployment level closer to 5%. This is reflected in our fourth quarter 2022 reserve rate, which is still higher than our day 1 CECL rate. Barring any significant changes in the macroeconomic environment, we do not expect our portfolio to reflect our fully normalized annual loss rate target until 2024.\nAccordingly, we continue to expect reserve builds in 2023 to be generally asset-driven and that the reserve rate will gradually migrate towards approximately 10% as credit normalization brings our portfolio net charge-offs back to that mean annual loss rate to which we've been underwriting. RSA expense will continue to serve as a functional alignment of economic interest with our partners, reflecting the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, offset by rising net charge-offs. As a result, we expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be between 4% and 4.25%. Should credit normalize at a slower rate than we expect, RSAs will likely come closer into the high end of that range. And the extent that funding costs or net charge-off rise to the high end or beyond of our current assumptions, we expect the RSA to come in to the low end or lower than this range.\nIn terms of other expense, we remain committed to delivering operating leverage such that expenses grow at a slower rate than net interest income. Our full year expectation that expenses will run approximately $1.125 billion per quarter. To the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we will moderate our spending where appropriate while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. As we demonstrated throughout this past year, Synchrony's business and financial models are performing as it's designed to do. Our proprietary data and analytics, diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack allow us to reach and improve more customers for the same level of risk while leveraging low customer acquisition costs and driving greater customer lifetime value. Our retailer share ranges are effectively aligning our partners' economic interest with our own, and in doing so, enabling Synchrony to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions.\nAnd our robust balance sheet is providing funding flexibility as we seek to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most. In short, Synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient risk-adjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and partners evolve. We remain on track to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as market conditions stabilize.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Looking to 2023 and beyond, Synchrony is well positioned to navigate the uncertainties of the operating environment that lies ahead. As we continue to leverage our differentiated business model to add new and deepen existing customer and partner relationships, further scale our comprehensive product suite, enhance our programs and expand our markets and deliver best-in-class experiences centered around each customer's individual financing needs. Synchrony will increasingly attract new customers and forge more expansive relationships, support our partners' ability to grow through evolving market conditions and solidify our leadership position as the digital ecosystem of choice, all while driving consistent, high-quality growth at strong risk-adjusted returns for all stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nMargaret M. Keane\n\nExecutive Chair of the Board, Synchrony Financial\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions). The Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session."

Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong quarter of financial results, highlighted by net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 2.8% and a return on tangible common equity of 26.6%. Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent growth and resilient returns is a testament to our well-diversified portfolio, our balanced approach to product, consumer and credit strategies and the strength of our differentiated business model.\nAs we continue to leverage our advanced digital capabilities, expand our reach through new partners and distribution channels and further diversify our product suite, Synchrony further solidifies itself as the partner of choice for retailers, merchants and providers alike. To that end, we added or renewed 15 partners in the third quarter and are excited to be partnering again with Bassett and Floor & Decor.\nBassett has chosen to partner with Synchrony again because they value 3 of Synchrony's core strengths. Our superior customer experience, our advanced data analytics and ability to leverage these data insights to drive growth and the unique marketing opportunities that exist through Synchrony's home network and marketplace, which will enable them to reach more customers and drive growth.\nMeanwhile, Floor & Decor has selected to partner with Synchrony again because of our ability to power a multiproduct offering for both consumers and commercial customers. Floor & Decor is a high-growth retailer and believes that Synchrony is best positioned to help them achieve their objectives.\nSo whether they're looking for advanced data analytics and the powerful network effect of our marketplaces and networks, our seamless omnichannel experiences or our diverse suite of financial products and services, Synchrony is well positioned to deliver strong targeted outcomes for each of our partners.\nWe are increasingly anywhere our customers seeks tailored payment and financing solutions, big or small purchases occurring in person or digitally. We leverage our industry expertise, broad distribution channels and dynamic financial ecosystem to connect our partners with customers whenever and however they want to be met with a broad range of products and services, attractive value propositions and seamless experiences that meet their needs at any given moment. As a result, Synchrony continued to reach and serve more customers in the third quarter.\nOn a core basis, excluding the impact of recent portfolio sales and in prior year periods, we added 5.8 million new accounts and increased core average active accounts by 8% year-over-year. Purchase volume grew 6% to $44.6 billion or 16% on a core basis, reflecting both the increase in accounts as well as higher engagement across those accounts with 8% higher spend per account versus last year. This continued strength in purchase volume was broad-based across our portfolio and a testament to the breadth and depth of our 5 sales platforms, the compelling value propositions we offer and a healthy consumer.\nAt the platform level, Synchrony achieved double-digit growth in our Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness, Digital and Home & Auto platforms and single-digit growth in our Lifestyle platform. More specifically, Home & Auto purchase volume was 11% higher, driven by strength in home, furniture and auto-related spend, as well as the impact of inflationary conditions on inventory, gasoline and automotive parts.\nIn Diversified & Value, purchase volume increased 20%, driven by higher out-of-partner spend, partner penetration growth and strong retailer performance. Lifestyle purchase volume grew 6%, reflecting an industry-specific rebound within Luxury and higher out-of-partner spend more broadly.\nThe 18% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer engagement including higher active accounts and spend per account among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches.\nThe 16% increase in Health & Wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account in our Dental and Pet categories. We are particularly excited about the opportunities we see in our health and wellness platform to reach more patients and provide them with greater access to flexible financing. As health care costs continue to rise and the burden of out-of-pocket expenses intensifies with the growth in high deductible health care plans, there is a clear and growing need for consumers to have access to the financial solutions that empower them with choice, choice in how and when they manage the cost of planned and unplanned medical procedures as well as elective care procedures.\nToday, Synchrony's Health & Wellness platform encompasses more than 260,000 provider locations, 17 health systems and approximately 75% of the country's dental and veterinarian practices through which we are expanding access to patient financing. We are a leader in patient care financing for the last 35 years, yet we know there is still more we can do to expand accessibility to Synchrony's patient financing product suite.\nWe continue to expand our health and wellness partnerships and drive product and experience innovations. We're also broadening our distribution channels to reach and serve more customers through integrations with practice management providers like Epic and health systems like St. Luke's.\nMore recently, we announced our integration with Sycle, the audiology industry's #1 practice management solution. Through this partnership, Synchrony will leverage Allegro Credit's leadership in the audiology industry and deliver a comprehensive set of financing options, including both CareCredit Healthcare credit card and Allegro Credit's Buy Now Pay Later financing solutions to more than 5,000 U.S.-based hearing clinics.\nSynchrony is deeply passionate about empowering Americans to have greater access to responsible and flexible financing options whenever and however they need it. As we continue to add and renew existing leaders in the health and wellness space, including our partnerships with Aspen, Heartland Dental, Sono Bello and American Society of Plastic Surgeons and expand our distribution channels with practice management software like Epic and Sycle. Synchrony is increasingly the financial ecosystem at the center of patients' daily lives, empowering them with choice and best-in-class value propositions that truly make a difference.\nWe believe there is no other consumer lender with the industry expertise, customer and provider reach, our innovative solutions to help close the gap between Americans patient needs and a suite of financial resources to address them.\nTurning now to Synchrony's Dual and Co-branded cards, where we also continue to demonstrate momentum. Purchase volume on these products grew 28% versus last year and represented about 39% of our total purchase volume for the quarter. When tracking average transaction value and frequency trends across the major out-of-partner spend categories of these products, we continue to see robust consumer demand across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories.\nAs we would expect, there have been some modest seasonal shifts among a few of the major categories in favor of more education-related spend and less travel and entertainment spend. Otherwise, transaction values in gas and auto-related spend have continued to show growth in line with gas price trends and inflation, while grocery spend value is running relatively steady with the last few months.\nThe more recent pullback in gas prices appears to have contributed to a slight acceleration in broader discretionary and nondiscretionary spend with categories like clothing, home furnishing and repair, bill pay and auto-related spending experiencing higher transaction value at similar frequency.\nPutting this all together, the daily and monthly touch points that Synchrony has with our customers across a broad range of purchases tells us that consumer health remained strong and supportive of demand. whether they're taking care of everyday essentials like gas, groceries and medical expenses or making more episodic investments like buying a new mattress or replacing a refrigerator.\nOur customers are responsibly accessing financing for their needs, maximizing the value they seek and managing well overall as they navigate the pressures of inflation and the uncertainty of the markets.\nImportantly, Synchrony's customer insights also inform many of the strategies across our business. We utilize this data to deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers, greater outcomes for our partners and more predictive insights for Synchrony as we manage our portfolio to deliver appropriate risk-adjusted returns through cycles.\nOur sophisticated underwriting and diverse product suite allow us to respond quickly to changing consumer behaviors and market conditions. Synchrony combines our scale more than 100 million open accounts and billions of transactions with external data, including utility and telecom information, device identification and usage, cash flow and income data and also with partner data, like frequency and value of historical purchase, all to dimensionalize our customer and their transactions. This enables us to more effectively engage and service our customers, make better credit and fraud decisions, and drive prudent profitable growth.\nOnce our customers begin utilizing our credit products, Synchrony leverages real-time indicators to monitor any shifts in our borrowers' financial well-being, from transaction and payment behavior characteristics to credit bureau alerts. We are closely in tune with our customers and can make both account and portfolio level adjustments quickly.\nAnd of course, Synchrony's responsive digital capabilities are complemented by our fully scaled, highly experienced servicing teams to ensure that our customers have appropriate support when they need it. In short, Synchrony's dynamic technology platform is what powers our ability to have a finger on the pulse of each customer and harness the data into actionable insights so that we can optimize the outcomes for all stakeholders.\nWe are able to say yes to more customers, more consistently and for the same level of risk even as market conditions change. This is what ultimately provides invaluable continuity to our partners and customers and resilient risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the third quarter financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's strong third quarter results reflected continued strength of consumer and broad-based demand for the wide range of products and services that our ecosystem seamlessly delivers. Purchase volume of $44.6 billion reflected a 6% increase compared to last year or 16% on a core basis. Continued strength in consumer spend, coupled with some moderation in the payment rate, contributed to 8% higher average balances per account versus last year and 13% growth in receivables or 14% on a Core basis.\nOur Dual and Co-branded cards accounted for 23% of core Receivables and increased 29% from the prior year. Net interest income increased 7% to $3.9 billion, primarily reflecting a 10% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables, partially offset by the impacts of the portfolios sold during the second quarter of 2022.\nOn a Core basis, interest and fees increased 18%. (inaudible) for the third quarter when normalizing for the prior year impact of portfolios recently sold was 17.6%, approximately 10 basis points lower than last year, while still approximately 200 basis points higher our historical average.\nNet interest margin was 15.52% in the third quarter, a year-over-year increase of 7 basis points. The primary driver of this increase was a 51-basis-point improvement in loan yields, which contributed 42 basis points to net interest margin. Stronger liquidity portfolio yield also contributed 29 basis points.\nThese improvements in our loan and liquidity portfolio yields were partially offset by the anticipated increase in interest-bearing liability costs, which increased 74 basis points to 2.05% in the quarter and reduced net interest margin by 62 basis points.\nThe mix of interest-earning assets also reduced net interest margin by roughly 2 basis points. RSAs were $1.1 billion in the third quarter and 5% of average receivables. The $209 million year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the impact of the portfolio sold in the second quarter of 2022 and program performance.\nProvision for credit losses was $929 million for the quarter. The year-over-year increase reflected the impact of a growth-driven $294 million reserve build this year compared to a $407 million reserve release in the prior year.\nOther income decreased $50 million, primarily reflecting the impact of higher loyalty costs. Other expenses increased 11% to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher employee cost and other expenses. Total other expense included $27 million of additional marketing growth reinvestment of Q2's $120 million gain on sale proceeds.\nAs detailed in the appendix of our presentation, we expect that the gain on sale and the reinvestment made in the second, third and fourth quarters of this year, will be EPS neutral for the full year 2022.\nOur efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 36.5% compared to 38.7% last year. Excluding the effects of the gain on sale reinvestment, the efficiency ratio would have been 35.6% and approximately 310-basis-point improvement versus last year.\nPutting it all together, Synchrony generated net earnings of $703 million or $1.47 per diluted share for the third quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 2.8% and a return on tangible common equity of 26.6%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem.\nSynchrony is consistently able to meet a broad range of our customers' needs while maintaining cost and credit discipline, which allows us to sustainably grow while delivering consistent risk-adjusted returns.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. We continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of our portfolio. The vast majority of our borrowers continue to perform consistently with or better than 2019 performance. We continue to monitor borrower behavior closely and note that consumers are still slowly working through excess savings levels from peak levels.\nThe external data we track indicates due to the combination of summer spending and inflationary conditions, the proportion of customers who receive stimulus payments and have since spent the entire amount has increased approximately 2 percentage points since July, now around 40% compared to 38% a few months earlier.\nThe remaining 60% of customers sold out a portion or all of the stimulus still saved. When tracking consumer savings balance trends by tiers, 0 to 2,500, 2,500 to 5,000 and balances greater than 5,000, the external data suggests that during the course of the third quarter, the top 2 tiers of seamless customers experienced balance reductions of approximately $300, but have begun to rebound, while the bottom here are seen at roughly $100 in runoff.\nMeanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust and portfolio payment rates remain elevated compared to our historical 5-year average. This suggests to us that borrowers generally remain well positioned to support robust demand for goods and services while responsibly meeting their financial obligations.\nTurning to Synchrony's portfolio, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.28% compared to 2.42% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.43% compared to 1.05% last year. Our third quarter net charge-off rate was 3% versus 2.18% last year. This 82 basis point year-over-year increase generally reflected the gradual progression of our credit losses towards our portfolio underwriting target of 5.5% to 6%. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.58%, down 7 basis points from the 10.65% in the second quarter.\nMoving on to another source of Synchrony strength, our capital, liquidity and funding. Deposits at the end of the third quarter reached $68.4 billion, an increase of $8.1 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources increased by $1.6 billion.\nAltogether, deposits represented 82% of our funding while securitized and unsecured debt represented 8% and 10%, respectively, at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $20.3 billion, or 20.1% of our total assets, consistent with last year.\nWe maintain a diversified approach to both our deposit base in secured and unsecured debt issuances and prioritize a strong and efficient funding foundation of at least 80% deposits. We expect to continue to grow our deposits to fund our growth, and we'll maintain an opportunistic approach to secured and unsecured issuances when market conditions are supportive of efficient funding.\nGenerally speaking, we manage our balance sheet to be interest rate neutral. That said, as we continue to grow our deposit base, and actively encourage a rotation from savings to CDs, we're actively extending our deposit duration. As a result, we expect to be slightly liability-sensitive over the near term, while we continue to manage interest rate through term maturities.\nIt's also important to note that through the mutual alignment of economic interest and delivery of a minimum return on assets at the partner program level, Synchrony's RSA will provide some offsetting support to the impact of rising interest rates on our business.\nMoving on to discuss Synchrony's strong capital position. Note, that we previously elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. As a result, starting this past January of 2022 and ending in January 2025, Synchrony makes an annual transitional adjustment of approximately 60 basis points to our regulatory capital metrics. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet.\nWith that in mind, we ended the quarter at 14.3% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 280 basis points lower than last year's level of 17.1%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.2% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 280 basis points to 16.5%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.1% compared to 26.6% last year.\nWe continued our track record of robust capital returns in the third quarter. In total, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through $950 million of share repurchases and $109 million of common stock dividends. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $1.4 billion.\nSynchrony remains well positioned to continue to return considerable capital to our shareholders as guided by our business performance, marketing conditions and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions.\nFinally, please note that our full-year 2022 outlook is outlined on Slide 11, which has been updated in the following ways.\nEnding loan receivable growth versus last year is now expected to be approximately 12% or more, up from 10% plus previously. The net charge-offs will be approximately 3.05% for the full year, down from our prior expectation of 3.15% and RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables will be approximately 5.10% for the full year, down from 5.25% previously.\nTurning to net interest margin in operating expenses. Net interest margin will be approximately 15.55%, up from approximately 15.50% and incorporates our latest view on the interest rate environment and funding needs.\nOperating expenses should continue their quarterly run rate of approximately $1.05 billion, excluding the impact of the gain on sale reinvestment plans which are detailed in the appendix of our earnings presentation.\nTo conclude, Synchrony remains very well positioned to achieve our long-term financial operating targets as the environment normalizes.\nI'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. Synchrony's third quarter financial performance highlighted the benefits of our highly diversified business. Across spend categories, product offerings and distribution channels and through our ever-growing network of partners, merchants and providers, Americans' financial needs are increasingly powered by the Synchrony ecosystem. Our ability to efficiently and dynamically leverage real-time data and deliver optimized financing solutions and experiences for our customers and partners even as needs evolve and market conditions shift is what enables Synchrony to consistently deliver the outcomes that matter most for our many stakeholders. Utility and value for our customers, sales and loyalty for our partners and providers and sustainable growth and consistent risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders.\nWith that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Harmon Miller\n\nSVP of IR, Synchrony Financial\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please start the Q&A session. Thank you."

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.\n\nKathryn Miller;SVP of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.\nFinally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony continued to execute on our key strategic priorities and deliver strong financial results for the second quarter 2022, including net earnings of $804 million or $1.60 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 30.3%. These results were driven by Synchrony's differentiated business model and our deep understanding of the needs and expectations of our customers and partners. Consumer health also remained strong during the second quarter, which supported continued demand for the wide variety of products and services that our partners, merchants and providers offer. As a result, Synchrony added 6 million new accounts, grew average active accounts by 4% and achieved our highest purchase volume ever in a quarter of $47 billion, a year-over-year increase of 12%, or a 16% increase on a core basis.\nDual and co-branded cards accounted for 38% of core purchase volume and increased 31% from the prior year. Consumer spend was broad-based across our platforms, leading to double-digit growth in our diversified and value, health and wellness, digital, and home and auto platforms as well as single-digit growth in our lifestyle platform. We also continue to see higher engagement across our portfolio as purchase volume per account grew by 8% compared to last year. The continued strength in purchase volume contributed to loan receivables growth of 5% year-over-year or 11% on a core basis. Our dual and co-branded cards accounted for 22% of core receivables and increased 27% from the prior year.\nWe'll also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers, thanks to our ability to deliver our seamless experiences, attractive value propositions and broad suite of flexible financing options across our ever-growing network of distribution channels. To that end, we recently announced the launch of Synchrony SetPay Pay in 4 through Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale and business management platform. This buy now pay later offering further expands the suite of payment and financing options and will be part of the Pay with Synchrony app on the Clover app market for merchants. Through our partnership, Synchrony is able to expand our customer reach and distribution through hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the country.\nSynchrony's long-term partnership with AdventHealth, one of the largest not-for-profit health care providers in the U.S., is another example of how we continue to expand and deepen our reach in health and wellness. AdventHealth will offer CareCredit as its primary patient financing option, and will accept CareCredit nationwide in more than 130 facilities, including hospitals, urgent care centers, outpatient clinics and physician practices.\nAs out-of-pocket health expenses continue to rise for consumers, Synchrony's CareCredit is a way for people to pay for care not covered by insurance, including deductibles, coinsurance and co-pays. CareCredit's flexible financing options will be available for all points of care and within the patient's AdventHealth account, which includes Epic's MyChart portal, enabling patients to manage their care needs alongside the resulting financial obligations.\nIn addition to extending options for consumers to pay for care, CareCredit will also help streamline the health systems' payment processes. In short, Synchrony is increasingly anywhere our customer is looking to make a payment or finance a purchase, big or small, in person or digitally, we can meet them whenever and however they want to be met, with a broad range of products and services to meet their needs in any given moment. This ability to deliver the versatility of our financial ecosystem seamlessly across channels, industries and retailers and providers alike, is what positions Synchrony so well to sustainably grow, particularly as customer needs change and market conditions evolve.\nWe have one of the largest active account bases in the U.S. with more than 65 million active accounts. And yet, our typical customer has less than 2 of our products on average. As we continue to expand our distribution channels and more effectively leverage our various marketplaces and networks, Synchrony can connect our partners with more customers and drive still greater lifetime value expansion. Say, for example, our home and auto care networks, where combined annual visits surpassed 300 million last year, and CareCredit.com, which received almost 19 million provider views in 2021 as well as 19 health systems across the country and our strategic partnerships with point-of-sale platforms like Clover. No matter how you look at it, Synchrony is increasingly delivering the power of our networks on behalf of both our customers and our partners. Whether it's through the expansion of our existing customer wallet share or increasing our reach to new customers, we are driving efficient and sustainable growth because of our increasingly ubiquitous presence and the universal utility of our offering.\nFrom revolving lines like our private label, dual and co-branded cards to our broad range of installment offerings and secured and commercial products, Synchrony's financial ecosystem can deliver the right financing offer for the right product at the right time, all while optimizing the value they see. And of course, this is all enabled by our dynamic technology stack. Synchrony has prioritized innovation for many years and have the digital capabilities to facilitate deep integrations with sophisticated partners as well as simple functionality for smaller local businesses. We can be as plug-and-play or as customized as necessary without increasing our level of investment.\nAs Synchrony leverages our proprietary data, analytics and underwriting through these integrations, we deliver not only seamless experiences, but also consistently powerful outcomes for both our customers and partners. The breadth and depth of our consumer lending expertise informs every aspect of our customer and partner strategies and allows us to support them and provide a great experience. The level of continuity that Synchrony provides across channels, spend categories and partners as well as through business and market changes, drives both loyalty and resilience for Synchrony and our stakeholders. From partners with digital omnipresence across spend categories and point-of-sale and merchants that offer great value across discretionary and nondiscretionary needs to providers like doctors and dentists and major health systems like AdventHealth and St. Luke's and practice management software like Epic. Synchrony is increasingly at the center of a broad range of financing needs empowering our customers with choice and best-in-class value propositions that truly make a difference. This drives greater diversity and resilience in our portfolio, both in terms of our sales platforms and the industries we serve as well as consumer spend categories.\nOur customers finance everyday purchases like gas, groceries and routine medical expenses as well as more episodic needs, like buying a new mattress or replacing a refrigerator. They drive great value from our general purpose and dual and co-brand cards, coupled with the best-in-class rewards they can earn on their spend. About half of our out-of-partner spend is comprised of nondiscretionary spend like bill pay, discount store, drugstore, health care, grocery and auto and gas. And of course, Synchrony also derives resilience from our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Our sophisticated data analytics and our proprietary underwriting have enabled Synchrony to reach more customers and offer them greater financial flexibility, while also maintaining or improving upon the predicted level of risk.\nIn fact, since 2009, Synchrony has more than doubled our purchase volume, receivables and interest income while also growing our mix of prime and super-prime customers by 14 percentage points. Meanwhile, we built a very strong balance sheet, including a stable deposit base that represents more than 80% of our funding at any given time, consistent an efficient access to the debt capital markets and a robust capital and liquidity position such that we currently operate with 15% CET1 ratio at 25% Tier 1 and credit reserve ratio. So when you bring it all together, Synchrony is uniquely positioned to deliver sustainable growth and resilient risk-adjusted returns even as market conditions change and the needs of our customers and our partners evolve.\nWe leverage our proprietary data and analytics, diversified product suite and dynamic tech stack to maintain low customer acquisition costs, deliver consistent credit performance and drive greater customer lifetime value. We align our partners' interests with our own through retail share arrangements, which are designed to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns for Synchrony through changing market conditions, while also sharing program profitability with our partners. And we utilize a stable and efficient funding model to provide continuity to our customers and partners when they need it most. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the second quarter financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another strong financial performance for the second quarter, highlighting the benefits of our highly diversified business across our sales platforms, our partners, merchants, providers and customers and underpinned by the continued health of the consumer. This quarter, we achieved the highest quarterly purchase volume as a company, exceeding $47 billion, which reflected a 12% increase compared to last year. On a core basis, which excludes the impact of our recently sold portfolios in the prior and current year quarters, purchase volume grew 16% year-over-year.\nFrom a platform perspective, our diversified and value, health and wellness, digital, and home and auto platforms each continue to generate double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong demand for the variety of goods and services we finance as well as the broad partner, merchant and provider networks that connect our customers and partners.\nAt the platform level, home and auto purchase volume was 12% higher due to continued strength in home as well as higher auto-related spend, reflecting the waning effects from the pandemic period, the preference for consumers to invest in the maintenance of their existing vehicles given the supply chain issues on new and used vehicle sales and the impact of inflationary pressures on gasoline purchases and automotive parts.\nIn diversified value, purchase volume increased 24%, driven by the strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement. The 14% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer engagement, including higher average active accounts and spend per active among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches. The 15% increase in health and wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based growth in active accounts and higher spend per active account driven by our dental, pet and cosmetic categories.\nOur lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of 2%, reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in our music, specialty and luxury verticals, partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in our outdoor vertical and particularly strong growth in the prior year period.\nLoan receivables grew 5% year-over-year to $82.7 billion or 11% on a core basis. We also continue to see sequential growth driven by strong purchase volume and partially offset by higher payment levels. Net interest income increased 15% to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting the 13% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables. Payment rate for the second quarter, when normalizing for the impact of the portfolio sold during Q2, was 18.1%, approximately 20 basis points higher than last year and approximately 250 basis points higher than our historical average. The net interest margin was 15.60% in the second quarter, a year-over-year increase of 182 basis points.\nThe primary driver of our NIM expansion was a 570-basis-point increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interest-earning assets, primarily due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity. This accounted for 105 basis points of the year-over-year increase in our net interest margin.\nIn addition, the second quarter's 80 basis-point improvement in loan yield contributed to a 63 basis-point improvement in net interest margin, while the slight increase in interest-bearing liability costs reduced net interest margin by 1 basis point. RSAs were $1.1 billion in the second quarter and 5.42% of average receivables. The $121 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs and also included an approximate $10 million impact associated with our reinvestment of the gain on sale from portfolios sold during the second quarter.\nThe reinvestment was in support of the growth initiatives in association with the value proposition launch. As a reminder, the RSA is designed to create mutual alignment of interest. While each agreement is unique to the partner program, we generally structure the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside opportunities are shared.\nSo as Slide 7 demonstrates, the RSA enables our partners to share in the profitability of our programs, while also providing economic protection to our business. In a rising credit loss environment, the level of RSA payment to our partner declines because the higher credit costs become a larger offset to the program's profitability. In addition, the minimum profitability threshold within each RSA ensures that Synchrony achieves an appropriate risk-adjusted return before any incremental program economics are shared with the partner.\nThese minimum return thresholds also provide a buffer to our business and the occasional event of a regulatory change such that the profitability of the program performance is impacted by, for example, a change in fees collected. This dynamic also was demonstrated on Slide 7 due to the strength of our risk-adjusted return when the CARD Act became effective in 2011.\nGiven the questions regarding the potential changes to late fee regulation, I thought I'd highlight 2 things. First, over [16%] of our late fee revenue flows through our RSA agreements and will be subject to sharing with our partners. Second, greater than 95% of the late fees are covered through either repricing rights or change in law provisions, effectively change in regulation provisions, which were included in our program agreements adopted after the Card Act was implemented. This is another example of how the RSA function has alignment of interest with our partners as market conditions change.\nNext, let's focus on provision for credit losses, which was $724 million for the quarter, a year-over-year increase due to the impact of a reserve release last year and partially offset by lower net charge-offs. Other income increased $109 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the $120 million gain on sale from the portfolio sold during the quarter. Excluding the impacts of the gain and certain reinvestments of the portion of the proceeds, other income would have been 3% lower year-over-year, primarily due to the impact of higher loyalty costs that were partially offset by interchange revenue year-over-year.\nOther expenses increased 14% to $1.1 billion due to the impact of higher employee costs marketing spend, information processing and other expenses. Our efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 37.7% compared to 39.6% last year. Excluding the effects of the reinvestment expenses deployed from the gain and sale proceeds, the efficiency ratio would have been 36.8%, an approximate 280 basis-point improvement.\nThe increase in employee costs versus last year reflected higher headcount driven by growth and in-sourcing as well as higher hourly wages and other compensation adjustments. Total other expenses included $62 million of costs related to additional marketing and site strategy actions as we reinvest the $120 million gain on sale to these and other growth and efficiency initiatives. As detailed in the appendix of our presentation, we expect that the gain on sale and reinvestment in Q2 and the remainder of this year will net out as EPS neutral on a full year basis.\nIn summary, Synchrony generated net earnings of $804 million or $1.60 per diluted share for the second quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 30.3%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally-enabled model combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Not only were we able to support the strong customer demand with a diverse range of products, but we're able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. At a macro level, we continue to see signs of gradual normalization across the credit spectrum of the portfolio. That said, even with this normalization, our 2021 and 2020 vintages continue to perform better than our 2019 vintages and payment rates remain elevated versus last year as well as compared to our historical average. With regard to delinquency, our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.74% compared to 2.11% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.22% compared to 1% last year. The year-over-year delinquency comparisons were primarily impacted by the prior year period's historic lows, at which point, the impacts of COVID-19 stimulus and forbearance action had the greatest impact on the portfolio.\nOur portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvement in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.73% compared to 3.57% last year, an 84 basis-point improvement year-over-year, primarily reflecting the very strong consumer. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.65%, down 31 basis points from the 10.96% in the first quarter.\nLet's focus on some key trends that continue to support our strong performance and confidence we have in our business. First, the consumer remains in a strong position. The combination of robust labor markets, wage growth and elevated savings continues to support the desire to spend and repay their financial obligations, while also managing through the impacts of the inflationary pressures. According to external data, stimulus spending segments have generally remained consistent from March through June. About 2/3 of consumers have either spent a portion of their stimulus or have the entire amount of stimulus they receive still saved. The remaining 1/3 of consumers has spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last 2 years.\nWhen taking a look across the balance tiers, the top 2 tiers of the stimulus recipients, those with balances above $2,500, have seen modest balance decreases, while the lower tier, balance is less than $2,500, have remained flat. During the second quarter, consumers rotated their spend within discretionary and nondiscretionary categories as they manage higher costs from inflationary pressures while still fulfilling their everyday purchases. In general, we saw a slight variability across our out-of-partner spend volume and frequency trends. These fluctuations likely indicate that the consumer is not actively reducing total spend or frequency, but rather rotating their overall spend. So for example, in certain categories like grocery, it appears that our customer is managing to ticket size and substituting items that are a greater priority, whether that means choosing a generic brand or forgoing a less desired item or treat. In terms of gas station spend, however, average transaction values have accelerated with rising gas prices, but transaction frequency has generally held constant, if not increased slightly. All this is to say we continue to see trends of a strong consumer who is moving through their day-to-day and spending money without meaningfully changing their choices or priorities.\nSecond, the differentiated strength of our business as well as the underlying trends within our portfolio that we have discussed today continue to demonstrate Synchrony's ability to deliver consistent risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions. In addition to the inherent resilience that comes from the diversification of our portfolio across spend categories, financing options, distribution channels and customer demographics, Synchrony derives financial strength through our sophisticated cycle-tested underwriting.\nThe predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities supports more stable loss performance around our target credit loss range of 5.5% to 6% even as economic conditions change and consumer creditworthiness evolves. From 2009 peak loss rate of 10.7% during the great financial crisis, the last decade's average of approximately 4.5% loss level our portfolio has grown and evolved meaningfully. And even as the mix of partners and credit quality of our portfolio has shifted over that same decade, Synchrony has grown significantly and delivered resilient risk-adjusted returns within a band of 8.5% to 11%.\nIt's also important to note that we've delivered these returns even as interest and fees have been coming at somewhat lower levels due to the elevated pay rates during the last 2 years.\nMoving on to another Synchrony strength, our funding, capital and liquidity. Synchrony's balance sheet has been built to be resilient. Over time, we have diversified our business in support of our ability to generate consistent risk-adjusted returns and considerable capital. This in turn has allowed us to grow and evolve our balance sheet such that we can fund growth efficiently without having to make trade-offs with regard to what's in the best long-term interest of our business and our various stakeholders.\nLet's start with the strong and stable foundation of Synchrony's funding or deposit base. Deposits at the end of the second quarter reached $64.7 billion, an increase of $4.9 billion compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 84% of our funding compared to 81% last year, with both securitized and unsecured funding each comprising 8% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $18.9 billion, which equated to 19.8% of our total assets, down from 23% last year.\nAs a reminder, before I provide the details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. The annual transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics. We ended the quarter at 15.2% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 260 basis points lower than last year's level of 17.8%.\nThe Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.1% of the CECL transition rules compared to 18.7% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 270 basis points to 17.4%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 25% compared to 28% last year. We continue to deliver robust capital returns to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we returned $809 million to shareholders through $701 million of share repurchases and $108 million of common stock dividends. When considering our existing capital position today, combined with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business, Synchrony is particularly well positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. As of quarter end, our total remaining share repurchase authorization for the period ending June 2023 was $2.4 billion.\nFinally, let's review our full year outlook, which is summarized on Slide 14 of our presentation and incorporates the following macroeconomic assumptions: 10 interest rate increases during 2022, qualitative tightening measures, a slowing economy resulting from these actions, continued higher inflationary conditions and no additional impacts from the pandemic. We continue to anticipate broad-based strength and purchase volume. As consumer savings declines and payment rate moderates, while on a lag, we also expect purchase volume growth to moderate. Given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we've achieved in the first half of this year, we expect ending loan receivables to grow in excess of 10% versus the prior year.\nTo the extent that payment rate moderates further, we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan receivable growth to accelerate. We expect our net interest margin to be approximately 15.5% for the full year. As we move through the back half, net interest margin will be modestly lower due to the impacts of seasonal funding to support growth. Our net interest margin outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as the increase in interest and fees driven by the primary movement in payment rate moderation. Higher interest and fees will be partially offset by the impact of reversals as credit normalizes and the impact of benchmark rates on funding.\nTo that end, we now expect net charge-offs of approximately 3.15% for the full year, reflecting the strong credit performance we experienced in the first half. As we move through the second half of the year, we continue to expect delinquency to rise modestly. We continue to expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven absent a meaningful change in the macroeconomic environment.\nRSA expense will continue to reflect the impact of strong program performance and robust purchase volume growth, but should continue to moderate as net charge-offs rise. We now expect RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to be approximately 5.25% for the full year.\nIn terms of other expense, we continue to expect quarterly levels to be approximately $1.05 billion. This outlook excludes the impact of the $120 million gain on sale that we are reinvesting in our business this year. As a reminder, we deployed $80 million of the gain on sale proceeds in 2Q and expect to deploy the remaining $35 million to $40 million in the second half, such that the gain in reinvestments will be EPS neutral for the full year. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that our receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we will moderate our spending where appropriate, while still prioritizing the best long-term investments. Examples of such is the opportunity might be to lower the workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spending.\nSo to conclude, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through 2022. We are confident in our business' ability to continue to deliver sustainable, attractive risk-adjusted growth and resilient peer-leading range of risk-adjusted returns, even if market conditions change. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian.

The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2022, including net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share. a return on average assets of 4% and a return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. This financial performance was driven by the core strengths of our business and the continued execution of our key strategic priorities to drive greater value for our partners, providers and customers. We continue to expand and diversify our portfolio during the first quarter with the addition of renewal of more than 15 partners.\nWe also continue to extend our reach and engage more customers, thanks to the powerful combination of our seamless experiences, attractive value propositions and broad suite of flexible financing options. New accounts grew 10% during the first quarter, reaching $5.5 million, and average active accounts increased 6%.\nTurning to customer spend. We continue to experience broad-based demand across the many industries we serve. Purchase volume increased 17% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our diversified value, digital, health and wellness and home and auto platforms. We also continue to see higher engagement across our portfolio as purchase volume per account grew 10% compared to last year. Customer spend reflected strong cross-generational growth. Millennial and Gen Z spend increased 23% year-over-year, and Gen X and baby boomers spend increased 15%. The combination of strong purchase volume and a slight moderation in payment rate drove loan receivables growth of 8% on a core basis. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, including the loan receivables held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 16% from the prior year. In short, Synchrony has continued to see strong engagement across our customer base and momentum across our product suite, thanks to our ability to deliver flexible financing options that specifically address whatever our customers' transactions may look like on any given day, whether they're looking to cover a health care need, purchase supplies for a home repair, or they're simply convenience or value shopping. Our customers can access financing solutions that specifically address their needs while optimizing the value they seek.\nOf course, in an ever-changing consumer landscape, the financing needs and expectations of customers evolve as do the strategic priorities of our partners. To an increasingly greater degree, it's no longer simply about reward points or cash back. It's also about delivering an end-to-end experience where the kind of perks that attract a customer to the product, are designed to anticipate and optimize value. The more dynamic and data-driven those experience and the value propositions are, the deeper the customer relationship and the stronger their lifetime value over time.\nIn order to deliver consistent and compelling outcomes for both our customers and partners, we consistently invest in our digital capabilities, our product suite and our value propositions so that we can continue to meet our customers where, when and however they want to be met. These investments take shape in a number of different ways, whether it's through loyalty, technology or marketing spend, our partners' interests are aligned with ours. So we structured the majority of our economic arrangements such that the investment and upside opportunity are shared. Synchrony's innovative digital capabilities allow us to deeply integrate with our partners and providers to deliver seamless and engaging omnichannel experiences, while also leveraging our data and insights to optimize customer outcomes. In particular, we are often able to develop highly tailored value propositions to attract customers for whom we can predict transaction behavior and financing needs, which ultimately leads to more engaged and satisfied customers, higher spend and better outcomes for all.\nWe are always looking for ways to enhance our program performance. Value proposition refreshes are particularly attractive and effective way to drive deeper engagement with existing customers and attract new customers, resulting in higher lifetime value of each account. We have far more data and insights to leverage based on our experience with an existing portfolio. And since our partners' interests are aligned with ours, the investment costs are generally shared. Simple program enhancements like deeper integrations, more relevant and universal value propositions and greater product flexibility enable us to deliver greater and more utility and value to our customers and stronger results for our partners. Our customers receive greater financial flexibility to address their broad range of needs and make smarter purchases, while also maximizing the rewards they care about. And our partners attract new customers and drive greater customer loyalty, larger ticket sizes and more frequent transactions.\nOur partnership with PayPal is a great example of how, together, we continue to evolve and enhance our offerings to drive still greater outcomes for all. Earlier this month, we announced the launch of our new and refreshed co-branded PayPal cash back credit card. The consumer value proposition is a best-in-class cash-back offering where the consumer will earn unlimited 3% cash back when paying with PayPal at checkout and 2% everywhere else, Mastercard is accepted. The card has no annual fee, no category restrictions and can be added to the digital wallet for easy, fast and secure checkout. We're excited about this opportunity as it delivers exceptional consumer value while leveraging the innovative digital experiences from previously launched partner programs to deliver a truly seamless and elegant customer experience. In particular, the PayPal card experience will be fully integrated with the PayPal app empowered by native APIs. Customers will be able to apply for the card and service their accounts all within the app as well as receive personalized notifications and alerts to manage their credit account.\nThanks to our integration within the PayPal app, customers will be able to redeem their rewards into their PayPal balance to use for future purchases or transfer into their PayPal savings account powered by Synchrony Bank. The rollout of the new product, enhanced experience and value proposition began earlier this month, and we expect it to be fully deployed this quarter.\nGiven the level of integration and functionality we are launching with this card, as well as the best-in-class value proposition we're delivering, we expect to see meaningful growth in new accounts and spend on the card. We're truly excited to continue to raise the bar by consistently investing in and delivering innovative financing experiences for our partners and customers. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the first quarter financial performance in greater detail.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony's first quarter performance reflected continued strength across our diversified sales platforms and, in particular, the powerful combination of our digitally powered product suite, seamless customer experiences and compelling value propositions, which resonate deeply with the needs of our customers and partners. We generated over $40 billion of purchase volume in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a 17% increase compared to last year. From a platform perspective, our home and auto, diversified value, digital and health and wellness platforms each continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong demand for both our products and attractive partner and provider networks.\nAt the platform level, home and auto purchase volume was 10% higher due to continued strength in home and improvement in auto as more consumers return to the road. In diversified and value, purchase volume increased 25% and driven by strong retailer performance and higher customer engagement. The 20% year-over-year increase in digital purchase volume generally reflected the growth across the platform. We experienced greater customer engagement, including higher active accounts and higher spend per active among our more established programs and continued momentum in our new program launches. The 17% increase in health and wellness purchase volume was driven by broad-based strength led by dental given the benefit of increases in patient volume compared to the prior year. Our lifestyle platform generated purchase volume growth of 4%, reflecting strong retailer sales and growth in music and specialty, partially offset by the ongoing impact of inventory shortages in power and particularly strong growth in the prior year period.\nLoans grew 8% year-over-year to $83 billion, including loan receivables of $78.9 million and held for sale receivables of $4 billion. At the platform level, year-over-year loan growth rates accelerated from the fourth quarter as strong purchase volume and some easing in payment rates contributed to balance growth. Net interest income increased 10% to $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting a 7% increase in interest and fees due to higher average loan receivables. On a sequential basis, first quarter payment rate was down approximately 25 basis points to 18.1%, but was still approximately 45 basis points higher than last year and approximately 225 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average.\nAs we progress through the first quarter, payment rate declined to 17.2% in February, but increased in March, reflecting normal seasonality associated with the tax refund season. That said, March was the first month where payment rate was lower versus the prior year since the pandemic began in 2020. Net interest margin was 15.8% in the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 182 basis points.\nThe primary driver of this NIM expansion was a 6.5% increase in the mix of loan receivables relative to total interest-earning assets due to the growth in average receivables and lower liquidity. This accounted for 126 basis points of the year-over-year increase in our net interest margin. In addition, the first quarter's 32 basis points improvement in loan yield and a 33 basis points reduction in interest-bearing liabilities cost each contributed 26 basis points of NIM improvement. RSAs were $1.1 million in the first quarter and 5.4% of average receivables. The $150 million year-over-year increase was primarily driven by the continued strong performance of our partner programs.\nProvision for credit losses was $521 million, an increase of 56% versus last year due to lower reserve release that was partially offset by lower net charge-offs in the first quarter 2022. Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve release of $37 million, inclusive of the reserve reductions from our held-for-sale portfolios of $29 million. Excluding the impact of our held-for-sales portfolios, the $8 million reserve release reflected an improvement in our loss forecast and credit normalization trends based on continued strong performance, partially offset by an uncertain macroeconomic environment. Other income decreased $23 million, primarily reflecting higher loyalty costs due to purchase volume growth. The year-over-year comparison was also adversely impacted by lower investment gains from our ventures portfolio. Other expenses increased 11% to $1 million due to the impact of higher employee, marketing and business development and technology costs.\nOther expense also included the impact of $10 million related to certain employee and legal matters. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 37.2% compared to 36.1% last year. In total, Synchrony generated net earnings of $932 million or $1.77 per diluted share during the first quarter. We also generated a return on average assets of 4% and return on tangible common equity of 34.9%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of the financial products and services we offer through our financial ecosystem. Not only were we able to support our strong customer demand with a diverse range of products, but we're able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 9. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.78% compared to 2.83% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.30% compared to 1.52% last year. When removing the impact of the held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 15 basis points versus 5, and the 90-plus metric would be down about 30 basis points instead of 22. Our portfolio's strong delinquency trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvement in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.73% compared to 3.62% last year, an 89-basis-point improvement year-over-year, primarily reflecting a very healthy consumer and a 45-basis-point higher payment rate. The 36-basis-point sequential increase from our fourth quarter net charge-off rate of 2.37% primarily reflected the impact of approximately 25-basis-point sequential decline in the payment rate as some consumers continued to revert back towards prepandemic payment behaviors.\nOur allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.96%, up 20 basis points from the 10.76% in the fourth quarter.\nLet's focus on some key trends that have supported our strong performance, and the confidence we have in our business. First, as we just discussed, the underlying trends within our portfolio are performing better than our expectations heading into the year. Our portfolio payment trends continue to show gradual normalization across the credit spectrum, reflecting the strength of the consumer more broadly. In addition, the population of customers within our portfolio that are now in post-exploration forbearance programs from other lenders has performed better than our expectations. This suggests to us that with the benefit of excess savings due to stimulus, modified spending behaviors and widespread forbearance, these borrowers manage their personal balance sheet well through the pandemic, and therefore, have a lower probability of default. According to data from (inaudible), 2/3 of consumers have either only spent a portion of the stemless or have the entire amount of stimulus they receive still saved. The remaining 1/3 of consumers have spent the entirety of the cash stimulus they received during the last 2 years.\nWhen tracking consumer balance trends by tiers, 0 to $2,500, $2,500 to $5,000 and balances greater than $5,000, the (inaudible) data indicates that while all balanced tiers of stimulus-receiving customers have seen balance declines between $200 to $300 from peak levels observed last fall, the 2 higher tiers continue to show growth in their savings balances since the third stimulus check. The lower tier with balances of $2,500 or less has generally remained flat aside from the stimulus checks over the last 2 years. Meanwhile, labor markets continue to be robust as unemployment levels decline and wage growth continues.\nThrough mid-April, consumer spending continues to be strong, reflecting broad-based spend across our platforms and products. Finally, our portfolio is well positioned to navigate changing market conditions given its inherent diversification across bank categories, financing options and channels and customer demographics. Synchrony's sales platforms encompass a broader range of discretionary and nondiscretionary industry through a wide network of distribution channels. More than 1/4 of our purchase volume in 2022 came from each of our diversified value, home and auto and digital platforms. Another 8% of purchase volume came from health and wellness. And almost half of our (inaudible) spend in 2022 was comprised of bill pay, discount store, drugstore, health care, grocery and non-grocery food and auto and gas spend. In addition, our disciplined approach to driving consistent growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns means that our portfolio credit mix remains balanced and favorably positioned compared to the mix in the first quarter of 2020.\nAt the end of the first quarter of 2022, approximately 40% of our balances representing super prime customers, another 35% came from prime and the remaining 25% came from non-prime. And in terms of average credit line by credit segment, our portfolio's super prime, prime and nonprime lines are still lower by an average of 8% compared to 2 years ago.\nMoving on to another Synchrony strength, our funding, capital and liquidity. Deposits at the end of the first quarter were $63.6 billion, an increase of $814 million compared to last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.8 billion. This resulted in deposits being 83% of our funding compared to 81% last year, with securitized funding comprising 8% of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $17.8 billion, which equated to 18.7% of our total assets, down from 29.2% last year. As a reminder, before I provide the details of our capital position, it should be noted we elected to take the benefit of the CECL transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies. The impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics. To that end, the first year phasing of the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital resulted in a reduction of our CET1 ratio of approximately 60 basis points in the first quarter.\nWe ended the quarter at 15.0% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 240 basis points below last year's level of 17.4%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 15.9% under the CECL transition rules compared to 18.3% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 250 basis points to 17.2%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 24.5% compared to 28.7% last year. We continue our track record of robust capital returns to shareholders. In the first quarter, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through $967 million of share repurchases and $114 million of common stock dividends. Even when factoring in the roughly 180 basis points of remaining CECL transition impacts on our capital ratios over the next 3 years, synchrony still has considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy in order to get to our 11% CET1 target ratio. This, coupled with the meaningful earnings and capital generation of our business, thanks to our disciplined approach to growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns means that Synchrony is particularly well positioned to execute our capital plan as guided by our business performance, market conditions, and subject to our capital plan and regulatory restrictions.\nAs part of our capital plan, the Board has approved a 5% increase in our common dividend, bringing it to $0.23 per share beginning in the third quarter 2022. In addition, our Board has approved an incremental share repurchase authorization of $2.8 billion for the period ending June 2023. Inclusive of the remaining $251 million authorization we had at March 31, this brings our total share repurchase authorization to $3.1 million. Finally, let's turn to our updated outlook for the full year, which is summarized on Slide 12 of our presentation.\nWe've assumed that the pandemic remains well controlled than any rising cases will not have a material impact on the economy or our customers. Our macroeconomic scenarios include a minimum of 5 interest rate increases during 2022, qualitative tightening measures starting in the second quarter, a slowing economy resulting from these actions and continued higher inflationary conditions. While the macroeconomic environment is uncertain, given the dynamics of the portfolio as we see them today, we do not anticipate a material impact on our full year 2022 outlook for loan receivables and credit performance. We expect consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve. As consumer savings begin to decline and payment rate moderates, while on a lag, we would expect purchase volume growth to moderate as the year progresses. Given the strong purchase volume and loan receivables growth we've achieved, we expect ending loan receivables growth of approximately 10% versus the prior year.\nTo the extent that payment rate moderates further, we would anticipate purchase volume to moderate and loan growth to accelerate. We expect our net interest margin to be between 15.25% and 15.50% for the full year. As we move through the year, NIM will be impacted by the fluctuation in the percentage average loan receivables to average earning assets due to the impacts of seasonal growth, portfolio conveyances and the timing of funding. As mentioned earlier, our NIM outlook also reflects the anticipated impact of rising benchmark rates as well as rising interest and fees, which will be partially offset by higher reversal as credit normalizes.\nIn terms of credit performance, we expect a rise in delinquency and loss from current levels. For the full year 2022, we expect net charge-offs to be less than 3.50%. Based on the performance we've seen across the portfolio, we now expect the portfolio to reach our mean annual loss rate of 5.5% until 2024, unless significant changes in the macroeconomic environment develop. Of course, as credit normalization continues to take shape, we expect interest and fee yields to increase. As charge-offs peak, this growth in interest and fees will be partially offset by peak reversals. We expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven. RSA expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth, but should begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise. For the full year, we expect the RSA as a percentage of average loan receivables to be between 5.25% and 5.50%. As a reminder, we anticipate the GAAP and BP portfolio conveyances to occur in the second quarter, producing a nonrecurring gain on the [sale] of approximately $130 million. We expect to completely offset this gain through increased investments or incurring certain discrete items and thus be EPS neutral for the full year.\nIncluded in this quarter was $10 million of certain employee and legal matters, leaving approximately $120 million of the incremental costs remaining for the full year.\nIn terms of other expense, we continue to expect the quarter levels to be approximately $1.05 billion. This outlook excludes the impact of the $130 million gain on sale we are reinvesting or incurring in our business. We remain committed to delivering positive operating leverage. To the extent that receivables or revenue growth is not tracking ahead of expense growth for the full year, we will moderate our spending where appropriate, while still prioritizing the best long-term prospects for our business. An example of such an opportunity might be through fewer workforce additions or reducing other discretionary spend.\nSo to conclude, Synchrony is operating from a position of strength as we progress through 2022. We're confident in our business' ability to deliver sustainable, attractive risk-adjusted growth even if the market conditions change. Our innovative customer experiences, compelling value propositions and flexible product offerings are resonating across the diverse industries, partners and customer demographics we serve. Our sophisticated cycle-tested underwriting as well as our deep domain experience of lending and servicing at scale, meaning that the predictive power of our credit decisioning and account management capabilities will continue to support the stability of Synchrony's target loss range.\nFinally, our RSA functions as an economic buffer. As interest and fees rise with credit normalization and receivables growth, the RSA absorbed the impact of both rising net charge-offs and a large proportion of any increases in growth-oriented costs. These factors enable Synchrony to deliver consistent results with peer leading range of risk-adjusted returns over time. I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his closing thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. we deeply understand the needs and expectations of our customers and partners, which enables us to deliver financing solutions and experiences that strongly resonate building long-lasting relationships and greater value over time. Synchrony's differentiated business model consistently positions us as the partner of choice. Whether we're powering financing experiences for local merchants, health care providers, our national brands, we're able to meet our customers where, when and however they want to be met. The scalability of our technology platform, the breadth of our product suite and the depth of our lending insights across many industries enables us to consistently deliver sustainable and attractive outcomes for all of our stakeholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Miller\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now begin the Q&A session. (Operator Instructions) Operator, please start the Q&A session."

My name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today. (Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Kathryn Miller. And Katherine, you may begin.\n\nKathryn Miller\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.\nBefore we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.\nDuring the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call. Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit or guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.\nOn the call this morning are Brian Doubles, Synchrony's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Wenzel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Brian Doubles.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. We are really proud of our Synchrony team and the strong level of execution that enabled us to close the year out with such strong results, including several company records.\nOur core strategy to drive sustainable growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns is founded on 3 primary objectives: first, grow our existing partner programs and win new partners; second, diversify our programs, products and markets; and third, deliver best-in-class customer experiences.\nDuring 2021, we added 36 partners and renewed another 38. We're excited about the prospects in both our existing portfolio and new partner pipeline to power innovative financing experiences and serve the ever-changing needs of our customers.\nAs you know, we are constantly seeking opportunities to extend our leadership position and much of that will continue to be driven by the ongoing diversification and expansion of our distribution channels. To that end, we acquired Allegro Credit at the beginning of the year, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer financing audiology products. This acquisition allowed us to deepen our foothold in the health and wellness space, reaching more providers and customers and empowering them with an expanded suite of financing products and services.\nWe also announced our strategic partnership with Clover, which will enable us to deliver our innovative products and experiences to more merchants and customers. As a reminder, our integration with Clover will enable small businesses to access Synchrony financing products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform.\nIn addition, Synchrony continued to expand our 2 main consumer-facing marketplaces, mysynchrony.com and carecredit.com during the year. These marketplaces are broad and deep networks that provide consumers with a one-stop shop to find and shop with merchant partners and providers as well as submit applications and service their accounts. And through the broad reach, easy accessibility and strong utility of these networks, Synchrony is driving strong repeat sales.\nCombined annual visits across these networks surpassed $300 million by year-end, and we drove about 1 million referrals and received almost 19 million provider views through carecredit.com. Repeat sales across our networks were 52% in the fourth quarter of '21. An additional metric that we are focused on driving is sales per active account, which are about twice as high in our CareCredit and home and auto networks compared to the average buy now, pay later products that we see in the marketplace. This is a testament to the deep customer relationships that our network products foster.\nSynchrony's ability to leverage our networks and drive new customers and repeat sales to our partners at higher spend levels has been and will continue to be a meaningful competitive differentiator, an important growth driver for our business.\nAnother element of our continued diversification and expansion over the last year includes our health system initiative, through which we successfully signed 7 new systems, bringing our total to 20. By integrating with health systems through technology platforms like Epic, Synchrony is able to meaningfully extend our customer and provider reach while also enhancing the utility of our CareCredit card.\nFor example, the Epic myChart user base spans about 150 million patients. And by making our patient financing app available within the Epic App Orchard, we're able to provide those patients with expanded access to financing options wherever the provider or health system is part of the CareCredit network across a broad range of needs from elective care to routine medical expenses and nonelective care needs.\nIn an environment where insurance coverage is increasingly limited, but health and wellness needs arising, we are empowering more patients and providers with greater choice, flexibility and utility as we expand our networks and integrate with more health systems.\nSo overall, 2021 was the year in which we accelerated our business strategy. Through strategic partnerships like Clover, we can expand our reach by tens of thousands of new merchants. Through the expansion of our digital networks, we can reach hundreds of millions of consumers. And collectively, the health systems with which we have launched CareCredit and some capacity have over 40 million patient visits.\nNo matter how you look at it, Synchrony is at the center of a large cross-section of commerce in the U.S. regardless of whether the purchase takes place in person or digitally. We connect almost 70 million average active accounts through seamless omnichannel experiences to nearly 450,000 locations, and we power their everyday purchases from furniture and home improvement to health care products and services, car care needs and clothing, jewelry and powersports with customized financing options that optimize value and outcomes for both our customers and partners.\nThe more consumers, merchants, providers and partners that Synchrony reaches the more diverse the demand for products, services and value propositions becomes. So we continue to diversify both our products and programs in 2021 with the launch of our industry-first program with Walgreens and the introduction of our SetPay Pay in 4 product.\nIn addition, we continue to advance the growth of our Synchrony Mastercard, which represents an important opportunity within our product strategy to drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long term.\nDuring the second half of the year, we broadened our Synchrony Mastercard acquisition efforts to include new digital channels, expanding our reach and accelerating our speed to market. With the real-time activity and data capture, along with our sophisticated dApply capabilities, which include advanced prefill and credit decisioning insights, we streamlined the application process and optimized the customer experience. As a result, active accounts grew 11% in the second half compared to the first half of the year. And thanks to the compelling value propositions we offer, our sales per active account grew 18% on the same basis.\nOf course, as we continue to expand our wallet share, Synchrony is able to reach and serve more customers and provide them with more choices and greater value. And as we strive to provide easy and comprehensive access to a broader set of financial products and services, we are excited to launch PayPal savings in the first quarter. Through this expanded partnership with PayPal, we will broaden the distribution of our savings product to reach a unique set of customers with key features and functionality, including instantaneous fund movement between PayPal balances, no withdrawal limits and a savings goal feature to empower customers to set and reach their financial goals. Existing PayPal customers will be able to quickly and easily open their PayPal savings account inside the new PayPal Super App.\nWe're proud to partner in this transformative initiative and remain intensely focused on continuing to elevate the customer experiences we power across all our partnerships. It should come as no surprise that Synchrony's consistent investment in digital innovation has enabled each of our product and partner successes along our evolution. We are continuously enhancing the ways in which we deliver simple and seamless customer experiences because the outcomes are far stronger for all of our stakeholders.\nFor example, during the past year, we upgraded close to 11 million accounts across 14 partners to our new alerts platform, which delivers customizable e-mail, text messages and push alerts with real-time and rich transaction data and notifications.\nWe also rolled out some upgrades to our platform, including several new features like digital wallet provisioning and enhancements to push notifications and e-bill. Collectively, the availability of these features contributed to a 40% increase in unique visitors in 2021 and 56% growth in the number of payments we received in SyPI.\nWith the rollout of enhanced native acquisition capabilities via SyPI and our client mobile apps, we've grown new accounts for that channel by 67% year-over-year. And more specifically, by enabling wallet provisioning for cardholders to add their Synchrony account to their digital wallet, fourth quarter wallet providence grew 32% year-over-year and wallet sales volume increased 63%.\nSo when you put it all together, the unique combination of our deep lending expertise, the industry's most complete product set and our advanced digital capabilities has enabled Synchrony to evolve into a leading financial ecosystem that delivers compelling outcomes for our partners and our customers. There is no other industry provider that offers the full breadth and depth of digitally powered financing products, services and value propositions that Synchrony does today and this ability to connect our partners and customers through best-in-class omnichannel experiences is deeply resonating and driving record results for Synchrony and our stakeholders.\nIn this past year, we achieved almost 25 million new account originations and record purchase volume of $166 billion and a 19% increase in spend per active account. These milestones, combined with strong credit performance and our continued discipline around risk-adjusted returns and expense management, enabled Synchrony to deliver record financial results for the full year, including $4.2 billion of net earnings or $7.34 per diluted share, a 4.5% return on assets and a 39% return on tangible common equity. As a result, we were able to return $3.4 billion of capital to shareholders, including $2.9 billion of share repurchases and $500 million of regular dividends.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian to discuss the fourth quarter performance, which reflected broad-based momentum across our business.\n\nBrian J. Wenzel\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results, reflecting our differentiated business model and the strong partner and customer value propositions, which have been made possible as we execute on our strategic priorities.\nOur net earnings were $813 million or $1.48 per diluted share. We generated a return on average assets of 3.4% and a return on tangible common equity of 28.7%. These strong net earnings and returns demonstrate the power and efficiency of our digitally enabled model, combined with the compelling value of our financial products and services we offer through our ecosystem.\nNot only were we able to support the strong seasonal customer and with our diverse range of products, but we were able to do so while maintaining cost discipline and strong risk-adjusted returns. We achieved record purchase volume of $47 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 18% compared to both last year in 2019, excluding Walmart.\nPurchase volume was up double digits across 4 of our 5 platforms demonstrating clear broad-based strength through the range of diverse industry verticals we serve. Purchase volume per account also increased during the quarter, up 13% compared to last year and 22% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding Walmart.\nDual and co-branded cards accounted for 42% of the purchase volume in the fourth quarter and increased 30% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, including the loans receivable held for sale, Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 25% of the portfolio and increased 10% from the prior year. Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 20%, totaling more than 7 million new accounts in the fourth quarter and almost 25 million new accounts originated for the year.\nAs you may recall, we reached an agreement for the sale of our GAAP portfolio, which represented $3.9 billion of loan receivables in our held-for-sale portfolio at year-end. Continuing our commitment to achieving appropriate risk-adjusted returns, we are discontinuing our partnership with which resulted in the reclassification of approximately $500 million of loan receivables to held for sale in December.\nExcluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, loan receivables would have increased by 4% versus the prior year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. RSCs were $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and 6.15% of average receivables. The $220 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance, including receivables and purchase volume growth as well as the improvement in net interest income.\nFocusing on our credit performance. Provision for credit losses was $561 million. Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve build of $72 million, net of the reserve reductions from our held-for-sale portfolios of $98 million. Excluding the impact of our held-for-sale portfolios, the $170 million reserve build reflected the impact of loan receivable growth within the context of our unchanged set of macroeconomic assumptions and credit normalization outlook, which includes peak loss in the first half of 2023.\nOther income increased $85 million, driven by a $93 million gain in a venture investment. While I will provide more details later on in our discussion, I want to highlight that the majority of the fourth quarter EPS benefit from this gain was offset by unrelated asset impairments and certain opportunistic marketing investments we executed in the fourth quarter.\nMoving to Slide 8 and our platform results. Our home and auto, diversified and value, digital and health and wellness platforms each continue to experience double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume, reflecting strong diversified demand.\nOur lifestyle platform also experienced robust demand as purchase volume increased 6% year-over-year, but faced a tough comparison to last year's strength in power sports volume. Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected the more modest growth versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was partially offset by continued elevation in payment rates. Average active accounts trends range on a platform basis, up by as much as 9% in both diversified and value in digital. Home and auto, lifestyle and health and wellness average active accounts grew in the low single digits or relatively flat.\nThe average active account growth in diversified value largely reflected the stronger retailer performance. Digital active accounts were up versus the prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base and new programs. Interest of fee trends, while generally improved across the platforms, continue to be impacted by elevated payment.\nI'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. The accumulated savings by consumers, combined with seasonally higher holiday transactor behavior, impacted payment rate during the fourth quarter. As we progress through the period, payment rate moderated somewhat from the third quarter levels but increased with the seasonal holiday spend we typically see in December.\nPayment rate for the period was about 180 basis points higher than last year and 290 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average. When tracking the account payment trends from the third to the fourth quarter, we see a slight mix shift away from above and full statement balance payments towards more minimum and below minimum payments. More specifically, the percent of account balance is paying their full saving balance decreased sequentially by approximately 20 basis points and the percent of accounts paying between their minimum payment and their full statement balance decreased sequentially by approximately 70 basis points.\nThe percentage of accounts paying their minimum payment or less than their minimum payment increased sequentially by approximately 90 basis points. We continue to expect payment rate to gradually normalize as customer spend remains robust, the consumer savings read is declining and industry-wide forbearance expires. While it is difficult to predict elevated consumer spending, lower consumer savings, inflationary pressures and return to full financial obligations has begun to impact accumulated savings levels by consumers, which we believe will lead to a moderation in payment rate.\nFourth quarter interest and fees were up approximately 2%, reflecting average loan receivable growth. Net interest income increased 5% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.77% compared to last year's margin of 14.64%, a 113 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs.\nMore specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 500 basis points from 79.9% to 84.9%, driven by average receivables growth and lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 96 basis point increase in our net interest margin.\nInterest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.18%, a year-over-year improvement of 51 basis points, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 42 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The loan receivable yield was 19.61%, a year-over-year reduction of 32 basis points. This resulted in a 26 basis point reduction in our net interest margin.\nNext, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. Elevated payment rates continue to drive year-over-year improvement in our delinquency metrics. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.62% compared to 3.07% last year, and our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.17% compared to 1.40% last year. When removing the impact of the held-for-sale portfolios on our delinquency measures for the fourth quarter of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down approximately 60 basis points versus 45 and the 90-plus metric will be down approximately 30 basis points instead of 23.\nOur portfolio of strong delinquency trends have continued to drive strong year-over-year improvement we've seen in our net charge-off rate, which was 2.37% compared to 3.16% last year, a 79 basis point improvement. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 10.76%, down 52 basis points from 11.28% in the third quarter.\nLet's move to Slide 11 and focus on expenses. Other expenses of $1.1 billion included the impact of $46 million of asset impairments and $29 million of certain incremental marketing investments. Excluding these impacts, other expenses increased 5% compared to the prior year.\nFocusing on employee compensation, fourth quarter was impacted by 2 key factors: one, higher hourly wages as we raised the minimum wage to $20 during the third quarter; and second, higher incentive compensation as 2020 levels were negatively impacted by the pandemic. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 41.1% compared to 37.1% last year.\nExcluding the impacts of the gain on our venture investment, the asset impairments and the incremental marketing investments, the efficiency ratio would be 39.7%. Even with these adjustments, our efficiency ratio remains elevated compared to our historical average due to lower revenue, which has resulted from the impact of higher paying rate and lower average receivables.\nWe will continue to take a disciplined approach to expense management while also maintaining the pace of strategic investments in the business. This continues to be a clear point of differentiation for Synchrony. As we demonstrated through our Investor Day, Symphony leverages our legacy of operating smaller dollar balances to acquire, originate and service our accounts more efficiently than other general purpose issuers. Our cost to acquire is half that of private label peers and 1/4 of the broader industry's average.\nIt's also important to remember that throughout the course of the pandemic, we have maintained a relatively steady level of marketing spend to stay engaged with our customers, much of which is largely contemplated within the RSA. As a result, Synchrony generally does not ramp up our marketing expenses in order to compete for new customers.\nSimilarly, we consistently prioritize investment in our business and technological innovation. The digitally enabled products and services that we offer and the seamless omnichannel experience a power for some of the most sophisticated technology partners in the world would not be possible without our tireless focus and steady investment in innovation year after year.\nSo while the return of our operating efficiency ratio to approximately 32% will primarily be driven by the normalization of payment rate and thus the recovery of revenue, we are confident in our ability to continue to achieve market-leading operating leverage as loan growth continues.\nNow let's move to Slide 12 and discuss another core strength of Synchrony's, our funding, capital and liquidity. Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, coupled with the stickiness of our deposit base, we have generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during the year. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during periods of uncertainty, we've been actively managing our lending profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile.\nAs a result of this strategy, there was a slight shift in our funding mix compared to last year. Our deposits declined by $512 million from last year, and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $1.3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized funding comprising 10% of our funding sources and unsecured funding comprising 9% at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $15.7 billion, which equated to 16.4% of our total assets, down from 24.7% last year.\nBefore I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has 2 primary benefits. First, it delayed the effects of CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment.\nWith this framework, we ended the quarter with 15.6% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 30 basis points lower than last year's level of 15.9%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.5% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.8% last year. The total capital ratio decreased 30 basis points to 17.8% and the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fleet phased-in basis decreased to 24.4% compared to 27% last year.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we will recognize the first portion of the CECL transition adjustment, which reduced our CET1 ratio by approximately 60 basis points. As a reminder, the impact of CECL has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet. This transitional adjustment pertains strictly to our regulatory capital metrics.\nWe continue to execute on our commitment of strong capital return to shareholders by returning $1.1 billion to shareholders in the fourth quarter through $982 million in share repurchases and $120 million in common stock dividends. For the year, we returned $3.4 billion, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and $500 million in common stock dividends.\nGiven the strong performance of our business during the year, our Board approved an increase in our share repurchase authorization through June 2022 by an incremental $1 billion. As of December 31, we had $1.2 billion remaining in our share for perks authorization. We have begun our normal capital planning process, and we'll provide an update to our planned capital actions once approved.\nOur business generates strong returns and considerable capital, reflecting our commitment to drive consistent growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our continued cost discipline. We have considerable excess capital on our balance sheet to deploy either through growth or returns to shareholders. Accordingly, we will continue to take an aggressive but prudent approach to returning capital to our shareholders, guided by our business performance, market conditions and subject to our capital plan and any regulatory considerations.\nFinally, let me focus on our outlook, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation, assumes a stable to improving macroeconomic environment and a well-controlled pandemic. For the upcoming year, we expect consumer demand to remain robust, supporting broad-based purchase volume growth across the various industries and markets we serve.\nAs consumer savings begins to decline and payment rate moderates, we'd expect purchase volume growth to moderate somewhat. We expect our net interest margin to reflect the trends consistent with those during the second half of 2021 and should follow historical seasonality.\nWith the advance of our held-for-sale portfolios in late Q2, we anticipate some excess liquidity, creating a modest headwind to NIM in both the second and third quarters. And as we've done in the past, we will work to reduce this excess liquidity quickly.\nAs payment rates moderate and credit trends normalize through the gradual rise delinquency and loss, we expect higher interest and fee yields to be offset by higher reversals. Our current expectation is that delinquency will peak in the fourth quarter.\nGiven our reserve levels at year-end, we'd expect reserve builds in 2022 to be generally asset-driven and partially offset by the approximate $130 million of final reserve reductions associated with our held-for-sale portfolios. RSA expense will continue to reflect the strength of our program performance and purchase volume growth but should begin to moderate as net charge-offs rise.\nIn terms of operating expense, we generally expect quarterly expense to run in line with the fourth quarter 2021 levels, including the impact of asset impairments and certain marketing items we discussed earlier. And lastly, with regard to our held-for-sale portfolios, we anticipate conveyance to occur in the second quarter, producing a nonrecurring gain on sale of approximately $130 million. We expect to redeploy this gain through completely offsetting incremental investment in our business, thus be EPS neutral for the full year.\nSo putting it all together, Synchrony's differentiated model is powering strong growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns through changing market conditions, and we're emerging from the pandemic with considerable momentum.\nAs we continue to leverage our core strengths, our diversified portfolio, which provides resiliency and sustainable growth, our deep industry expertise, advanced data analytics and digitally enabled product suite, the combination of which enables strong risk-adjusted returns and our scalable technology platform, which powers efficient customer acquisition and servicing as well as swift partner integrations.\nSynchrony will continue to engage more customers, drive greater lifetime value and deliver sustainable growth at peer-leading risk-adjusted returns. So as operating conditions continue to normalize, we remain confident in our ability to achieve the long-term operating metrics we laid out at Investor Day to continue to drive considerable value for all of our stakeholders.\nI will now turn the call back over to Brian for his concluding thoughts.\n\nBrian D. Doubles\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, Synchrony Financial\n\nThanks, Brian. I could not be more proud of the Synchrony team and all that we have achieved this year for our partners, customers and stakeholders. Whether it's been through investments in our digital innovations, strategic partner integrations, expansion into new distribution channels or the addition of new product offerings, Synchrony has continued to evolve and enhance ways in which we connect our partners and customers through our financial ecosystem.\nThis has positioned us as a leader in the digital commerce revolution with very exciting opportunities ahead of us. We will continue to win new partners and renew existing ones. And at the same time, we'll further diversify our programs, products and the markets we operate in. And of course, underpinning it all is our laser-like focus on our integrated product set and providing that best-in-class customer experience that drives value, loyalty and superior outcomes for our partners and customers.\nSynchrony will continue to outperform over the long term, as we provide our partners and customers with the power of choice. As we deliver on our key strategic priorities, we will continue to drive consistent growth at attractive returns and unlock even greater value for our stakeholders.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call back to Kathryn to open the Q&A.\n\nKathryn Miller\n\nThat concludes our prepared remarks. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to 1 primary and 1 follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.\nOperator, please start the Q&A session."

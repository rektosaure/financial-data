Welcome to the Fidelity National Information Services Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the FIS third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nJoining me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and James Kehoe, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by James, who will review our financial results.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language. Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information presented in our earnings release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone.\nI'm very pleased to report we delivered strong third quarter results that exceeded expectations across our key operating metrics. Our performance demonstrates real momentum across the business, with adjusted revenue growth of 6.3%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.8% and adjusted EPS of $1.51, up 8% year-over-year. These are great proof points that our future forward strategy is working. By leveraging our strong foundation, executing to deliver profitable growth, and allocating capital with discipline.\nLet me walk you through what's driving our strong performance. This quarter's 6.4% recurring growth demonstrates the success of our commercial excellence initiatives. We achieved sequential margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points, driven by strong segment profitability across both banking and capital markets. Adjusted free cash flow conversion was 142%, enabling us to increase our share repurchase target to $1.3 billion for the year. These results demonstrate the strength of our execution and validate the strategic investments we've been making to position FIS as a technology company at the forefront of financial services innovation.\nDuring the quarter, we returned $509 million to shareholders across share repurchases and dividends. Most importantly, we're entering the fourth quarter well positioned to achieve our full year 2025 financial goals and move into 2026 with real momentum. Based on our performance and visibility, we're raising our full year outlook for revenue, EBITDA and cash conversion.\nTurning to Slide 6. Now let me talk about what we're seeing in the marketplace. Bank technology spending remains strong, and our clients are prioritized to spend across our high-growth verticals. We digital solutions, payments innovation and lending modernization. We anticipated that AI would transform financial services, but the pace and depth of adoption have exceeded our expectations. In fact, industry surveys indicate that more than 3 out of 4 banks have actively launched our piloting Gen AI and agentic solutions, a market increase from just a year ago. Our clients are leaning in and asking us to help shape their AI journeys, viewing us as a strategic partner. Data powers the algorithms that underpin AI, and for this reason, FIS holds a foundational advantage with over 200 petabytes of data, powering on average 20-plus products per client across the money life cycle. This advantage will grow significantly post acquisition of the credit issuer solutions business, adding almost 1 billion additional accounts to our platform. As the operating environment for banks continues to improve, they are investing with confidence. Consumer spending patterns support this optimism. Debit and credit card spending remains resilient year-to-date, and we're seeing strong account growth across our bank clients. Year-to-date, FIS core accounts are up mid-single digits as our clients continue to grow. We are also seeing an acceleration in bank M&A across the market. The third quarter had the highest level of quarterly bank consolidation in 4 years, driven by a more favorable regulatory backdrop. We expect industry consolidation to continue to be a long-term tailwind for FIS. We're the vendor of choice for financial institutions positioning us to benefit as the industry consolidates and acquirer seek scalable, enterprise-grade technology partners. The acquisition of Credit Issuer Solutions, which we now expect close in the first quarter of 2026, will further strengthen our offerings, providing us with scaled credit processing capabilities.\nFinally, let me address pricing directly. The pricing environment remains stable. Net pricing has been a tailwind for us year-to-date across both banking and capital markets, supported by a continuous product, feature and functionality enhancements that strengthen our value proposition with clients. We operate in a rational market, and we're confident in our ability to continue to price for value.\nLet's turn to Slide 7. Our strong execution and laser focus on helping our bank clients is translating into high-quality sales performance across our business. Our sales pipeline, annual contract value, or ACV, has expanded 13% annually since 2023. And we're deploying AI early in the marketing to sales cycle for lead generation, making our go-to-market motion smarter and more efficient. Renewal retention has also shown steady improvement of approximately 3% in 2024 and 2025. This is a key driver of the accelerating banking growth we are delivering. Net pricing has contributed 60 basis points of growth on average over the last 2 years as we continue to price for value. And in 2025, both segments will have a positive pricing contribution for the year. Recurring ACV, the fuel for future revenue growth has compounded annually at 11%, with particular strength in verticals such as payments, where our network solutions and Money Movement Hub are driving outsized sales growth. Our strategic investments are paying off. Taken together, all these improvements across our sales engine are fueling the durable recurring revenue growth acceleration we're seeing across our business.\nNow turning to Slide 8. We are translating this market momentum into sustained growth in our banking segment, which remains the cornerstone of our business. At Investor Day, we outlined 3 strategic priorities to drive sustainable, accelerating growth, operational excellence, core and digital and payments. On operational excellence, we're maintaining our relentless focus on client experience and sales execution. Happy clients renew, expand and advocate and the numbers I just shared on retention prove we're getting this right. We're achieving this through our investments in AI, which are fundamentally transforming how we operate and improve everything from client support to risk management to product development, modernizing our solutions to help our clients run, grow and protect their businesses more effectively. We're helping clients run their business through intelligent automation, predictive insights and operational efficiencies of the back office that reduce costs and improve service delivery. We're helping them grow through AI-powered personalization and intelligent decisioning that drives revenue and deepen customer relationships. And we're helping clients protect their business through advanced broad detection, real-time risk scoring and behavioral analytics that stop threats before they impact customers.\nLet me next update you on the progress we're making in 2 of our key high-growth vectors. Digital and payments. Beginning with digital on Slide 9. Our Digital business is performing very well with growing traction across both our retail and commercial offerings. The U.S. TAM for digital solutions is $10 billion, growing at approximately 12% annually through 2028. Banks are spending aggressively on digital capabilities and open banking adoption is accelerating. We're capitalizing on this by embedding AI-powered capabilities such as predictive insights and hyper-personalized recommendations into our Digital One platform to deliver a more seamless intelligent digital banking experience. Clients are also prioritizing solutions with seamless integration and robust API connectivity, which are core strengths of our platforms. We've seen over 30% growth in users across our digital platforms, and we see this as a growth engine for our banking segment for years to come. We also had significant competitive takeaways this quarter.\nSMBC MANUBANK, a U.S. subsidiary of Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Corporation, selected our commercial online banking offering, Dragonfly, to help the bank better service enterprise customers. This win displaces a monoline digital competitor and underscores the rationale behind our targeted M&A strategy. As year-to-date, our sales in commercial digital solutions have nearly tripled, with our win rates improving by 13 points with Dragonfly. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of amount, an AI-powered preform providing seamless unified digital account opening capabilities. This acquisition is a perfect example of how we are using AI to help clients grow their business. Amounts Platform fundamentally changes how banks acquire and onboard customers while helping to grow revenue and reduce friction and risk. And we've hit the ground running, signing 7 new deals since closing the acquisition and expanding our relationship with a top 10 U.S. bank.\nNow let's turn to Slide 10. Payments is the other major growth driver and the momentum here is equally compelling. We're operating in a $53 billion U.S. TAM that is growing 5% annually. Card issuing debit transactions remain robust at 6%, providing a steady foundation. But the real market acceleration is in instant payments and digital currencies, which represent the future of money movement and areas where FIS is strategically invested. The complexity of this growing market is creating new opportunities for FIS as banks increasingly rely on us to help them navigate the changing landscape. And we're seeing this in our sales performance. Our payment sales have been outstanding. 53% recurring sales growth year-to-date and a 5% improvement in win rates, in addition to traditional debit and credit offerings, we are leading the way in alternative payments with modernized cloud-native solutions like our Money Movement Hub, which is our core agnostic real-time payment gateway for our clients.\nLaunched just a quarter ago, we're already seeing strong traction with over 40 new clients signed. Additionally, the NYCE network has been a particularly bright spot, with sales more than doubling in a pipeline growth of 3x versus last year. Here again, AI is a critical differentiator. Fraud is one of the biggest threat facing financial institutions today. We're using machine learning and behavioral analytics to detect and met fraud in real time across billions of payment transactions daily. We also continue to expand our capabilities and geographic presence. We recently acquired Everlink to strengthen our payments offering in Canada. And the credit issuer acquisition will add scale in both U.S. and international credit processing and significantly higher cash flow when we closed that deal in the first quarter.\nIn closing, let me bring this all together. FIS delivered a very strong quarter that exceeded expectations. We're seeing favorable market conditions, and we're executing on our strategy as a technology company at the forefront of financial services innovation. This isn't a one-quarter story. We're building sustainable, profitable growth on a foundation of operational excellence, product leadership and client partnership. We're confident in our trajectory and are raising our full year outlook.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to James to walk through the financial details.\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning.\nI'll begin on Slide 12 with a summary of our financial results. We had a great quarter, exceeding our outlook on revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Revenue grew 6.3% to $2.7 billion, driven by outperformance from our banking business and strong recurring revenue growth across both segments. Adjusted EBITDA grew 7.1% with margins expanding by more than 50 basis points. Margins were up nicely in both segments, led by strong execution across our cost-saving programs. Adjusted EPS increased 7.9% to $1.51, led by strong operating growth.\nTurning now to free cash flow. Moving forward, we will report on both adjusted and unadjusted cash flow measures, and I'm happy to report that both are performing well. As we've messaged on prior calls, we are running extensive cash optimization programs, and we drove significant improvements in the third quarter. Free cash flow was $800 million in the quarter and more than doubled year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow was approximately $930 million with cash conversion coming in at more than 140%. While we anticipated a cash conversion of over 100%, the outperformance was driven by accelerated working capital actions, particularly strong results from our accounts receivable initiatives. Capital expenditures were 7.9% of revenue in line with our expectations. On a year-to-date basis, cash conversion was 91%, and we now expect full year cash conversion of more than 85%. And we are well positioned to deliver on our 2026 Investor Day goal of 90%.\nLeverage remains steady at 3x or 2.9x excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. We returned over $500 million to shareholders, including $300 million of share repurchases, and we recently increased our annual target for share repurchases from $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.\nIn summary, we outperformed across all key metrics. Strong execution is driving high-quality growth, and this gives us great confidence as we look forward to 2020.\nTurning now to our segment performance on Slide 13. Adjusted revenue and recurring revenue both grew 6% with strong recurring revenue growth from both segments [Audio Gap] exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Revenue growth of 6.2% was well above the high end of our range, reflecting strong core growth and an MAA contribution of 150 basis points. The performance was led by recurring revenue growth of 6% with strong transaction growth across our payments business in addition to strength in digital banking.\nNonrecurring revenue increased 8%, mostly due to card personalization and deconversion fee timing. Professional services accelerated to 6% growth and net pricing was positive in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. Banking EBITDA margin expanded by 68 basis points, primarily due to a rising contribution from cost saving programs. We expect these positive trends to continue into the fourth quarter and drive even stronger margin expansion.\nTurning now to capital markets. Adjusted revenue growth of 6.4% came in close to the high end of our expectations. M&A contributed 130 basis points, consistent with prior quarters. Recurring revenue grew 7.6% as we saw a rebound of lending activity and stronger momentum in our treasury and risk businesses. Nonrecurring revenue increased 12.6%, reflecting strength in license sales.\nLastly, professional services declined 5.6% due to the timing of some engagements. Capital Markets EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, reflecting higher cost savings, accelerating growth in high-margin recurring revenue and higher in sales. As with banking, we expect segment margins to expand in the fourth quarter.\nMoving now to Slide 14. Year-to-date results are strong with both adjusted revenue and recurring revenue growing over 5%. Banking growth of 4.8% is in line with our increased outlook, and we are confident in delivering a strong fourth quarter. It's a similar story in Capital Markets with year-to-date growth of 6.6% aligned to our full year outlook. Overall, we delivered good results across both segments, and we are executing well on the second half revenue acceleration and margin expansion that we guided to earlier in the year.\nTurning now to our increased full year outlook on Slide 15. We are raising our ranges for revenue and adjusted EBITDA to reflect the stronger operating results and the recently closed amount acquisition. We are raising our revenue range by $65 million at the midpoint, resulting in an adjusted revenue growth of 5.4% to 5.7%, well ahead of our Investor Day outlook.\nFor banking, we are increasing our revenue growth range from 4% to 4.5% to 4.9% to 5.3%, an increase of almost 1%. The recently closed amount acquisition is expected to contribute around 20 basis points of additional growth with stronger operating performance driving the remaining 65 basis point increase. For capital markets, we are updating our outlook to approximately 6.5% to better align with the performance we have seen year-to-date and reflecting a tough comparison in the fourth quarter. We are raising our full year EBITDA outlook to reflect our third quarter performance, and we are updating our margin outlook to include the impact of M&A. Importantly, we are confident in delivering margin expansion across both segments in the fourth quarter.\nLastly, we are tightening our EPS range by $0.02 and reiterating double-digit growth of 10% to 11%. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided updated modeling assumptions in the appendix.\nBefore closing, I wanted to reiterate some points related to the coming year. While tuck-in M&A tends to weigh on margins in the short term. The M&A deals signed in 2024 and 2025 will be accretive to FIS margins in 2026 with further margin benefits in the out years. Because of this and combined with the underlying margin profile of the business, we are confident in delivering margin expansion of greater than 60 basis points in 2026. As you can see, we are driving improved cash conversion, going from 77% in 2024 to over 85% in 2025, and we are on track to deliver 90% conversion in 2026, as our cash optimization initiatives continue to bear fruit. Overall, we are seeing positive revenue trends across the business, and we have good momentum as we exit the year.\nLastly, we're excited the credit issuing acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026 and continue to expect the transaction to be accretive in the first year and add $500 million of free cash flow in 2026, rising to $700 million post integration.\nI'll conclude on Slide 16. In summary, our third quarter results were ahead of expectations, driven by strong recurring revenue and margin expansion from both segments, and we are increasing our revenue and EBITDA outlook for the year for the second time. Free cash flow was exceptional in the quarter, and we are increasing our 2025 cash conversion target to over 85%. We returned over $500 million to our shareholders, and we've increased our full year target to $2.1 billion.\nWith that, operator, could you please open the line for questions."

Thank you for joining us today for the FIS Second Quarter 2025 earnings conference call. The call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation, and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President, and James Kehoe, CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by James, who will review our financial results. Turning to slide three, today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone. I'm excited to share our second quarter results, which highlight the benefits of transforming FIS into a stronger and highly focused company. Let me start with the headline. We delivered a strong quarter led by momentum in our banking business. We are executing on our future forward strategy centered around client centricity, operational simplification, and innovation, creating greater value for both our shareholders and our clients. The numbers tell the story. We delivered strong 5% revenue growth, accelerating from 4% in the first quarter, fueled by our increasing momentum in banking. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA exceeded our outlook with margins, improving 200 basis points sequentially. An adjusted EPS of $1.36 met our expectation. In April, we announced the strategic acquisition of Global Payments Issuer business and the sale of our minority whirlpool stake.\n\nTransactions that align with our operational simplification strategy, while strengthening our financial profile and significantly improving our free cash flow generation. We returned $460 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in the second quarter, and we remain on track to meet our $1.2 billion target for the year. Our strong first half results and implementation pipeline leave us increasingly confident in achieving our increased full-year outlook. Now let's turn to slide six for a discussion on the momentum we are seeing in the market. Our strategic execution is translating into marketplace success across the complete money lifecycle, with several prestigious new engagements including competitive takeaways. Beginning with money at rest, we secured a major consolidation win with two premier Northeast financial institutions coming together to form a $25 billion regional banking leader.\n\nThey selected us as their core provider after highly competitive evaluation, further validating our position as the partner of choice for bank consolidation. Our digital solutions continued their strong sales momentum with double-digit ACV growth in the quarter. A top 20 US bank selected our Digital One offering to assist in streamlining and enhancing its operations, and our Digital One commercial offering was selected by the US subsidiary of a large Asian bank. Moving to money in motion, our Office of the CFO capabilities are resonating across a diverse range of clients. In the second quarter, one of the world's leading energy technology companies selected our award-winning Treasury solution for global cash and risk management needs. Additionally, multiple European banks chose our risk and reporting solutions, including Balance Sheet Manager, for regulatory and compliance needs. Our payments capabilities are also in demand globally.\n\nFor example, a leading South Asia-based bank selected us for its long-term debit processing needs. And lastly, in money at work, we expanded our relationship with a leading financial services technology company through a multi-year commitment on our private equity platform. Our capability in this domain continued to gain momentum across the trading and asset industry, where we are taking our SaaS go-to-market strategy and taking share. Now let's turn to slide seven for an update on the product innovation we are driving across FIS. Accelerating the product flywheel through our build-buy-partner strategy is strengthening our competitive position. We build what differentiates us and buy and partner what accelerates us. And our buy strategy is delivering. The issuer acquisition and whirlpool sale received US regulatory clearance, eliminating any prospect of a lengthy secondary request. We continue to work with international regulators, and the acquisition close remains on schedule.\n\nThis transaction adds best-in-class credit issuing solutions to our end-to-end banking offerings, creating immediate cross-sell opportunity. And complements our broad suite of best-in-class solutions, strengthening our position as the partner of choice with unmatched capabilities across both banking and payments. Additionally, we recently acquired Everlink, a leading provider of integrated payment solutions to Canadian financial institutions, further executing on our international expansion strategy. We have a robust pipeline of M&A opportunities across our key growth sectors, with additional acquisitions expected shortly. Our build and partner strategy is accelerating innovation. In May, we launched our Money Movement Hub, our solution that simplifies payment acceptance and management for banks of all sizes through a universal API, allowing banks to seamlessly integrate with payment networks and manage multiple payment types.\n\nLast week, we announced we're expanding Money Movement Hub capabilities to include digital assets through our partnership with Circle Internet Group, enabling banks to transact in USDC for both domestic and cross-border payments. This perfectly illustrates how our build and partner strategies align to enhance the entire money lifecycle and position us to expand into digital currency. We are driving AI innovation throughout the enterprise. Building on the success of Treasury GPT, we are on track to launch our Banker Assist solution by year-end, the agentic AI platform for commercial banking that embeds intelligent voice-powered assistance directly into client interaction. The response at our Emerald Conference was tremendous, with significant customer interest and pipeline validating this AI investment. In July, we upgraded our Treasury GPT offering with enhanced risk reporting and liquidity management tools.\n\nWe now have multiple AI pilots across banking and capital markets, with additional product announcements coming throughout the year. Our build-buy-partner strategy is accelerating innovation, strengthening our market position, and expanding our capabilities across the complete money lifecycle. In summary, our strategy is working, and our clients are responding. We're confident in our ability to deliver sustained growth, enhanced profitability, and increasing shareholder returns. James will now take you through our financials and increased outlook. James.\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'll begin on slide nine with an overview of our second quarter results. Revenue grew 5% to $2.6 billion, exceeding our outlook thanks to outperformance from our banking business. Adjusted EBITDA also grew 5% and exceeded the top end of our outlook range. EBITDA margin was flat year over year, but improved sequentially by approximately 200 basis points. Adjusted EPS of $1.36 came in at the midpoint of our range, as operational strength was partly offset by higher D&A. Free cash flow was $292 million, with a cash conversion rate of 52%. Cash tax payments were much higher this year, resulting in a 23-point headwind. On a year-to-date basis, cash conversion is 61% compared to 53% in the prior year period, as our working capital improvement programs are starting to drive benefits.\n\nAs a reminder, cash flow is seasonally stronger in the second half of the year, as first half cash flow includes outflows for bonus and higher tax payments. Importantly, we are reiterating our full-year cash conversion target of 82% to 85%. Capital expenditures were $218 million in the quarter, 8% of revenue and in line with our expectations. Leverage increased modestly quarter over quarter to three times.\n\nGuys, can you read the Alice in?\n\nWe can hear you again, sir.\n\nOh, OK. Perfect.\n\nOK, let me try again. Apologies for the technical issues. I think you last heard me finish on leverage. So I'll just start there. So leverage increased modestly quarter over quarter to three times. Excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, the leverage ratio was 2.9 times, and we continue to target a long-term ratio of 2.8 times. Lastly, we returned $460 million to shareholders, including $246 million of share repurchases, and we're reaffirming our $1.2 billion annual target for share repurchases. Turning now to the segment results on slide 10, adjusted revenue growth of 5% was driven by recurring revenue growth of 6%, with recurring revenue at 81% of total revenue. Banking grew 6% in the quarter, coming in above the high end of our outlook range.\n\nThe accelerated growth is primarily driven by an improvement in commercial excellence, including the implementation of previously signed deals and continued strong client retention. The result also includes a 1 percentage point benefit from the shift of some EBT revenue from the third quarter to the second. Recurring revenue growth continued to outpace adjusted revenue, posting a strong growth of 7%. And non-recurring revenue increased 5%, reflecting growth in license revenue. Banking EBITDA margin contracted by 70 basis points, primarily due to a bad debt charge in the quarter. We anticipate a return to margin expansion in the third quarter, with further improvement in the fourth quarter, reflecting an easier comparison. Turning now to capital markets, adjusted revenue growth came in at 5%, slightly below our expectations, with recurring revenue growth of 5%.\n\nRecurring revenue was negatively impacted by a temporary slowdown in our lending business, as we faced lower loan syndication activity as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty. The good news is that we have seen a rebound in July, with lending activity returning more in line with the strong pace we experienced in the first quarter. Capital markets adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 50 basis points, primarily reflecting temporary margin dilution from a prior year acquisition. We are projecting a return to margin expansion in the third quarter. Moving now to our year-to-date results on slide 11. We are pleased with our first half financial results. Year to date, we have delivered steady and consistent results, with both adjusted revenue and recurring revenue growing 5%. Banking growth of 4% is in line with our full-year expectation, and we are confident in delivering accelerating revenue growth over the second half of the year.\n\nIn capital markets, we are pleased with the strong first half growth of 7% and anticipate a step up in recurring revenue growth to underpin the second half performance. Turning now to our full-year outlook on slide 12. We are raising our full-year outlook ranges for revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EPS to reflect a strong second quarter, a recently closed acquisition, and the favorable impact of currencies. We are raising our revenue target by $75 to $85 million, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 4.8% to 5.3%. We now anticipate banking revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, an increase from 3.7% to 4.4% previously. For capital markets, we are reaffirming our outlook of 6.5% to 7%, consistent with the performance we have seen in the first half of the year.\n\nMoving on to adjusted EBITDA, we are raising the low end of our full-year EBITDA outlook by $10 million to reflect the second quarter beat. We now expect full-year margin expansion of approximately 20 basis points, reflecting the margin dilutive impact of updated currency assumptions. While currencies had a favorable impact on revenue of about $60 million, the EBITDA impact was neutral, and this creates a margin headwind of 25 basis points. As such, on a constant currency basis, we are tracking in line with our prior margin expansion goal of 40 to 45 basis points, while also absorbing some dilution from closed M&A. We are increasing the low end of our EPS range by $0.02, and this leads to double-digit EPS growth of 10% to 11%. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided updated modeling assumptions in the appendix.\n\nOne item of note is that we have updated our estimate for non-GAAP cash expenses. The increased outlook reflects $75 million of expense related to the issuer acquisition, as well as an additional $45 million of severance expense as we advance rightsizing initiatives in anticipation of the deal close. Importantly, a higher non-GAAP cash expense will have no impact on our previously communicated capital return targets. Let's now discuss our third quarter expectations on slide 13. For the third quarter, we anticipate revenue growth of 3.8% to 4.4%, with banking at 3% to 3.5% and capital markets at 5.5% to 6.5%. For banking, we are projecting moderating growth entirely due to the 100 basis point shift in revenue from the third quarter into the second.\n\nThis implies a sequential acceleration in fourth quarter revenue growth, but you will recall that we are lapping 200 basis points of negative one-time items, and our commercial excellence initiatives continue to drive improved outcomes. For capital markets, we are projecting third quarter growth of 5.5% to 6.5%, with the high end reflecting current lending volumes and the lower end conservatively assuming a return to second quarter levels. We are projecting adjusted EBITDA margin expansion of 45% to 80 basis points, and this is fully underpinned by cost actions, which have already been executed, and this gives us a high level of confidence. Lastly, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $1.46 to $1.50, representing growth of 4% to 7%, driven entirely by EBITDA growth. I'll conclude on slide 14. In summary, our second quarter results were ahead of expectations, thanks to a strong operational performance from banking.\n\nLooking forward, we are confident in our second half projections for revenue growth and margin expansion, and we have increased our total shareholder return goal to 12% to 13%. Capital returns were $460 million in the quarter, and we are on track to achieve our $2 billion annual target. And lastly, the acquisition of the issuer solutions business remains on track. With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?\n\nThank you. As a reminder, to ask a question, please press star one-one on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, press star one-one again. Due to time restraints, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. And our first question will come from the line of Darren Peller with Wolf Research. Your line is open.\n\nHey, thanks, guys. Nice results. Look, putting aside just the slight pull forward dynamic, banking trends on the recurring side continue to look pretty strong. So maybe help us understand, number one, what the key drivers are, and if you really, if you feel good about the core platforms right now showing sustainability, what's driving the growth and what's driving the what's going to be an acceleration exiting the year beyond just comps. And then maybe add on to that a little bit more around the tuck-in. I think you mentioned just, I don't know if there's anybody who could help us with sizing it, what it did for guidance. That would be helpful to understand as well. But really looking for the key drivers of what you're seeing underneath the business in the banking segment. Thanks, guys.\n\nYeah, Darren, thank you. I'll take both of them, and then I'll have James add on to the specific dollar amount on the acquisition. You're right. We're very pleased with the recurring growth in banking. And I think we've been consistent as we came into the fourth quarter and first quarter that 2025 was going to be the pivotal year where we saw a step up in the recurring banking growth. I would really attribute it to the focus in our commercial excellence pillar in our future forward strategy. So think about net new sales. So we are selling more, and we have been over the last couple of years, and the quality of those sales is strong. So we talked about a couple of years ago, you know, selling not just professional services and license, but really focusing on selling higher margin products.\n\nSo think digital, think payments, think software that is recurring, and that really focusing the business on those new sales. And as a result, seeing a mix out of PS and license into recurring. And we're seeing the benefits of that new sales activity really land in '25 and then will continue in '26. That's one piece of net new sales. The other piece is really focused on retention and high, high levels of retention and making sure that our retention and our compression metrics all stay in line. And I'm just extraordinarily pleased with how well that's going. So you think about higher quality new sales into recurring and then doing a much better job in terms of focusing on high levels of client retention, and you start to really see the momentum we are seeing in banking. And as you know, our sales cycles are fairly long.\n\nSo we have a lot of visibility into the rest of the year, and we're starting to have a high level of visibility of the first half of 2026. So we really like where recurring is going in banking. We're pleased with it. It's exactly where we expect it to be. I do think there was some pull forward in the second quarter, as James recommended, but broadly overall, very happy with where recurring is going. In terms of the tuck-in, maybe I'll just talk about the strategic value, and James can give you the dollar amount. Again, we remain very committed to our buy-build-partner strategy. It's executing very well for us, both in terms of taking advantage of our global distribution and our marquee client set, as we bring different products into the portfolio and lean into them to help us drive growth.\n\nSo very pleased with the acquisition announcement of Everlink. We think it fits very nicely into our payments portfolio, and they're also very excited to be part of the FIS umbrella. We think we can really add distribution and scale for them. In terms of the guidance and the numbers included there, I'll send it over to James.\n\nYeah, Darren. So that's roughly a contribution full year of 20% to 25%. So call it, you know, it's early days yet as we start integrating, and you know, we're stirring closely at this. So it's in or around $20 million. And then to get back what Stephanie said, we did guide at the beginning of the year. Commercial excellence was about 150% of contribution year on year. And we did say roughly split between the contribution of new sales and the significant increase in retention exiting last year and continuing into this year. So both of those are very much on track, with probably retention even slightly higher than our expectations.\n\nThat's great to hear. Thanks, guys.\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Tingjin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\n\nThank you so much. Good morning. Stephanie, I was curious if you're in your client conversations, if you're hearing any potential change in client decision-making given whether it be the macro or all this talk about stablecoin and AI, are you seeing any shift in spending behavior developing at all?\n\nOh, yeah, great question. I think it's definitely we view it as an opportunity. Our clients are very interested in it. I think everybody's looking in terms of the use cases, but certainly, every single financial institution is looking at how they serve their clients and make it available. So I would say demand is much higher, TBD in terms of which use cases take effect. But for us, as we think about FIS, our job is to provide the capabilities out to our clients. And that's why, you know, for us, in terms of whether it's a digital currency or ACH or wire real-time payments, all of that is good for us because we enable all of that. I do see a lot of interest, and there's a focus in terms of, you know, making sure that financial institutions don't fall behind in terms of offerings, large and small.\n\nTBD in terms of how much ultimate demand from the end businesses and consumers, but no bank wants to be left behind in terms of not having a capability.\n\nMakes sense. Thank you.\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho. Your line is open.\n\nHey, guys. Great results as always. I have a quick question and then a quick follow-up. So we noticed the slight or big acceleration in the whirlpool pay growth. So just want to make sure before we get over our skis here, obviously great execution by you guys to make sure you have some comments on how much of it is organic, and then I have a quick follow-up. Thank you.\n\nYeah, thanks, Dan. Appreciate it. So on whirlpool, they were very pleased with their performance. A couple of things. If you think about their growth rates, they're growing over a fairly soft quarter in the second quarter. And so I think it was 2%. So year over year, they had an easy comp. But all hats off to them, quite frankly. They have a couple of things going on. One, there's a bit of seasonality in the business because they do do some tax processing payments in the second quarter. But I would say more meaningfully is really them boarding some pretty big e-com clients that for them is driving some pretty significant growth. So I think they're very pleased. We're very pleased with their outcomes.\n\nI do think it's a seasonally high quarter for them, but you know they are stepping up their expectations in terms of revenue, and I know we're very pleased with it.\n\nGreat. So it looks like a win-win on this deal. Actually, I'll skip my next question. We're good. This was, thank you so much.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Trevor Williams with Jeffries. Your line is open.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back to margins, James. I think the call out you'd made on banking this quarter, there was a bad debt charge. If you could quantify that. And then even with the lower full-year guide, the 20 basis points, it still implies you need margins to be up, I think, just under 150 BIPS in Q4. Just how we bridge to that, the level of visibility there. I know you mentioned some one-time headwinds on the revenue side, but any more help there would be great. Thanks.\n\nYeah, the bad debt was, I was, I think it was about $8 million, so maybe 45 BIPS out of the 70 BIPS year on year. And then there were a couple of allocation changes we didn't mention on the call. So the actual good thing about the banking in the second quarter is the actual, you recall on the first quarter, we had an adverse mix because we were lapping licenses. The mix in banking actually in the second quarter was positive, and it was offset by some of these noisy items in OpEx. So we're actually really pleased with the change in trajectory from Q1 to Q2 on banking. So full steam ahead. And you know, as we look across the rest of the company, we said on the last call, most of our, a large percentage of our cost reduction initiatives are in the second half.\n\nwe're actually accelerating some of our organizational streamlining, as you saw from our comments on one-time expense. So we have brilliant visibility looking forward on the cost program. So we're really happy there. But to get to your question is the Q4, yes, I think the implied margin build is, how much is it? 200 basis points roughly. you recall in the prior year, there was a true up of a termination charge plus some other items for a total of $33 million. We're lapping an easy comp in the fourth quarter, and that accounts for 100 basis points of the 200 basis points. So actually, if you strip out the easy comp from last year, our implied margin in the fourth quarter is about 100 basis points. And we have cost programs stacked up that will probably even over-deliver against that kind of 100 basis point run rate.\n\nSo we have a large degree of flexibility in the second half here. So we're just a, just a, I want to really want to hammer that home. We look very carefully at the implied Q4 guide on margins, and we're incredibly comfortable with the cost reduction set up already.\n\nOK, I appreciate that. Thank you.\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Brian Bergen with TD Cowan. Your line is open.\n\nHey, guys. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on capital markets. So a little bit slower growth in the quarter, but you mentioned, I think it was slower lending syndication and a recovery, I guess, in July. Just how much visibility do you have to the acceleration in the second half? Just talk about conviction in that re-excel. What might preclude a reoccurrence in slower lending syndication? I'm just trying to get a sense of the confidence there as you're forecasting the second half. Thanks.\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. I'll take that. So I think we were very pleased and continue to be very pleased with capital markets. That's why we shared the first half was very strong. If you think of, if you look at it on a year-to-date basis, we have a little bit of ups and downs. So first quarter, if you'll recall, we had a very significant license renewal that drove our non-recurring up, which was strong for us in the first quarter. With respect to the second quarter, we did see some softness, temporary softness in our lending business, largely tied to the slowdown in large financial institutions' loan syndication activity in the second quarter specifically, related to some macroeconomic uncertainty. We saw that slowdown, as James mentioned, and that's really what drove the recurring slowdown from first quarter to second quarter.\n\nThe good news is in July and into August, we've been seeing a very nice rebound in that syndication activity that's back in line with first quarter levels. And we're also continuing to see a strong new sales activity in our lending business. So we did see a, like I said, a downturn in the second quarter. We think it's related to macro, very much related to macro uncertainty. We're seeing that come back up. So that gives us a lot of confidence as we move into Q3 and Q4 with respect to capital markets.\n\nAll right. Thank you. And James, just a quick one on tax. Is there anything from the one big beautiful bill implications on taxes going forward?\n\nYou know, we're in the early stages of assessing it. But just to clarify, there's no impact whatsoever on the effective tax rate. This is the timing of the cash payments. So there's probably some opportunity in the current year. But I would, you know, highlight our prepared comments. Our overall tax payments in the current year are about $100 million higher than the prior year. So it might give some slight relief on that. But I think as you look forward, you could see some slight tax benefit this year, next year, but then it washes itself out of the system, and by 2027, it's broadly neutral, but no impact on effective tax rate. And we're confirming the 12% rate that we guided to at the beginning of the year.\n\nOK, thank you.\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vasu Goval with KBW. Your line is open.\n\nHi, thank you for taking my question. First one for you, Stephanie. Just on the bank M&A activity, that's obviously considered to be a positive for FIS. And we're starting to see some of that play out already with recent bank mergers. Just curious if this space of M&A activity continues. Should we think of that as incremental to your medium-term guide for the banking segment, or was that already contemplated?\n\nIt's a great question, Vasu. I will reiterate what you said. And you know, it's been a thesis for FIS for a long time. We serve the larger financial institutions, and by default, they end up being the consolidators. In addition to that, you know, we have fantastic products and solutions that serve larger financial institutions. We definitely were thrilled with the announcements that have come through already. We continue to be very optimistic. And I think it continues to prove out the competitiveness of the product set that we have and the focus on clients. In terms of whether it's incremental, I would say for the rest of the year, it's whatever M&A activity has been completed. And frankly, a lot of it, we have a lot of view to it as we come into the year, is not incremental. However, you know, things continue to unfold.\n\nAnd as you know, we learn of new things and solidify new things, we'll obviously put it in the guide. But we don't have incremental M&A sitting in this guide per se. And we'll continue to keep you updated as things, if things move up or down on us.\n\nThat's super helpful. And then just one quick one on just the pricing backdrop in the industry. I know some of your peers have called out headwinds on the pricing front in core processing. Are you seeing a change in trend lines? Or any color around that would be helpful.\n\nYeah, I've been hearing that. Our pricing is very consistent. So when you think about it in terms of either what we have to price on new wins or compression, I think what you're hearing from a lot of people is likely challenges in terms of quality of products and then corresponding pricing that they have to take. But you know, from an FIS standpoint, again, we stand very large and scaled. And so we can get pretty price competitive if we need to. It is not impacting our overall revenue. And in fact, I would say we're winning more new business. I think it's a very competitive industry. And it sounds like people are struggling with making sure that they're as competitive as they need to be with the products and the solutions they have. So interesting dialogue, not seeing it show up.\n\nBut again, I'm generally larger and have more scale, so can absorb that. And then in combination with a very competitive product set tends to come in our favor.\n\nYeah, and just to give you the stats on that, both businesses had positive net pricing. Banking in the quarter, banking was up slightly. And capital market was similar to the historic trends of somewhere between 1% to 2% of net pricing after compression. So we've seen no material change in the direction of travel on either of the businesses.\n\nGreat. Thank you for the color.\n\nAnd one moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\n\nThank you so much. I want to follow up on Vasu's question or basic question, particularly as it relates to pipeline, et cetera. I'm wondering if we're seeing banks kind of evolve their roadmap or what they're looking for from FIS. I think one of the things that's always striking about the banking industry is that it, for a variety of reasons, we haven't seen the move to cloud and public cloud type solutions. Is that something your customers are beginning to talk to you about? And what are the hurdles that we could see, or you think we can clear to start to evolve some of the product portfolio even faster on a go-forward rate, especially given all the changes with new technologies that they're bringing to the market you're talking about?\n\nYeah, it's a great question. I would say it depends on the size of bank. So let's start with the smaller banks. So in the smaller bank standpoint, I don't see roadmap evolution per se, meaning they're looking for FIS to provide them with their modernization journey. We've already put all of our clients generally in the cloud. So that's generally done for us. And then as we think about modernizing them, which modernization generally is about componentization of the core. So pulling out different pieces of the core and hollowing it out is the way banks generally look at it. I think there's been a desire to do that for, you know, over the last seven to 10 years. I do think the market is moving whereby they don't want to do a big bang approach. And this is more larger financial institutions.\n\nAnd in the larger financial institution standpoint, there is a desire to do more componentized and come out with products and solutions and deliver value more quickly than a big bang core conversion. So I do think that the large financial institution business is evolving, even from five years ago where they wanted to move everything at once. They want to move things more in pieces and parts and deliver value out to their customer set in smaller chunks. So I think that the buying pattern is changing. With respect to FIS, as you know, we have a very significant large financial institution base. And so we have the benefit of working with them very directly and understanding as they change their roadmaps from whether it's one single move to, you know, a componentization.\n\nAnd our job and where we feel really good about our core strategy is that is overall driving our product roadmap. So we do have the ability, and the majority of our clients on MVP have different capabilities on MVP, whether it's digital banking, whether it is a checking account, a money movement account, a CD account. We are seeing banks move in this direction, and our core capabilities have the ability to do that. It's obviously all cloud-generated. I do think the new technology coming in is super interesting. I'm not sure that it's really interesting with respect to, you know, how these banks want to move, but more importantly, maybe more around how they serve their clients with GenAI, thinking about digital banking, et cetera. But that's probably a conversation for another day. So I guess great question.\n\nI think the pipeline remains strong, like I said, which is really helping us drive the momentum in banking. I think the large financial institution base is taking a different approach. I think our core modernization and banking modernization strategy is delivering on that and continues to give us a bunch of opportunity as we think about '26 and '27.\n\nThanks so much for the comments, Stephanie. Have a good day.\n\nYou bet.\n\nOne moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ken Suchoski with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\n\nHey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on, I guess, capital markets. I mean, I heard the lower loan syndication activity, but it looks like the organic growth slowed, I think it was by like 3% to 4% points. So I was just curious, like how much of the slowdown was due to the lower loan activity versus other factors? Just seems like a pretty big driver there, a big business overall, if it was 3% to 4% points of slowdown. And then just on the 200 basis points of one-time items, I think that was in banking revenue growth in the prior year. Just trying to understand what that was. Thank you.\n\nYeah, maybe I'll start on capital markets, and I'll let James lean in. On the capital markets piece, if you go back and you look at the Q1 to Q2 growth, and you really focus on recurring first, you know, recurring had about 100 basis points slowdown. And that's really related to the loan syndication activity we talked about, which was macro. And the good news is that that is coming back. And you can expect to see that recurring growth return in the back half of the year. I think the rest of the difference is around just license activity through capital markets. The first quarter, if you look at it, had a very significant license renewal. There's just some timing around when license renewals happen each year.\n\nSo you can see the revenue growth of capital markets in total was up significantly, but it was on the back of a really large renewal for a license. So I think, you know, as you think about the different pieces, I think we feel really good about capital markets recurring, which is, again, talking about the health of the business. And then there's clearly some lumpiness as we go throughout the year in terms of licenses based on renewals and sales. But even leaning into the back half of this year, the expectations around the license and nonprofessional services are right in line with where we've been historically. James, I don't know if you're.\n\nYeah, remember what we said on the first quarter call when we did a 9 on capital markets? We said that wasn't a trend rate. And then two is it was fundamentally, it was coming from a 47% increase in the non-recurring, which essentially is the license business. And you know, while we're inclined to, but maybe one way to look at this is the overall year-to-date on capital markets is up just just just south of 7%. And that's probably a good way to look at the remainder of the year. You know, as you look at it, and the rest of the year, recurring will accelerate somewhat because, you know, we saw a dramatic rebound actually in July on the lending business. The business almost doubled versus prior year. So we've recovered very, very strongly. So that will add a point in the successive quarter.\n\nAnd then licenses will continue to grow in the second half, but at a slower pace. We're not going to be repeating the 47% because that had a lot of renewals in the quarter. And then professional services will probably accelerate slightly. We've good line of sight to the implementation schedule. So we're very comfortable with the full-year outlook on capital markets.\n\nAnd then can maybe repeat your banking question.\n\nOh, yeah, your banking question then, what were these items that were lapping? So this was fourth quarter. There were two items. There was a termination fee reversal, and that was $20 million. And the other one was an adjustment relating to customer contracts of $13 million. So a total of $33. So as you look at the fourth quarter, it's a 200 basis point, call it tailwind on revenue, and it's 105 BIPS on margins. And both of these items are at 100% margin. They're at 100% margin.\n\nOK. All right. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you.\n\nThank you. One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Chris Kennedy with William Blair. Your line is open.\n\nGood morning. Thanks for taking the question. Stephanie, you mentioned the Everlink acquisition. Can you just give us an update on the international strategy?\n\nSure. That's a great point. So Everlink, obviously, is a natural extension for us in payments, right in line with what we do in Canada. I think as you think about our international strategy, there's really two things that are going to significantly continue to advance it. One is the Everlink acquisition, but then also as you think about the issuer acquisition from Global Payments. Both are quite international and will advance our international footprint in specifically adding payments capabilities internationally. So that's really good for us as we think about broadening out and building momentum in our payments business, both in terms of the US, but also rest of the world, where we continue to see a lot of momentum, a lot of demand, and where we're not nearly as concentrated.\n\nAnd so both of these, again, are great products and solutions that can come in and really take advantage of our really scaled distribution channel. So very excited about both.\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking the question.\n\nThank you. And we do have time for one last question. And that will come from the line of Matt Coad with Truist. Your line is open.\n\nHi. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question here. I just wanted to go back to the capital markets question a bit, just in light of the weaker loan syndication activity impacting recurring revenue growth. Could you guys remind us, right, of the revenue drivers there, whether it's based on loan activity, whether it's SaaS related, and whether it's based on, say, level of AUM? Just a reminder of what's driving revenue growth would be helpful.\n\nYeah, so there's nothing AUM related here at all. And the majority of the revenue growth is really from net new sales. So think about new sales added each year, recurring revenue, and then net of any attrition, which is very low in capital markets. Then incremental to that, you have net pricing, which James talked about, has been very consistent. And then you have some license activity. Generally, there isn't a significant amount of what we would call transaction or organic growth activity here. It's been, you know, maybe around 100 basis points, whether it's from transactions or those types of things. It's not AUM. However, there was a very big swing. Given the macroeconomic uncertainty, you can kind of go back and look at the large financial institutions all mentioned it. Loan syndication just rose up.\n\nSo there is a bit of organic growth that we get from transactions. It's not generally material. However, when it swings from, you know, generally positive to almost negative to zero, it can impact us. As James said, the good news is it's back in July and August. We feel really good about recurring growth going back up to a 6% range. And so overall, this business does not have a significant amount. There's no AUM at all, and it doesn't have a significant amount of transaction activity. There is, you know, maybe 100 BIPs. James, do you have anything you want to add?\n\nNo, and this was, you know, this business has been performing incredibly strongly. And, you know, to give you some context, you know, we were growing the business at a kind of low teens kind of number in the first quarter. And it fell off to a 35% decline. And since then, it's back closer to the, it's actually above the Q1 performance. So there was a market reduction in loan syndication activity in the quarter. We've now had, I think it's seven or eight weeks where it's up again versus prior year. It's one of the very few businesses within the capital markets portfolio that is exposed at times to, so the loan activity. But it's a $6 million impact on our $3 billion business. That's what's pulled down a recurring in the quarter, and it'll bounce back quite strongly in the second half.\n\nReally helpful, guys. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou bet.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, thank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, John. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the FIS First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. Call is being webcasted. Today's earnings release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website fisglobal.com. On the call with me this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and James Kehoe, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, and James will review our financial results.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to date any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law, please refer to the safe harbor language Also, throughout today's call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. I'm pleased to report that 2025 is off to a strong start. Our laser focus on driving commercial excellence across the enterprise. While simplifying and strengthening our portfolio is delivering results for our shareholders. Our durable business model is underpinned by high levels of recurring revenue, and this allows us to deliver consistent financial results across all economic cycles, and the recently announced strategic acquisition of Global Payments issuer business and the sale of our minority Worldpay stake will strengthen our value proposition to clients while further strengthening our financial profile. .\nIn the first quarter, we delivered adjusted revenue growth of 4%, ahead of expectations. Recurring revenue growth accelerated meaningfully from 2% last quarter to 4%. We expect to see continued strength over the course of the year as signed deals continue to be implemented on schedule. The 3 client requested delays that we mentioned on our last quarter call are all live and we have not seen any negative impacts from macro factors. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was at the high end of our outlook. While free cash flow conversion exceeded 70%, a very strong start, giving us confidence in delivering on our full year outlook. Adjusted EPS grew 11% to $1.21 at the upper end of our outlook, and we returned $670 million to shareholders across share repurchases and dividends. Our solid start to the year and strong execution leaves us confident in reaffirming our full year outlook.\nNow let's turn to Slide 6 for a discussion on new wins and our leading position in the markets we serve. During the first quarter, we signed several new marquee engagements across the money life cycle, and we are seeing momentum building in the second quarter. Beginning with Money at Rest. On the heels of a record year for core wins in 2024, we continue to see strong demand for our core solutions and are expecting another year of solid sales. I'm pleased to announce that our IBS core was selected by a leading East Coast commercial bank with over $15 billion in assets as part of an evaluation following an acquisition. After a highly competitive process, the bank's management team selected FIS for their complex needs as a growing financial institution. This win demonstrates we are well positioned to capitalize on consolidation given our skew towards larger banks and stronger product set.\nThis is a positive proof point of our strong competitive positioning and much improved retention rates. We anticipate momentum in core wins to continue in the second quarter. with an active pipeline of opportunities we expect to close. Our digital solutions continue to gain traction in the market. During the first quarter, a Midwest community bank with over $15 billion in assets, selected our Digital One product to help the bank transform its branch teller technology. The win represents another competitive takeaway for our digital capabilities, which were recognized by Celent for market momentum and support in their recent reports.\nMoving to money in motion, where our office of the CFO capabilities are resonating with a broad range of clients. During the quarter, we expanded our relationship with a leading multinational engineering and technology. The company selected FIS' award-winning treasury management solution to assist it with its cash and risk management needs. The company also selected several of our payment solutions, including our payments hub, a connectivity solution that helps corporates centralize, standardize and process payments quickly and at scale. This is a prime example of how Office of the CFO is expanding our addressable market beyond traditional financial institutions to corporate. We are encouraged by the market reception to our office of the CFO offerings and are well on track to meet our sales goals for the year.\nMoving to money at work. We continue to expand our presence in adjacent growth vectors such as private equity and private capital. In the first quarter, Atlas SP, a global investment firm specializing in private credit, selected our commercial solution to help manage its servicing needs on complex loans and investor reporting requirements. The win is a competitive takeaway and represents our first direct lender client for our commercial lending solution. Turning to more traditional capital activity. Our derivatives processing solution was selected by a premier buy-side firm looking to expand its self-clearing capabilities. We continue to see a trend of buy-side firms adopting self-clearing capabilities and are encouraged for the prospects of our derivatives clearing solution.\nNow turning to Slide 7 for a quick review of our recent milestone transaction. On April 17, we announced 2 transactions that accelerate the strategic repositioning of our portfolio. First, we entered to an agreement to sell our 45% stake in Worldpay to Global Payments for $6.6 billion and pretax value. The sale price represents a premium to the valuation FIS received when it sold its majority stake in 2024 and accelerates the monetization of Worldpay versus pursuing an IPO. Second, we announced the acquisition of the Issuer Solutions business for a net enterprise value of $12 billion, including a $1.5 billion tax benefit. As a reminder, the transactions are expected to close simultaneously in the first half of 2026. The acquisition of the Issuer Solutions business and the sale of our Worldpay stake strengthens our strategic and financial position.\nIssuer Solutions complements our existing banking solutions product suite with best-in-class credit processing capabilities at scale and enhances our value proposition to large banks and corporates, unlocking greater cross-sell potential across existing clients. The acquisition is also financially attractive. The transaction is accretive in the first 12 months to adjusted EPS, EBITDA margins and adjusted free cash flow with greater benefits longer term as synergy targets are achieved. It strengthens our financial profile and provides us with greater recurring revenue. And lastly, the transaction allows us to monetize a nonstrategic at and replace it with a growing stream of durable revenue and strong free cash flow. We look forward to closing the transaction and are excited to be partnering with Global Payments going forward. We're confident the transactions will represent a significant win for all companies involved. And with that, I'll turn it over to James for a review of our first quarter financials. James?\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 9 with an overview of our first quarter results, which we previewed on April 17. We had a great start to the year with adjusted revenue growth of 4%, exceeding the high end of our outlook. We delivered upside from both operating segments, further increasing our confidence in meeting our full year outlook. Adjusted EBITDA came in close to the high end of our outlook at $958 million, leading to an EBITDA margin of 37.8% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS was $1.21, and it was also near the high end of our outlook, with year-over-year growth of 11%. Cash conversion improved significantly as we rolled out working capital initiatives and lapped a weak prior year. Free cash flow was $368 million in the quarter, compared to $95 million last year, with conversion rate of 71% compared to 18% in the prior year.\nAs a reminder, the first quarter is historically a lower conversion quarter, so we are off to a strong start on our full year target of 82% to 85%. Capital expenditures were $233 million in the quarter or 9% of revenue, consistent with our full year expectation, and we exited the quarter at our target leverage of 2.8x. Lastly, we returned $670 million to shareholders including $450 million of share repurchases, putting us well on track to meeting our $1.2 billion annual target for share repurchases. In summary, a great start to the year with strong execution across all key metrics. Turning now to our segment results on Slide 10. Adjusted and recurring revenue growth was 4% with recurring revenue at 81% of total revenue. We continue to emphasize growth in this durable high-margin revenue stream.\nBanking grew 2% in the quarter, coming in ahead of the high end of our outlook. Recurring revenue growth outpaced adjusted revenue growth at 3% in the quarter. Nonrecurring revenue increased 3% and as the anticipated 2 percentage point headwind from termination and license fees was offset by stronger performance from our card production business. Professional services declined 5% as we successfully concluded some large projects at year-end. As Stephanie discussed, client implementations are on track, and we expect accelerating professional services growth over the course of the year. Banking EBITDA margin contracted to 40.1%, reflecting high license and termination fees last year and the timing of operating expenses. Turning now to capital markets, where we had another strong quarter. Adjusted revenue growth came in ahead of the high end of our outlook at 9% with recurring revenue growth of 6%.\nNonrecurring revenue advanced 47% as the team delivered a strong license quarter, including outsized renewal timing. Professional services declined 5% year-over-year, reflecting the completion of some project work and is expected to return to growth in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points, reflecting strong growth in high-margin license revenue and continued favorable operating leverage. Moving now to our outlook on Slide 11. As messaged on our April 17 call, we are reaffirming our outlook for the full year, and we are not changing any of our key assumptions. Implementations are ramping on schedule, and we have good line of sight into the 150 basis points of incremental banking growth that is tied to commercial excellence. For the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted revenue growth of 4.2% to 5%. We are targeting banking revenue growth of 3.7% to 4.4%, Consistent with our commentary on the fourth quarter call and in line with our full year outlook. This acceleration will be underpinned by strong and accelerating recurring revenue growth. For Capital Markets, we expect adjusted revenue growth of 6% to 6.7% and combined with a strong first quarter. This puts our first half growth modestly ahead of our full year outlook. We are projecting sequential margin improvement of approximately 200 basis points to around 39.8% to 40% in the second quarter. For the year, we anticipate continued sequential margin improvement over the remaining quarters as we progress to our full year target of 41.3%. We are projecting adjusted EPS of $1.34 to $1.38 with EPS growth ranging from 0% to 3%. The result is held back by 2 items with a combined negative impact of approximately 5 points of growth. Firstly, we are lapping the sizable [indiscernible] growover in interest income as we opportunistically invested Worldpay proceeds last year.\nSecondly, we are facing a tough year-on-year comparison on EMI. Worldpay had a very strong performance last year, including a slower-than-planned buildup of stand-alone operating expenses. Consistent with prior quarters, we have provided our detailed assumptions in the appendix. Let's now wrap up on Slide 12. In summary, our first quarter results were above expectations with strong starts on both revenue growth and cash conversion. We are on track for accelerating growth from our banking segment beginning in the second quarter. And we are reaffirming our full year outlook with total shareholder return of 11% to 13%. Capital returns were $670 million in the quarter putting us on schedule for our $2 billion annual capital return target. And lastly, we announced a significant transformation of our financial profile. replacing our noncash minority interest in Worldpay with a durable cash-generating asset in Issuer Solutions. With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the FIS Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com. Joining me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and James Kehoe, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by James, who will review our financial results. Turning to Slide 3.\nToday's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language. Also throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nAnd now I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2024 was a year of continued progress at FIS. We made significant strides executing on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day to drive commercial excellence across the enterprise, refocused sales on key growth vectors and extend and complement our portfolio of solutions with targeted M&A. We committed to doing this while also focusing on continued profitability and increasing total returns to shareholders. While there is still much work to do, the actions we've taken to refocus the company are driving improved financial outcomes and delivering greater value to all of our stakeholders.\nOur focus on commercial excellence continues to increase the momentum we are seeing in new sales across core banking and our key growth vectors of digital, payments and commercial lending, positioning us for accelerated growth going forward. I want to thank the entire FIS team for their commitment and dedication to moving the company forward through this period of rapid change. Overall, we delivered a solid set of financial results in 2024, leveraging our strong position across the money life cycle. Revenue growth accelerated from 3% to 4% in 2024. And while this was slightly below our expectations due to some onetime items, growth in new sales, including a 10% increase in Amplify cross sales and improved commercial excellence across our client base, leave us confident in further acceleration in 2025.\nWe are pleased with the early returns on our sales transformation, driving new wins and higher margin recurring revenue. For example, we've hired more quota-carrying specialists focused on specific solution sets in key verticals such as payments, digital and treasury and risk. We are confident the specialized sales approach will allow us to better cross-sell solutions into our clients and position us to capitalize on our most attractive and growing markets. This focus on profitable growth and business simplification translated into strong margin expansion of 64 basis points for the year. This exceeded our original outlook of 20 to 40 basis points. We are poised to drive further margin expansion in 2025, in line with our Investor Day targets as we execute on the pillars of our future forward strategy. The strong execution this year resulted in adjusted EPS growth of 18% on a normalized basis, again, exceeding our full year outlook. Lastly, we returned $4.8 billion to shareholders across share repurchases and dividends, including $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Looking into 2025, we are well positioned to return $2 billion of capital and deliver double-digit total return to shareholders, including 9% to 11% adjusted EPS growth. Turning to Slide 6 for a discussion on new sales, key client wins and partnerships.\nI'm pleased to report that we ended the year on a high note with the sales momentum we generated over the first 3 quarters of the year continuing into the fourth quarter. The strong close reaffirms our confidence in accelerating revenue growth over the course of 2025 and will provide a solid foundation for continued growth into 2026. Beginning with money at rest. We had a record year of core wins with success across all of our strategic banking platforms. This included several competitive takeaways with our core platforms resonating across regional, community and de novo banks. I'm excited to announce that Centennial Bank, a growing regional bank with over $20 billion in assets will be moving to our IBS platform. And as part of this strategic migration, they've also selected our B1 Studio digital bank offering, which will be replacing their current provider. We're thrilled to be working with Centennial and look forward to growing alongside them. Our IBS platform was also selected by a leading Midwest based community bank. The bank will be migrating FIS from a competitor's solution that have been servicing the bank for decades. Moving to digital.\nNew sales of digital solutions grew 70% year-over-year in 2024. Demand was primarily driven by cross-sales into FIS' core clients. Additionally, we are seeing early traction bundling our digital solutions with new core wins, reducing complexity and cost for banks. We expect the strong digital sales momentum to continue in 2025, aided by the recent Dragonfly acquisition and specialized sales focus. Moving to money in motion.\nWe signed a number of new wins across domestic and international banks and premier fintech companies. First, I'm pleased to announce that we entered into a strategic partnership with Affirm, enabling our debit processing clients to have access to a firm's market-leading buy now pay later capabilities. BNPL represents one of the fastest-growing markets in the changing payments landscape, with over 86 million Americans having used the service in 2024. Our partnership with Affirm, the first of its kind to bring together debit processing with pay overtime capabilities demonstrates FIS' commitment to innovation and unique positioning to unlock financial technology across the money life cycle.\nDuring the quarter, we also expanded our relationship with NatWest, a leading U.K. financial institution. NatWest will utilize several new products across both payments and lending. And we've continued to gain traction beyond financial institutions having signed several new network and processing deals with emerging technology providers. This is a significant opportunity to further diversify our payments business, leveraging our loyalty network and issuing capabilities. Moving to money at work.\nWe had another strong sales quarter with continued demand across trade processing and commercial lending. In the fourth quarter, one of the largest regional banks in the U.S. opted for FIS' transfer agency solution. This is another example of how our cross-sell initiative Amplify is resonating with clients. We also continue to see benefit integrating our strategic acquisitions into our global distribution network. During the quarter, Torstone, a specialized SaaS post-trade platform acquired in early 2024, signed one of the largest deals in its history, leveraging FIS' brand and track record in the market, Torstone was able to sell its back-office services to a leading digital brokerage company.\nIn the fourth quarter, we also signed a number of new engagements with both traditional and alternative lenders and our pipeline of opportunities remains large. Commercial lending remains a key growth vertical for us with double-digit revenue growth in the quarter and strong new sales. FIS' products and solutions were once again recognized by a number of prestigious advisory and expert firms across the industry. Our Horizon banking platform was recognized by Celent winning in the advanced technology category. While IDC recognized FIS as a leader in MarketScape's North American digital core banking platforms, and for its outstanding customer satisfaction and treasury management. Additionally, Gartner placed Horizon in IBS in the Leaders quadrant of their Magic Quadrant for retail core banking systems. And Affirm also recognized MVP in the Visionaries quadrant. We are pleased to see so many of our products and solutions continue to be recognized as leaders in the market, reaffirming the momentum we are seeing in sales activity. I'll conclude on Slide 7 with an overview of how FIS is capitalizing on the unique market of the office of the CFO.\nLeveraging our reach across the full money life cycle, FIS is uniquely positioned to tap into one of the most attractive opportunities in enterprise software, helping CFOs turn finance from a cost center into a growth center for their business. The role of the CFO across large enterprises is expanding. Finance leaders are being tasked with improving and automating processes while simultaneously lowering costs and navigating complex tax and regulatory environments. To achieve these goals, CFOs are leaning on trusted technology providers like FIS for help. The office of the CFO represents a global market of over $25 billion with double-digit growth and significant runway to further grow our business with enterprise corporate clients.\nThe fragmented competitive landscape in this space works to our advantage. While competitors might be able to offer clients 1 or 2 solutions FIS delivers a comprehensive suite of end-to-end capabilities across money at rest, in motion and at work. This suite includes award-winning solutions across payments, supply chain management, digital enhancements and fraud prevention. And we are further extending our lead with the launch of next-generation solutions, such as Treasury GPT, a new tool launched in partnership with Microsoft. Leveraging AI, corporate treasurers are able to access and synthesize large pools of data, helping them improve their cash management activities.\nWe are also expanding our reach with strategic M&A, including the recent acquisition of U.K. Fintech Demaca, positioning FIS as a leader in supply chain finance capabilities. This mix of organic and inorganic investments reinforces how we are effectively allocating capital across the company to capitalize on growth opportunities. The office of the CFO is just 1 example of an attractive and growing market where FIS' unique set of assets, positions the company to win. I stepped into the CEO role at FIS 2 years ago, a company I am honored and privileged to lead. During this time frame, we initiated one of the largest transformational strategies in the company's history to improve our profitability and financial foundation, enabling us to drive key client outcomes of simplification, innovation and client centricity as well as investor outcomes of enhanced shareholder value. The organic and inorganic investments we are making are delivering tangible results.\nWe have successfully completed 5 acquisitions, driving positive financial returns and extending our solution capabilities in key growth areas such as digital, payments and commercial lending. We established new commercial partnerships with industry leaders like Microsoft, Affirm and Worldpay, among others. These partnerships have enabled us to extend innovative new capabilities to our clients and their customers. We had our strongest year ever in core banking with record new wins, sales momentum across our key growth vectors, including 70% growth in digital sales and continued demand for our commercial lending solutions.\nOverall, new sales increased a solid 9% in 2024, showing progress in our commercial excellence transformation and providing us with visibility into future growth as signings convert into revenue over the next few quarters. Our solutions have received dozens of new awards and third-party accolades from prestigious organizations, recognizing us as leaders and visionaries. We are on the right path to accelerate growth expand profitability and increase shareholder value. And while progress is in to straight line, and we still have more work to do, I'm extremely pleased with the momentum we have and excited about our prospects going forward.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to James for a review of our financials. James?\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning. As Stephanie mentioned earlier, we made continued progress in 2024, laying a strong foundation to achieve our Investor Day goals. The separation of Worldpay was a landmark event, allowing us to increase our growth investments while returning significant cash to shareholders. Our financial results in 2024 coupled with strong growth in new ACV sales and improved commercial excellence give us great confidence for the year ahead. Turning now to our share quarter results on Slide 10.\nAdjusted revenue growth was 4% in the quarter. we outperformed again in capital mortgage coming in above the high end of our guide. Banking delivered a strong ACV sales quarter but revenue growth lagged expectations due to some onetime items. While these items pressured our fourth quarter results, overall, they will have a positive impact on our 2025 banking revenue growth with a meaningful acceleration beginning in the second quarter. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in well ahead of our expectations, expanding more than 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by capital markets and lower corporate costs. Adjusted EPS increased 49% or 9% on a normalized basis, led by strong EBITDA growth of 6%. Total debt was $11.3 billion, with a leverage ratio of 2.65x, better than our stated goal of 2.8x.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we returned $1.2 billion of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases of $1 billion. And for the year, we fully delivered on our $4 billion target. Free cash flow was $700 million in the quarter, with a cash conversion rate of 110%. While our cash conversion in the quarter was strong, it did fall short of our expectations due to less favorable working capital performance. This led to a full year cash conversion of 77% and we are taking action to improve our working capital conversion going forward. Turning now to our segment results on Slide 11.\nAdjusted revenue growth was 4% and with recurring revenue growth at 2%. Banking grew 2% in the quarter, coming in slightly below our outlook; three, unexpected items hit us late in the quarter. And negatively impacted revenue growth by around 2 percentage points. Recurring revenue growth of 1% includes a negative impact of approximately 1% and from a contract recognition adjustment. As a reminder, we are growing over an unusually strong 7% recurring growth in the prior year. Nonrecurring revenue declined 3%, including 2 unexpected items. First, a large license deal pushed out of the full quarter and is now expected to close later in 2025. Secondly, the results include the reversal of a $20 million termination fee related to an announced bank merger, which was subsequently abandoned due to regulatory scrutiny.\nWhile the reversal of this termination fee was a sizable headwind in the quarter, the retention of this client will benefit recurring revenue in 2025. Professional services advanced 16% and in line with our prior expectations for acceleration over the second half of 2024. Banking EBITDA margin declined 120 basis points entirely due to unfavorable product mix. Turning now to capital markets, which had another very strong quarter.\nAdjusted revenue growth came in ahead of expectations at 9%, with strong recurring revenue growth of 7%. Other nonrecurring revenue advanced 16%, fueled by very strong license sales and professional services increased 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 190 basis points reflecting strong growth in high-margin license revenue and favorable operating leverage. Turning now to our full year results on Slide 12.\nAdjusted revenue and recurring revenue grew 4%. Banking revenue grew 2% with recurring revenue growth of 3% and inclusive of the share quarter headwinds we discussed earlier. Worldpay related revenue was $140 million for the year compared to $31 million in 2023. And this was more than offset by the loss of $150 million of revenue from federally funded pandemic release. On a normalized basis, Banking's underlying growth was above 3% for the year. And the cost savings and operating leverage led to margin expansion of 88 basis points. Our Capital Markets business had a banner year with 7% growth in both adjusted and recurring revenue, margins expanded 73 basis points benefiting from growth in higher-margin license sales, cost savings and continued operating leverage. Turning now to Slide 13 for 2025 outlook.\nOur outlook is fully aligned with the goals we set at Investor Day. We expect revenue growth to accelerate to 4.6% to 5.2%, in line with our Investor Day commentary of accelerating revenue growth. We expect margin expansion of 40 to 45 basis points consistent with our prior guide of 2025 being at the lower end of the 40 to 60 basis points reach. Adjusted EPS growth is projected at 9% to 11%, within our 2-year target of 9% to 12%. This is a strong EPS performance given the higher 2024 jump-off point. When we provided the guide back in May of last year, 2024 EPS was projected at 10% to 12% growth on a normalized basis.\nWe delivered 18% growth in 2024 and absolute EPS was $0.24 higher than the upper end of our range. Our target leverage is unchanged at 2.8x, and we expect cash conversion to improve from 77% in 2024 to 82% to 85% in 2025. We recently increased our dividend by 11% and we expect to deploy $1 billion of capital toward M&A. Importantly, we are raising our share repurchase goal from around $800 million to $1.2 billion, and this reflects our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders. In summary, our 2025 outlook is fully aligned with the midterm goals we set at Investor Day. Let's turn now to our more detailed projections on Page 14.\nWe are projecting full year revenue of $10.4 billion to $10.5 billion. This includes an expected $50 million currency headwind as well as the wind-down of a nonstrategic business within the Corporate and Other segment. Together, these items will reduce reported revenue by approximately $100 million for the year with no impact on adjusted revenue growth. Full year revenue growth of 4.6% to 5.2% is projected to accelerate over the course of the year. Banking growth is projected at 3.7% to 4.4%, consistent with our midterm targets. And we are expecting another year of strong revenue growth from capital markets with a full year range of 6.5% to 7%. We do, however, anticipate a somewhat slower start to the year with first quarter revenue growth projected at 2.5% to 3.5%.\nWhile capital markets will have a strong start to the year with 7% to 8% growth, banking is facing a tough go over of 200 basis points of nonrecurring revenue due to exceptionally high license and termination fees in the first quarter of last year. Excluding this impact, our banking and outlook of 0.5% to 1.5% growth would be closer to 2.5% to 3.5%. Banking growth will accelerate over the course of the year. as we benefit from very strong 2024 recurring ACV sales and the ramp-up of previously signed deals.\nOn our third quarter call, we highlighted some client requested implementation delays. While these contracts are already signed, the requested delays shifted revenue out of both the fourth quarter of 2024, and the first quarter of 2025. And this has shifted over a point of growth from the first quarter into the second quarter. In summary, while the first quarter will be softer than the full year, we expect an immediate pickup in the second quarter. We have good visibility into the drivers, and we are confident our second quarter banking growth will be within the full year outlook range of 3.7% to 4.4%.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we anticipate full year margin expansion of 40 to 45 basis points. Strong execution of our established cost management capabilities and favorable operating leverage will more than offset the roll-off of TSA's cost increases and a less favorable revenue mix. In summary, accelerating revenue growth continued margin expansion and strong management of below-the-line items will drive adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 11%. Let me now walk you through our revenue building blocks on Slide 15.\nWe have clear line of sight into accelerating banking growth over the course of the year. Strong ACV sales, higher retention and deferred implementations will drive 150 basis points of incremental revenue growth. The recent Dragonfly digital acquisition adds an additional 60 basis points of growth. These improved growth trends will be modestly offset by declining nonrecurring revenue. leading to banking adjusted revenue growth of 3.7% to 4.4%. For capital markets, we are projecting consistent high-quality revenue growth of 6.5% to 7%. The growth will be driven by ongoing expansion into faster-growing adjacent verticals with a similar M&A contribution in 2025 as compared to 2024. Let me now cover the below-the-line assumptions on Slide 16.\nWe expect interest expense and tax rate to be in line or better than our Investor Day targets. Interest expense will increase to $120 million to around $370 million, reflecting increased leverage and lower interest income. We will reduce our effective tax rate to 12% to 12.5% from above 15% in 2024. And diluted shares outstanding will decline 5%. Lastly, we anticipate a Worldpay EMI contribution of around $550 million well ahead of our Investor Day outlook and increasing around 7.5% over 2024. Let me now wrap up on Slide 17.\nIn summary, our 2025 financial outlook is fully aligned with the goals we set at our Investor Day last year. Banking revenue growth will accelerate to around 4% with recurring revenue growing at a faster pace. Capital Markets will continue to grow at around 7% and we are targeting margin expansion of 40 to 45 basis points, underpinned by a strong track record on cost management. Lastly, we are targeting $2 billion of capital return in 2025, and we will deliver total returns of 11% to 13%.\nWith that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?"

Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and good morning, everyone. Over the past 18 months, we have moved with a high sense of urgency to reposition the company on a sustainable path for growth and to unlock greater value for all of our stakeholders. We've taken bold actions to refocus the business and improve client centricity, to simplify our business and strengthen our financial position.\nIn May, we hosted an Investor Day. The company's first in 6 years, where we set out to reintroduce investors to the new FIS, laying out our corporate vision to capitalize on our privileged position, powering the global economy by moving money seamlessly across the entire money life cycle, and the strength and durability of our business model across all economic cycles.\nAs our second quarter results demonstrate, we are executing across the growth vectors we laid out at Investor Day: To deliver accelerating profitable revenue growth and sustainable double-digit total returns for shareholders. Within money at rest, we are seeing strong demand for our core and digital offerings. In core banking, we are currently on track for a record year of new core signings driven by competitive takeaways and greater traction in the community banking market. In fact, for the first half of 2024, we've signed almost as many cores as we did in all of 2023.\nWithin our digital business, we saw new sales growth of over 30% in the first half of 2024, highlighting the success of our cross-sell into existing core customers and displacing competitors. Within money and motion, our differentiated loyalty solutions and payment offerings continue to resonate in the market, and we signed several new marquee partners in the quarter.\nWe're also winning in the fast-growing treasury and risk market, with further penetration in growth verticals such as insurance. Across money at work, we are leaning into our global distribution to win new business and seeing strong double-digit growth in our commercial lending business, where we continue to see a long growth trajectory. So in summary, we're executing strongly across all growth vectors and are seeing strong momentum across the business.\nI am pleased to report we delivered our sixth straight quarter of outperformance as we continue to execute against our strategy. Revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, with acceleration across both Banking and Capital Markets. We exceeded our profitability targets with company margins expanding by 110 basis points, driving normalized adjusted EPS growth of over 30%, well ahead of our outlook. Our strong first half performance is allowing us to once again raise our financial outlook for the year.\nNow let me share with you some strategic highlights from the quarter. I'm thrilled with the strong new sales momentum we're driving, including our cross-sell initiatives across the enterprise and the benefits we're seeing from our commercial relationships with Worldpay. Over the first half of 2024, cross-sell activity across the enterprise grew an impressive 15% as our sales transformation efforts continue to take hold. We're accelerating our go-to-market strategy with key partnerships and innovative new product rollouts.\nWe recently teamed up with Curanos, a global data intelligence company to provide FIS core banking clients with access to Curanos' proprietary data and analytics, helping them optimize their deposit gathering strategies and improve profitability. We also announced a partnership with Lendio, a leading small business financial solutions technology platform to streamline SMB loan processing for financial institutions.\nAlso within Capital Markets, we launched our Climate Risk Financial modeler, a best-in-class SaaS-based solution designed to help corporations, insurance companies and financial institutions assess and quantify climate risk across their portfolio. These are just a handful of examples of the ongoing product innovation across the company. We continue to return capital to shareholders and are well on track to deliver on our $4 billion of share repurchase commitment for the year. Additionally, our Board recently approved a new share repurchase authorization of $3 billion.\nAcross the some more client wins, beginning with money at rest. We saw strong demand for our core banking platforms with several competitive takeaways, including Third Coast Bancshares, a leading Texas-based community bank. Also within money at rest, digital had another strong sales quarter as our offerings continue to resonate in the market. We expanded our relationship with a large regional bank with over $25 billion in assets that added its current breadth of products within our Digital One ecosystem.\nWe also saw continued traction across money in motion, with new engagements across payments and loyalty solutions. Synchrony, a leading consumer financial services company is partnering with FIS and enabling our premium payback loyalty solution. Synchrony joins a long list of leading card issuers who've selected FIS' premium payback offering to help differentiate their value proposition in the highly competitive consumer credit industry.\nOur award-winning Treasury and Risk Solutions also continue to see strong demand. This quarter, a large U.S.-based life insurance provider selected FIS' suite of risk and compliance tools. This represents a new relationship for the business as the team builds on its strong presence in the insurance market. Within money at work, we signed several new engagements across trading and asset servicing solutions and commercial lending. Newer expanded engagements include Trustmoore, a global boutique corporate services company; and a leading global private equity firm, both selecting FIS' private capital suite, our award-winning private equity fund accounting software and reporting solution.\nTrustmoore is a perfect example of how we're leveraging acquisitions to source and win new opportunities. The combination of FIS' strong accounting and reporting solutions, coupled with the capabilities of recently acquired DeepPool, an investor servicing software provider, were the deciding factors in allowing FIS to win a highly competitive sales process. Capital Markets continues to differentiate itself from its peers by further expanding into fast-growing verticals and capitalizing on its global reach.\nIn addition to our new wins, our efforts are being recognized by some of the most prestigious independent expert advisory firms and financial publications across the industry, with our Treasury and Risk Solutions products winning top honors from both Global Finance Magazine and Treasury Management International. And CNBC once again named FIS a top 250 global fintech company.\nSo in summary, we reported another strong quarter and have good visibility into delivering our forward outlook, given the durability of our highly recurring business model. Before I turn it over to James, I'd like to thank all of our colleagues here at FIS, who continue to move the company's Future Forward. James?\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, with strong execution across many vectors. We delivered broad-based outperformance against our financial outlook and this allows us to increase our full year outlook for the second consecutive quarter. Adjusted revenue growth accelerated to 4% in the quarter, compared to 3% in the first quarter, and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting continued cost savings and favorable revenue mix. Adjusted EPS was $1.36 in the quarter, up 79% compared to the prior year and growing over 30% on a normalized basis.\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow metrics. Total debt at the end of the quarter was $11.2 billion, with a leverage ratio of 2.6x. We returned $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, including share repurchases of $1.1 billion. Year-to-date, we have repurchased $2.5 billion of shares, and we are well on track to deliver on our $4 billion full year target. Free cash flow was $504 million, with a cash conversion rate of 85%. And we are confirming our full year cash conversion target of 85% to 90%.\nTurning now to our segment results on Slide 10. Adjusted revenue growth was 4% with recurring revenue also growing 4% in the quarter. Banking revenue growth came in at the high end of our outlook range and accelerated to 3% in the quarter. Recurring revenue also grew 3%, in line with our expectations, and we are confident recurring revenue growth will accelerate in the third quarter and for the back half of the year, reflecting strong execution and sales momentum. Other nonrecurring revenue grew 21%, reflecting growth in license revenue and deconversion fees associated with bank consolidation.\nLastly, professional services revenue declined 13% year-over-year. We expect to see an acceleration in professional services growth in the second half as this revenue stream has stabilized and will reaccelerate in the second half of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points, primarily reflecting continued cost savings and favorable revenue mix.\nTurning now to Capital Markets. Adjusted revenue growth was 7%, led by recurring revenue growth of 7%. Excluding acquisitions, adjusted revenue grew 6%, up from 5% growth in the first quarter. Other nonrecurring revenue grew 15%, primarily reflecting growth in license revenue, and professional services increased 2%, in line with our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, reflecting operating leverage and growth in higher-margin license revenue. Consistent with prior messaging, we continue to anticipate full year margin expansion across both segments.\nTurning now to our full year outlook on Slide 11. Our strong year-to-date results and good visibility in the second half growth drivers positions us for another increase to our full year outlook. We are raising our full year EPS outlook by $0.13 to $0.15 to $5.03 to $5.11, reflecting normalized growth of 13% to 15%. This increase is driven by strong execution and broad-based favorability across multiple areas.\nLet's walk through the key changes on Slide 12. We are raising our absolute revenue target by $20 million to reflect more favorable ForEx impacts. Segment growth rates are unchanged. We continue to expect Banking growth of 3% to 3.5% and Capital Markets of 6.5% to 7%. We are increasing the low end of our adjusted EBITDA range by $15 million, reflecting year-to-date outperformance. And we remain confident in achieving our new full year EBITDA range.\nWe are meaningfully increasing our EPS outlook reflecting continued strong execution and broad-based favorability across depreciation and amortization, interest expense, shares outstanding and Worldpay EMI. Together, these factors are expected to contribute an additional $0.13 to $0.15 of adjusted EPS, with approximately $0.08 coming from Worldpay EMI. Importantly, we remain confident in delivering the 9% to 12% adjusted EPS growth we committed to at Investor Day.\nLet's now move to our third quarter outlook on Slide 13. We are projecting adjusted revenue growth of 4% to 4.5% for the third quarter, with Banking Solutions growth at 2.5% to 3% and Capital Markets at 7.5% to 8%. As a reminder, the Banking outlook includes a significant rollover in nonrecurring revenue. Despite the large nonrecurring headwind, we expect to deliver steady revenue growth driven by an acceleration in recurring revenue. Importantly, the combination of strong recurring revenue and our rebound in nonrecurring revenue, provides us with a high degree of visibility around fourth quarter revenue growth of at least 5%.\nFor Capital Markets, we are forecasting another good quarter of revenue growth with strong recurring revenue and a rebound in professional services revenue growth. Overall, we are projecting an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.5% to 40.7%, in line with our comments at Investor Day. This reflects a negative impact from a grow-over in corporate expenses, which were at the lowest absolute level in the third quarter of 2023. Adjusted EPS is projected to increase 35% to 39% to $1.27 to $1.31. We anticipate another good quarter for FIS, and we remain highly confident in achieving our full year outlook.\nLet me now wrap up on Slide 14. In summary, we are encouraged by our financial results, delivering our sixth straight quarter of outperformance. During the second quarter, we accelerated revenue growth and drove margin expansion across both operating segments. And once again, we meaningfully increased our 2024 adjusted EPS outlook. Lastly, we returned $1.3 billion of capital to our shareholders, an increase of $1 billion compared to the second quarter of 2023.\nWith that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?"

Thank you for standing by and welcome to the FIS First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to hand the call over to George Mihalos, Senior Vice President and Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nOn the call with me today are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and James Kehoe, our CFO. Stephanie will begin the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by James, who will review our financials.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. I'm pleased to report that 2024 is off to a very strong start. We're outperforming on our financial commitments to shareholders, experiencing solid new sales momentum and leveraging our strong capital position to aggressively return capital to shareholders while also investing for growth.\nThe decisive actions we took in 2023 through our Future Forward strategy are resonating across the enterprise and improving operational and financial outcomes. This is the fifth consecutive quarter where we've exceeded our financial outlook with broad-based outperformance across revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. While still early, we are confident in achieving our 2024 outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA, and we are meaningfully raising our EPS outlook to reflect a sustainable lower tax rate and a higher EMI contribution from our Worldpay stake. Momentum is building across our new sales pipeline as our solutions continue to resonate with clients. We saw strong new sales growth in the first quarter with good demand across digital banking, payments and risk compliance solutions. We expect the strong new sales activity to continue over the remainder of the year.\nMoving on to capital allocation. We are once again increasing our share repurchase target for the year by $500 million. We now expect to repurchase a total of $4 billion in 2024. During the quarter, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including $1.4 billion through repurchase. And [indiscernible] at highly synergistic tuck-in opportunities to further our business.\nBefore turning it over for an in-depth discussion on our first quarter financial performance and updated 2024 outlook, I'd like to remind everyone that tomorrow, we will be hosting an Investor Day, where we will be showcasing our corporate strategy, providing segment deep dives and introducing medium-term financial targets. We hope you can join us in person in New York City or via the webcast.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to James. James?\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and hello, everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our successful cash management and tax initiatives have allowed us to meaningfully raise our full year EPS outlook. On a continuing operations basis, adjusted revenue growth accelerated to 3% compared to flat in the fourth quarter of 2023. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 200 basis points year-over-year, primarily reflecting cost optimization initiatives, which boosted margins in the Banking segment.\nAdjusted EPS from continuing operations was $1.10 in the quarter, up 53% compared to the prior year. and up 24% on a normalized basis. On a total company basis, including 1 month of discontinued operations, revenues $2.9 billion with adjusted EPS of $1.33. Beginning in February 2024, our 45% interest in Worldpay is reported on the EMI line of the income statement.\nMoving now to our balance sheet and cash flow metrics. After paying down debt with the Worldpay proceeds, our total debt at the end of the quarter was $11.2 billion, with a leverage ratio of 2.7x. We repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of shares resulting in over $1.6 billion of capital returned to shareholders during the first quarter. Additionally, we are once again increasing our share repurchase target for the year by $500 million to $4 billion in total. We will deploy this incremental $500 million over the course of the fourth quarter of 2024. We benefiting 2025 EPS.\nOn a continuing operations basis, we generated free cash flow of $95 million in the first quarter, with a free cash flow conversion rate of 18%. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by a number of factors, which are temporary in nature, including the delay of prior year tax payments for the first quarter of 2024 and the timing of TSA reimbursements from Worldpay. Overall, these temporary items amounted to $195 million or 36 points of negative impact. Adjusting for these items, free cash flow conversion would have been approximately 54% compared to 40% in the first quarter of 2023. Importantly, these temporary items were already factored into our full year cash conversion target of 85% to 90%. And we are confident that we will achieve this target.\nTurning now to our segment results on Slide 8. Adjusted revenue growth was 3%, in line with our expectations and recurring revenue growth was a steady 5%, broadly in line with the trends we saw during 2023. One quick note on backlog. While we will continue to provide backlog data in our quarterly 10-Q filings, we will no longer be focusing on backlog during our earnings presentation. As you already know, backlog does not appropriately capture underlying growth from existing clients, such as account and transaction growth. Last quarter, we provided you with increased disclosure around our recurring and nonrecurring revenue streams within the banking segment. And building on that transparency, we have now added a schedule in the appendix highlighting the resiliency of our recurring revenue growth across a multiyear period. Compared to backlog, recurring revenue growth is a more meaningful predictor of sustainable future revenue growth. and we will be increasingly focused on this measure as a key indicator of the underlying strength of the business. Moving on to segment performance. Banking adjusted revenue growth was at the high end of our outlook range and accelerated to 2% in the quarter compared to flat in the fourth quarter of '23. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by an impressive 350 basis points, primarily driven by cost initiatives and favorable revenue mix. Banking recurring revenue grew a healthy 4%, representing continued steady growth. Other nonrecurring revenue grew 9% and with strong year-over-year growth in license fee revenue, more than offsetting declines in pandemic-related revenue. Professional services revenue declined 14% and reflecting a difficult year-over-year comparison in project revenue related to a large client.\nTurning now to Capital Markets. Adjusted revenue growth was 6%, an improvement from 1% growth in the fourth quarter, led by strong recurring revenue growth. Excluding the impact from acquisitions, adjusted revenue increased 5%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 80 basis points during the quarter, primarily reflecting less favorable revenue mix. And for the year, we continue to expect modest margin expansion. Capital Markets recurring revenue grew by a strong 9% in the quarter, whereas other nonrecurring revenue was flat and professional services declined 4%.\nTurning now to our full year outlook on Slide 9. Our first quarter operational performance gives us great confidence in meeting our full year outlook. However, given that it is so early in the year, for now, we are reiterating our full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our full year adjusted EPS outlook by $0.22 to $4.88 to $4.98 and as we drive broad-based favorability across taxes, interest expense, depreciation and the EMI.\nLet's walk through the key changes on Slide 10. We continue to project total reported revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion with adjusted revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%. We expect the banking segment to grow between 3% to 3.5%, and we anticipate capital markets revenue growth of 6.5% to 7%. We continue to forecast year-over-year margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points for the full year, implying an expected moderation in the margin expansion relative to the first quarter's 200 basis points. Over the past few months, we have been very focused on optimizing our cash management, taxes and capital structure. And these initiatives are driving $0.22 of favorability compared to our original EPS guidance. We are now in a position to reduce our tax rate projection to around 14.5% from over 17% previously. This contributes approximately $0.14 and the lower tax rate is sustainable going forward. More to follow on this at Investor Day. We are also reducing our depreciation and amortization projections by $5 million to $10 million compared to our prior outlook. And we now anticipate full year interest expense of $320 million to $325 million, an improvement of $25 million reflecting strong execution in quickly deploying the Worldpay proceeds to maximize returns.\nLastly, we have raised our 11-month Worldpay EMI contribution by $15 million to $20 million, mostly reflecting their strong start to the year. As a result, we are raising our full year EPS outlook to a range of $4.88 to $4.98, growing more than 45% on a continuing operations basis. On a normalized basis, we now expect adjusted EPS to grow 10% to 12%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dis-synergies.\nLet's now move to our second quarter outlook on Slide 11. We are forecasting another quarter of accelerating revenue growth, margin expansion and strong earnings growth. We are projecting adjusted revenue growth of 3% to 4% with banking solutions at 2% to 2.5% and Capital Markets at 7% to 8%. We expect banking revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, reflecting easier year-over-year revenue comparisons and the favorable impact from stronger new sales over the second half of 2023. We expect steady Capital Markets adjusted revenue growth over the remainder of the year, in line with our second quarter outlook. We are projecting adjusted EBITDA of $980 million to $995 million, which translates to year-over-year margin expansion of 80 to 100 basis points. Continuing operations adjusted EPS is projected to increase 59% to 64% to $1.21 to $1.25. In summary, we expect the favorable first quarter trends to continue into the second quarter, and we are confident in our full year outlook.\nLet me now wrap up on Slide 12. In closing, we are very encouraged by our first quarter results, delivering our fifth straight quarter of outperformance. We are raising our full year EPS outlook by $0.22, an increase of 4.5%, and we are reaffirming our revenue and adjusted EBITDA targets. We are confident in our full year outlook and are well on track to deliver accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins in 2024. Lastly, we returned over $1.6 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and increased our 2024 share repurchase target by $500 million to $4 billion.\nWith that, we will be concluding today's call, and we look forward to speaking with you and taking your questions at tomorrow's Investor Day. Have a good evening.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you.

Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. When I stepped in as CEO, we were facing an uncertain economy, a banking crisis, inflation and a market where new capital was scarce. And while FIS was a stature company with over 50 years of market success, it had lost its focus in recent years. Simply put, the company was not meeting expectations. It was missing financial commitments and growth opportunities. It was slow in the delivery of products, too complex for clients to navigate and selling in areas that didn't contribute to the bottom line.\nFast forward a year later, and we are now a much different company with renewed focus, vision and measurable results. We took a decisive action and moved with urgency to put the company on a sustainable path for long-term success, unlocking value for shareholders and recommitting to our clients who are at the center of everything we do. In a short period of time, we successfully executed a number of significant operational commitments while consistently delivering financial outcomes ahead of expectations.\nEarlier this month, we announced the successful completion of the majority sale of the Worldpay business to GTCR, a key milestone for our future. This landmark transaction creates 2 market-leading companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to capitalize on their respective growth and margin opportunities in rapidly evolving markets.\nFIS holds a meaningful 45% stake in Worldpay and the 2 companies will continue to work together closely in the future. The strategic go-to-market partnership we established with Worldpay through our commercial agreements preserves the key value propositions for clients of both companies, and it is a powerful continuation of what we started when our 2 organizations first came together. Worldpay will remain an important distribution channel for FIS while continuing to benefit from access to FIS's array of bank tech services, such as our embedded finance solutions. We are excited to partner with Charles Drucker, the Worldpay management team and GTCR, and we are confident the business is on the right trajectory to reinvigorate revenue and earnings growth.\nThe separation reinforces FIS's position as a global enterprise software leader, servicing the technology needs of the most complex global financial institutions, multinational corporates and governments. With a sharp focus on our marquee set of clients, we are well positioned to capitalize on favorable industry trends and quickly push into faster-growing verticals and segments of the market. This builds on our first-mover technology advantages, allowing us to accelerate revenue growth as our 2024 outlook demonstrates.\nThe Worldpay transaction also allows us to recapitalize our balance sheet, providing ample flexibility to reinvest in the business, while at the same time, accelerating capital returns to shareholders and lowering our leverage ratio. I'm pleased to announce that we are once again raising our share repurchase target. We are now committing to buying back at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our previous $3 billion target. Including repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, this brings our total share repurchase commitment up to at least $4 billion. This increased buyback reflects our confidence in the business, a strong capital position and our view on the intrinsic value of FIS' shares.\nLastly, we continue to execute against our future forward strategy, exceeding our targets for 2023 and increasing our commitment for operational excellence in 2024. The program is changing the way FIS operates with a focus on driving greater efficiency, effectiveness and growth for our clients and for FIS.\nOur successful efforts are underpinned by distinct and tangible proof points. For example, over the second half of 2023, we were able to return the company to year-over-year margin expansion, and we expect to drive further profitability improvements in 2024. We refocused our sales force to prioritize higher value, higher-margin technology sales, and we intensified our efforts to improve the customer experience, including accelerating implementations of our next-generation technology solutions. While there is still plenty of work to be done, I couldn't be prouder of the FIS team and what we've accomplished together in just a year's time.\nNow let's turn to a discussion of our financial results. Turning to Slide 6. The significant actions we undertook in 2023 are already driving improved financial outcomes. We delivered full year 2023 financial results ahead of our outlook, including 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance on a total company basis. Adjusted revenue growth of 2% was driven by strong total company recurring revenue growth of 4%, including 5% recurring growth across our banking and capital markets segments.\nProfitability improvements were primarily driven by our Future Forward program. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expanding over the second half of 2023, despite headwinds in high margin nonrecurring revenue such as license and termination fees. We meaningfully improved adjusted free cash flow conversion in 2023 to a normalized 95% as compared to 72% in 2022.\nCapital expenditures declined to approximately 8% of total company revenue in 2023, down from 9% in 2022 as a result of continued execution against Future Forward initiatives. Lastly, we returned over $1.7 billion in capital to our shareholders through the combination of both dividends and share repurchases with over $800 million in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 7. The trajectory of our recurring revenue growth trends exiting the year and continued expense management gives us confidence that both revenue growth and profitability are inflecting in 2024. We expect a sustainable acceleration in adjusted revenue growth from 3% in 2023 to more than 4% in 2024.\nThis acceleration is principally driven by a meaningful improvement in banking's revenue growth from 2% in 2023 to at least 3% in 2024. We expect the momentum we've been experiencing in our Capital Markets segment over the past few years to continue with healthy growth in excess of 6%. The segment will continue to benefit from market share gains and expansion into newer verticals.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, fueled by the success of our Future Forward strategy, we returned the company to year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the first time in nearly 2 years. Building on the success of Future Forward and the underlying fundamentals of the business, we are confident that the company is positioned for sustainable margin expansion in 2024 and beyond.\nThe revenue acceleration and operational improvements just discussed, coupled with balanced capital deployment, will allow us to deliver 5% to 7% normalized EPS growth, which includes a high single-digit negative dissynergy impact. As a result of this improved financial outlook, we are committed to returning over $4 billion of capital to our shareholders across buybacks and dividends in 2024.\nLooking forward, current favorable market trends as well as the operational efficiencies we continue to drive, leave us confident that we are positioned for further earnings acceleration beyond 2024.\nTurning to Slide 8. We are seeing increased client demand and a growing sales pipeline as our products and services continue to resonate, especially with large financial institutions. Based on the current level of activity we are seeing across our pipeline, we expect an acceleration in new sales in 2024 as compared to 2023, aiding revenue growth beyond 2024.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we signed multiple marquee wins across our businesses. Beginning with enterprise core platforms, we're seeing an increased demand from the regional community bank market for our bundled offerings of core digital payments through strong new sales and implementation. Additionally, we signed several new and expanded core engagements with regional community and international financial institutions, including a key competitive takeaway, Bank of California, with approximately $40 billion in assets.\nAlso, demand for FIS's digital banking solutions remains strong. Our Digital One platform was selected by some of the most demanding banks and financial institutions, including a global asset manager with greater than $1 trillion in assets under management. Likewise, we've seen continued robust sales for our Digital One studio with leading national regional and super regional banks, including Hancock Whitney, First Citizens Bank and Bank of Montreal. These banks have all deployed solutions from our digital suite, which offers deeper personalization capabilities in support of their deposit growth, product cross-sell and customer experience improvement objectives.\nTo underscore our progress in digital banking, our sales pipeline continues to expand with demand from large financial institutions increasing in the double digits. Our payments and network businesses continue to gain traction, and we are expanding our sales focus in these areas given the long growth runway they represent. The nice debit network had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed multiple new engagements with premier financial institutions, retailers and global media companies. Additionally, FedNow continues to gain traction. We now have over 215 clients either in contract or in our pipeline and we're now certified to both send and receive payments.\nMoving on to Capital Markets. Beginning with securities trading and processing, our market-leading clear derivative solution was selected by a global financial technology provider and a leading alternative asset manager. Additionally, our treasury solutions had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed new engagements with a leading financial technology company, several municipal governments, a multinational health care provider and an online consumer apparel provider.\nOur Lending Solutions also had a number of impressive new or expanded wins in the quarter. This included a leading U.S. automaker, several European automakers, as well as several global financial institutions who were seeking a partner who could service and support their global client base.\nI'm encouraged by the trends we experienced over the second half of 2023 and confident we are poised for a meaningful sales acceleration in 2024. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. I'm incredibly proud of the team for their commitment to our future forward strategy and the heightened focus on improving client centricity, accelerating product innovation and simplifying our go-to-market approach.\nOur performance in 2023 and our strengthened position entering 2024 give me confidence that we are on the right path to further improve operational and financial outcomes going forward. With that in mind, FIS plans to host an Investor Day in New York City on Tuesday, May 7. We hope you can join us for a discussion on our go-forward corporate strategy post the Worldpay separation, our playbook for sustainable success in our banking and capital markets segments and, of course, our multiyear financial targets and capital allocation framework.\nWith that, let me turn it over to James for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and 2024 outlook. James?\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 11 with some comments on our 2023 performance and the key drivers of earnings power for the upcoming year. As Stephanie noted, we are pleased with our results, having consistently exceeded the high-end of the outlook. The original EBITDA guidance was $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and the actual results came in well above the high end of the range. The outperformance was driven by strong recurring revenue growth from both Banking and Capital Markets, profitability improvements fueled by our future forward program and better-than-expected performance from Worldpay, which is now reflected in discontinued operations.\nOn January 31, we completed the majority sale of the Worldpay business. The transaction positions both companies for future success, allowing them to focus on their respective end markets and to pursue appropriate capital allocation strategies. The transaction has also allowed FIS to transform its capital structure, paying down debt to ensure an investment-grade rating while accelerating return of capital to shareholders and allowing for appropriate levels of investment in the business. FIS is now well positioned to deliver accelerating revenue growth with a return to sustainable margin expansion.\nRevenue growth will accelerate from 3% in 2023 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024 or 3.8% to 4.3%, excluding acquisitions and dissynergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to expand by 20 to 40 basis points. Adjusted EPS is projected to grow 38% to 41% year-over-year on a continuing operations basis, including a significant contribution from the deployment of Worldpay proceeds and the first-time inclusion of the Worldpay equity method investment contribution. On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dissynergies. Strong core business performance and our Future Forward program have more than offset the negative impact from dissynergies.\nTurning now to Slide 12 for a few considerations on our financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, FIS's 45% financial interest in Worldpay will now be reported separately on the equity method investment line of the income statement. Our 2024 adjusted EPS outlook of $4.66 to $4.76 includes a $0.69 to $0.71 contribution from Worldpay.\nPlease note that the $0.69 to $0.71 is for 11 months only. Had the transaction closed at the end of last year, our 2024 adjusted EPS for continuing operations would have been $0.06 higher, resulting in a pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82 on a full year basis. Consistent with our prior messaging, our go-forward adjusted EPS outlook will include the Worldpay EMI contribution and we will also be providing condensed quarterly financial results for Worldpay on a 100% basis, including revenue and EBITDA on both a GAAP and adjusted basis.\nLastly, going forward, FIS will be presenting revenue growth on an adjusted basis. This reflects year-over-year constant currency revenue growth for our Banking Solutions and Capital Markets operating segments.\nWith that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 13. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and this is the fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding the high end of our outlook. Including Worldpay, total company revenue increased 1% to $3.7 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.2% and adjusted EPS of $1.67. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year, held back by a margin decline in discontinued operations.\nOn a continuing operations basis, revenue was flat at $2.5 billion, and this was in line with our expectations. Strong recurring revenue growth across both banking and capital markets was offset by expected declines in nonrecurring revenue and professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by a strong 70 basis points year-over-year, led by meaningful margin expansion in Banking Solutions. Adjusted EPS for continuing operations was $0.94 in the quarter, a decline of 4% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher interest expense with a negative impact of $0.07. For discontinued operations, revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion, modestly ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 160 basis points reflecting a less favorable revenue mix and the timing of certain expenses.\nMoving now to cash flow and balance sheet metrics where we continue to drive improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in a normalized free cash flow conversion of 100% with a full year conversion rate of 95%. This compares very favorably to our 2023 full year target of greater than 80% free cash flow conversion. We ended the year with total debt of $19.1 billion with a leverage ratio of 3x.\nAs previously communicated, we repurchased $510 million of shares during the fourth quarter of '23, resulting in over $800 million of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year as a whole.\nTurning now to our segment results on Slide 14. For the quarter, adjusted revenue growth was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations. As expected, backlog remained stable, up $23.5 billion. Continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by anticipated nonrecurring headwinds.\nBanking revenue was flat in the quarter while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points, primarily driven by Future Forward cost initiatives. Banking recurring revenue grew a healthy 7%, including stronger-than-expected consumer spend in our payments business and the benefit from our prior year grow-over.\nNote that our calculation of banking recurring revenue growth reflects 2 changes: first, in keeping with historical practice, we have transitioned certain nonstrategic businesses, which we expect to sell or wind down from Banking solutions to the Corporate and Other segment; second, with the expiration of federal funds related to pandemic relief programs, we have moved this revenue from recurring revenue to nonrecurring revenue with no change to total revenue.\nWe have provided a detailed reconciliation table for these adjustments in the appendix. As you will see, these adjustments have a de minimis impact on full year recurring revenue growth. Banking recurring revenue growth of 4% in 2023 is unchanged, while the changes increase our 2022 recurring revenue growth by a mere 40 basis points.\nThe recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by expected declines in other nonrecurring revenue and professional services of 22% and 31%, respectively. The decline in other nonrecurring revenue includes an 11% headwind from the decline in pandemic relief revenues, while the decline in professional services reflects a difficult comparison.\nTurning now to Capital Markets. Capital Markets adjusted revenue increased 1%, led by continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7%. As expected, nonrecurring revenue declined by 10% and primarily driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison related to license fees, which we have consistently messaged throughout the year. The decline in higher-margin nonrecurring license revenue was the primary driver of the 250 basis point margin contraction.\nLooking forward, we will be facing lower headwinds from both professional services and other nonrecurring revenue. And we expect to see closer alignment between adjusted revenue growth and recurring revenue growth.\nTurning now to our full year results by segment on Slide 15. Adjusted revenue growth increased 3%, led by strong recurring revenue growth of 5%. Banking revenue was up 2% as recurring revenue growth of 4% offset declines in nonrecurring revenue and lower professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat, but margins were strong in the second half of the year as Future Forward savings accelerated. Capital markets revenue increased 5%, led by very strong recurring revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points to 50.3%, primarily due to lower margins over the second half of the year, reflecting a lower contribution from higher margin license fees.\nTurning now to Slide 16 for an update on Future Forward. I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our 2023 target for future forward OpEx savings, and we see further upside in 2024. We delivered in-period EBITDA savings of $155 million, well above our original goal of $100 million. And we are raising our 2024 incremental savings target from $215 million to $280 million.\nWe are reiterating our total cash savings target of $1 billion for the Future Forward program. We are reaffirming our capital reduction target, increasing our OpEx savings goal and adopting a slightly more conservative view regarding the reduction in acquisition, integration and other expenses.\nTurning now to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 17. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from the prior quarter. We intend to use our strong financial position and balance sheet flexibility to prioritize a balanced set of capital allocation priorities. These priorities include maintaining an investment-grade rating while investing to accelerate growth and consistently returning ample capital to shareholders.\nFor 2024, we are assuming a year-end leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x, which allows us ample flexibility to invest in the business while increasing our share repurchase target for the year. We remain committed to paying an above-market dividend. And going forward, we will grow the dividend in line with adjusted net earnings.\nReflecting our confidence in the business and our strong free cash flow generation, we are once again raising our share repurchase commitment. We now expect to repurchase at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our prior target of at least $3 billion. And through the first 2 months of this year, we have already repurchased approximately $490 million of the $3.5 billion target.\nLastly, we will selectively invest in complementary tuck-in M&A where we can leverage our scale and distribution to drive faster growth across strategic verticals. This balanced capital allocation framework provides a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value creation. In total, we expect to return greater than $4 billion to shareholders in 2024, up from $1.7 billion in 2023.\nNow let's move on to our 2024 outlook on Slide 18. Building on the operational and financial improvements of 2023, our '24 outlook confidently forecast accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins. We are projecting reported revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion. And this includes an adverse currency impact of around $20 million. Adjusted revenue growth will accelerate from 3% in '23 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024. Our projections include 70 basis points from closed tuck-in acquisitions, but this is mostly offset by a negative impact of 50 basis points from dissynergies. Net of these impacts, adjusted revenue growth would be approximately 3.8% to 4.3%. We expect the banking segment to grow between 3% to 3.5% and or 3.3% to 3.8% net of acquisitions and dissynergies, up from 2% in 2023. And we anticipate capital markets revenue growth of 6.5% to 7% or 5.1% to 5.6%, net of acquisitions as compared to 5% in 2023.\nWe are forecasting year-over-year margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points reflecting continued favorable impact from the Future Forward program and the inherent leverage in our business model. Included in this outlook is a $280 million year-over-year benefit from the Future Forward program, and this will more than offset dissynergies from the Worldpay transaction of $250 million.\nWe have provided our assumptions regarding the key below-the-line items with some additional details in the appendix. We are projecting D&A of $1.075 billion and we anticipate a tax rate of 17.2% to 17.5%. Interest expense is projected at around $350 million and we expect shares outstanding of 556 million shares, a reduction of 6% compared to 2023, including an 11-month EMI contribution of $0.69 to $0.71, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of between $4.66 and $4.76. This translates to a growth rate of 38% to 41% on a continuing operations basis. On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5.5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dissynergies. Lastly, on a pro forma basis, including 12 months of Worldpay EMI contribution, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82. We are confident in our balanced outlook for 2024, and and believe we are well positioned to accelerate long-term earnings growth.\nLet's move now to Slide 19, where we provide a reconciliation for our 2023 results on a normalized basis. Last quarter, we provided an estimated normalized adjusted EPS range of $4.40 to $4.55. I am happy to report that both continuing ops EPS and normalized EPS came in within the guidance ranges we provided. Continuing operations EPS was $3.37 and was at the higher end of the range that we provided on the third quarter call. On a 12-month basis, normalized EPS was $4.50. And again, this was toward the higher end of the range. Adjusted for an 11-month EMI contribution, 2023 normalized EPS is $4.44.\nMoving now to Slide 20 for an overview of our first quarter outlook. We are projecting revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, with Banking Solutions at 1% to 2% and Capital Markets at 6% to 7%. We expect Banking revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, reflecting easier year-over-year revenue comparisons and the favorable impact from stronger new sales over the second half of 2023. We are anticipating adjusted EBITDA of $955 million to $970 million, which translates to year-over-year margin expansion of 180 to 200 basis points, reflecting Future Forward savings, including an expected 2-month EMI contribution of $0.09 to $0.10 and we expect adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.97. Continuing operations EPS is projected to increase 31% to 35% and we estimate high single-digit growth on a normalized basis.\nIn summary, we are expecting a good start to the year with revenue growth accelerating compared to the fourth quarter and improved alignment between adjusted revenue and recurring revenue growth. Margins will expand and this is consistent with the performance delivered in the second half of last year.\nLet me now wrap up on Slide 21. In closing, we are encouraged by our 2023 results and believe we are on the right path as we reposition the enterprise for long-term success. The completion of the Worldpay transaction positions both companies for future success and meaningfully improves our capital structure. We are confident FIS will deliver accelerated business growth in 2024. And with adjusted revenue growth of at least 4% and a return to consistent margin expansion. And given our confidence in how the business is performing, our improved financial flexibility and the attractive valuation of our stock, we have once again raised our total share repurchase target to at least $3.5 billion in 2024 and greater than $4 billion in total. With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nWith me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and James Kehoe, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by James reviewing our financial results and providing forward guidance.\nToday's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. Let me start by saying it's an honor and a privilege to lead this very talented team who are collectively building the future of FIS.\nI'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter, executing on both our financial and operational commitments. This is our third straight quarter of solid financial results, once again meeting or exceeding the high end of our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook and delivering strong free cash flow conversion.\nWe have taken decisive actions to transform FIS over the past year with growing predictability of meeting or exceeding our targets and expanding margins with measurable impact from our Future Forward program. The Worldpay separation and our Future Forward execution repositions FIS into a company with a strong balance sheet, which enables us to both invest in growth and increase capital return to shareholders, while at the same time, reduces exposure to macro consumer trends.\nPost the Worldpay transaction, FIS will be a global enterprise software leader, positioned for a resilient recurring revenue growth, aided by beneficial secular trends, a marquee set of global clients and best-in-class products and solutions, which will all accelerate profitable revenue growth. The FIS of the future builds on our strong foundation, repositioning the company as a cloud-based enterprise software-as-a-service provider, servicing the world's most complex financial institutions and capital markets participants. This enables us to expand into new client segments as well as into new faster-growing verticals. All of this leads to confidence in our current year outlook, our future prospects and our plan to drive long-term shareholder value.\nOur confidence is further reinforced by positive momentum we are seeing across a number of key leading indicators. First, we continue to deliver steady recurring revenue growth, which extends our visibility and serve as a foundation for sustainable revenue growth.\nSecond, our sales pipeline is robust, and new customer engagement is strong. We are seeing an increase in sales force productivity and increasing pipeline of high-margin opportunities and a strong transition from onetime to recurring revenue as we take advantage of both market demand as well as secular trends.\nFinally, the traction that we are getting by bringing many of our clients live on our new platforms like Modern Banking Platform, Digital One and risk management solutions is driving positive future momentum. Given our confidence in the business and the attractive valuation of our stock, we are resuming share repurchases in the fourth quarter, increasing our total share repurchase goal to at least $3.5 billion by year-end 2024.\nLet's turn now to a discussion of our quarterly results. Moving to Slide 6. We delivered another strong quarter of financial results with broad-based outperformance relative to our prior outlook. The outperformance was driven by strong organic revenue growth of 4%, led by 7% recurring revenue growth in the combined Banking and Capital Markets segments and from profitability improvements driven by our Future Forward program.\nWe continue to generate strong free cash flow and are on track to exceed our 2023 free cash flow conversion target of greater than 80% for the year. Year-to-date free cash flow conversion is a very strong 94%. This is well ahead of our full year target as efficiency efforts related to Future Forward continue to cascade through the business. Our teams are continuing to move with quality, speed and a high sense of urgency, accelerating our path forward.\nTurning to Slide 7. We are making significant strides in transforming FIS. Our Worldpay separation remains on track to close in the first quarter of 2024. Since our last earnings call, FIS and Worldpay have achieved several important milestones necessary to advance the separation. We are very pleased with the success of the recent $8.7 billion Worldpay debt raise. The strong demand, evidenced by the upsizing of the debt offering at favorable rates, secures the committed financing required to close the deal. Looking ahead, we are working towards securing the necessary regulatory approvals to close the transaction and finalizing terms around commercial agreements.\nMoving to Future Forward. We are on track to deliver on all of our commitments, including $1 billion in total savings across the enterprise by year-end 2024. The program is sharpening our focus on innovating and delivering best-in-class solutions and products to market faster, simplifying our go-to-market approach and improving client experiences. This, in turn, is driving improved new sales momentum.\nTurning to Slide 8. FIS is uniquely positioned as the leading software solutions provider to the most demanding and complex financial institutions globally. And while recognized as the provider of choice for large FIs and regional banks, our next-generation offerings are increasingly resonating with a broader base of clients, who have increased financial services needs. This includes leading multinational corporates, insurance companies, leading global fintechs and neobanks.\nWe have developed a full suite of cloud-based, componentized enterprise solutions delivered via SaaS offering. Over this past year, we've focused significant efforts on bringing these solutions to market across our core digital and issuing platforms.\nAs a result, our next-generation core banking solution, Modern Banking Platform, is now live with a number of Tier 1 financial institutions and fintechs. This includes a new digital savings platform for BMO in the U.S., a digital interest-bearing deposit account product for PayPal and a deposit account for SMBC Group member, Manufacturer Bank's new Digital Banking division, Jenius Bank.\nLooking ahead to 2024, we expect more Tier 1 banks to go live with MBP offerings as part of a broader multiyear core modernization effort. We are equally excited about the prospects for our Digital One and Payment One solutions, bringing enhanced front-end digital experiences and complex issuer processing capability to the most demanding financial institutions.\nOur overall vision for our enterprise core platforms is to leverage the full value of our open architecture and robust APIs going forward, eliminating mass conversion complexity. This creates an open environment that speeds the FIS product and development flywheel to bring new capabilities to our clients with increased flexibility.\nIn Capital Markets, we are seeing strong tailwinds across business, a function of both increased wallet share and faster growth in nontraditional verticals. As the leading global provider of treasury and risk solutions, Capital Markets is benefiting from several secular trends. These include increased regulatory mandates, climate and environmental risk demand verticals such as insurance and asset management and growth in lending from nonbank providers.\nTurning to Slide 9. I am very encouraged by our sales momentum during the third quarter and pleased to announce several marquee wins across our Banking and Capital Markets segments. Beginning with the enterprise core platforms, FIS was selected by Provident Bank to drive the bank's core modernization going forward.\nIn digital, we had several wins in the quarter, including Origin Bank selecting our Digital One suite over the offerings of notable disruptor. We also had a particularly strong quarter in payments and network as money movement remains front and center for banks, fintechs and corporates.\nSales of the NICE network accelerated in the third quarter with notable signings of several leading retailers, restaurants and fintechs. And lastly, while still early days, we are encouraged by the interest we are seeing related to the rollout of FedNow, where we currently have over 190 clients in our pipeline, up from 116 clients just last quarter.\nMoving to Capital Markets. During the quarter, we had a number of impressive wins, including new or expanded engagements with some of the largest financial services providers in the world. We recently signed a long-term extension for our industry-leading derivatives clearing solution with a top 5 U.S. financial institution.\nWe also signed our largest contract ever for our private equity fund accounting software to a leading global investor services company. Demand for risk tools was strong across all geographies and verticals.\nOur FIS enterprise risk suite continues to gain traction with global investment banks and broker-dealers, especially in the growing insurance vertical with new sales to several leading U.S. and international clients. Overall, we are encouraged by the level and quality of engagements that we are seeing across the enterprise.\nMoving to Slide 10. During the third quarter, our differentiated solutions received a number of prominent industry accolades. First, leading research and advisory firm Celent recognized 3 of FIS core offerings with awards in advanced technology, customer base and breadth of functionality.\nOur industry-leading treasury solutions were recognized by leading advisory firm IDC and several industry publications. We are delighted to see that our solutions are not only resonating with clients but also with leading experts in influential advisory firms in the industry.\nTurning to Slide 11. Over the course of the year, we have been moving with a high sense of urgency to improve the performance of the business, free cash flow and capital allocation. We set a new agenda to ensure that clients are at the center of everything that we do to innovate across our portfolio with next-gen solutions.\nWe've made significant progress delivering on our financial and strategic commitments to date. The separation of Worldpay affords us the benefit of substantial upfront proceeds, which creates immediate capital allocation flexibility for us to accelerate capital return to shareholders while investing in growth.\nWe're excited about the outcome that the strategic transaction drives and remain confident in the underlying strength of our business and sustainable operating model going forward.\nWe look forward to hosting all of you at an FIS Investor Day in the second quarter of 2024.\nWith that, I'd like to introduce James Kehoe, our new CFO, who brings decades of experience navigating the dynamic financial environment and managing its aspects unique to large international organizations. I will now turn the call over to James.\n\nJames Kehoe\n\nExecutive VP & Global CFO\n\nThank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'm delighted to be here, and I look forward to meeting with all of you in the near future.\nAs noted in our earnings release, as of the third quarter, we have transitioned the Worldpay business into discontinued operations. Going forward, our ongoing FIS financials will be presented on a continuing operations basis. However, for this quarter, we will also present some of our metrics on a total company basis, and this will allow you to compare to our prior total company outlook.\nContinuing operations now reflects 2 principal operating segments: Banking and Capital Markets as well as the Corporate and Other segment. As we review the split between continuing operations and discontinued operations, I would note that the continuing operations income statement understates the true earnings power of FIS.\nFor example, the continuing operations financial results do not yet include the EPS contribution from our 45% equity stake in Worldpay nor does it include the significant EPS upside from the deployment of the Worldpay net cash proceeds, including a planned debt reduction of approximately $9 billion and share repurchases of at least $3.5 billion through 2024. Taken together, these items will have a meaningful impact on EPS, and we estimate like-for-like earnings power of around $4.40 to $4.55 for 2023.\nLet's now move to our third quarter results. As Stephanie mentioned in her prepared remarks, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, and it is the third consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding the high end of our outlook.\nIncluding Worldpay, total company revenue increased 2% on an organic basis to $3.7 billion with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 44.2% and adjusted EPS of $1.65. The adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 50 basis points year-over-year, 20 basis points above the high end of our expectations driven by strong incremental margins on our recurring revenue and continued benefits from Future Forward. This marks the first year-over-year EBITDA margin improvement since the fourth quarter of 2021, and we expect continued year-over-year margin improvement in the fourth quarter.\nOn a continuing operations basis, revenue increased 4% organically to $2.5 billion led by strong growth in recurring revenue across both Banking and Capital Markets. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year to 43% led by strong margin [indiscernible] in Banking. Adjusted EPS for continuing operations was $0.94 in the quarter, a decline of 7% compared to prior year, and this was entirely due to higher interest costs.\nFor discontinued operations, which reflect our Merchant segment, revenue decreased 1% organically to $1.2 billion. That was broadly in line with our expectations for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 46.8%, reflecting continued Future Forward efficiencies. And adjusted EPS came in at $0.71.\nMoving now to cash flow and balance sheet metrics, and we continue to drive improvements across multiple vectors. Capital expenditures were reduced 5% year-over-year to $298 million or 8% of revenue as we continue to optimize and prioritize investments.\nWe generated strong free cash flow of $907 million, resulting in a free cash flow conversion of 92% for the quarter and 94% year-to-date. This compares very favorably to our prior target of greater than 80% free cash flow conversion.\nLastly, we reduced our total debt by approximately $800 million to $18.7 billion, yielding a leverage ratio of 3x while also returning over $300 million to shareholders.\nTurning now to our segment results on Slide 15. Recurring revenue increased 7% with strength across both Banking and Capital Markets, and this led to organic revenue growth of 4% for the quarter. Backlog was $22.5 billion, increasing 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting improved sales execution.\nBanking revenue grew 3% organically in the quarter. And recurring revenue grew 7%, including a benefit of approximately 4 percentage points as a result of an outsized contribution from servicing federally funded pandemic relief programs. Pandemic relief had little impact on the Banking growth rates in the first half of 2023, but the third quarter results did exceed our expectations.\nAs anticipated, we saw declines in professional services and other nonrecurring revenue of 18% and 11%, respectively. These declines reflect a difficult year-over-year comparison in license revenue and lower customization projects in professional services. Banking EBITDA margin expanded 120 basis points to 44.6% primarily driven by Future Forward cost initiatives.\nCapital Markets revenue increased 6% organically led by continued strong recurring revenue growth of 8%. Consistent with our year-to-date trends, professional services revenue decreased 8% as we continue to shift to recurring revenue engagements, while other nonrecurring revenue increased 13% due to higher license revenue. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 80 basis points to 49%, mostly reflecting the timing of operating expenses.\nTurning now to the outlook of -- for 2023 on Slide 16. This chart provides an outlook for the total enterprise prior to implementing accounting for discontinued operations.\nWe are raising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA outlook ranges to reflect continued strong operational results and good visibility around fourth quarter trends. Total company revenue is now projected at $14.6 billion to $14.65 billion, including an adverse currency impact of $25 million.\nOn a constant currency basis, we are increasing the lower end of the range by $125 million and the higher end of the range by $44 million. As we close out the year, we are narrowing our ranges for segment growth. In Banking, we are narrowing our outlook to 1.3% to 1.7%, in line with our prior expectations.\nFor Capital Markets, we now anticipate organic revenue growth of approximately 5% to 5.5% primarily due to an expected shift in license fees into 2024. And lastly, we've improved our Merchant segment outlook to account for recent performance. As expected, this implies a slight deceleration in organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter for both Banking and Capital Markets, reflecting difficult year-over-year comparisons related to nonrecurring revenue headwinds.\nAs a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate a 5-point headwind in Capital Markets as we lap a very strong year-ago quarter for license revenue. However, consistent with the trends we have seen all year, we do anticipate another solid quarter of recurring revenue growth with approximately 3% growth in Banking and 7% growth in Capital Markets. We are also increasing our adjusted EBITDA range to $6.1 billion to $6.15 billion, reflecting higher revenues and improved EBITDA margin.\nIn summary, we are raising our full year outlook to reflect continued outperformance and a favorable future outlook.\nTurning now to Slide 17, where we are providing updated assumptions regarding the Worldpay transaction. We now anticipate net proceeds of more than $12 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to our prior estimate.\nObviously, we will provide a final net proceeds number once the transaction closes. As previously disclosed, the proceeds will be used to transform our capital structure by significantly delevering the balance sheet while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders.\nOverall, we anticipate reducing gross debt to approximately $10 billion, leading to a significant reduction in interest costs post transaction. As we get more visibility into net cash proceeds and continue to deliver strong cash conversion, we are now comfortable reinstituting share repurchases of approximately $500 million by year-end.\nToday, we are increasing the targeted share repurchases from $2.5 billion to at least $3.5 billion by the end of 2024. And we will continue to assess additional capacity throughout the year. We will accomplish this share repurchase goal while still remaining comfortably within our targeted leverage ratios.\nWe expect full year 2023 D&A of approximately $1 billion on a continuing operations basis. And you should assume growth of 8% to 10% in 2024 as past capital investments flow through the income statement.\nSome good news on tax rate. We now anticipate an effective tax rate of 17% to 18%, down 200 to 300 basis points compared to the 19% to 21% we communicated previously. We continue to expect incremental Future Forward savings of $215 million in 2024. And our forecast for adjusted EBITDA dissynergies remain approximately $200 million in 2024. And finally, we can confirm that we will report the after-tax earnings from our 45% stake in Worldpay within our adjusted net earnings and adjusted EPS. And we'll include this in our 2024 outlook.\nTurning now to our outlook for continuing operations on Slide 18. The left-hand side of this chart lays out our 2023 outlook for continuing operations, excluding Worldpay. This results in adjusted EPS of $3.30 to $3.40.\nHowever, as I noted earlier, the 2023 continuing operations income statement does not accurately reflect the true earnings power of FIS. A good example is interest expense. The continuing operations interest expense is burdened with the entire interest expense of FIS with no interest expense allocated to discontinued operations. This artificially depresses the earnings of continuing operations.\nShifting to the right side of the chart, let's discuss the earnings power of FIS. Worldpay NCI adds approximately $0.60 to $0.65 of adjusted EPS on a full year 2023 basis. And the deployment of the Worldpay transaction proceeds would add $0.65 as we meaningfully reduce interest expense and share count. These benefits are modestly offset by a higher tax rate.\nOverall, this leads to a normalized 2023 EPS of $4.40 to $4.55. We will provide our outlook for 2024 revenue and adjusted EBITDA during our fourth quarter earnings call.\nSwitching gears now to Future Forward. On a continuing operations basis, we delivered approximately $55 million of year-to-date savings. This year, we anticipate $100 million of in-period savings and expect to exit the year with run rate benefits of $200 million. This aligns with our expectation of $215 million of year-over-year benefit to 2024 adjusted EBITDA, and we will provide quarterly updates through the life of the program. Overall, we continue to anticipate $1 billion of total cash savings across all 3 categories of cash optimization.\nMoving now to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 20. Post the Worldpay transaction, FIS will be in a very strong position with significant balance sheet flexibility and a balanced set of capital allocation priorities.\nWe will prioritize investments to accelerate revenue and EPS growth while returning ample capital to shareholders over time. We will target a strong balance sheet and maintain investment-grade credit ratings.\nGiven our strong free cash flow generation and predictable revenue streams, we are reiterating our long-term gross leverage range of 2.5 to 3x adjusted EBITDA. We intend to maintain a competitive dividend, and we will grow the dividend in line with adjusted net earnings. We will selectively invest in M&A, targeting smaller, complementary but highly synergistic targets where we can leverage our tremendous scale and distribution to drive faster growth across strategic verticals.\nAs mentioned earlier, we will deploy excess capital for share repurchases. And going forward, we anticipate that share repurchases will be a key element of our value proposition to shareholders. We are convinced that this balanced capital allocation framework provides a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value creation.\nIn closing, let me say again how excited I am to be joining the FIS team during this time of transformation. I believe we are on the right path to unlock meaningful shareholder value as we reposition the enterprise for long-term success.\nAs you have seen, this quarter marks the third consecutive quarter of delivering on our financial commitments, with results at or above the high end of our outlook. As such, we are confident in increasing our total company outlook for the year.\nWe have also introduced an outlook for 2023 continuing operations in line with our prior expectations. And lastly, given the confidence in how the business is performing, our improved financial flexibility and the attractive valuation of our stock, we are reinstituting share repurchases with approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. And we are raising the total buyback to at least $3.5 billion through 2024.\nWith that, operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, Shereen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the FIS Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation, updated investor facts and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com. With me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and Erik Hoag, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with the strategic and operational update, followed by Erik reviewing our financial results and providing forward guidance.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We continue to move with speed and a sense of urgency, accelerating our path forward, and we're making strong progress delivering on our financial and strategic commitments to drive change across the enterprise for all of our stakeholders.\nOn July 6, we announced a landmark transaction with GTCR, positioning both FIS and Worldpay for long-term success and accelerating us on the path to unlock shareholder value from the planned separation. Our Future Forward initiatives are simplifying our business and driving increased client centricity while improving efficiency and financial outcomes across the company. And our second quarter results show the impact of this effort, exceeding expectations and our guidance. While we have more work to do, I am very proud of our team, and I'm more optimistic than ever as we bring the company's Future Forward.\nTurning to Slide 6. I'm pleased to report FIS delivered another quarter of solid financial results. Second quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS all exceeded the high end of our guidance range. Solid execution across all 3 of our business segments and a continued focus on expense discipline drove the outperformance relative to our outlook. On a combined basis, the Banking and Capital Markets businesses posted healthy recurring revenue growth of 4%. This represents a more normalized rate of growth within our 3% to 5% cycle range.\nBuilding on the profitability improvements we delivered in the second quarter, we are confident in our ability to deliver sequential adjusted EBITDA margin improvement over the course of 2023, led by improvement in the Banking Solutions segment. We are on track to deliver on our greater-than-80% free cash flow conversion commitment for 2023, with year-to-date conversion an impressive 94%. Post the closing of the Worldpay transaction, we would expect free cash flow to further align even more closely with net earnings. Reflecting the first half outperformance and current business trends, today, we are again raising our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023.\nTurning to Slide 7. As we announced in early July, we signed a definitive agreement to sell a 55% stake in the Worldpay Merchant Solutions business to GTCR, a leading private equity firm with deep expertise in the payment space. We believe this transaction represents a superior outcome for FIS shareholders, relative to pursuing a spin-off of Worldpay into the public markets. It accelerates our path forward to create 2 highly focused and independent companies, infusing new capital quickly into Worldpay for investment, while generating substantial upfront proceeds to transform FIS' balance sheet, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders.\nFirst, the $18.5 billion transaction immediately establishes an attractive market-aligned value for the Worldpay business, representing over 10x Worldpay's 2023 adjusted EBITDA. This represents a premium to FIS's trading multiple of approximately 8x prior to deal announcement. As we continue to execute on our strategy and deliver on our financial commitments, we believe FIS is well positioned to expand our valuation multiple further.\nSecond, the upfront proceeds of at least $11.7 billion will allow us to delever the balance sheet quickly, while simultaneously accelerating capital returns to shareholders at unique attractive valuation levels. Erik will elaborate on our capital allocation priorities during his discussion of our financial results. However, we see significant value in the shares at current levels and are eager to rapidly capitalize on the valuation dislocation for the benefit of our shareholders.\nLastly, we believe this transaction best positions FIS and Worldpay to better focus on their respective markets, clients and colleagues while promoting a continued close relationship between the 2 companies crystallized by commercial partnerships. Going forward, Worldpay will remain an important partner and distribution channel for FIS, while Worldpay will continue to benefit from access to FIS's array of bank tech solutions and services. I look forward to working closely with Charles Drucker and the Worldpay management team for many years to come.\nThe partnership with GTCR also ensures that Worldpay will have ample access to capital to pursue near-term inorganic growth opportunities while maintaining a healthy balance sheet. We're excited about the transaction and the prospect of generating meaningful returns for our shareholders, and we will look forward to updating you on developments as we approach closing by first quarter 2024.\nTurning to Slide 8 for an update on trends we're seeing across our Banking and Capital Markets businesses and the key drivers of growth within our existing base of clients. In May, we held our annual flagship industry conference, Emerald, with 4,000 clients and influencers in attendance. The overarching takeaway from the conference was that clients are excited about our path forward and are looking for their trusted technology partners like FIS to better help them navigate the evolving landscape. FIS is well positioned to serve our clients on several market trends that are top of mind across their C-suites.\nFirst, the secular shift towards digital that has permeated money movement broadly defined across Banking and Capital Markets and supports our normalized rate of growth as more and more financial transactions take place across a variety of banking channels. The need to embrace next-generation cloud-native technology with modernized digital user interfaces has never been greater. The competitive lines are blurring as upstart fintechs, global technology companies and even retailers encroach on the traditional banking landscape with digital-first offerings.\nFIS was early in embracing the promise of cloud technology with over 85% of current compute in the cloud and the launch of several digital native solutions, including Digital One, Payments One and Modern Banking Platform, which was just recognized for several industry awards. While prior investments position FIS with an early-mover advantage, we are not standing still and continue to prioritize spend to further leverage the cloud, improve the end user experience and ensure we enable all types of digital money movement.\nSecond, the rapidly rising interest rate environment is creating greater competition for deposits. Financial institutions and asset managers are relying on digital-only, high-yield savings accounts and online access to money market accounts, ultimately increasing the number of total accounts across the banking system. Account growth, which continued sequentially from the first quarter and transaction and growth across our platforms, are the primary drivers of recurring organic revenue growth across both the FIS Banking and Capital Markets segments. FIS has partnered with a number of blue-chip banks and fintechs powering their digital-only account offerings.\nAlso, post the SVB fallout, financial institutions are proactively preparing for increased regulatory oversight with a greater focus on managing interest rate risk and profitability. The situation is fluid with new regulations still being discussed by regulators and legislators, but the need for best-in-class reg tech offerings is mission-critical to bank's operations. We're seeing consistent demand for balance sheet and treasury management solutions and expect that momentum to continue.\nAnd lastly, we've recently seen increased consolidation across the financial industry and acquiring institutions requiring the expertise of a trusted core provider to assist in quickly and seamlessly onboarding new accounts at scale. We believe FIS is a relative beneficiary of industry consolidation given the company's skew towards larger financial institutions.\nTurning to Slide 9. FIS offers a wide range of software-led solutions that are resonating across a diverse range of end markets, with our product reach increasingly extending beyond traditional financial institutions. I'm pleased to report, we've closed several notable wins this quarter across the host of solutions, beginning with enterprise core platforms. We saw a solid momentum across our product set. Notable wins include the sale of our Digital One platform as well as an expansion of services provided to a large global fintech provider.\nNext, our payments and networks offerings underpinned by our loyalty solutions, including premium payback and our proprietary debit network, NICE, continue to see tailwinds. We signed several new premium payback engagements in the second quarter, including a leading retailer and a major U.S. financial institution. We continue to be excited about the prospects of our NICE debit network going forward and expect the offering to be a beneficiary of the recently implemented REG 2 rules.\nIn our Capital Markets business, demand for our institutional solutions continues to be robust. Sales of our treasury and risk management solutions remain particularly strong. And we're seeing solid traction across the board with increased penetration across nontraditional verticals such as large corporates, including insurance and auto finance companies.\nFinally, I'm delighted with the progress we're making across our Amplify initiative, which was designed to accelerate cross-sells across the enterprise. We had a solid quarter of Amplify-driven sales, particularly the selling of acquiring services into multiple banking and Capital Markets clients. Amplify remains a core part of our sales strategy going forward post the Worldpay transaction. Supported by commercial partnerships, we expect Worldpay will remain a key distribution channel for Banking and Capital Market services for years to come.\nTurning to Slide 10. We're making continued progress across our enterprise-wide transformation program, Future Forward. We're well on our way to delivering on our previously communicated cash expense saving and shifting those savings into client-centered outcomes. We continue to prioritize investments focused on modernizing our technology stack, leveraging the cloud, simplifying our user interface and improving the digital experience for end users of our products.\nWe recently welcomed a new Chief Technology Officer at FIS with an extensive background in the consumer digital technology space. Our CTO is entrusted with ensuring FIS continues to embrace a developer-focused, innovation-driven culture with the appropriate personnel in place to lead FIS forward and stay ahead of the curve. We're excited about the prospects AI presents for our business and our clients. AI holds the promise of improving employee and client productivity, accelerating development and implementation time lines, reducing costs and improving product quality and customer care.\nWe have several ongoing AI-driven initiatives across the company, and we expect to materially increase the number of programs over the coming months. The early results from these initiatives are encouraging.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Erik. Erik?\n\nErik D. Hoag\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll begin on Slide 12 with an overview of our second quarter financial results.\nOverall, we delivered effectively against our commitments, exceeding the high end of our outlook for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, revenue increased 2% organically to $3.7 billion, with adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.4% and adjusted earnings per share of $1.55. Revenue outperformance in the quarter was driven by our Capital Markets segment, exceeding the high end of our outlook, with Banking and Merchant both in line with the high end.\nAs we anticipated, each of our 3 operating segments saw sequential improvement in their adjusted EBITDA margins, with Merchant returning to expansion in the quarter. Adjusted EPS exceeded the high end of our outlook by $0.05, driven by outperformance in EBITDA and some below-the-line favorability in the quarter.\nMoving to cash flow and our balance sheet. We continue to see improvements across multiple vectors. Our capital expenditures decreased 13% year-over-year to $267 million or 7% of revenue, reflecting continued benefit from our Future Forward initiatives. We generated free cash flow of $953 million in the second quarter, resulting in a year-to-date free cash flow conversion of 94%, well above our full year commitment of greater-than-80% conversion. Lastly, we reduced our total debt by approximately $500 million to $19.5 billion, yielding a leverage ratio of 3.2x at a weighted average interest rate of 3.4%, and we returned over $300 million to shareholders through dividends. The team continues to focus on both our operational strengths, cash flow fundamentals as long-term drivers to sustainable shareholder value creation.\nTurning to our Banking and Capital Markets results on Slide 13. On a combined basis, the segments delivered organic revenue growth of 3% in the quarter, driven by 4% recurring revenue growth. Our large and stable backlog held steady, in line with our expectations, exiting the quarter at $23 billion, reflecting flat year-over-year growth and sequential growth of 1% as we recognize revenue while replenishing with new sales. This backlog metric includes contracted yet unrecognized sales with varying contract durations and times to implementation, making it one of many inputs to our underlying growth.\nLooking back, outsized backlog growth over the past few years was largely driven by a handful of large and unique transactions. Excluding these outsized transactions, backlog growth has been stable, while recurring revenue, excluding these transactions, posted growth within our cycle guidance. And more recently, while our year-over-year backlog growth has ranged between flat to 2%, we've seen healthy recurring revenue growth in the first half of 2023 for Banking and Capital Markets.\nAs we noted previously, our sales teams continue to transition to higher quality new sales, which will drive sustainable high-margin long-term growth. This change in sales initiatives is incorporated into our outlook for the year. And while still early in the transition, we're seeing some early indications of success with improvement in the contribution margin on new sales.\nAt the segment level, Banking increased 2% organically in the quarter with recurring revenue growth of 3%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 200 basis points to 42.5%, an improvement from the down 250 basis points we saw in the first quarter. Margin contraction was primarily driven by revenue mix as we saw a 10% reduction in high-margin onetime revenue. We continue to anticipate margin expansion in the back half of the year for the Banking segment as Future Forward continues to ramp.\nShifting to the Capital Markets segment, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Capital markets increased 7% organically in the quarter with recurring revenue growth of 10%. Revenue growth was driven by the strength of our modernized solution suite, strong sales execution and the multiyear shift from a license to SaaS-based go-to-market strategy.\nAdjusted EBITDA margins expanded 100 basis points to 50.2%. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by high contributions on recurring revenue, growth in high-margin license revenue and a reduction in low-margin professional services. Overall, we're pleased with the progress in the first half of the year as we continue to position FIS for sustainable growth in revenue, profit and earnings for years to come.\nTurning to Slide 14. Worldpay revenue increased 1% organically with similar subsegment trends as seen in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points year-over-year or 480 basis points sequentially as we grew our high-margin revenue streams across the operating segment and delivered on cost management. Global volumes grew 6% in the quarter, driven by both consumer spending and strong execution, while our revenue yield improved by 2 points compared to our first quarter results.\nTurning to Slide 15 for a financial update on Future Forward. As previously messaged, we remain committed to rightsizing our expense base while ensuring an appropriate level of investment in the initiatives outlined in Stephanie's comments. Our Future Forward program centers around this goal with a focus on improving the ways we work and go to market as a company. On a holdco basis, we continue to make significant progress in our cash savings achievement. Exiting the quarter, we achieved over $175 million in annual run rate operational expense reduction, resulting in over $35 million benefit to the quarter. We also increased our capital expenditure achievement to over $140 million as we continue to trend to our $200 million commitment in 2023.\nIn summary, the Future Forward program continues to provide a tangible benefit to our financial P&L and operational health, while enhancing the ways we work. In a moment, I'll provide some estimates on the operational expense targeted to FIS moving forward.\nTurning to Slide 16 for a recap of our capital allocation priorities for FIS. Throughout 2023 and following the transaction close, FIS will remain focused on reducing debt, paying an appropriate dividend and using excess capital for share repurchase or tuck-in M&A. Our first priority remains a strong balance sheet and investment-grade ratings. Given our free cash flow generation and highly recurring revenue streams, we're comfortable with the long-term gross leverage range of 2.5 to 3x adjusted EBITDA.\nNext, we remain committed to paying our dividend, and we are reiterating a 35% payout ratio based off FIS adjusted net earnings. We intend to grow this dividend in line with adjusted net earnings going forward, consistent with our historical practice.\nLastly, our default use of excess capital will be share repurchases, inclusive of at least $2.5 billion tied to transaction proceeds with potential upside to this number given the attractive valuation of our stock. Longer term, we intend to consistently return excess capital to our shareholders through share repurchases, while leveraging our advantages of scale and distribution to supplement growth in strategic verticals with complementary tuck-in M&A. This capital allocation strategy provides a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value creation over a multiyear period.\nTurning to Slide 17 for an overview of our revised outlook. On a holdco basis, our second quarter results lead us to confidently increase our guidance to $14.5 billion to $14.63 billion in revenue and $6.03 billion to $6.15 billion in adjusted EBITDA. Consistent with our first quarter revision, this increase aligns with the high end of our guidance to our second quarter beat, in addition to a change in FX assumptions while significantly increasing the low end of our ranges.\nBeginning in the third quarter, the Worldpay business will be transitioned to discontinued operations, and we will be restating our first half 2023 financials to reflect this. At that time, we will look to provide an updated outlook for FIS's continuing operations.\nOur adjusted EPS metric will now be less meaningful given the impending transition of the Worldpay business into discontinued operations. And because of this, we're focusing investors on revenue and adjusted EBITDA until we provide an updated outlook for FIS's continuing operations.\nOn a consolidated basis, we now anticipate organic revenue growth of approximately 1%. This reflects an increase to the low end of both Banking and Capital Markets organic growth outlook to 1% to 2% and 5% to 6%, respectively. Given the impending transition to discontinued operations, we are not updating our Merchant segment outlook from our previously issued full year guidance at this time. That said, we're pleased with the segment's performance over the first half of 2023, and we remain confident in the underlying strength of the Worldpay business.\nWe continue to anticipate margin improvement in Banking and Capital Markets as we ramp the benefits associated with Future Forward. And we are reiterating our outlook for free cash flow conversion of over 80%. As seen in our year-to-date results, we remain confident in delivering on our commitments.\nI'll conclude on Slide #18 with some considerations for FIS in 2024. Following the close of the transaction, FIS will retain a 45% equity stake in the Worldpay business in partnership with GTCR. This equity stake was valued at over $4 billion, accounting for approximately $7 per share at our current share count. We anticipate an effective tax rate for FIS of approximately 19% to 21%. This increase from our current effective tax rate is primarily due to the reduction of the TRA benefit and accounts for increases in the corporate tax rate in certain regions. As previously stated, we would anticipate $10 billion of total gross debt after the transaction closed. We expect this debt will carry a weighted average interest rate of approximately 3.25% to 3.75%.\nAs noted in the announcement of the transaction, we would anticipate deleveraging to approximately 2.5x, translating to an adjusted EBITDA of approximately $3.9 billion to $4 billion, inclusive of our estimated RemainCo corporate expense.\nWith regards to our Future Forward program, we expect substantial cost savings of approximately $1 billion for FIS post the Worldpay separation, retaining 80% of the original program. We previously anticipated a year-over-year benefit of approximately $300 million to adjusted EBITDA in 2024. Following the close of the transaction, this $300 million will become approximately $215 million, with an annual run rate of approximately $425 million exiting 2024.\nWe also anticipate adjusted EBITDA dissynergies for FIS of approximately $200 million, including $100 million of revenue dissynergies and $100 million of incremental operational expense dissynergies. We will look to minimize these dissynergies with our Future Forward program.\nWhile we've made significant progress, we're still working diligently to disentangle both allocated infrastructure expense and depreciation and amortization expense between the 2 entities. When appropriate, we'll provide further commentary on both of these items.\nI'll conclude by saying that the team and I are excited about the progress that we've made to continue to move FIS forward and the underlying fundamentals of the business for years to come. I'd like to thank everyone for their time this morning. Operator, will you please open the line for questions?"

[Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Georgios Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com. With me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and our CFO, Erik Hoag. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by Erik reviewing our financial results and providing forward guidance.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. I'm pleased to report that FIS is off to a very strong start in 2023. Our financial results exceeded our expectations on all key metrics: revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Organic revenue growth outperformed across all 3 of our operating segments.\nThis outperformance was driven by a combination of both stronger execution, as well as better-than-anticipated macroeconomic impacts, including consumer spending and higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth across the financial services sector. Heritage FIS, which includes our banking and capital markets businesses, posted strong recurring revenue growth of 6%. Merchant revenue grew 2% driven by 15% organic growth in our e-commerce business, well ahead of the broader market.\nWe remain focused on improving cash flow and efficiency across the company and are on track to delivering on our greater than 80% free cash flow conversion target for the year. These are very strong results against our expectations and can be attributed to our leadership team and our colleagues across the globe, all pulling together to build our future forward. I'm extremely proud of the team, and I'm very excited about and confident in the future of FIS.\nAs a result of our strong performance, I am pleased to announce we are raising our full year outlook. First quarter results meaningfully exceeded our expectations, reflecting stronger revenue growth of 3% across the enterprise. Solid execution and a more favorable macro environment fueled this outperformance. Banking and Capital Markets recurring revenue growth of 6% exceeded our expectations, benefiting from elevated financial services activity, including higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth.\nWithin the Merchant segment, improved execution and stronger consumer spend drove most of the revenue upside. E-commerce had another very strong quarter with 18% organic growth, excluding the Russia-Ukraine impact in the quarter, contributing an additional point of merchant revenue growth relative to our internal expectations.\nWe are updating our second quarter and full year guidance to reflect consistent trends from the first quarter to the second quarter, with a very slight moderation in the high levels of trading volume experienced in Q1. Our outlook for the full year has strengthened relative to the outlook we provided in February across all of our operating segments.\nGiven our overall strong results and improving operating performance, we are increasing our full year 2023 outlook, while continuing to account for risk associated with macroeconomic impacts to our Merchant segment in the back half of the year. We understand the importance of delivering on our commitments and are confident in our recently raised outlook.\nWe continue moving forward with a high sense of urgency and are making progress across our range of initiatives. The spin-off of Worldpay is on track. We are making meaningful progress both internally with the formation of our separation management office and externally with our regulators. Our future forward initiatives, designed to drive greater efficiency, effectiveness and growth, is off to an exceptional start.\nI'm confident we will not only deliver on our 2023 cash savings target of $500 million, but achieve at least our $1.25 billion of cash savings target by year-end 2024. On the governance front, we've taken broad steps forward to align all management compensation with operating share price performance. These changes were made in order to further align our executive compensation programs with long-term shareholder interest. We've also reorientated our sales force compensation plans to align to our stated goal of pursuing high-quality, higher-margin deals. We are driving a performance-based culture both tops down and bottoms up across the globe.\nWe are making good progress preparing for the planned spin-off of the Worldpay business. This is a testament to the hard work, focus and dedication of our FIS colleagues and business partners tasked with marshalling forward the separation quickly. We are making meaningful progress having created a separation management office to work with both Charles Drucker and me.\nIn addition to working towards securing required regulatory approvals, we are urgently negotiating commercial revenue and separation agreements across the 2 companies with an eye towards minimizing business disruption and dissynergy. While we are not yet ready to provide formal dissynergy estimates on this call, we are actively working to minimize the impact of any dissynergies.\nI'd like to offer a framework for thinking through the potential impact, which we believe will be very manageable. Previously, the company disclosed that it achieved a total of $750 million in revenue synergies and $500 million of operating expense synergies post the Worldpay acquisition. We expect to maintain the majority of the $750 million revenue synergy achievement with Worldpay continuing to act as an important distribution partner for FIS post spin.\nWe also expect to maintain a meaningful portion of FIS Worldpay operating expense integration savings. Additionally, my partnership with Charles Drucker is already bringing focus to the business and is driving meaningful results in key areas, such as sales execution, and maximizing pricing opportunities across all of FIS.\nAs I mentioned earlier, our Enterprise Transformation Program, Future Forward is off to a great start. We are confident not only achieving our targeted $500 million of cash savings in 2023, but have direct line of sight into executing on the additional $750 million of cash savings expected in 2024, while investing in improved client service and next-generation product development for our clients.\nAs of first quarter of 2023, we've achieved a total cash savings on an annual run rate basis in excess of $210 million. We expect operating expense savings to accelerate over the course of the year. While we are reiterating our Future Forward cash savings target of at least $1.2 billion -- $1.25 billion by year-end 2024, the team is continuing to identify additional opportunities across the enterprise to unlock growth, efficiency and effectiveness for FIS and our clients.\nWhile we are confident the program will deliver meaningful cash savings for FIS, this will not come at the expense of clients who remain at the center of our decision-making. We believe our solid first quarter recurring revenue growth underscores the importance of our customers' place on our offerings and services and our commitment to their own future.\nGiven recent events across the global banking sector, we want to provide you with an update regarding trends across our Banking segment. While recent developments have driven volatility in markets and across the banking sector, we do not expect this activity to impact us significantly in the near term, and believe FIS is well positioned to be a beneficiary of the recent disruption in the long term.\nOur confidence is underpinned both by current factors we are presently seeing in our business and historical precedent, which points to resilient bank IT spend following periods of financial duress.\nA recent study by Curinos, a leading provider of data, technology and insights to financial institutions noted: Recent events should have a limited impact on near-term revenue for core processors as the current situation is impacting deposit balances, not accounts. Additionally, technology processing spend across the banking industry has also historically been resilient during prior challenging cycles of uncertainty.\nIn line with Curinos' perspective, since the onset of the SVB fallout in early March, we have seen elevated increases in our accounts on file serviced across our core platforms, which is the primary driver of our banking revenue. The resilience and accounts on file is not surprising to us. It aligns with what the banking industry experienced during prior challenging periods as the Curinos study noted, and supports our confidence in our outlook for the Banking segment.\nAs depositors disperse funds across multiple bank accounts, ultimately driving more account growth, FIS is well positioned to benefit as a leading provider of core banking technology, particularly to large financial institutions, which is the primary base of our FI business. Additionally, to the extent the recent turbulence results in increased regulation, FIS is well positioned to benefit across both the Banking and Capital Markets segments.\nFIS boasts a highly diversified customer base with no one client accounting for more than 1% of company revenue. Given our SKU towards somewhat larger banks, consolidation across the FI space should benefit us as we would expect these larger banks, many of which are FIS customers, to be the buyers of distressed financial institutions, and this is exactly what we've seen play out thus far with respect to recently sold failed financial banks.\nAdditionally, 60% of our revenue growth is predominantly tied to accounts and 40% to transactions. Since the SVB announcement, we've seen a modest acceleration in accounts on file and transaction volumes remain steady. Given these dynamics, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our business associated with the recent events.\nBefore turning it over to Erik, I'd like to close with a quick refresh of the new agenda we introduced just a few short months ago and the significant progress we are making executing against those goals. As you can see, we are moving urgently to put FIS on a path for sustained value creation for all stakeholders. The macroeconomic conditions, whether consumer or financial services related, have positively impacted our results in the first quarter and regardless of whether they remain or decline from this point forward, we are confident enough to raise our outlook for the year.\nThe planned spin-off of Worldpay is on track, creating 2 world-class companies with a sharpened focus on their respective client bases. Our Future Forward initiative is progressing ahead of schedule, accelerating the transformation of FIS into a more agile and efficient company better positioned to drive innovation. And lastly, we're focused on returning Heritage FIS back to the compounder model of the past with a focus on steady revenue growth, margin expansion, improved free cash flow generation and a sustainable double-digit total shareholder return.\nWith that, let me turn it over to Erik, who will take you through the financials. Erik?\n\nErik D. Hoag\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us this morning. I'll begin on Slide 14 with some additional detail on our financial results before moving into our increased guidance, future forward achievement and capital allocation priorities for Heritage FIS.\nOur first quarter results exceeded our expectations across all financial metrics. Revenue increased 3% organically to $3.5 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 38.7% and adjusted EPS of $1.29. Revenue growth came in 2 points above the high end of our outlook.\nAs Stephanie mentioned, this outperformance was driven by a combination of both stronger operating performance, as well as better-than-anticipated macroeconomic impacts, including consumer spending and higher levels of deposit account and transaction growth across the financial services sector. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS exceeded expectations through both operational strength and the benefit in net interest expense.\nMoving to cash flow on our balance sheet. Capital expenditures decreased 32% year-over-year to $279 million or 8% of revenue, reflecting the benefits of our Future Forward initiatives. We generated free cash flow of $641 million or 84% conversion, and returned over $300 million to our shareholders through dividends. Lastly, we exited the quarter with $20 billion in total debt, yielding a leverage ratio of 3.2x at a weighted average interest rate of 3%.\nTurning to our Heritage FIS results on Slide 15. We're pleased to report organic revenue growth of 4%, driven by 6% recurring revenue growth. Our backlog continues to be strong and durable, exiting the quarter at $22.5 billion. As previously mentioned, our sales teams are transitioning to target higher quality, more profitable new sales which will drive sustainable high-margin growth. Because of this, we would anticipate some softness in backlog over the short term as the team aligns to these initiatives.\nThis change in sales initiatives is fully incorporated into the increased outlook for the year. Ultimately, the result of this will be higher quality new sales, laying the foundation for sustainable growth in revenue, EBITDA and cash flow, while providing best-in-class capabilities for our clients, as well as emphasizing our high-margin, sticky recurring revenue offerings. Overall, this is a very strong start to the year for Heritage FIS segments as we saw stronger-than-anticipated operating performance, driving results above our expectations.\nAt the segment level, Banking increased 2% organically in the quarter, which was 2 points above the high end of our outlook. This outlook was underpinned by recurring revenue growth of 4%, which exceeds our -- which exceeded our expectations. Strength in recurring revenue was driven by strong execution from our business in conjunction with elevated account and transaction growth during the quarter. As expected, adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 250 basis points to 40.1%, primarily driven by a 23% reduction in termination fees and onetime license revenue.\nThis performance in margin improved compared to our fourth quarter results, and we continue to anticipate sequential margin improvement through 2023, leading to expansion in the back half of the year. For the second quarter, we are anticipating banking organic revenue growth of 0% to 2%, which incorporates a continued reduction in nonrecurring revenue, and we remain confident in meeting or exceeding our organic growth outlook for the year.\nTurning to our capital markets results and outlook on Slide 17. Capital markets increased 7% organically in the quarter, exceeding the high end of our outlook by 2 points. The overperformance in the quarter was underpinned by 11% recurring revenue growth, with a 4-point tailwind associated with elevated activity in the financial services industry. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 48.2%. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by high contribution margins on our revenue growth as well as the underlying strength of the one-to-many operating model.\nWe continue to see resilient strength in the operating performance of Capital Markets, and believe our multiyear transition to SaaS-based engagements has laid the foundation for resilient growth. For the second quarter, we anticipate organic revenue growth of 4% to 6%, primarily associated with an assumption of recurring revenue normalizing off the elevated growth seen in the first quarter. For the year, we're reiterating our outlook of 4% to 6%, inclusive of a tough license compare in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 18. Our Merchant segment increased 2% organically, exceeding the high end of our outlook by 2 points as we saw better-than-expected consumer spending and accelerated growth in e-commerce. Broadly speaking, we're seeing continued strength in our e-commerce subsegment, accelerating to 15% in the quarter with strong sales and exceptional growth in our Worldplay for Platforms offering. Worldplay for Platforms continues to benefit from our ongoing investments and renewed leadership structure, and we continue to see a significant opportunity in this attractive vertical.\nOur SMB and enterprise subsegments saw trends similar to our fourth quarter 2022 results. Consistent with our guide, margins contracted 350 basis points to 43.5%, primarily due to unfavorable revenue mix. Global volume increased 9% on a constant currency basis to $551 billion. This acceleration was a result of stronger consumer spend across our enterprise and e-commerce subsegments.\nIn the quarter, volume growth outpaced revenue growth as a result of higher spend in nondiscretionary verticals, for example, grocery and drugstore, and market share gains within the PayFac vertical.\nTurning to Slide 19 for a further review of Heritage Worldpay's outlook for the year. As we entered the year, we had anticipated organic revenue decline of 2% to 4%. The guide reflected a 300 basis point headwind associated with attrition in the SMB subsegment, and further macro deterioration impacting growth by an additional 500 basis points. Our first quarter results outperformed our expectations by 2 points compared to the high end of our outlook.\nWhile the business continues to be impacted by the headwinds in the SMB subsegment, consumer spending performed better than expected in the U.S. and the U.K. As a result, we're updating our second quarter and full year guidance to reflect relatively consistent trends from the first quarter to the second quarter, and improved consumer spend in the back half of the year. Because of this, we now anticipate second quarter organic revenue growth of negative 1% to plus 1%, and full year organic revenue growth of down to 1%, a material improvement compared to initial expectations. This outlook for the second quarter assumes relatively similar trends across our subsegments compared to the first quarter. On the margin front, we will continue to see improvements through the year consistent with normal seasonality and further aided by our Future Forward initiatives.\nTurning to Slide 20 for a review of our increased 2023 guidance. Given our strong start to the year, we're confidently increasing our full year 2023 outlook to incorporate the overperformance seen in the first quarter. Specifically, we're increasing our revenue and EBITDA ranges by $85 million and $35 million, respectively, accounting for a $0.06 increase in our adjusted earnings per share outlook for the year. This increase is aligned directly to our first quarter results compared to the high end of our prior guide.\nOur increased outlook over the remainder of the year has strengthened relative to the outlook we provided in February, based on the current trends in our businesses. With that in mind, for the year, we now anticipate consolidated organic revenue growth of 0% to 1%, adjusted EBITDA margins of 41.5% to 42.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.76 to $6.06.\nAs I stated in our last earnings call, our philosophy continues to remain conservative in our forward projections as we continue to build credibility and deliver on our commitments. This increased outlook continues to account for risk associated with macroeconomic impact in our Merchant segment, and we would anticipate further upside if macro trends remain stable.\nAs previously mentioned, we continue to anticipate margin improvement over the course of 2023 as we ramp the benefits associated with Future Forward, and we're reiterating our outlook for free cash flow conversion of over 80%. Lastly, we provided additional assumptions on our -- for our guidance in the appendix as well as a revised 2022 organic base to account for some small shifts in our operating segment rollouts.\nTurning to Slide 21 for a financial update on Future Forward. We remain committed to rightsizing our expense base while ensuring minimal impact to our clients or colleagues. Aligned to this commitment, Future Forward centers around investing in sales and support, automating and improving processes and improving the ways we work.\nAs Stephanie mentioned, we're reiterating our targets for operational expense savings of $300 million exiting 2023 and $600 million exiting 2024. We had a strong start to the year with annual run rate savings of over $100 million exiting the quarter, with an in-quarter benefit of over $15 million. We continue to target a $200 million reduction in capital expenditures during 2023, with an incremental $100 million reduction in 2024.\nIn the quarter, we achieved annualized CapEx savings of over $110 million as we executed rapidly on the Future Forward initiative. We're extremely pleased with our early progress, and we'll continue to provide quarterly updates on achievement throughout the program.\nI'll conclude with a recap of our capital allocation priorities for Heritage FIS on Slide 22. Following the successful execution of the spin, Heritage FIS will remain focused on reducing debt, increasing our dividend and utilizing excess capital for share repurchase or tuck-in M&A. First, we continue to target a long-term leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x. To achieve this, we would anticipate reducing total debt, while also benefiting from adjusted EBITDA growth over a multiyear period.\nNext, we remain committed to a 35% dividend payout ratio for Heritage FIS. Following these 2 pillars, we will utilize excess cash or debt capacity for share repurchase or optionality around tuck-in M&A opportunities. Our default use of excess capital will prioritize share repurchase at current valuations while we assess M&A opportunities in their risk-adjusted returns. This capital allocation strategy is conservative in nature, while providing a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value over a multiyear period.\nI'd like to thank everyone for their time this morning. Operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of IR, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the FIS Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nWith me on the call this morning are Stephanie Ferris, our CEO and President; and Erik Hoag, our CFO. Stephanie will lead the call with a strategic and operational update, followed by Erik reviewing our financial results and providing forward guidance.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nCEO, President & Director, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, George, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Today marks my first earnings call as the CEO of FIS. Let me begin by saying I feel incredibly privileged by the opportunity to reflect on our past, restart our future and recommit to our clients, colleagues and investors.\nFIS is a tremendous company with world-class assets and a marquee set of clients. We are an industry leader with more than five decades of history, positioning where change, challenge and opportunity intersect. Today, I will present to you the next chapter.\nWe have a lot of ground to cover, including our fourth quarter financial results, 2023 guidance and specific outcomes of our strategic review which includes the planned spin-off of our Merchant business Worldpay.\nLet me start by sharing that I'm pleased to report that we met our financial goals for the fourth quarter. While this is a good first step, we recognize that we have a lot of work to do to meet our expectations going forward. Today, we will share a number of decisive actions we're taking to better align our business with the needs of our clients and the expectations of our shareholders. Let me take you through our path forward.\nTurning to Slide 5. We've set a new agenda to improve the operational performance of the business, sharpen our client focus, and improve both the free cash flow of the company as well as the earnings quality. We will do this by following three key principles that will underpin all of our go-forward actions to drive value. First, we will ensure that clients are at the center of everything we do by creating a client-centric culture. Second, we will continue to innovate across our portfolio of solutions to ensure growth for our clients. And third, we will simplify and streamline our operations, decision-making and time to market to improve profitability. Combined, these principles form the foundation of our efforts to drive efficiency, effectiveness and profitable growth.\nTurning to Slide 6. Over the past 60 days, we've moved with the highest sense of urgency and focus to advance a number of strategically important initiatives. First, in December, we announced that we initiated with the Board of Directors a comprehensive assessment of the company's strategy, operations and structure with the goal of positioning FIS to drive stronger results, increase shareholder value and enhance client experience. As an outcome of this ongoing assessment, we announced today, we are pursuing a spin-off of our Merchant business, creating two world-class public companies, FIS and Worldpay. It is my pleasure to also announce that Charles Drucker, Worldpay's former CEO, has agreed to return as a strategic adviser to me. Charles, who is my close friend and colleague, will lead the preparedness phase of the planned spin-off and is expected to become Worldpay's CEO upon the closing of the transaction.\nSecond, we announced in November that we are launching an enterprise transformation program. This program, which we have branded Future Forward, is moving ahead with speed to improve the operational performance of the company by driving efficiency, effectiveness and profitable growth across every facet of the enterprise.\nWhen we launched Future Forward, we are targeting to deliver cash savings across the company of $500 million by year-end 2024. I'm happy to share that we now expect to exceed our $500 million original target by the end of this year, and I'm increasing our target to $1.25 billion in net savings prior to the effect of the spin-off exiting 2024. As I mentioned earlier, we are and will continue to be intensely focused on cost management, cash generation and earnings quality.\nThird, we are realigning our incentive programs to be tied to shareholder value creation, company performance and client satisfaction scores. In order for us to deliver on our commitments, this realignment is critical.\nAnd fourth, consistent with our December announcement, we've continued to reshape our Board of Directors for independent governance. I'm proud of what we've been able to do in the first 60 days. This is just the beginning for us.\nSlide 7 describes our rationale for separating the two businesses. The pace of disruption in payments is rapidly accelerating, requiring increased investment for growth and a different capital allocation strategy for our Merchant business. The separation of Worldpay from FIS will result in the creation of two stand-alone market leaders, each well-positioned to capitalize on the significant value-creation opportunities ahead in their respective markets. It is expected that FIS and Worldpay will maintain a close commercial partnership to deliver critical capabilities like embedded finance and loyalty through premium payback preserving a key value proposition for clients of both businesses and limiting potential dis-synergy.\nIt should also simplify our operations and give each management team additional flexibility to operate the business in a way that best delivers value for all clients and shareholders alike. Specifically, it will enable FIS to pursue a strong investment-grade credit rating while enabling Worldpay to invest more aggressively in growth. A separation also enables FIS and Worldpay to implement different capital allocation strategies which align to their growth targets and underlying market needs.\nTurning to Slide 8. Both companies serve a blue-chip set of clients. FIS serves the technology needs of global financial institutions, regional community banks and marquee set of asset managers across the spectrum. Worldpay serves the payment needs of the world's global technology, Internet and retail companies. Both companies boast unrivaled global distribution and operating scale. As separate entities, FIS remains the #1 global FinTech provider and Worldpay remains the #1 global acquirer by transaction. Both companies will be market leaders in their own right and by forging a commercial relationship together, we can affect a superior outcome as compared to keeping them together.\nLet me provide some additional context for what this transaction means for the stand-alone FIS business on Slide 9. FIS is returning to its roots. This focus will allow the company to maintain its competitive advantage in delivering innovative next-generation technology solutions to the most complex financial institutions. Additionally, FIS will be in a better position to balance return of capital to shareholders with organic investment and complementary M&A. We remain committed to our investment-grade ratings, conservative capital structure and growing dividends. Putting it all together, we are returning FIS to its historical quality compounder model which is more closely aligned with the way that FIS operated before the Worldpay acquisition. As a quality compounder, FIS will emphasize steady recurring revenue growth, consistent margin expansion and disciplined capital return to shareholders.\nImportantly, we will prioritize maximizing free cash flow and profitable revenue growth. Consequently, I would expect our free cash flow conversion to move permanently higher post the spend, reflecting less working capital volatility and lower capital expenditures. Lastly, we are committed to improving the quality of our reported earnings. This includes narrowing the delta between adjusted earnings and GAAP earnings and presenting free cash flow measures that better align with the cash we have available to deploy. Erik will provide additional color during his discussion of our financials.\nNow I'll touch on the Worldpay strategy to drive enhanced shareholder value. Worldpay operates in a more dynamic and disruptive end market relative to Heritage FIS with more of a growth focus. The separation from FIS will allow Worldpay to pursue a more growth-oriented strategy, which we believe the company is better suited for and aligns more closely with investor expectations. Central to the growth strategy is a return to more consistent M&A and a capital structure that does not require an investment grade rating. Beyond an organic investment, the team is taking aggressive steps to repivot the business back towards growth. This includes the investment in the Worldpay platform strategy to strengthen the company's value proposition with ISVs and a continued push towards increasing its total percent of e-commerce revenue. While near-term investments are impacting profitability, we are confident the business can return to growth and deliver value for shareholders as an independent entity.\nTurning to Slide 11. I'd like to provide some additional insight into the durability of our banking and capital markets businesses. And why I am so confident that they are poised to deliver accelerating revenue growth and margin expansion. We are reorienting FIS toward a path of more sustainable, higher-quality recurring revenue growth. There are two challenges specific to 2023, which are masking the underlying performance of our business, particularly in the Banking segment.\nThe first is our previously discussed elongation in sales cycles for very large transactions. To be clear, our pipeline of opportunities remains robust and our win rate on transactions is stable. We are confident as economic conditions stabilize, sales will accelerate. We also hired a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on driving highly profitable recurring revenue growth regardless of deal size. We believe this hire will help us cross-sell and upsell with existing clients as well as better penetrate smaller sized financial institutions.\nThe second challenge is a growth headwind tied to nonrecurring revenue, largely onetime licenses and deconversion fees from bank consolidation. We anticipate this to be another 1% headwind in 2023. We do not expect onetime license and deconversion fee revenue to remain a similar headwind in 2024. While the above trends are creating a short-term headwind for us, we believe our normalized growth rate for these segments is approximately 3% to 5%, which demonstrates the underlying strength of our banking and capital markets businesses. With a refocus on high-quality recurring revenue growth and the benefit from our Future Forward initiative, we are expecting margin expansion in banking and capital markets for 2023.\nAs a result of the timing around our actions, we are confident that these businesses have hit the low point of their margin contraction and will return to margin expansion in the back half of the year. On the back of all the Future Forward actions we have taken are now planning to take.\nTying it all together, FIS is on a trajectory to create shareholder value as a quality compounder that generates consistent mid-single-digit recurring revenue growth. margin expansion and robust free cash flow.\nTurning to Slide 12. We will provide you with regular updates on Future Forward. I've already described our progress toward achieving $500 million in net cash savings by the end of this year and prior to the effect of the spin-off, $1.25 billion by the end of 2024. I'd like to take a moment to describe how we will achieve these targets.\nFuture Forward is a multifaceted initiative designed to permanently improve the performance of the company by delivering improved outcomes for clients while driving operational efficiencies internally, free cash flow generation and earnings quality. We are focused on more effectively meeting the needs of our clients by continuing to accelerate the development of next-generation technology solutions and anticipating their future needs. Driving toward a more efficient operating structure by prioritizing human and capital resources that best align with the needs of our clients and the returns expected by our shareholders. And lastly, driving improved growth outcomes through sales productivity, reduced complexity and a continued focus on clients. These important initiatives will continue at FIS and Worldpay post spin.\nI will cover our next steps on Slide 13 before turning the call over to Erik for his financial review. 2023 will be a year of recommitment for FIS as we work to reposition the business to return to sustainable growth, profitability and value creation in 2024 and beyond. First, we are focused on executing the spin off of Worldpay, which we expect to complete within the next 12 months. Second, we are sharpening our operational focus to continue to promote a client-centric culture and to deliver on our commitments to all of our stakeholders. Third, Future Forward initiatives will continue within both FIS and Worldpay to maximize our cash flow and earnings quality. And finally, we are laser-focused on creating shareholder value with action and improved performance.\nI'm pleased with the progress we've made in such a short period of time. I'm confident that we're on the right path forward.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Erik to discuss our fourth quarter results and 2023 outlook. Erik?\n\nErik Hoag\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephanie. I'd like to start today by outlining some of our priorities as a new management team before touching on our financial results. As I stated last call, a priority of ours is to be transparent about our future expectations and we delivered results in line with that revised outlook. Today, I'd like to lay out a few more priorities for 2023 and beyond.\nFirst, we'll manage FIS as a high-quality compounder with predictable and consistent earnings growth. Our operational structure and long-term capital allocation strategy will prioritize delivering double-digit total shareholder return. This is the core tenet of a compounder investment thesis, which FIS is operationally and financially positioned to achieve.\nNext, as Stephanie mentioned, we're focused on enhancing the cash flow characteristics of FIS. In 2023, despite an anticipated reduction in EBITDA and earnings, we're taking actionable steps to increase our cash flow on a year-over-year basis. This increase in cash will be primarily driven by decreasing our capital expenditures by approximately $200 million. We're also taking conscious actions to reduce onetime spend associated with transformation and integration programs. I am confident we're taking the correct actions to deliver strong shareholder returns over the longer term. With that as the backdrop, let's quickly touch on our fourth quarter results.\nOn a consolidated basis, revenue increased 4% organically to $3.7 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.2%, yielding an adjusted EPS of $1.71. At the segment level, banking grew 4% organically in the quarter. Banking margins were pressured due to unfavorable revenue mix and inflationary cost pressures.\nWe had an exceptionally strong quarter in capital markets with 10% organic revenue growth and 220 basis points of margin expansion. Fourth quarter revenue growth included a 4-point benefit associated with the timing of license renewals which drove a 22% increase in nonrecurring revenue. As I look to proactively message any one-off tailwinds or headwinds, this license benefit in the quarter should be flagged as a potential headwind in the fourth quarter of 2023. Excluding this tailwind, capital markets increased 6% organically, well ahead of historical trends.\nAdditionally, recurring revenue grew 11%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of recurring revenue growth greater than 8%. Our strategy to transition to durable SaaS deployments continues to resonate in the market.\nMerchant grew 2% on a constant currency basis in the fourth quarter, including a point of headwind associated with Russia and Ukraine. E-commerce revenue growth remained strong, increasing 16% on a constant currency basis. Our card present channel and SMB experienced softness as lower sales did not outpace attrition and compression trends. These trends in SMB reflect a lack of new product investment, which we believe the spin will best enable us to remedy. And in enterprise, we saw economic weakness in the U.K. and anticipate further deterioration this year.\nTouching quickly on cash flow and balance sheet. We generated roughly $3 billion of free cash flow in 2022, which was lower than originally expected, primarily due to negative working capital more specifically the timing of receivables within the Merchant segment. Total debt as of 12/31 was approximately $20 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 2.6% and leverage was approximately 3.2x.\nTurning to Slide 16 for our 2023 guidance. Our philosophy remains conservative in our forward projections as we look to build credibility and deliver on our commitments. With that in mind, for the year, we anticipate consolidated organic revenue growth of negative 1% to positive 1% or $14.2 billion to $14.45 billion of revenue, adjusted EBITDA of $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion or margins of 41.5% to 42.2% and adjusted earnings per share of $5.70 to $6. This outlook assumes further macro deterioration, including a global recession impacting our Merchant segment. To be clear, our guidance assumes macroeconomic trends continue to deteriorate throughout the year.\nWe expect total company margins to improve over the course of 2023 as we ramp the benefits associated with Future Forward. At the segment level, we expect banking organic revenue growth of 0% to 2%, which includes lapping difficult compares associated with nonrecurring revenue cycles, nonrecurring revenues as well as the near-term impact of elongated sales cycles. Banking margins will improve throughout the year, with a return to margin expansion in the second half. In Capital Markets, we expect 4% to 6% organic revenue growth coupled with continued margin expansion. This segment continues to benefit overanalysis of sustainable SaaS deployment over license revenue.\nIn Merchant, we're anticipating organic revenue decline of $0.02 to $0.04. This guide reflects a 300 basis point headwind associated with attrition and compression in the SMB subsegment, and further macro deterioration impacting growth by an additional 500 basis points. We expect Worldpay to reaccelerate post spin as it leverages its scale with both organic and inorganic investments to once again differentiate itself in the market. Lastly, we're focused on our cash flow fundamentals and anticipate expanding our free cash flow conversion to over 80% in 2023.\nTurning to Slide 17. As Stephanie mentioned, we have two temporary headwinds impacting these segments this year and empirically believe the underlying growth rate is 3% to 5%. We're undertaking various strategic priorities for these segments, which we believe will improve our fundamentals moving forward. First, we've hired a new Chief Revenue Officer to focus on higher quality and sustainable sales growth. Specifically, while we still pursue large transactions where FIS is clearly differentiated, we want to ensure that our cross-selling to existing clients remains a priority. The breadth of solutions we have between banking and capital markets will continue to take market share as we expand our lasting relationships with our valued clients.\nWe also see the benefits of Future Forward ramping through 2023 and 2024 to support an already expanding margin profile. Lastly, as Stephanie mentioned, we believe the spin of our Merchant segment will help simplify our operating model and focus our investments on the most pressing needs of our clients.\nWith that, I'll turn to an overview of the Merchant growth profile on Slide #18. Accounting for two known headwinds, we believe Merchant normalized growth is 4% to 6%. The first of these headwinds has been a lack of new product investment, driving compression and attrition in our SMB subsegment, accounting for approximately 3 points of headwind in our Merchant guide. We're confident this is near term in nature and will be directly addressed with the successful spin of Worldpay as it transitions to a growth-oriented capital structure and investment philosophy.\nSecond is the macroeconomic impact we anticipate this year. Our guidance assumes further macro deterioration in the U.K. and a recession in the U.S. This recessionary assumption accounts for approximately 5 points of headwind in our Merchant guide.\nSimilar to our strategic priorities in banking and capital markets, we're taking actions to accelerate off this 4% to 6% normalized growth rate. The Merchant segment will benefit from new product investments to enhance its competitive profile and growth profile. Additionally, Future Forward will help support increasing profitability later in 2023 and beyond.\nI'll finish by noting that as revenue accelerates in the segment, it carries a very high contribution margin, which will drive underlying margin expansion beyond the Future Forward benefit. All in, we view the segment as accelerating off the 4% to 6% normalized revenue growth in 2023 with margin expansion incorporated in the model.\nMoving to a breakdown of EBITDA expectations on Slide #20. Both our Banking and Capital Markets businesses are expected to increase adjusted EBITDA and expand margins in 2023. In Banking, we would anticipate margin expansion of over 50 basis points and Capital Markets to expand margins by 50 to 100 basis. This significant margin expansion in Banking and Capital Markets reflects both underlying strength in the contribution margins as well as Future Forward. These segments are positioned for durable and profitable growth over the longer term, leveraging a one-to-many operating model with high concentrations of recurring revenue.\nConversely, we anticipate a weaker performance in our Merchant segment, coupled with higher corporate costs. In Merchant, we anticipate a reduction in EBITDA associated with lower revenue and increased expense associated with residual payments.\nIn our Corporate segment, we're seeing the impact from divested businesses in 2022 and a temporary headwind associated with a tough comparable on incentive compensation.\nLooking beyond 2023, we're confident that we're moving the company to the appropriate path of margin expansion. There are two key tenants underpinning this confidence. First, we expect to benefit from our Future Forward initiatives to continue to ramp with incremental benefit in 2024. Second, we will continue to benefit from our newly implemented sales and commission structure, which emphasizes higher margin revenue growth. Both of these initiatives will support consistent and ongoing margin expansion at FIS moving forward.\nTurning to Slide 21 for an overview of how Future Forward will continue to rightsize our expense base and further support profitability and cash. We expect to generate approximately $150 million of in-year operating expense reduction. These savings will ramp to approximately $600 million on a run rate basis exiting 2024. In addition to these OpEx savings, Future Forward will support our priority to improve our cash flow through a reduction in capital expenditures and onetime program spend. We're targeting a $200 million reduction in CapEx during 2023, and we intend to reduce CapEx by another $100 million in 2024. We're also aggressively ramping down spend associated with transformation and integration projects, such as platform consolidation resulting in a benefit to cash.\nTaking all of this into account, we're pleased to increase our expected net cash savings associated with Future Forward to approximately $1.25 billion exiting 2024. We'll continue to provide quarterly updates on achievement of those targets throughout the life of the program. These initiatives are the bedrock for improving the operational performance of FIS and align directly with our priorities outlined today.\nI'll conclude with our current capital allocation priorities on Slide 22. In 2023, we're focused on paying down debt, increasing our dividend and decreasing CapEx. First, we utilize excess free cash flow to reduce debt in support of our investment-grade credit ratings, which is a key pillar to FIS' long-term capital and operating strategy.\nNext, we recently announced an increase to our core quarterly dividend of more than 10%, and we anticipate to exit the year approximating our 35% target payout ratio. Moving forward, we intend to continue increasing our dividend roughly in line with earnings growth.\nAs mentioned throughout my prepared remarks, Stephanie and I are also prioritizing a reduction in capital expenditures this year. We're putting a heightened focus on ROIC to ensure an appropriate return on investment and are making targeted investments aligned to the client needs.\nFinally, in conjunction with the spin, we'll conduct a comprehensive review of our capital structure to reduce future volatility in our net interest expense. We're moving with a high sense of urgency to drive these outcomes. While we face challenges, we remain confident that this is the right path forward to improve the company's performance, free cash flow and earnings.\nI'd like to thank everyone for their time this morning. Please note additional guidance, assumptions and next steps on the spin in our appendix. Operator, would you please open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. George Mihalos, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nGeorgios Mihalos\n\nSVP & Head of IR, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nGreat. Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for the FIS Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nGary Norcross, our Chairman and CEO, will provide a business overview. Stephanie Ferris, our President, will provide an operational update. Finally, Erik Hoag, our Deputy CFO, will then review our financial results.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language. Also, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information is presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.\n\nGary Adam Norcross\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, George, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me begin by saying this will be Woody Woodall's last official day as Chief Financial Officer. His contributions over the past 14 years have been tremendous and he has established a firm foundation for Erik Hoag as our new CFO to build upon in the future.\nI'm also very excited. Stephanie Ferris will become President and CEO on January 1, 2023. Stephanie's 28 years of industry experience, varied executive roles and her understanding in the FIS business and industry positions her well for this promotion. I am confident in her ability to lead this company going forward and excited to continue working with her as I assume the role of Executive Chairman of the Board. Congratulations, Stephanie on this well-earned promotion.\nI'll begin on Slide 5 for a quick overview of results. In the quarter, we delivered revenue and adjusted EPS in line with our expectations, a testament to the fundamental resiliency of our business. Organic revenue growth for the quarter was 5%. Banking Solutions grew 6%, merchant Solutions grew 5% and capital markets grew 6%, all on an organic basis. Our profit margins in the Banking and Merchant Solutions businesses saw a continued pressure in the quarter. This resulted in an overall adjusted EBITDA margin contracting by 150 basis points year-on-year, primarily a function of inflationary cost pressures such as wage inflation and downstream supplier increases as well as incremental macro headwinds such as consumer weakness in the U.K.\nWe are not pleased with the profitability performance of the business and are taking actions to address them. We did want to provide you some insight on the underlying performance of the businesses because given the backdrop we operate in and the continued economic slowdown we are seeing in certain geographies around the world. On the slide, you will see we provided some key growth trends with minor adjustments to help investors see the underlying performance of these businesses. As you can see, the underlying growth trends of the businesses are good in this backdrop.\nIf you adjust for pandemic services, our banking revenue grew 8% during the quarter. Merchant Solutions grew 6% adjusting for Russia, Ukraine, with our eCom business growing 22%. Capital Markets had an impressive 9% growth adjusting for the volatility of license fees, which we have discussed on numerous calls.\nWe also executed on our commitment of returning capital to shareholders through $1 billion of share repurchase in addition to the almost $300 million of dividends paid, while maintaining leverage at 2.9x in support of our investment-grade credit ratings.\nTurning to Slide 6. We are seeing indications of a broader economic slowdown. In Banking, as we discussed last quarter, we continue to see deals greater than $50 million, taking more time to close than we saw over the last several years. Smaller transactions in banking continued to show good momentum, which allowed us to close more new contract value this quarter as compared to the same quarter last year.\nIn Merchant across the United Kingdom, we saw even greater pullback than we expected last quarter. We continue to see stability in U.S. payment volumes through the first 9 months of the year, but are beginning to see a shift in nondiscretionary spending towards the big-box merchants. Should there be economic pressure in the U.S., FIS is well positioned to capture volume shifts given our size and scale and market-leading distinction in the grocery and pharmaceutical verticals as well as our strength in enterprise card presence and e-commerce capabilities.\nCapital markets continues to exceed our expectations as our pivot to a SaaS-based go-to-market strategy has strengthened the resiliency of that segment. This strategy has also supported the profitability of this revenue as we benefit from a one-to-many operating model, allowing these clients to leverage our scale and expertise to simplify their complex needs. Given the demand for SaaS-based solutions in this segment and the continued macroeconomic issues we are seeing, our license fees each quarter will continue to come under pressure. We will continue to monitor this trend closely.\nI'll conclude with the actions we are taking to ensure long-term growth and stability. FIS investment-grade credit ratings differentiate us from others in the industry and provides us with a strong foundation during uncertain times. We will continue to fortify our balance sheet with a focus on the long term. Because of this, we currently do not anticipate taking out incremental debt in 2023 to fund share repurchase above our excess free cash flow. We will remain focused on allocating capital efficiently and should market conditions deteriorate, we will deploy our robust free cash flow to pay down upcoming maturities.\nFortunately, the strength of our enterprise will allow us to continue to fund share repurchase with excess cash, returning incremental capital to our shareholders above and beyond our dividend. We are also announcing an Enterprise Transformation program to significantly enhance cash flows through the business with a focus on both operational excellence and prioritizing capital expenditures. As we have completed significant investment programs over the last several years, including our data center consolidation and several banking, capital markets and merchant modernization programs, we are now able to reduce our capital requirements in the future. We are reaffirming our commitment to 20% plus annual dividend growth and a 35% payout target, a true differentiator of FIS compared to others in the industry and a testament to our cash flow generation.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Stephanie for the operational update.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident & Director, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThank you, Gary, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. Let me start by saying what an honor and a privilege it is to be assuming the role of CEO of FIS on January 1. Gary, thank you for your leadership and mentorship, and I look forward to working closely with you in your new role as Executive Chairman.\nI also look forward to working with our 65,000 colleagues and our thousands of clients and partners around the world. And finally, thank you to Woody, our outgoing CFO, for his many years of service and congratulations and welcome to Erik Hoag, our new CFO.\nLet me echo Gary's comments that the third quarter was challenging. We are not satisfied with our results. Given the changing macro environment, the persistence of inflationary cost pressures and the resulting impacts to margin and free cash flow, we are taking immediate action to permanently reduce the cost structure of the company via our Enterprise Transformation program.\nTurning to Slide 9. This program will focus on transformation of our business with a goal of maximizing revenue growth while simplifying our operating model. This will enable us to deliver significant reductions in both operating costs and capital expenditures through very targeted actions while always ensuring that our client remains at the center of everything we do.\nOur goal is to deliver long-term margin expansion while reallocating capital spend to the highest value-creating activities for our clients, thus driving improved cash flow conversion. This Enterprise Transformation program has 2 key pillars designed to restructure and reinvigorate our operating model. First, we're focused on permanently reshaping our cost structure through both cost reduction and containment initiatives. These include actions surrounding the optimization and reduction of vendor spend, the outsourcing of non-value-added activities and reviewing and rightsizing the current workforce.\nSecond, we are focused on increasing the revenue of the company by unlocking value through our targeted enterprise cross-sell program called Amplify, which will take advantage of the significant white space opportunity to sell our existing products across our current segments. We will also be focused on reviewing, aligning and simplifying both our pricing and incentive structures, as well as various other commercial excellence initiatives.\nWe have begun to take immediate actions towards this transformation program. Detailed planning is underway and our early expectations are to deliver at least $500 million of cash savings with additional upside to be determined as we go through the planning process. Given the economic backdrop, we are pressing to deliver as many of these savings in 2023 as possible. I plan to update you with a more complete sizing and framework for the program on our fourth quarter earnings call.\nMoving on to the third quarter. Our segment results were mixed. Revenue came in largely as expected with the exception of further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, primarily in the U.K. Adjusted EBITDA margins were challenged.\nI'll begin on Slide 10 with a brief overview of our Banking and Capital Markets segments, including highlighting several exciting new wins. Demand for FIS' mission-critical solutions across both segments continues to be strong with solid positive sales growth and even in this more uncertain macro environment, our sales pipeline remains robust.\nIn our Banking Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% or 8% adjusting for the pandemic grow over. Strength was driven by continued demand for our next-generation platform solutions across core, issuer, digital and wealth management. PaymentsOne, our next-generation card management platform had a strong sales showing. Key wins include a leading global card network provider that selected PaymentsOne for its cross-border prepaid consumer and corporate solutions business that serves nearly 20 countries. Migrating from its in-house solution to our API-based platform will enable the company to realize end-to-end efficiency benefits at scale.\nAdditionally, a leading Philippine financial institution selected PaymentsOne for processing of its credit card and unsecured loans portfolio, helping them to drive innovation and market expansion. And finally, one of the world's largest retailers went live with FIS Premium Payback across its U.S. locations. We see this as a tremendous proof point of cross-selling across our segments.\nA challenging economic factors like inflation play into consumer shopping decisions. Premium Payback offers significant discounts to shoppers, benefiting both merchants and card issuing banks who are looking to offer more innovative and frictionless way for cardholders to monetize their rewards currency.\nTurning to capital markets. We had another strong quarter, even with a slowing sales backdrop. Revenue increased 6% organically or 9% excluding license revenue. Capital Markets has been on a multiyear strategy to shift to SaaS-based solutions from license solutions. We are very pleased to see the success of this strategy. We had several impressive client wins within the Capital Markets segment this quarter, including multiple wins for our cross-asset trading platform with several leading FIS across Europe and Asia.\nNot only will our solutions provide these financial institutions with a single cross-asset platform to support their front, middle and back-office operations, the platform caters to changing regulatory environments, making local regulatory approval easier for the banks.\nWe also deepened our relationship with a leading data analytics company as they expand their use of our receivables and payables solution for the purpose of empowering their corporate customers to drive automation, cost savings and more effective cash flow management.\nTurning to Slide 11. I'll touch on the performance of the Merchant Solutions segment. Given past interest in our Merchant strategy and its evolution in recent years, I'd like to take a few minutes to update you on the competitive position of the Worldpay business as well as the strategic pivot that is currently underway. We will provide a much more comprehensive deep-dive into our differentiated merchant solution strategy and its complementary nature to our other segments in early 2023.\nMerchant Solutions revenue increased 5% on an organic basis with growth negatively impacted by further deterioration in the U.K., while U.S. consumer spend remained consistent throughout the quarter. While our merchant business is not immune from an economic slowdown, we believe the business is well positioned to grow through a recession. Approximately 55% of segment revenue is sourced from the e-commerce and enterprise subsegments, excluding the U.K. We would expect these subsegments of the business to be more resilient in an economic downturn relative to SMB.\nFurthermore, our North American Enterprise subsegment increased 7% in the quarter. This channel indexes towards nondiscretionary spend categories, including big box retail, grocery and pharmacy. While some of this growth is a result of strong year-over-year comparisons coming out of the pandemic, we continue to see and expect strong growth in this key segment of Merchant Solutions.\nWe have several notable wins this quarter, especially in our e-commerce business, highlighting the strength that our global scale and reach offers to our clients. First, while still early days, we're very pleased with the momentum we are seeing for our recently launched Global Solution guaranteed payments, which we introduced to you last quarter. A large global consumer electronics giant chose this end-to-end e-commerce solution to help them maximize order conversion rates and reduce order fulfillment times, all while eliminating the financial liability of fraud on approved orders.\nWe have also expanded our relationship with a large U.S. discount retailer by expanding processing volumes and adding new services like the FIS Premium Payback solution, encryption and tokenization services.\nI'm excited to announce that we officially branded and launched our Worldpay platforms offering, leveraging the capabilities provided by the Payrix acquisition. While still early days, I'm pleased with the momentum we are seeing. Worldpay platform is our innovative approach to addressing the SMB market by empowering SaaS platforms with the unparalleled tools and capabilities across FIS' merchant and banking offerings. We believe we're at the forefront of the new era of payments that will drive the next evolution of services to SMBs via software and platforms with payments and financial services leading the way.\nThis quarter, we closed several notable wins in verticals such as media and veterinary. In response to questions regarding the performance of the business post-pandemic and in an effort to improve transparency, we are providing some additional detail on this call. First, despite a fair amount of noise around disruption and market share shifts, Merchant Solutions revenue and volume growth in aggregate, when indexed to 2019 levels, has remained stable, showing steady revenue growth and high single-digit volume growth.\nFurther, revenue and volume growth rates and yields have remained consistent by subsegment, albeit they're varied depending on the merchant size and vertical in each category. To be clear, while our SMB subsegment which indexes to card-present acquiring, has been adversely impacted by changing market dynamics. The strength in our e-commerce business where we continue to grow above market and in our enterprise business has allowed us to deliver consistent top line results.\nGoing forward with continued market share growth in e-commerce as well as our strategic shift to embedded payments and embedded finance, we expect e-commerce to ultimately account for 50% plus of total segment revenue.\nI will end where I started. I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity in front of us at FIS. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Erik for further discussion of our third quarter results and our revised outlook for 2022. Erik?\n\nErik Hoag\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, I'd like to dive deeper into the third quarter results, particularly around EBITDA margins, touch on our balance sheet and cash flow metrics and then move to capital allocation and forward-looking commentary.\nI'll begin with our third quarter financial results on Slide 13. As Gary mentioned, revenue increased 5% on an organic basis and adjusted EPS was $1.74, in line with our expectations for the quarter. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 150 basis points to 43.7% as margin expansion in capital markets and a reduction in corporate expenses was more than offset by contraction in banking and merchant, reflecting a mix of inflationary costs, high-margin pandemic growovers and incremental macro headwinds in geographies such as the U.K.\nTurning to our segment results. Banking revenue increased 6% organically with adjusted EBITDA margin contraction of 320 basis points to 42.9%. Margin contraction was primarily driven as high variable costs associated with inflationary pressure, a reduction in pandemic-related revenue and ramping as-a-service deals, which are currently dilutive to segment margins. While these as-a-service deals are currently dilutive, they have aided in our strong banking growth over the past several quarters and will continue to expand margins over time.\nAs expected, termination fees were down compared to the prior year period, but a pull forward on license revenue mostly offset this impact resulting in growth in nonrecurring revenue. We have also seen some elongation in sales cycles, particularly for larger deals, where we remain a market leader versus others in the industry. This is negatively impacting both revenue growth and margin in the quarter, and we expect this headwind to persist for the remainder of the year.\nTurning to Merchant Solutions. Revenue increased 5% on an organic basis with margin contraction of 430 basis points to 47.4%. Margin contraction was primarily driven by incremental investment in emerging channels as well as macro impacts associated with the U.K. and Europe wage inflation and FX. Capital Markets organic growth was 6%, demonstrating the consistency and resiliency of the segment over the last several quarters. Margin expanded by 90 basis points to 49.3%, primarily driven by strong cost discipline and operating leverage within the segment.\nTurning to Slide 14. In the quarter, we returned approximately $1.3 billion of capital to shareholders, maintained leverage of 2.9x and had a weighted average interest rate of 2%. We generated $684 million of free cash flow, including an approximate $250 million headwind associated with the taxable gain from our cross-currency swaps in the quarter. This resulted in free cash flow conversion of 65%. Excluding this impact, free cash flow conversion would have been approximately 84%.\nReflecting our year-to-date conversion and outlook for the fourth quarter, we now anticipate free cash flow conversion of approximately 80% for the year. And excluding the tax impact in the third quarter, we would anticipate a more normalized 88% conversion for the year. We anticipate share buyback of approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter as we utilize excess free cash flow to buyback stock. We're highly focused on improving our free cash flow conversion moving forward, driven by a targeted reduction in capital expenditures aligned with the priorities outlined in the Enterprise Transformation program.\nTurning to Slide 15 for commentary around capital allocation philosophy. As Gary mentioned, we're putting a heightened focus on the balance sheet given the macroeconomic environment. Said plainly, we no longer anticipate taking out incremental debt in 2023 to fund share repurchase. This will modestly delever our enterprise in conjunction with EBITDA growth, further supporting the strength of our balance sheet as a competitive differentiator. We remain committed to our annual dividend growth of 20-plus percent and continue to believe that a 35% payout ratio is an appropriate target. Beyond our dividend and capital expenditures, share repurchase will be our default use of excess free cash flow consistent with our historical capital allocation strategy.\nTurning to Slide 16. Reflecting several incremental and persistent headwinds that Gary, Stephanie and I have discussed throughout the presentation, we're adjusting our full year 2022 guidance. There are 3 primary vectors driving the reduction in our outlook for the year. First, we've seen incremental macro factors impacting various portions of our revenue streams. Most notable of these macro factors is the recessionary trends within the U.K. and broader Europe, putting pressure on our merchant volumes within the region. Given the slowing level of bank consolidation due to deteriorating credit markets, we've reduced our assumption for termination fees in the quarter. While this is ultimately a benefit to the health of FIS over the longer term, it's driving a material reduction to our 2022 expectations.\nThe second vector would be inflation and cost pressures impacting the expense base. This is inclusive of incremental wage, infrastructure and vendor costs. Additionally, while inflation has been an incremental benefit to some revenue streams via price escalators, it has also resulted in higher pass-through revenues, which carry low to 0 margin. This has negatively impacted revenue mix and margins.\nThe last vector is associated with sales timing and execution due to continued elongation in our larger transactions, resulting in a push on certain previously forecasted revenues. We also incorporated our third quarter results into this revised outlook compared to original expectations. While the backdrop is challenging, the size of our backlog and concentration of our recurring revenue has allowed us to offset most revenue challenges, however, with a different mix of businesses and margin profiles. We're looking to address these cost pressures through our announced Enterprise Transformation program that Stephanie discussed earlier, and we believe that longer-term margin expansion remains a staple within our operating model.\nA key priority of mine and the finance teams will be managing the things inside our control very closely. While we cannot control the macro, we'll look to manage the micro across both operating and capital expenditures to drive profitability and incremental cash through the enterprise.\nTurning to Slide 17 for a summary of our revised guidance. For the year, we now anticipate consolidated revenue of $14.47 billion to $14.52 billion resulting in organic revenue growth of 6% to 7%, adjusted EBITDA of $6.17 billion to $6.21 billion or margins of 42.6% to 42.8% and adjusted EPS of $6.60 to $6.66. We are proactively derisking our fourth quarter and full year 2022 guidance to incorporate additional macro deterioration from what our business is currently experiencing.\nTo be clear, our current forecast is above our fourth quarter guide. For banking and capital markets, we are lowering our assumptions associated with high margin nonrecurring revenue given decreased visibility. With respect to Merchant, we're incorporating further consumer challenges across both the U.K. and, to a lesser extent, the U.S.\nAs the incoming CFO, given the more uncertain backdrop, I think it's prudent to err on the side of caution as it relates to setting forward expectations. As investors, you should expect this to be my guidance philosophy going forward.\nTurning to Slide 18. Given the uncertainty in the macro backdrop, we are reassessing our midterm guidance which we will readdress early next year. While it's premature at this juncture to provide a formal 2023 outlook as it relates to operational performance, I do want to offer some color on several below-the-line assumptions for the purposes of updating your models. Beginning with depreciation and amortization, our current projection is a range of $1.28 billion to $1.32 billion into for the full year 2023.\nMoving to net interest expense. Assuming the refinancing of maturing debt, our net interest expense would be in the range of $650 million to $700 million for the full year 2023 at current interest rate projections. As economic continues to progress through 2023, if debt reduction becomes a more optimal use of capital over share repurchase, we will execute accordingly. Presently, we would expect share repurchase to be our back-end loaded in 2023. I expect our effective tax rate to be slightly higher around 15% to 16%, and our period end 2022 share count should be approximately 595 million. At this time, we believe our below-the-line assumptions are in a reasonable range to communicate externally for the upcoming year to assist in modeling our financials.\nAs I wrap up my prepared remarks, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge the contributions of my predecessor, Woody Woodall to the company and mentorship as I now assume leadership of the finance organization. I'll finish by saying I'm excited for the next chapter of FIS and commit to being a prudent allocator of capital, a disciplined expense manager across the enterprise and a transparent and conservative communicator to the investment community. FIS continues to differentiate through expertise with enterprise merchants and financial institutions, we continue to provide mission-critical capabilities with highly recurring revenue streams and we benefit from a one-to-many operating model to drive underlying margin expansion, all of which we believe will deliver consistent and sustainable results through challenging macroeconomic conditions, driving value to our clients and shareholders for years to come.\nThank you again for your time this morning. Operator, will you please open the line for Q&A."

Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our financial results and provide forward guidance. Finally, Erik Hoag, our Deputy CFO, will then review -- will be with us for Q&A.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and other filings with the SEC. The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Please refer to the safe harbor language.\nAlso, throughout this conference call, we will be presenting non-GAAP information, including adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share and free cash flow. These are important financial performance measures for the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information are presented in our earnings release. Finally, I'm excited to share that George Mihalos will be joining our team during the third quarter. He knows both our company and the industry extremely well and will be a valuable addition to FIS.\nWith that, Gary, I'll turn the call to you.\n\nGary Adam Norcross\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nate, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to begin today's call by congratulating Erik Hoag as he begins to transition into his new role as Chief Financial Officer of FIS and by thanking Woody for his more than 14 years of distinguished service with the company. Erik has been with FIS for nearly 15 years, working closely with Woody throughout that time. And spent most of his time leading financial planning and analysis at FIS. Erik has a strong insight into both our business and financials.\nThis transition represents the strength of our talent development and succession planning and I have the utmost confidence in Erik's ability to meet or exceed our financial commitments while returning capital to our shareholders. As a key member of my leadership team, Woody's contribution to FIS has been immeasurable. During his tenure, he helped transform FIS with 2 of the largest strategic acquisitions in the industry. He meticulously manage costs while at the same time, empowering our businesses to accelerate their growth profiles. His leadership will be missed.\nWoody will step down effective November 4 and remain with the company through a transitionary period as CFO Emeritus to ensure a smooth transition.\nI'll now begin our earnings presentation on Slide 5. FIS delivered another strong operating performance in the second quarter. Revenue grew 8% organically to $3.7 billion. EBITDA increased 5% to $1.6 billion and adjusted EPS grew 7% to $1.73 per share. Each of our segments exceeded their revenue expectations with Banking growth of 6%, Merchant of 14% and Capital Markets of 7%.\nOur decision to continue to invest through the pandemic has put FIS in a leading position as we continue to see strong demand from our clients and prospects.\nU.S. consumer health and client demand were strong throughout the quarter as evidenced by our financial results. I want to highlight how proud I am of our team who remain focused on our clients, colleagues and communities. They have continued to deliver excellent results in the face of increasing volatile macro conditions.\nTurning to Slide 6. In addition to our strong financial model, our competitive position has never been better. We have the most modern solution suites in the market with world-class scale and differentiated end-to-end solutions.\nIn Banking, we continue to be the leader in cloud native core processing with our modern banking platform. In addition, we are quickly becoming a leader in embedded finance under Stephanie's leadership. We continue to expand our capabilities to enable financial institutions to offer digital banking services to business and commercial clients through a SaaS-based offering that can be quickly deployed as the consumer demands continue to evolve. Our embedded finance solutions are easily scalable and they create new revenue streams for our clients by enhancing their digital footprint.\nIn our Merchant segment, we continue to be a disruptor in the industry. We recently became the first payment processor to eliminate our clients' financial liability for chargebacks due to fraudulent purchases. The new guaranteed payments offering allows us to increase our already industry-leading authorization rates with fraud protection through a single integrated solution.\nWe have also continued to see exceptional strength out of our recent Payrix acquisition, and we are actively integrating Payrix with our ISV channel to develop an enhanced SMB offering. Stephanie will expand on these in a moment.\nIn Capital Markets, we continue to differentiate with end-to-end solutions using a recurring revenue SaaS model. For example, our clear derivative suite is a high-performing and modernized technology platform that seamlessly integrates our clients' existing infrastructure and spans end-to-end post-trade derivatives processing.\nWe also continue to invest in self-service automation, which is a key feature in our personal pension solution that recently drove a new win with the U.K. pension service. Despite the cloudy macro environment, this is an exciting time at FIS from a technology and a client services standpoint.\nLastly, I'd like to touch on the strength of our balance sheet on Slide 7. FIS has historically performed very well during periods of economic stress, and the strength of our balance sheet is a key differentiator for us in the marketplace. To that end, we reduced our leverage ratio to 2.9x during the second quarter.\nWe also successfully refinanced a portion of our debt in early July to increase our financial flexibility and to further decrease interest rate risk. In addition, return of shareholder capital is a priority for us. We paid nearly $300 million in quarterly dividends, and we intend to continue to drive to 20% plus annual dividend growth each year.\nWe also resumed share repurchase, buying back approximately $300 million in shares during the second quarter consistent with expectations. Our cash flow conversion is robust, which we will utilize to sustainably invest for growth while simultaneously returning significant capital to our shareholders through dividends and by default share repurchases in the back half of the year and throughout 2023.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie to describe how these strategic accomplishments are translating to our segment's operating performance. Stephanie?\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary, and welcome, everyone. We've reached a pivotal moment in fintech, where we've seen a fundamental shift in the way our clients and their customers want to consume financial services.\nFirst, financial institutions are both modernizing their financial technology facts and looking for ways to expand their own growth, driving increasing demand for Banking-as-a-Service.\nSecond, payments and financial capabilities are being embedded in software and across platforms, driving demand for a financial technology partner to help create a seamless consumer experience.\nAnd finally, rapidly evolving customer digital experiences are pushing our clients to focus on their core businesses and products, creating demand for offerings using a cloud-based as-a-service business model.\nThese trends have created large new areas of growth that cannot be served with traditional fintech models and segments. Our clients are looking for us to deliver these financial services to them by creating new models that utilize our best-in-class assets combined in creative new ways.\nAt FIS, we are uniquely positioned to capture these opportunities. We spent the past 5 years developing the best-in-class next-generation banking and capital markets technology. We are one of the only truly global e-commerce platforms. We have a marquee set of global corporate clients, large global banks and asset managers. And we built all of this at scale with global distribution. We're really pleased with our results again this quarter, and you will see that many of our wins reflect these trends and opportunities.\nIn Banking, we had a very strong quarter of core wins, showing continued strength in our traditional banking channel. We're pleased to share that we signed another 2 modern banking platform deals this quarter, finding our first large bank outside of the U.S. with ANZ Banking Group, the second largest bank in Australia and New Zealand. Being selected by a global bank of this caliber clearly shows that MBP has global reach and scale.\nJust as impressive as our recent core banking win with Columbia Bank and Umpqua Bank. Umpqua has been a key client of ours for years, but they were recently acquired by Columbia, who historically worked with one of our competitors. Typically, when a merger like this happens, you would expect acquiring banks to consolidate on to their core. Instead, I'm proud to share that Columbia Bank decided to consolidate onto the FIS core because of our expertise in serving large financial institutions.\nSimilarly, a large Northeast regional financial institution, Valley National Bank, had made the decision to leave FIS for a competitor. However, their conversion kept getting delayed. And during that time, they acquired another bank who was also running on an FIS core. After a review of the capabilities that the combined bank needed and their experience with their previous attempts to convert off FIS, the bank made the decision to consolidate the new combined bank onto our most advanced regional banking solution. These 2 examples point to our differentiation and strength in this larger regional bank market.\nAs we turn to new market growth, FIS is capitalizing on the rising demand for Banking-as-a-Service solutions as banks seek to create new revenue streams by widening their traditional distribution to end consumers through fintechs. And they're looking to leverage our embedded finance ecosystem. As an example, a leading-edge digital bank chose FIS' Banking-as-a-Service solution to support fintechs and offering account opening, money movement and card issuance to their customers. They're an early adopter expanding their reach through the fintech landscape. We've also seen increased demand for Banking-as-a-Service from fintechs that are demanding other use cases such as embedded lending, accounting, money movement and faster payments.\nAnd another exciting win for us, Block recently selected our national payments network to power their Cash App Card. They were drawn to the flexibility and service that we can offer them and are excited to leverage the power of our combined merchant and issuer ecosystem. Opportunities like this are creating a growing pipeline across verticals for payments crypto and digital financing so that banks and fintechs can grow with us as they expand their embedded offerings, all demonstrating the power of unlocking our assets.\nIn addition to embedded finance, we also see an emerging opportunity to deliver our offerings using our cloud-based as-a-service model and are experiencing this in the wealth and retirement space. Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price are 2 examples of strategic as-a-service wins for FIS.\nIn order to win their business, we live with our differentiated technology, and we demonstrated our ability to automate and scale our services across their expansive businesses. These landmark wins required an as-a-service approach, resulting in a win-win for both our clients and for FIS. This business model enables both our clients and FIS to participate in the benefits of growing the organic base of revenue and margins of our clients. And to date, these clients have grown organically 10% and all have expanded their scope of services with us.\nFinally, we're seeing significant momentum behind our Digital Banking Solution, Digital One, where we recently signed several new large regional financial institutions, including CIT and Signature Bank. Given current signings, the Digital One [cloud] solution will be supporting over 4 million customers by the end of 2023.\nTurning to Slide 10. In Capital Markets, our end-to-end solution continue to meet our clients' needs. We successfully signed the fourth largest bank in Japan, Sumitomo Trust Bank, who will implement our risk analytics manager to protect their operations from future regulatory changes. Our growing relationship with this bank also underscores the importance of our world-class scale and international reach.\nTurning to Europe. We're expanding our relationship with UBS by adding additional modules from our cleared derivatives suite, which will help to enhance their existing operations. This growing relationship highlights the competitive advantage that we've created by using componentized architecture to deploy our new solutions.\nEach of these important new wins demonstrate how our end-to-end solutions differentiate us from the competition by better meeting client needs with advanced technology.\nOn Slide 11, our Merchant results demonstrate that our long-term strategy is working. Our strategic focus in e-commerce for large as well as SMB and platform businesses is driving strong results. Our diversified e-commerce portfolio in terms of size of clients and verticals that we serve, recent new wins, share of wallet gains from existing customers and the addition of the Payrix capability which opens up our ability to serve SMBs via SaaS platforms are all contributing to outstanding performance.\nWe continue to open new geographies as well as add differentiated new solution capabilities like our recently launched Guaranteed Payments solution. With this solution, FIS was the first payment processor to guarantee e-commerce merchants increased approval rates and eliminate the financial liability of fraudulent purchases.\nBuilt on the back of our investment to improve authorization rates for our clients. This new solution now takes that investment to the next level, creating an end-to-end solution from merchants to banks. It not only eliminates rules at the merchant level through sophisticated machine learning decisioning, but allows them to increase transactions through our issuer partnerships, allowing us to pass broad scores and information on compromised cards from our merchants to our issuers.\nThis solution ultimately helps the merchant drive significantly more revenue by authorizing and improving more transactions. A large global health and beauty retailer will be an early adopter of Guaranteed Payments, which they will use to help maximize their revenue. As an early adopter, we've seen their approval rates increase by 600 basis points increasing their annual revenue by approximately $45 million, while also eliminating financial fraud liability. Because of the significant value that this brings to our merchants, we're able to increase our revenue, in most cases, doubling what we're earning over our processing revenue.\nWe have many examples of clients getting value from our ecosystem and full suite of solutions, including one of the world's largest grocers who continue to expand their relationship with us adding more banking capability to their operations and a very large global retailer who is expanding their loyalty portfolio by tapping into FIS' network of merchants for rewards redemption.\nThese 2 expansion deals combined drove more than $30 million of new contracts in the quarter. All these recent wins demonstrate that our strategy is working.\nOur expansion into SMB e-commerce with our new platform is also going exceptionally well. Payrix is exceeding our expectations for growth, and we're leveraging its embedded Payment-as-a-Service model to expand into SMB e-commerce in 2 ways. First, it enables us to serve cloud-based platforms like [Mateo], which is a B2B subscription management and financial operations platform that recently selected us to be their Payments-as-a-Service layer. We did have the ability to serve cloud-based SaaS platforms like this before Payrix.\nSecond, it enables us to offer e-commerce capability to our existing ISV clients. For example, Revel is a long-standing ISV of our serving several verticals. We traditionally serve them for card present only, and now they're expanding and embedding Payrix technology to enable payments in their online ordering and delivery services as well as card-not-present options to their end customer.\nWe're in the process of bringing our capabilities for SaaS platforms and traditional ISVs together into an enhanced platform offering. This platform strategy is critical to our future, and we're continuing to invest to bring new capability, leveraging our full assets. We expect a full rollout during the third quarter, and I'm looking forward to sharing more with you on the next call.\nI'll wrap up with Slide 12, which describes how merchants 14% constant currency growth is built up by subsegment. Global eCommerce continues to be our fastest-growing business consistent with our strategy. Its revenue growth accelerated to 28% in the second quarter from 23% in the first quarter on a constant currency basis. Enterprise and SMB are also both continuing to grow very well, generating 9% and 8% revenue growth this quarter, respectively.\nDespite the noise that circulated about Worldpay during the pandemic, our strategy for our merchant business is clearly advantaged in the fastest-growing and most strategically important segments of the market.\nI want to end my remarks where I started. We spent the past several years investing to bring forward the next generation of fintech solutions. The market is recognizing our shift. I'm pleased to share that for the second year in a row, we've been named a Fast Company's 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators list, jumping 14 spots in just a year's time competing with over 1,500 companies from various industries. Our inclusion in this exclusive list is a result of our demonstrated commitment to encouraging innovation at all levels attracting top talent and bringing bold new ideas to market. It's a rewarding recognition of the investments we've made.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results. Woody?\n\nJames W. Woodall\n\nCorporate EVP & CFO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with our financial results on Slide 14. We are very pleased with our 8% organic revenue performance for the quarter and 9% for the first half of the year which was driven by strong top line results achieved by all of our operating segments. In addition, we drove below the line leveraged and achieved adjusted EPS of $1.73 per share.\nTurning to our segments. Banking organic revenue growth was 6% as the team continues to execute on our strategy and ramp recent wins. Banking adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 130 basis points to 44% primarily due to the high contribution margins associated with last year's term fees and the pandemic-related revenue that we had to grow over as well as ongoing wage inflation.\nMerchant revenue grew 14% in constant currency and 12% on an organic basis, which includes a little over 1 point of headwind from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nWe're particularly pleased with eCommerce growth at 28% in constant currency and 22% on an organic basis. We continue to anticipate eCommerce to grow about 30% in constant currency and more than 20% organically for both Q3 and Q4.\nMerchant adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 280 basis points to 47%. The Russia-Ukraine conflict had a negative impact to margins of about 50 basis points, and we continue to invest in geo expansion for eCommerce plus Payrix sales channel expansion to capture strong demand.\nCapital Markets organic growth was 7%, primarily due to 10% recurring revenue growth that was driven by strong sales momentum and our transition to SaaS. Capital Markets adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points to 48% as the segment continues to benefit from operating leverage and diligent expense.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our strong revenue growth through the first half of the year. We continue to see wage inflation as an ongoing challenge, but have pulled operating levers to help offset this cost. Accordingly, we still anticipate adjusted EBITDA margins of 44% to 45% for the full year.\nTurning to Slide 15. We generated over $800 million of free cash flow during the second quarter, which is in line with expectations. We remain on track to achieve free cash flow conversion approaching 95% of adjusted net earnings for the full year as free cash flow conversion expands in the second half, consistent with normal seasonality.\nDebt was down by approximately $675 million, which helped us push leverage below 3x and restart our share repurchase program. The assets of M&A, we're focusing on share repurchase and are on track to buy back approximately $3 billion in shares during 2022. We also anticipate utilizing excess free cash flow in 2023 to buy back shares.\nTurning to Slide 16. We are maintaining our expectation for 7% to 9% organic revenue growth for the full year and adjusting our EPS outlook to account for recent macro changes and divestitures. Since we initially provided full year guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call, geopolitical and macro environments have changed materially. The Russia-Ukraine conflict created a little over a point of headwind within our Merchant business that we have covered so far with stronger revenue performance in eCommerce, and we expect to be able to continue to offset this headwind without affecting guidance.\nWe've also been able to offset rising costs from inflation and do not anticipate needing to change guidance for this either. With the strength of our financial model, we were able to overcome 1 or 2 headwinds in most years.\nThis year, the macro environment also changed by another 2 vectors that our initial guidance cannot absorb, foreign exchange and interest rates. In an effort to provide as much transparency as possible, we have outlined the implications of FX and interest for our full year 2022 guidance.\nFirst, the U.S. dollar has appreciated the multi-decade highs compared to the pound sterling and the euro making foreign currency translation our largest revenue. This FX translation has about a (inaudible) impact on our full year 2022 EPS as compared to original expectations.\nSecond, rising interest rates are impacting our net interest expense. This increased interest rates on our variable rate debt in conjunction with our recent bond issuance accounts for another $0.13 of EPS headwinds.\nFinally, we sold 2 businesses with our Corporate and Other segment, consistent with our strategy to divest or wind down nonstrategic assets. As these transactions close, we intend to use the proceeds to help fund share repurchase but using about a $0.03 impact on the year. Combined, FX, interest and divestitures are driving our guidance revision as our operating performance remains quite strong. When excluding these macro factors, we're effectively raising the high end of our guidance by $0.02 and the low end by $0.04.\nI'm extremely proud of our colleagues here at FIS, who have worked diligently to continue to drive our business forward through volatile macro conditions.\nOn Slide 17, we provide our typical guidance update. For the third quarter, we expect organic revenue growth of 5% to 6%, consistent with the range of $3.58 billion to $3.64 billion. This includes organic revenue growth assumptions for banking in the mid-single digits capital markets in the mid- to upper single digits and merchant in the upper single digits.\nThe third quarter faces difficult comps, particularly in banking as we had a large termination fee in the third quarter of the prior year. We also had expected the term fee in the third quarter of this year that has pushed out to the fourth quarter. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 45% for an adjusted EBITDA guidance range of about $1.6 billion to $1.63 billion.\nLastly, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share.\nFor the full year, we expect organic revenue growth to land in the middle of our original 7% to 9% organic growth range at about 8%. Our full year revenue range is $14.6 billion to $14.7 billion.\nAt the segment level, our organic revenue growth assumptions are unchanged, including Banking of 6% plus Capital Markets in the mid upper single digits and Merchant in the low double digits.\nFinally, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA margins of 44% to 45%, resulting in adjusted EPS of $7 to $7.10 per share. Updated assumptions for D&A, net interest expense, tax, share count are included in the Appendix section of this presentation.\nI would like to conclude on a personal note. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at FIS, and I wouldn't trade any of the last 10 years I've been a CFO. We've seen tremendous growth, and I'm proud to have played a part in what FIS is today. Gary, thank you for your friendship, partnership and leadership over the past 14 years. I'd like to thank the Board of Directors for their advice and support over these years. I'd also like to thank all of my colleagues here at FIS. They are the ones that have truly made the difference.\nFinally, I'd like to congratulate Erik Hoag's promotion to CFO. He has been an invaluable partner and I'm confident that I'm leaving you all in good hands. While I miss my time here, I am looking forward to retirement.\nWith that, operator, we please open the line for questions."

(Operator Instructions). Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Nate Rozof, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nNathan A. Rozof\n\nEVP of Corporate Finance & IR, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Sherry. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today for the FIS First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. The call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nGary Norcross, our Chairman and CEO, will provide the business and strategy update. Stephanie Ferris, our President, will discuss our operating performance. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our financial results and provide forward guidance. And finally, Eric Hoag, our Deputy CFO, will also be joining the call for the Q&A portion.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

These are important financial performance measures of the company but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.\n\nGary Adam Norcross\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nate, and thank you for joining us today. Starting on Slide 5. We had a strong start to the year, significantly exceeding our revenue expectations and achieving the high end of our EPS guidance. Revenue increased 9% organically to $3.5 billion and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $1.47 per share. All of our segments beat our organic growth expectations in the quarter. Banking grew 7%, exceeding our 6% expectation; Merchant grew 15% versus our low double-digit expectation; and Capital Markets grew 6%, with 8% growth in recurring revenue.\nNew sales increased our backlog 8% organically to $22.5 billion. This consistent strength in backlog aligns with our midterm outlook for 7% to 9% organic growth, and our sales pipelines remain strong. I'd like to thank the team for their sharp focus on serving our clients and for their continued execution.\nTurning to Slide 6. The pace of change in our industry is very exciting. We've invested ahead of this change and throughout the pandemic to position FIS for success. We moved our technology infrastructure and application architecture to the cloud, and we continue to bring new or significantly upgraded solution suites to market.\nIn Banking, our multiyear investment strategy has positioned us with the best-in-class capabilities across core and digital banking, issuer processing and wealth management. We further expanded the modern banking platform geographic reach this quarter by enabling public cloud deployments with Microsoft Azure. This will expand our reach into key markets like the U.K., Thailand and New Zealand.\nOur team has also successfully launched our new Banking-as-a-Service hub. This platform offers an all-in-one finance experience for our clients and enables them to rapidly create and deploy new embedded finance offerings for their customers.\nWe recently formed a partnership with Circle to enable our merchants to receive settlement in USD coin and Crypto.com, will be our first pilot customer. In addition to our ability to quickly deploy advanced technologies, international reach is also a true differentiator for us. Our Merchant business added 7 new countries in 2021 and plans to add 15 more by the end of 2023. In keeping with the crypto theme, Capital Markets recently announced a new partnership with Fireblocks to enable our clients to store and issue digital assets as well as to gain access to decentralized finance.\nAcross multiple verticals, industries and client types, we continue to develop mission-critical systems at global scale that empower our clients to innovate and grow. The power of FIS doesn't stop with our ability to deliver unique solutions. The true value unlock is leapfrogging from leading solutions for individual client types to offering expansive embedded finance experiences that can bring all of our capabilities to bear for every client. We have technology platform initiatives underway to simplify the consumption of our cloud-native capabilities, either as end-to-end solutions or as individual components. More and more, our clients are asking for access to solutions from all 3 of our operating segments to enable robust transformations across their enterprise. These initiatives will speed access for them and open up rich new revenue streams for us.\nWe are also evolving our go-to-market strategy by aligning our sales organization to directly target these new opportunities. Despite market fears about disruption, at FIS, we think we are the disruptor. And we will help our clients win now and into the future.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Stephanie to describe how this vision is translating to our operating segments and to review their first quarter performance.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. This was an exciting quarter with momentum building for our new solutions, as Gary discussed.\nStarting with Banking on Slide 8. We continue to see elevated organic growth, posting our sixth consecutive 5%-plus revenue growth quarter, which is well above the historical trend. Clearly, our multiyear investment strategy is paying dividends. To bring our vision to life, I'd like to highlight a few strategic new wins, which are a direct result of our technology investments.\nPaymentsOne is the most advanced, scaled issuer processing platform in the market. We've migrated approximately 1,500 of our existing clients to this platform, and we continue to leverage its unique end-to-end capabilities to win new clients. In the quarter, a top 20 U.S. financial institution selected PaymentsOne for debit processing and card production.\nWe remain differentiated with our issuer processing capabilities and believe we have significant TAM to capture with this innovative platform. In addition, we're making significant investments in our wealth management platform, gaining a second landmark win with Mutual of America, following our T. Rowe Price win last year.\nAnd in a third example, our Premium Payback loyalty network is a truly unique solution that combines our strength in issuing and acquiring to enable consumers to pay with points in store at the point of sale. This quarter, AT&T decided to join our loyalty network, and consumers will be able to use points from participating issuers to pay in AT&T stores. As retailers and issuers continue to join, we expect a powerful network effect.\nCapital Markets grew revenue 6% organically as shown on Slide 9. Our team continues to transition the business to SaaS-based revenue models, which drove recurring revenue up 8% in the quarter. Transitioning to SaaS not only increases the predictability and resiliency of growth, but also allows for incremental cross-sell opportunities as clients look to transition to the cloud. We've made significant investments in our transfer agency solution to create an as-a-service offering that drives efficiency and automation.\nSimilar to Banking, we had a second landmark win this quarter with a leading financial institution with more than $1 trillion in AUM, continuing the momentum from our Franklin Templeton win last year. This win builds on a long-standing core processing relationship, and we were thrilled to enhance our value proposition by bringing them even more breadth of capabilities. We also saw strength with privately held investment firms. Our investment operations suite drove Capital Market's largest-ever private markets deal with a premier high net worth multifamily office that will leverage our technology suite to transform their operations.\nFinally, we expanded our relationship with Robinhood in the quarter to empower their new stock loan income program. This expanded relationship helps cement our long-term vendor of choice partnership with Robinhood, where we continue to expand our value proposition across traditional and digital assets for this client. Overall, our end-to-end SaaS solutions are differentiated in the market and will continue to drive strong growth for Capital Markets.\nOn Slide 10, our Merchant segment generated 15% organic growth this quarter. And our Payrix acquisition is already paying off by signing several SaaS-based platforms in the quarter. Payrix more than doubled their client count as compared to last year, and we highlight a few recent wins with platform spanning the education, commercial and marketplace verticals on the slide. We also continued our success as the leading acquirer for crypto. Currency.com signed with us this quarter after witnessing our capabilities and client service for another crypto exchange. They were further attracted to our expansive global reach, which will help them expand their own business.\nLastly, The Nilson Report recently published their 2021 U.S. merchant acquirer ranking, which highlighted the strength of our e-commerce and software-led strategy. Our share of total U.S. volume increased by approximately 200 basis points to 20% in 2021 from 18% the year before. I couldn't be prouder of our team. The pandemic put them to the test, and they continue to put our clients first and execute at the highest level.\nI'll wrap up by sharing the performance of our subsegments on Slide 11. global eCommerce continues to be our fastest-growing business with 23% growth on a constant currency basis. As anticipated, travel rebounded strongly in the quarter, exceeding 2019 levels. Our large enterprise business grew 14% organically and continues to be a differentiated source of scale. Lastly, software-led SMB grew 13% organically, with restaurant and retail both growing double digits.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results. Woody?\n\nJames W. Woodall\n\nCorporate EVP & CFO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin with our financial results on Slide 13, then I'll touch on our balance sheet and cash flow before taking you through our guidance.\nWe're very pleased with our 9% organic revenue performance and the strong results achieved across all of our operating segments. We maintained consistent margins year-over-year as we were able to successfully offset wage inflation and difficult comparisons, including last year's stimulus-related revenue. This translated to 13% adjusted EPS growth, which is consistent with the high end of our full year guidance range.\nTurning to our segments. Banking revenue grew 7% on an organic basis, primarily due to continued client demand. Adjusted EBITDA margins contracted 90 basis points to 42%. The Banking segment is where we experienced the majority of our margin headwind as it directly benefited from the Paycheck Protection Program or PPP revenue in the prior year and was impacted by higher labor costs.\nMerchant revenue grew 15% on an organic basis, reflecting strong results across all 3 subsegments, as Stephanie mentioned. Merchant adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 47%, primarily due to high contribution margins on new revenue growth. Capital Markets revenue grew 6% on an organic basis, primarily due to continued strong new sales and the transition to SaaS, driving higher recurring revenue. Capital Markets' adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points to 47%, primarily due to its continued operating leverage.\nTurning to Slide 14. We generated $786 million of free cash flow during the first quarter. Free cash flow increased by 41% year-over-year. We have invested heavily in innovation over the past 5 years, spending over $5 billion in CapEx over that time. We believe that this investment has peaked as a percentage of revenue and expect it to come down gradually over the next several years to approximately 6% to 7% of revenue. As a result, we expect free cash flow conversion to expand in subsequent quarters, and we remain on track to expand our free cash flow conversion towards 95% of adjusted net earnings for the full year.\nWe increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.47 per share, and we returned a total of $287 million in dividends to shareholders this quarter. As a reminder, we plan to increase our dividend by approximately [20%] per year in order to gradually grow our dividend payout ratio over the next several years to approximately 35% of adjusted net income.\nIn addition, we reduced debt by $1.2 billion, including repayment and foreign exchange benefit, ending the first quarter at 3x leverage, which was a full 90 days ahead of schedule. We expect to maintain our leverage below 3x, and we'll resume share repurchase in the second quarter. At current valuation levels, we believe share repurchase is the best use of excess free cash flow. We expect to buy back approximately $3 billion in shares during 2022. We also anticipate utilizing excess free cash flow in 2023 to buy back shares. At current course and speed, this will be approximately $6 billion in share repurchases during 2023. Combined, this represents approximately 15% of our current market cap.\nTurning to Slide 15 to review our guidance. There is no change to our full year outlook. We achieved a strong start to the year and remain on track to deliver 7% to 9% organic revenue growth, 50 to 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and 11% to 13% adjusted EPS growth for a range of $7.25 to $7.37 per share. The primary risk and opportunities to our forward guidance include the impact of foreign exchange rates, geopolitical risk and the pace of pandemic recovery. Combined with the upside we delivered in the first quarter, we believe that this supports maintaining our outlook for the full year.\nFor the second quarter, we expect organic revenue growth of 6% to 7%, consistent with revenue of $3.65 billion to $3.685 billion. We expect adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 44%, resulting in adjusted EPS of $1.72 to $1.75 per share. Given the unusual puts and takes that are affecting organic growth rates for Banking and Merchant, I would like to provide you with some more color on our segment assumptions for the second quarter.\nIn Banking, we currently expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single-digit range for the second quarter. This is primarily due to the difficult compares created by the termination fees and pandemic-related revenue that we generated last year. We anticipate a similar growth profile of mid-single digits for our Capital Markets segment in the second quarter.\nFor Merchant, we currently expect organic revenue growth of approximately 9% to 10% in the second quarter. This equates to strong sequential growth of approximately 15% for Merchant. In addition, we expect adjusted EBITDA margins to step up each quarter throughout the year. Lastly, we include assumptions for FX, corporate and other and several below-the-line items within the Opinion section of our earnings presentation.\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank our colleagues for their continued efforts and perseverance through the pandemic. You continue to execute at a high level and generate strong financial results. Operator, would you please open the line for questions?"

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Nathan Rozof, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nNathan A. Rozof\n\nEVP of Corporate Finance & IR, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for the FIS Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Conference Call. The call is being webcasted. Today's news release, corresponding presentation and webcast are all available on our website at fisglobal.com.\nGary Norcross, our Chairman and CEO, will discuss our operating performance and 2022 priorities. Stephanie Ferris, our President, will describe our strategy to unlock the value of FIS. Woody Woodall, our Chief Financial Officer, will then review our financial results and provide forward guidance. Finally, Eric Hoge, our Deputy CFO, will also be joining the call for the Q&A portion.\nTurning to Slide 3. Today's remarks will contain forward-looking statements.

These are important financial performance measures for the company, but are not financial measures as defined by GAAP. Reconciliation of our non-GAAP information to the GAAP financial information are presented in our earnings release.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Gary. Gary?\n\nGary Adam Norcross\n\nExecutive Chairman & CEO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Nate, and thank you for joining us this morning. Starting on Slide 5. By all metrics, our colleagues delivered a historic operating performance for FIS in 2021. Our strategy continues to resonate with our clients and prospects, and our team continues to execute at an exceptionally high level.\nFor the full year, revenue increased 11% to nearly $14 billion. Margin expanded by over 200 basis points to 44%, and adjusted EPS increased 20% to $6.55 per share. Growth for the year was driven by strong performance across our operating segments, with Banking at 8%, Capital Markets at 8% and Merchant at 19%. In the quarter, Merchant came in softer than we expected due to the Omicron variant. As you will see in our deep dive on Merchant later in the deck, without this impact in late November and December, our Merchant growth would have been even higher. For the year, we generated record free cash flow of $3.6 billion.\nWe returned $3 billion to shareholders, increased our dividend and acquired Payrix, which will accelerate Merchant's eCommerce offering for platforms that primarily serve SMBs. We also successfully completed the Worldpay integration nearly a year ahead of schedule, beating our initial revenue synergy target by 50% and more than doubling our initial expense synergy target. We had a very strong sales quarter, even with the Omicron variant, due to the strong demand for our differentiated solutions. New sales increased our backlog to a record $23 billion, an increase of 8% organically. By any account, this was a record year for FIS and the strongest operating performance in our 53-year history.\nTurning to Slide 6. Given our sales success, we wanted to highlight several landmark wins across our company with clients and prospects who look to FIS as their trusted technology partner to help them to expand or transform their business. In Banking, this includes a top 15 global financial institution who wanted to accelerate their growth and expansion in the U.S. by executing a digital strategy. This innovated client-selected FIS in the modern banking platform to modernize their infrastructure using our cloud-native for processing platform. They will also use our cloud-native Digital One platform to enable their strategy, which was a key selling point in their decision-making process.\nAdditionally, Amerant Bank signed a significant deal to outsource most of their solutions to FIS, which allows them to transform their business from a multi-vendor solution to a single innovation partner. This will drive a significant savings for Amerant while bringing their solutions to the most current technologies, which is a great example of the power of the FIS portfolio. These wins are indicative of how the differentiated capabilities in our Banking segment drove the more-than-30% increase in new sales for the year.\nTurning to our Merchant segment. geographic expansion was a core tenet to our strategic rationale of the [by] Worldpay. Throughout 2021, we entered 7 new countries, which continue to push accelerated growth in our merchant offerings, especially eCommerce. One of those markets was Argentina. And as a direct result, we signed the country's largest airline this quarter. They chose FIS because they are looking for a trusted partner with a sophisticated vertical expertise and global processing platform that will help them grow their business.\nAnother key rationale for the Worldpay acquisition is our ability to utilize our combined solutions and data to increase authorization rates. We now integrated our merchant and issuer processing solutions to create AuthMax preferred. This innovative new solution dramatically increases authorization rates for transactions, where we are both the merchant acquirer and issuer processor based on our insight into both sides of the transaction. With this significant innovation, we can improve authorization of historically declined transactions as much as 40% for trusted cardholders of Worldpay's participating merchants. This generates significant revenue uplift for our clients.\nBased on this advancement, Netflix expanded our long-standing relationship this quarter to quickly take advantage of this new capability. Given our strong pipeline, we are looking forward to building on a record new sales increase in merchant to more than 40% for the year.\nIn Capital Markets, we signed our largest deal in the history of this business with Franklin Templeton. Like our T. Rowe Price announcement a few quarters ago in the wealth vertical, this anchor client establishes us as a leading global player with a differentiated international transfer agency solution that will provide a new leg of growth for capital markets.\nAdditionally, the recent investments we've made in our Clear Derivatives Platform are driving significant new wins, including SocGen this quarter, which will transition their middle and back office to our innovative solution. We could not be more pleased with the structural transformation that has occurred within our Capital Markets business. This team has done an outstanding job of combining our industry-leading products and to advance end-to-end solutions that are clearly resonating through our sales channel. Like our other segments, Capital Markets had a record year in sales and organic growth with new sales increased in more than 40% for the year.\nOn Slide 7, I'd like to revisit a topic that we discussed last quarter, which is the opportunity that we are seeing in the market to bring solutions together from across our segments. Buyer preferences continue to move in our favor, with clients consuming more of our solutions across their enterprise to create unique client experiences. Last quarter, we brought forward the example of Amazon, first, utilizing our nice debit network capabilities from banking before consuming our omnichannel merchant-acquiring capabilities and adding a treasury and cash management solution from capital markets. Given our success in revenue synergies with the Worldpay integration, we continue to evolve our go-to-market strategies through better organizational alignment, which allows us to take advantage of a broader addressable market for our unique solution set. These changes are driving real results as we grow our list of clients that are working across our business segments in unique and differentiating ways. As we continue to build capabilities, programmatically addressing this opportunity to create innovative new experiences truly unlocks the power of FIS. We will continue to bring this forward in the coming quarters as we think this alone could accelerate our growth rates from current levels.\nAs we close out 2021, I'd like to take a moment to recognize some of the awards FIS earned and to lay out priorities for 2022 on Slide 8. This year, we saw a tremendous recognition for our leadership in fintech as a global company. To name a few, Fast Company Magazine named FIS in their Best Workplaces for Innovators' List, which recognizes companies that empower their employees to improve processes, create new products and invent new ways of doing business. In Merchant, our Access Worldpay earned honors for Highest Authorization Rate by the Strawhecker Group. In Banking, our Unity Wealth Management platform was named Best Technology for Family Offices and the PAM awards. And in Capital Markets, our Clear Derivative Suite was named Post-Trade System of the Year, Global Investor Group. We were also recognized by Fortune as the Most Admired Company, and we were named the Best Place to Work for the LGBTQ+ Community for the fourth consecutive year. Lastly, we were recognized for the Best ESG Reporting by Hour Magazine.\nTurning our focus to 2022. At FIS, we have consistently invested for growth, executed at scale and delivered innovation at the highest level. We will continue to focus on unlocking the power of FIS in an organized and systematic way. This will be centered around delivering compelling new solutions for our clients and taking advantage of our significant head-start in the cloud to innovate at speed. We will also continue to componentize our technology stack to make all our industry-leading solutions available to every client, regardless of the segment where they reside today.\nThis will enable us to expand into attractive new verticals like crypto to capture fast-growing and emerging new markets. We have built FIS into an industry leader over the past 50 years. And in 2022, we will again demonstrate how FIS will further its lead over the next 50 years. This business will continue to grow and generate exceptional profitability and free cash flow, which we'll use to maximize shareholder returns and drive continued strong organic growth rates.\nFinally, I'd like to address a couple of executive announcements that we made this quarter. First, Bruce Lowthers decided to leave FIS to pursue a role outside the company. Over the past 15 years, Bruce has been a champion of our transformation, and the result of his focus and contributions has been significant acceleration in growth at FIS. Thank you for your service to FIS, Bruce. We wish you all the best with your next role.\nSecond, I'm pleased to announce that I've promoted Stephanie Ferris to be President of FIS. Stephanie returned to the company in September of last year as Chief Administration Officer, after originally joining FIS from the acquisition of Worldpay in 2019. She is a seasoned Global Executive with over 25 years of experience leading payments and technology platform businesses. She also has impressive experience driving digital transformation, frontline customer engagement and inclusive growth. This is a tremendous achievement, and we are excited to have Stephanie step into this new role. Congratulations, Stephanie. She joins us today and will continue to participate on future earnings calls.\nStephanie, welcome. I'll turn the call to you.\n\nStephanie L. Ferris\n\nPresident, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone. I'm excited to be here and to share a little bit more about our vision to unlock the power of FIS. FIS is uniquely positioned with the best and broadest set of assets delivered at scale and with global reach. All the start-ups that are coming to market are trying to create what we already have. They want to offer embedded finance solutions and are trying to build those capabilities one by one.\nWe already have leading deposit, lending, issuing and B2B solutions. And we have a large network of financial institutions, capital markets and merchant participants to drive adoption at a global scale. Our clients compete effectively within their traditional segments, but the market post-pandemic has shifted in the lines between traditional segments [and foreign]. By bringing all of our capabilities together to deliver embedded finance solutions, we have the unique opportunity to help our clients compete and win in this new reality. I'll build on this by providing an example of how we are translating our leading crypto capabilities within e-commerce to drive innovation across all of FIS.\nBeginning with Slide 10, we see Merchant's eCommerce opportunity as centered around 3 segments: enterprise, platforms and small to medium-sized businesses. Today, our expertise is in the enterprise space. Multinational enterprises and leading global brands choose us because of our global reach, best-in-class authorization and fraud rates and white-glove service. We consistently win landmark clients who need our help to expand into new countries or to help them solve their challenges using our payments expertise. The clients in these segments have unique needs. Serving millions of small businesses directly or through a platform requires specialized capabilities like automated underwriting and onboarding.\nPayrix will modernize our client experience through their next-generation product suite and enable us to deliver differentiated embedded finance and payment experiences for platforms that primarily serve SMBs, beating our entry into this high-growth segment of eCommerce. Their team is extremely talented, and we are excited to welcome them into the FIS family.\nFollowing the Payrix acquisition, we expect to formally launch our entry into platforms later this year, and I will be back again next quarter to share an update with you about this. But first, on Slide 11, I'd like to give you a little more color about how we operate in enterprise eCommerce and provide a case study about why we win in the crypto vertical. We serve 4 of the top 5 exchanges and have 100% client retention. Our success reflects a combination of both our product and innovation leadership. FIS was the first to offer Apple Pay for crypto currencies, and now we are launching direct settlement in crypto. We offer 14 payment methods across 46 markets and were named Crypto Payment Service Provider of the Year by Crypto AM in 2021. We were able to quickly expand into this emerging vertical because we have the technology and the expertise to enter new markets faster than our peers.\nWe also have sophisticated solutions that we developed by serving other complex verticals, like travel and airlines, that allow us to assess and properly underwrite new clients that other players may not understand. Here's where it gets interesting. We are expanding our expertise in crypto from merchant to both Banking and Capital Markets.\nOur clients in all of our segments want access to this high-growth vertical. We're enabling banks to open cryptocurrency accounts for their customers. And we enable them to buy, sell and hold crypto in partnership with NYDIG. By integrating Digital One, our clients can offer these accounts to their customers through their mobile apps, displaying crypto and traditional checking and saving accounts side by side. We are also blazing the trail for cryptocard issuing within our banking segment. FIS will handle all aspects of card management and processing for cex.io. This crypto exchange is offering a new line of crypto-based consumer cards across Europe and the U.K. by leveraging our innovative capabilities.\nAdditionally, our Capital Markets segment develops a software that powers exchanges, traders and asset managers. These solutions are in demand by our crypto exchange clients, and we are quickly deploying our expertise there.\nIn summary, we are expanding the reach of our crypto expertise from Merchants to Banking and Capital Markets in order to enable all of our clients to participate in this high-growth vertical.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Woody to discuss our financial results and provide 2022 guidance. Woody?\n\nJames W. Woodall\n\nCorporate Executive VP & CFO, Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.\n\nThanks, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us. I will begin with our fourth quarter and full year results, then touch on our balance sheet, cash flow and 2022 guidance before taking you through our enhanced market disclosures.\nStarting with the fourth quarter on Slide 13. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 11% and adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 120 basis points, generated adjusted EPS of $1.92 per share. Both Banking and Capital Markets revenue grew 8%, while Merchant revenue growth accelerated by 500 basis points sequentially to 19%. Banking's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 45%, primarily due to continued operating leverage. Merchant's adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 140 basis points to 52%, primarily due to revenue and cost synergies associated with the Worldpay acquisition. Capital Markets' adjusted EBITDA margin remained constant at 52%, primarily reflecting higher bonus expense related to strong revenue growth, which offset operating leverage from new wins.\nTurning to full year results on Slide 14. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 44%, and adjusted EPS was $6.55 per share. Adjusted EBITDA margins expanded 220 basis points, primarily due to operating leverage and strong execution of revenue and cost synergies associated with the Worldpay acquisition.\nIn Banking, revenue growth accelerated 8%, primarily due to strong new sales execution. Based on our large and growing backlog as well as our expanding pipeline of new opportunities, we expect Banking to continue to grow high single digits in the midterm. In 2022, Banking will grow 6% or more due to approximately [200] basis points in grow overs. This is primarily due to lapping pandemic-related stimulus and expected lower termination fees.\nMerchant revenue grew 19%. While new variants of COVID-19 are affecting near-term results, our strong new sales gives us confidence that Merchant will grow low double digits in 2022 and beyond.\nCapital Markets also continues to execute well with revenue growth of 8%. This segment is well positioned to accelerate revenue growth to the mid- to upper single digits in 2022, driven by another strong year of new sales, cross-sell opportunities and recurring revenue growth.\nTurning to Slide 15. I'll touch on the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow. We generated $3.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year, which we used to buy back 15 million shares, and we paid nearly $1 billion in dividends during 2021. During the fourth quarter, we generated approximately $850 million in free cash flow, which we primarily used to acquire Payrix.\nIn addition, our Board of Directors recently increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.47 per share. We intend to increase our dividend by approximately 20% per year. This will allow us to gradually grow our dividend payout ratio to approximately 35% of adjusted net income.\nTurning to our guidance on Slide 16. In the first quarter, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 8%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by approximately 50 basis points to 41%. And lastly, we expect to generate adjusted EPS of $1.44 to $1.47 per share. For the full year, we expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9%. We expect our adjusted EBITDA margin to increase by 50 to 100 basis points to approximately 45%. We expect to generate 150 to 200 basis points of margin expansion from operating leverage and annualization of synergies. This will be partially offset by higher labor costs resulting in our guidance of 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year.\nAs a result of our accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 11% to 13% to a range of $7.25 to $7.37 per share for full year 2022. We expect to generate free cash flow growth of approximately 15% and improved conversion of about 27% of revenue, which is approaching 95% of earnings for the full year. To start of the year, we'll repay debt and reduce our leverage below 3 turns before we resume share repurchase. Our guidance then assumes share repurchases of approximately $3 billion, mostly during the back half of 2020.\nPlease note that we have provided our detailed assumptions for depreciation and amortization, tax rate and share count within the appendix of this presentation on Slides 26 and 27.\nTurning now to our enhanced Merchant disclosures on Slide 18. Our volume trends continue to track closely with the networks. As compared to 2020, global volume growth remained stable at 17%. As a reminder, the networks also experienced stable volume growth between the third and the fourth quarters. Our U.S. volume growth accelerated by 200 basis points to 19%. This trend is again consistent with the networks.\nOn Slide 19, we show volume growth trends as compared to 2019. Our global volume growth remained consistent at 23%, while the networks' volumes accelerated modestly. This is due to our larger U.K. exposure, where Omicron variant had a significant impact, as I will show you in a few minutes.\nIn the U.S., our volume accelerated by 100 basis points to 26%. We do not currently serve SMB eComm or platforms, which help the networks to accelerate slightly more than us this quarter. We're looking to use Payrix as a first step to close this gap, as Stephanie mentioned earlier.\nAs we begin 2022, our volume trends continue to be consistent with the networks in January. International volumes began to improve in January as new Omicron cases started to slow in the U.K. In the U.S., volume growth slowed modestly in January as we lap last year's stimulus. As the Omicron variant recedes, we expect our volumes to continue to track closely with the networks.\nTurning to Slide 20. We updated the detailed subsegment data that we showed last quarter to include our fourth quarter results as compared to 2019. While all our subsegments continue to grow well above 2019 levels, the Omicron variant impacted the fourth quarter. Omicron primarily affected revenue yield as compared to 2019 by reducing the mix of SMB, travel and international volumes for the quarter.\nOn a more positive note, as compared to 2020, Merchant yield improved both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis, demonstrating our future revenue growth potential as high-yielding segments recover from the pandemic. Over the next few slides, I will talk you through the results of each subsegment and how they contributed to our Merchant revenue growth.\nGlobal eCommerce generated $1.2 billion in revenue during 2021, as shown on Slide 21. During the fourth quarter, global eComm revenue grew 31% as compared to 2019, excluding travel and airlines. Even with these strong results, we saw the effects of Omicron in travel and airlines. The chart on the right shows our monthly travel volumes versus 2019. Travel accelerated through November, but then pulled back to May levels in December. The difference between same-store sales and our total volume growth is due to new client wins. As travel comes back and exciting new verticals like crypto continue to emerge, we see significant opportunity for future growth.\nTurning to Slide 22. Enterprise generated $2 billion in revenue during 2021. During the fourth quarter, revenue grew 16% year-over-year and 8% over 2019. In the upper right-hand corner, the impacts of Omicron on the U.K. are obvious, where growth dropped to 0 in December from mid-teen levels previously. Our U.S. Enterprise business also saw some pullback in December, but it was not nearly as severe as in the U.K.\nSMB revenue growth over 2019 decelerated to 11% in the fourth quarter, as shown on Slide 23. This is clearly due to Omicron as the deceleration occurred in all verticals. As this variant recedes, we expect growth to reaccelerate. However, we are more excited by the opportunity to push into SMBs with e-commerce.\nIn summary, while we continue to see impacts from the pandemic in the short term, Merchant TAM is expected to grow 8% to 10% through the midterm, as shown on Slide 24. Further, as we continue to grow eCommerce as a larger and larger portion of our overall revenue mix, we're confident in our ability to outpace TAM growth and to generate low double-digit Merchant revenue growth in 2022 and beyond. The combination of Merchant growth with our continued strength in Banking and Capital Markets gives us confidence in our 2022 outlook and in the future of FIS.\nI would like to thank our colleagues for their continued efforts in serving our clients and driving our business forward. With that, I'd like to open the line for Q&A. Operator?"

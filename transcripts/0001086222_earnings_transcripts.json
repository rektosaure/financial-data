Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMark Stoutenberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including those regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The factors include, but are not limited to, any impact from macroeconomic trends the integration of any acquisition, geopolitical developments and other risk factors identified in our filings with the SEC. The statements included on today's call represent the company's views on November 6, 2025 and we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nAs a reminder, we'll be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. With that, I'll now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. I'm pleased to report that Akamai had a strong third quarter with results coming in above expectations for revenue, margin and earnings per share. Revenue grew to $1.055 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and up 4% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margins improved to 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.86, and up 17% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our business performed well across the spectrum of our portfolio with accelerating momentum for our Cloud Infrastructure Services or CIS, Continued strong demand for our high-growth security products and continued stabilization of our delivery revenue.\nWe're especially pleased with the greater recognition of the strength of our distributed platform and differentiated strategy among customers and industry analysts. For investors who may be less familiar with how we have transformed Akamai's business model from the CDN Pioneer to a leader in cloud security and distributed cloud computing, I encourage you to read the new report on Akamai from IDC. Titled Akamai, Navigating the Cloud Frontier, a transformation from CDN to distributed cloud provider. It offers an objective third-party perspective of how Akamai has evolved our strategy and our key differentiators in security and distributed cloud computing for AI inferencing at the edge. You can find the report on our website. As a great proof point for the advantages of by Akamai's uniquely distributed compute capabilities, the top 3 cloud providers in the U.S. are all now using Akamai cloud infrastructure services. And in Q3, one of them signed an expanded multiyear renewal that solidifies Akamai's position to be their premier distributed cloud computing provider.\nThis customer has a dominant position at the core of the Internet and uses our widely distributed managed container service to get their business logic closer to end users for superior performance. Our revenue for cloud infrastructure services in Q3 was $81 million, up 39% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. That's an acceleration from the 30% growth rate we had in Q2. We signed many new and expanded contracts for our cloud infrastructure services in Q3, including with a major global appliance and consumer electronics manufacturer in South Korea, a multinational financial services company in Singapore, a leading U.S. developer of analytics software, a U.S.-based supply chain planning software vendor, a European cyber or security provider, a major U.S. airline, a leading American video game company, a leading media and entertainment company in India and one of the largest media companies in the world.\nAlso, a multinational gaming company in Japan contracted for our cloud infrastructure services as part of a larger $37 million 2-year renewal for an array of Akamai products and services. Last week, I was with our team at the AI Industry Conference NVIDIA GTC where Akamai took a major step towards the future with the launch of Akamai Inference Cloud. Our platform to support the growing demand to scale AI inference on the Internet. With the rise of AI, the Internet is undergoing a fundamental shift in architecture. The Internet we're building today is driven by AI. And where human intelligence is supported and augmented by intelligent systems powered by AI entrants.\nAkamai is positioned to power inference the way we power the web by bringing inference physically close to users. This will enable faster performance and global scale to support intelligent applications worldwide. When the web was first taking hold, the need for performance and scale is what catalyzed Akamai's founding. Akamai helped to end what was known as the worldwide weight, enabling the Internet to scale to provide real-time services to billions of people around the world. Subsequently, we introduced web security as a cloud service. enabling the web to be used safely for myriad critical applications such as banking and commerce. We see the same need for performance, scale and security playing out again with AI inference today. By combining highly scaled GPU and compute capacity with Akamai's unparalleled global reach and security at the edge, Akamai Inference Cloud enables intelligence to run instantly securely and exactly where it's needed, right next to the user, agent or device.\nThis is how Akamai can power the new generation of AI applications, conversational, personalized and agent. All designed to scale in real time to meet unprecedented demand. As we look at AI investment cycles, we see the market at a transition point. Until now, the AI story has largely focused on training, the initial creation of AI models from massive amounts of underlying data. To train foundation models, AI pioneers have relied on hyperscale clouds and their centralized data centers with their enormous concentrations of compute, power and capital. We believe that AI inference or the execution of queries against a trained model is the new frontier, one that requires purpose-built infrastructure to enable distributed low-latency, globally scalable inference at the edge, with response times measured in a few tens of milliseconds.\nAs AI systems are adopted at scale, we expect the growth of inference will drive enormous demand to this new intelligent layer of the Internet. And we're not the only ones who see it coming. Fortune Business Insights noted in a report on the rising global AI inference market that due to rising demand for real-time low-latency AI processing near data sources Edge inference leads the market and is projected to grow at the highest CAGR of all AI inference models. And as NVIDIA's Founder and CEO, Jensen Wang said when we launched Akamai Inference Cloud at GTC Inference has become the most compute-intensive phase of AI. Demanding real-time reasoning at planetary scale. Together, NVIDIA and Akamai are moving inference closer to users everywhere, delivering faster, more scalable generative AI and unlocking the next generation of intelligent applications.\nAkamai Inference Cloud brings together Akamai's globally distributed architecture and expertise with NVIDIA's Blackwell AI infrastructure to provide the computing needed to unlock AI's true potential. The service is available today with 17 locations around the world and we're building out more points of presence as customer demand grows. One of our initial customers, Mons, the European digital-first marketing technology services and consulting company said \"with Akamai Inference Cloud, we will accelerate the delivery of key capabilities, including identifying players and play use and delivering tactical insights to coaches while the game is still happening. That's only possible by distributing advanced GPUs to the edge, and we believe it will transform how we approach sports broadcasting and immersive fan experiences.\"\nAnother customer, Harmonic, whose technology helps to distribute video content for television and the Internet said, \"Akamai Inference Cloud will allow us to run larger parameter, more capable models locally. Expanding the number of functions we can deliver cost effectively within the same compute instance to deliver fast response times, sophisticated personalization and more enriching video content.\" At Akamai, we believe the technology ecosystem that enables the AI revolution will require multiple providers of AI infrastructure, the hyperscalers, NVIDIA and also Akamai with our unique distributed capabilities and our unparalleled expertise at the edge. We are very excited about what lies ahead. The edge, of course, is also where Akamai deploys our security solutions. And as customers speak with us about their plans for AI inferencing, they tell us they see valuable synergy between Akamai's security and delivery product lines and our cloud computing capabilities. and how they trust Akamai to help make the Internet faster, more reliable and secure for their businesses.\nAkamai security growth in Q3 continued to be driven by strong demand for our market-leading segmentation solution and by rapidly growing customer adoption of our API security solutions. Combined, these high-growth security products grew revenue 35% year-over-year as reported and 34% in constant currency. Our segmentation wins in Q3 included a $3 million expansion contract to give one of North America's largest health care technology companies the visibility and control they didn't have before. A $1 million contract with a European insurance group that is also a net new Akamai customer, a multiyear contract with a large insurance company in Korea. And an expansion contract with a large bank in Mexico to extend their initial deployment across their operations in Latin America.\nIn Q3, we also continued to see growing interest in our market-leading API security solution. As organizations shift towards an API-first strategy and expand their use of AI applications that rely on APIs in a fundamental way, adopt tools that enable them to discover and monitor deployed APIs and to manage risk. Comply with stricter data protection regulations, especially in Europe and respond to public reports of API-related breaches that have raised awareness and increase the stakes for financial and reputational loss. Akamai API security wins in Q3 included a $7 million contract for API security with 1 of Europe's most important banks. As part of a $31 million multiyear commitment for security and compute. Adoption of API security as part of a $20 million expansion contract with one of the world's largest airlines.\nAn expansion of API security as part of a $42 million contract across the breadth of our portfolio with one of the world's largest software companies. a $2.6 million contract with one of the largest life insurance groups in Asia, the displacement of a competitor at a FinTech payments provider in Brazil. And we also signed 7-figure contracts for API security with 2 of the 10 largest financial institutions in the U.S. and one of the largest banks in Canada. We're also pleased to note that for the sixth straight year, Akamai has been named customers choice in Gartner's latest Voice of the Customer report for cloud web application and API protection. Akamai was also recognized as customer choice in Gartner's Voice of the Customer report on online fraud detection. Before I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to express my gratitude to our employees for their great work in Q3 and for making Akamai a great place to work. In recognition of your efforts, Glassdoor named Akamai as one of their top 50 best led companies of 2025. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed to say more on our Q3 results and our outlook for Q4 and the year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. I'm pleased to report that we delivered strong third quarter results with total revenue of $1.055 billion, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% in constant currency. We also had another quarter of very strong bottom line performance with non-GAAP EPS of $1.86 per share, up 17% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our strong EPS results were driven by higher-than-expected revenue and strong execution across the board. Moving now to revenue. Compute revenue, which is comprised of the fast-growing cloud infrastructure service or CIS solutions that Tom mentioned earlier, and our other cloud applications, or OCA was $180 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and up 7% in constant currency.\nAs a reminder, in Q3 2024, we recorded a $7 million onetime benefit related to the release of some deferred revenue in conjunction with the expiration of a long-term legacy compute contract. This revenue was part of our other cloud application products, and it had a 5 percentage point impact on a year-over-year total compute revenue growth rate. Total compute revenue was driven by continued strength in CIS. For Q3 2025, CIS revenue was $81 million, accelerating to 39% growth year-over-year as reported and in constant currency a nice step up from approximately 30% growth last quarter. As a result, we continue to expect CIS ARR year-over-year growth in the range of 40% to 45% in constant currency at year-end. Security revenue was $568 million, up 10% year-over-year as reported and 9% in constant currency. Revenue from our high-growth security products, by that, I mean, API security and Zero Trust Enterprise Security was $77 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year and 34% in constant currency.\nGiven the continued strength in our API security business, we now expect to exit 2025 with a run rate of approximately $100 million for that product line on both an as-reported and constant currency basis. Finally, we continue to expect the combined ARR for our high-growth security solutions to increase by 30% to 35% year-over-year in constant currency for 2025. Moving to delivery. Revenue was $306 million, down 4% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. This result was slightly better than expected, marking another quarter of improved trends in our delivery business. International revenue was $525 million, up 9% year-over-year or up 8% in constant currency, representing 50% of our total revenue in Q3. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and positive $8 million on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving to profitability. In Q3, we generated non-GAAP net income of $269 million or $1.86 of earnings per diluted share, up an impressive 17% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency and $0.20 above the high end of our guidance range. Finally, our Q3 CapEx was $224 million or 21% of revenue as we continue to invest in our fast-growing CIS business. Moving to cash and our capital allocation strategy. As of September 30, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.8 billion. During the third quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.\nAs a reminder, year-to-date, we spent $800 million to buy back approximately 10 million shares, marking the largest annual buyback in our history. As it relates to our use of capital, our intentions remain the same to continue buying back shares over time to offset dilution from employee equity programs and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases when market and business conditions warrant. Before I provide our Q4 and full year 2025 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, as in prior year, seasonality plays a significant role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Typically, we see higher than normal traffic from our large media customers and a pickup in seasonal online retail activity from our e-commerce customers. However, both are difficult to predict. Second, regarding Q4 operating expenses, as is typical for our business, we expect it to be higher than in Q3.\nThe main driver is the seasonal jump in sales commissions as our most successful reps achieve their annual quota accelerators. Finally, on July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act was signed into law, introducing significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions international tax framework modifications and it restored some business tax benefits. This new legislation, however, has not had a material impact on our tax rate in 2025. With those factors in mind, I'll move to our Q4 guidance. For Q4, we are projecting revenue in the range of $1.065 billion to $1.085 billion, up 4% to 6% as reported and up 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q4 2024. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $5 million impact on Q4 compared to Q3 levels and a positive $11 million impact year-over-year. And for the full year, at current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a positive $13 million impact on revenue in 2025 on a year-over-year basis.\nAt these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $322 million to $331 million. We expect Q4 EBITDA margin to be approximately 42% to 43%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $143 million to $145 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 30% for Q4. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $171 million to $181 million. This represents approximately 16% of our total projected revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.65 to $1.85. This non-GAAP guidance assumes taxes of $57 million to $60 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18% to 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 147 million shares.\nOur complete guidance for full year 2025 is available in today's press release, but let me walk you through the highlights for now. For the full year, we expect total revenue to grow 4% to 5% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% and EPS in the range of $6.93 to $7.13. In closing, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our cloud infrastructure service and high-growth security solutions. We are very excited about the potential of the Akamai inference Cloud as we extend AI to the edge. With that, I'll wrap things up. And Tom and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Stoutenberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. .\nSpeaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including those regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. The factors include, but are not limited to, any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisition, geopolitical developments, and other risk factors identified in our filings with the SEC. The statements included on today's call represent the company's views on August 7, 2025 and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. I'm pleased to report that Akamai had an excellent second quarter with results coming in above our guidance for revenue, margin and earnings per share. Revenue grew to $1.043 billion, up 7% year-over-year as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. And non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.73, up 9% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency and $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range. .\nOur strong performance was enabled by the stabilization of revenue from our delivery product line, combined with the solid growth of our security and compute product lines, as we continue to reposition Akamai to take advantage of the tailwinds in these markets and the substantial opportunities associated with AI.\nI'm especially excited about the growth and opportunity we're seeing for our cloud infrastructure services portfolio. CIS revenue in Q2 was $71 million and grew at 30% year-over-year as reported and 29% in constant currency. We're projecting even faster growth throughout the remainder of the year as we start recognizing revenue from some large deals signed earlier this year.\nAs a reminder, our cloud infrastructure services portfolio consists of the compute and storage solutions that we've developed based on Land, along with our edge workers product and the ISV solutions running on our cloud platform. It's the high-growth portion of our cloud computing product line, and it's where we're focusing our investments. Our rapid growth in cloud infrastructure services is driven in part by our customers' desire to get their compute instances closer to end users for improved scalability and performance and by their need to reduce cost. This is particularly true for new Gen AI applications, which are increasingly being used to drive real-time decisions, shape user experiences and power operations.\nTo attract and retain customers, businesses are developing a variety of AI-based apps and agents for personalization, support, search, inference and other tasks. Akamai's globally distributed platform spanning more than 4,300 points of presence across 130 countries offers unique advantages for deploying such AI applications bringing business logic and data to within milliseconds of end users globally and operating at a scale that provides a petabyte per second of throughput capacity.\nAlready, customers have deployed AI-powered applications on Akamai Cloud for tasks such as image classification, image optimization, speech to text and speech to image chatbots, inference engines, virtual fitting rooms to name a few. Last month, we introduced our new AI gateway solution to customers at an event in London. This new solution is designed to address 3 of the biggest challenges that businesses encounter when they deploy large language models, AI that's too slow, too vulnerable to attack and too expensive to run at scale.\nAI Gateway acts as a smart traffic controller that sits between users and the AI services deployed by our customers. So now instead of every AI request having to travel all the way to a centralized server, Akamai makes it possible to handle many of these requests closer to the user at the edge. Moving AI closer to the action makes each interaction faster makes our customers' systems more energy and cost efficient and ultimately allows our customers to deliver a vastly better experience for their users.\nThe edge is also where Akamai deploys our security solutions, including our new firewall for AI that fights prompt abuse and model compromise as well as our bot and abuse solutions that help our publishing customers monetize their content by monitoring and controlling access by AI scraper bots. AI Gateway and firewall for AI are prime examples of how we're bringing our expertise at the edge to the cloud to make AI faster, more secure and significantly more affordable. There are also good examples of the synergy between our new cloud computing capabilities and our security and delivery product lines as customers buy cloud computing from Akamai alongside security and delivery.\nExamples of the many contracts we signed in Q2 that included a large commit for our cloud infrastructure services, our 3-year $16 million renewal and expansion agreement with one of the largest companies at the forefront of the AI revolution, a 2-year $28 million agreement with 1 of the world's leading travel companies, a 3-year $18 million deal with a leading Internet platform in South Korea, a $19 million deal with an Internet company in Japan and a 3-year $10 million agreement with one of the world's leading media companies.\nTurning now to security. Security growth was driven in part by the continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution as more enterprises relied on Akamai to meet compliance requirements and to defend against ransomware and data exfiltration malware. Ransomware remains a top financial and reputational risk for enterprises as illustrated by the highly publicized a tax that took down several major retailers in Q2. According to news reports, 1 attack in April on a British retailer impacted operations for at least 3 months.costing the company an estimated $400 million in lost revenue.\nAnd a retailer in the U.S. reported $20 million in lost sales when a cyber attack took down its e-commerce platform during their Memorial Day weekend sale. In a world where attacks are finding new ways to penetrate traditional perimeter defenses, segmentation is the last and most important line of defense for major enterprises.\nAnd our market-leading segmentation solution is making a big difference for our customers. With our sophisticated threat intelligence, we've detected a wide variety of malicious ransomware attacks on commerce companies. And customers who use our segmentation solution we're able to identify these attacks and protect themselves from operational harm and financial loss.\nIn fact, Akamai is the only vendor to be named customer favorite in the new Forrester Wave Zero Trust Platforms Report receiving perfect scores in 3 categories: segmentation and control pricing flexibility and supporting services. Our segmentation wins in Q2 included a $9 million contract for Guardicore with one of the world's leading consumer and commercial insurance providers. After Akamai demonstrated the fastest time to policy across their on-prem, AWS and Azure environments. A $5 million contract with 1 of the world's largest financial services companies, that selected Guardicore after struggling to modernize their environment for Zero Trust to protect aging networks for which they had no visibility and a $3 million contract, 2/3 of which is for Guardicore with one of Japan's leading financial institutions.\nWins and other industries included deals with a leading manufacturer in the U.S., a major steel producer in Asia and a large holding company in Latin America. In Q2, we also continued to see strong interest in our market-leading API security solution. which earned Akamai recognition as a leader in KuppingerCole's Leadership Compass API security and management report released last month. Our API security solution combines very well with our market-leading WAF and bot management solutions to provide a compelling platform for app and API protection for major enterprises.\nMajor API security wins last quarter included a $15 million agreement with one of North America's largest real estate fintech companies, which included $2 million for API security, a $4 million expansion contract with 1 of the largest managed care organizations in North America, which included $2 million for API security. A $2.3 million agreement with one of the largest life insurance providers in India, which included $1.4 million for the protection of their API ecosystem as they migrated away from their previous provider and the $20 million 5-year contract renewal with one of the leading fashion and home retailers in Europe that included 7 Akamai security solutions in addition to compute and delivery.\nWe're very pleased to see customers increasingly utilize the full breadth of our security platform across applications, APIs, infrastructure and enterprise Zero Trust security. We believe this illustrates the strength of Akamai security defenses, the depth of our threat intelligence and our close relationships with enterprise customers who rely on us as a strategic partner in security helping them consolidate their security spending with a major vendor, they trust most to protect their businesses and reputations.\nBefore I turn the call over to Ed, I'd like to say a few words of welcome to the 2 new directors on Akamai's Board, John and Boss Berger. John has held several executive roles at Google including as lead for digital transformation for Google Cloud and Chief of Business Operations. Prior to that, she was a partner at McKinsey & Company. She brings deep expertise in cloud computing cybersecurity and AI as well as general management and strategy consulting experience.\nBoss Berger is the CEO of BT International, the division of the U.K. telco company that delivers global data, voice, security and cloud connectivity solutions to multinational organizations. BOSS brings expertise in leading complex global organizations executing go-to-market initiatives focused on driving customer acquisition, retention and expansion and building strategic partnerships with major technology infrastructure and cybersecurity providers.\nTheir insights and counsel will be invaluable to us as we continue to innovate and expand our cloud computing and cyber security offerings and advance our go-to-market transformation to best capture future growth opportunities.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed to say more in our Q2 results and our outlook for the rest of the year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. As Tom just mentioned, we delivered very solid second quarter results with total Q2 revenue of $1.043 billion, which was up 7% year-over-year as reported and 6% in constant currency. We also had another quarter of very strong bottom line performance with non-GAAP EPS outperforming our guidance range by $0.15.\nThe strong non-GAAP EPS performance was driven by a combination of higher-than-expected revenue, lower-than-expected bandwidth costs, higher interest income related to the convertible debt issuance in May and lower share count as a result of our stock buyback activity in the first half of the year. It's also worth noting that we received an unusually high amount of bandwidth and colocation credits during the quarter, resulting in a onetime positive benefit of approximately $5 million to gross margin in the second quarter.\nMoving now to revenue. Compute revenue was $171 million, up 13% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Compute revenue was driven by continued strength in our Cloud Infrastructure Services or CIS. CIS revenue was $71 million, up 30% year-over-year as reported and 29% in constant currency.\nAs Tom noted, we expect the growth rate of our CIS business to accelerate throughout the rest of this year and into next year, driven by some large contracts signed earlier this year that will start generating revenue late this year and into 2026 and beyond. We continue to expect CIS ARR year-over-year growth in the range of 40% to 45% in constant currency at the end of the year. Revenue from other cloud applications, or OCA, was $100 million, up 4% year-over-year as reported and up 3% in constant currency.\nAs we mentioned on our Q4 call in February, OCA includes many of our more mature compute products such as image and video manager, cloudlets and legacy net storage. We expect the revenue from OCA to remain relatively flat quarter-over-quarter for the rest of this year. However, as a result of a $7 million onetime benefit included in Q3 2024s results. We anticipate that the year-over-year revenue growth rate for OCA will take a onetime dip in Q3.\nAs a reminder, this onetime benefit was related to the release of some deferred revenue in conjunction with the expiration of a long-term legacy compute contract. Putting this all together, we remain very excited about our opportunities for compute. Based on the timing of revenue recognition for the larger deals I mentioned earlier, our compute growth for 2025 could be a little less than our goal of approximately 15% in constant currency for the full year.\nSecurity revenue was $552 million, up 11% year-over-year as reported and 10% in constant currency. Within security, the combined revenue for API security and Zero Trust Enterprise Security was $67 million, up 48% year-over-year as reported and 49% in constant currency. These results include approximately $8 million of inorganic revenue from no name.\nExcluding this inorganic contribution, year-over-year revenue growth would have been approximately 32%.\nWe continue to expect security revenue growth of approximately 10% in constant currency in 2025 and we continue to expect the combined ARR for our Zero Trust Enterprise and API security solutions to increase by 30% to 35% year-over-year in constant currency for 2025.\nDelivery revenue was $320 million, down 3% year-over-year as reported and down 4% in constant currency, well above our expectations. We're very encouraged by the continued improvements in both pricing and traffic growth we observed during the first half of the year. International revenue was $516 million, up 10% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency representing 49% of our total revenue in Q2. U.S. foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $17 million on a sequential basis a positive $8 million impact on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving now to profitability. In Q2, we generated non-GAAP net income of $251 million or $1.73 of earnings per diluted share, up 9% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency and $0.15 above the high end of our guidance range based on the items I mentioned earlier. Finally, our Q2 CapEx was $214 million or 21% of revenue.\nMoving to cash and our capital allocation strategy. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.6 billion. As a reminder, during the second quarter, we used cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility to fully repay $1.15 billion of our outstanding convertible senior notes that matured on May 1, 2025.\nFollowing this repayment, we issued $1.725 billion in senior convertible notes with the maturity date of May 15, 2033, with a coupon of 25 basis points. As part of the offering, we incurred net cost of $275 million from note hedging and warrant transactions while concurrently spending $300 million on stock buybacks.\nIt's worth noting that in the second quarter, we used approximately $250 million of the proceeds from this offering to pay off prior borrowings on our revolving credit facility. The net proceeds of approximately $900 million from this offering have been invested in highly liquid marketable securities currently yielding approximately 4% on a weighted average basis.\nAs it relates to return on capital, as I just mentioned, we spent approximately $300 million to buy back approximately 3.9 million shares during the second quarter. We ended the second quarter with approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Year-to-date, we spent $800 million to buy back approximately 10 million shares.\nGoing forward, our intention remains the same to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases when market and business conditions warrant. Before I provide our Q3 and full year 2025 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items.\nFirst, despite initial concerns, the likelihood of a complete tick talk ban in the U.S. appears to be less likely -- with this in mind, we are now including domestic revenue from TikTok in our Q3 and full year 2025 revenue guidance. Second, regarding compute revenue. As I mentioned earlier, last year's Q3 results included a onetime $7 million benefit that will not reoccur in Q3 2025.\nThird, as it relates to gross margin, we are projecting an increase in colocation and related costs, starting in Q3. as we anticipate additional compute capacity coming online during the quarter. This will result in roughly a 1 percentage point increase in cost of revenue in Q3 compared to Q2.\nIn addition, for our qualified compute partner sales, or QCP, we occasionally bundle third-party products as part of a total solution for customers. In certain situations, we must record the gross revenue from these sales and the associated costs. The gross margin on the partner resales is typically lower than our company gross margin. Therefore, as qualified compute partner revenue increases, we expect it will lower our overall gross margin. We anticipate the sales of QCP Partner Solutions will impact gross margins by approximately 70 basis points this year.\nIt's worth noting the primary advantage of working with QCP partners is their solutions do help drive additional higher-margin CIS revenue. Fourth, as we previously discussed, we are investing to strengthen our go-to-market approach. We're increasing our sales rep hunting capacity to be more proactive in finding and securing new business and we're adding experienced specialists to help support the sales of our new security and compute products.\nIn addition, we're also growing our channel organization to expand our partnerships and open up potential new revenue growth opportunities. These investments are crucial to our long-term success, but it will take time for the incremental headcount to ramp and start delivering results. As a result, we anticipate that our operating margin in the second half of the year will be lower than in the first half.\nFinally, on July 4, 2025, President Trump signed into law the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The act includes significant provisions such as the permanent extension of certain existing provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of favorable tax treatment for certain business provisions.\nThe new legislation has multiple effective dates with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. We are in the process of evaluating the act, but we do not expect it will have a material impact on our tax rate in 2025.\nSo those factors in mind, I'll move to our Q3 guidance. For Q3, we are projecting revenue in the range of $1.035 billion to $1.050 billion or up 3% to 4% as reported and up 2% to 4% in constant currency over Q3 2024. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $3 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels a positive $6 million impact year-over-year.\nAt these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $327 million to $332 million. We expect Q3 EBITDA margin of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $138 million to $141 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% and for Q3. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $227 million to $237 million. This represents approximately 22% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.62 to $1.66.\nThis non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes taxes of $54 million to $55 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 145 million shares.\nTurning to the full year. For 2025, we now expect revenue of $4.15 billion to $4.205 billion, which is up 4% to 5% as reported and 3% to 5% in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a positive $13 million impact on revenue in 2025 on a year-over-year basis.\nFor 2025, we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% as measured in today's FX rates. We anticipate that our full year CapEx will be approximately 20% of total revenue. And for the full year 2025, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $6.60 to $6.80. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 147 million shares.\nIn closing, we're very encouraged by our strong first half financial performance marked by solid results across both the top and bottom lines.\nWith that, I'll wrap things up. And Tom and I are happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Stoutenberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nGood afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including those regarding revenue and earnings guidance, along with our business outlook, 3- to 5-year goals and longer-term targets. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements.\nThe factors include but are not limited to any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisition, geopolitical developments and any other risk factors identified in our filings with the SEC. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's views on February 20, 2025. Akamai undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. Also, as part of our ongoing commitment to transparency, we've enhanced our disclosures to provide investors with a more comprehensive understanding of our business.\nThis quarter, we've created a new presentation available in the Investor Relations section of our website, offering a bit more information on our product portfolios, financials and performance goals. This presentation supplements the information in our earnings release and annual filings, and we encourage you to review it. Within the presentation, you'll find an overview of select revenue and year-over-year revenue and growth rates. Please note, all growth rate percentages are reported on a constant currency basis.\nWith that, I'll now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. As you can see in today's press release, Akamai delivered solid performance in the fourth quarter. with revenue coming in at $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share coming in well above our guidance range at $1.66. I'm also pleased to report that we made excellent progress on our multiyear journey to transform Akamai from a CDN pioneer into the cybersecurity and cloud computing company that powers and protects business online.\nFor the first time in Akamai's history, Security delivered the majority of our annual revenue in 2024, surpassing the $2 billion threshold and growing at 16% year-over-year. Our cloud computing portfolio recorded $630 million in revenue last year, growing 25% over 2023. The portion of this revenue derived from our cloud infrastructure services was $230 million, up 32% over 2023.\nOur cloud infrastructure services primarily consists of the compute and storage solutions that we've developed based on Linode. They also include our edge workers product and ISV solutions running on our cloud platform. Combined, security and compute accounted for 2/3 of Akamai revenue in 2024, growing 18% year-over-year. And we exceeded all our year-end annualized revenue run rate or ARR goals for the fastest-growing areas of the business, namely for our Guardicore platform, our API security solution, and enterprise revenue for our cloud infrastructure services. These are 3 of the key areas that we anticipate will drive revenue acceleration for our overall business in 2026 and beyond.\nIn the area of security, Akamai has expanded into new adjacent markets, growing beyond point solutions to provide a more holistic and comprehensive security offering. This has enabled us to expand our customer base and to better serve enterprises with a broader portfolio for protecting infrastructure, applications, APIs and user interactions in both cloud and on-prem environments. Security growth in Q4 was driven by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution as more enterprises relied on Akamai to defend against malware and ransomware. The Guardicore platform ended the year with an ARR of $190 million up 31% year-over-year and surpassing our goal of $180 million.\nIn Q4, we signed our largest deployment to date for Guardicore with a leading IT services company in India. The solution covers 30,000 servers and nearly 300,000 endpoints. We also displaced a competitor segmentation offering that was falling short at major banks, both Hong Kong and in the U.S. More than 80% of our segmentation revenue in 2024 came through channel partners, including one of the world's leading SIs, Deloitte, which wraps its services and implementation expertise around our segmentation and API security products to create value for customers that Deloitte knows well. Together, in Q4, we won a $5.8 million contract with Petrobras in Brazil to reduce the risk of a breach and ransomware attacks. We also partnered with Deloitte to help defend 2 large European banks from API risks.\nIn Q4, Akamai also signed a large contract for API security with one of the biggest asset managers and brokerage firms in the U.S. Our API security solution ended 2024 with an ARR of $57 million, up from just $1 million at the end of 2023 and exceeding our goal of $50 million. Taken together, our API security solution and Guardicore platform ended 2024 with $247 million of ARR. As we look ahead, we expect to generate continued strong growth for these products with a goal of increasing their combined ARR by 30% to 35% during the year.\nWe also anticipate that over the next several years, the rapid growth and more meaningful amount of revenue from these new products will help offset the slower growth of our more widely adopted and market-leading web app firewall and DDoS mitigation products. As a result and as noted in our supplemental disclosure that Mark mentioned a few minutes ago, we believe that we can maintain a CAGR of about 10% in constant currency for our security products over the next 3 to 5 years with typical M&A. This would bring us to more than $3 billion in security revenue by the end of the decade.\nWhile our security product line is performing very well, our compute product line is growing even faster and has a much larger addressable market. We've come a long way since we expanded into the cloud computing market in 2022 with the acquisition of Linode. And we made a lot of progress last year, achieving what we set out to do in revenue growth, signing new enterprise customers, infrastructure deployment, product development, partner ecosystem expansion and migrating our own applications from hyperscalers to the Akamai cloud.\nWe continue to sign compute customers at a rapid pace in Q4 and including 2 financial software companies in the U.S., 2 of the largest retailers in the U.S., a cybersecurity provider in Europe, an enterprise software company in Asia, one of the largest banks in Southeast Asia and an intelligent transportation system provider in Latin America. When we measure the progress of our cloud infrastructure services, we've been looking at the results through 2 lenses. Our primary lens is the uptake of these solutions by larger enterprise customers, such as those doing over $100,000 in ARR. The second lens is looking at the performance of these products across customers of all sizes.\nAt year-end, approximately 300 enterprises were spending at least $100,000 in ARR for our cloud infrastructure services, up significantly from the year before. Collectively, these customers finished the year with an ARR of $115 million for our cloud infrastructure services, far exceeding our goal of $100 million. When you include all customers, the ARR for our cloud infrastructure services finished 2024 at $259 million, up 35% year-over-year. This is a substantial improvement from when we acquired Linode in 2022 when the ARR from these services was approximately $127 million and was growing in the mid-teens.\nIn addition to enabling customer growth, our work to make Linode be enterprise grade has allowed us to move some of our most important products from hyperscalers to Akamai's Cloud. This has resulted in improved performance and savings of well over $100 million per year. Many of our customers have also significantly expanded their use of our cloud infrastructure services over the last year, some by a factor of 4x or more. By year-end, 15 customers were spending over $1 million in ARR for our cloud infrastructure services, more than triple the number from 2023. And today, we announced our first customer to sign a contract committing to spend more than $100 million for our cloud infrastructure services over the next several years. We believe this is a remarkable validation of our new cloud capabilities, signaling that an extremely sophisticated buyer of cloud services is confident in our ability to execute and provide a level of service and performance comparable to or better than the hyperscalers.\nThe recent improvements that we've made to our cloud platform will enable us to do even more enterprise customers in 2025. For example, in the last year, we expanded Akamai's core data center footprint to 41 locations in 36 cities around the world. Next week, we plan to announce that we've enabled our new managed container service in our 4,300-plus points of presence in more than 700 cities around the world. We're currently testing this service with customer workloads in over 100 cities. We've significantly upgraded our object storage solution with a 5x increase in scalability and a 10x increase in performance, making it comparable to the hyperscalers but with much lower egress fees due to the efficiencies of our unique edge platform.\nWe added GPUs for a variety of AI and media use cases One customer ran a proof of concept between Akamai and a hyperscaler and then chose Akamai for text to image AI inferencing workloads. Another customer uses our cloud for AI-powered speech recognition for its in-vehicle voice assistant. And an OTT provider switched from a hyperscaler to Akamai to provide a more cost-effective platform for its ad-supported streaming TV service. We enhanced the scale and security of our Linode Kubernetes engine product. Traditional cloud providers run Kubernetes platforms from a relatively small number of core data centers. Akamai's differentiated approach will combine the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of our edge to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider.\nBuilding on technology that we acquired from Red Cubes last year, we released the Akamai app platform to enable developers to build and deploy highly distributed applications in just a few clicks. And we added 9 compute ISV partners last year, bringing our total to 23. Our ISV partners accounted for $36 million of cloud infrastructure services ARR at year-end. We're very excited about our opportunity for continued strong growth as we bring the power of compute to the edge with our broadly deployed network getting compute instances closer to end users with an open platform that ensures flexibility and portability, orchestrated resource deployment to ensure efficient scaling and operations and predictable pricing with an unmatched ability to minimize egress costs.\nI think our rapid progress in cloud computing has summed up well in an evaluation of public cloud platforms released last month by IDC. Their worldwide public cloud marketscape for IAS identified Akamai as a major player relative to industry peers, saying \"Akamai has accelerated its journey into the public cloud IAS space. transforming from a pure-play CDN provider into a formidable public cloud competitor. In addition, Gartner positioned Akamai as an emerging leader for Gen AI specialized infrastructure in their recent innovation guide for generative AI technologies. As we noted in the supplemental materials Mark mentioned, we're supporting a growing number of AI use cases with a special focus on inferencing. While it's still early days, we're excited about the long-term revenue opportunity, and we believe that the unique properties of Akamai's Cloud position us to be a major player in AI inferencing in the years to come.\nAs we look forward to the rest of 2025, our goal is to grow our total cloud infrastructure services ARR by 40% to 45% in constant currency. We believe that the accelerating growth of our cloud infrastructure services revenue will be driven primarily by enterprise customers. Given the great success that we're having with our cloud infrastructure services, we plan to focus more of our compute investments in this area. In particular, we're in the process of migrating some of our older cloud applications for tasks such as visitor prioritization, image and video management and live streaming workflow to ISV partners who specialize in these areas, and we plan to move some or all of their workloads to Akamai's cloud.\nIn addition to converting former competitors into important ISV partners for our cloud, we believe this transition will enable us to focus more of our internal resources on further development and expansion of our cloud infrastructure services. The transition also means that we expect that the revenue from some of our cloud applications will decline in 2025. And as Ed will discuss shortly that we're projecting about 15% growth for our cloud computing solutions as a whole in 2025. As our cloud infrastructure services revenue continues to rapidly increase, we believe that we can reaccelerate the overall cloud computing revenue growth rate to achieve a CAGR of at least 20% on over the next 3 to 5 years in constant currency. This would make cloud computing our third $1 billion product line by 2027.\nI'll next talk about content delivery which continues to be an important generator of profit that we use to develop new products to fuel our future growth. Our unique edge platform with over 4,300 points of presence in over 700 cities continues to be a major differentiator in terms of lowering our costs, enabling massive scale and providing superior performance. And this is true not only for delivery but also for security and compute. In security, we use the platform to provide a massive shield against all sorts of attacks without impacting performance or raising costs. And in compute, we use the platform to provide function as a service with our edge workers product. And as we'll announce next week, we'll also use the same platform to run our new managed container service in thousands of pops across hundreds of cities. This capability is unique in the market, and it will enable our customers to get their compute workloads much closer to users.\nAkamai achieved substantial cost synergies by using the same physical server to support our delivery, security and now compute services in over 4,300 POPs and 700 cities. It's a unique capability and a key reason why Akamai has been so profitable while many of our competitors have struggled. Our installed base of delivery customers also continues to be a key contributor to our growth in security and cloud computing. As we harvest the competitive and performance advantages of offering delivery, security and compute as a bundle on the same platform. That synergy works especially well for our security and compute customers that want delivery as a feature and see it as critical to their relationship with us over other vendors.\nIn Q4, we signed many deals that included security and compute solutions alongside our best-in-class delivery. And we won back delivery business for competitors at one of the leading tech players in AI and as a leading player in streaming media. And in December, we acquired select customer contracts from Egeo to offer their customers our market-leading delivery services and the opportunity to take advantage of Akamai's full range of security and cloud solutions.\nI'm pleased to report that we're beginning to see signs of improvement in the delivery marketplace with more customers willing to sign multiyear contracts with predictable pricing, a more stable pricing environment generally and early signs of stabilizing traffic growth. As a result, and as Ed will discuss in a few minutes, we now expect to see the year-over-year decline in delivery revenue shrink to about 10% this year. If the favorable trends hold, we should see the decline in delivery revenue continued to lessen in 2026 and beyond.\nAs we noted in our call last May, our largest customer is navigating political challenges and is pursuing a DIY strategy. As a result, we expect that the revenue from this customer will produce a headwind of about 1% to 2% per year on our overall revenue growth rate for the next couple of years before stabilizing at a level similar to some of our hyperscaler customers, which would be about 2% to 3% of our total revenue. That said, I'm pleased to report that we entered into a 5-year committed relationship with this customer in Q4 and that includes a substantial minimum annual spend, which provides greater predictability and which reduces our exposure to their political situation in the U.S.\nWhile we're pleased with the progress that we made last year on our multiyear transformation journey, we still have work to do to reach more new customers and to cross-sell our new capabilities in security and cloud computing to our installed base. To drive greater top line growth over the next 3 to 5 years, we're transforming our go-to-market strategy to align more resources with the higher growth segments of our business and to accelerate the pace at which we add new customers. In particular, we've already begun to raise the ratio of hunters to farmers and sales and to increase the number of specialized sellers and presales resources that support sales of our Guardicore platform, API security and cloud infrastructure services. We're also investing more in partner enablement as the channel has become a major source of revenue growth for us.\nBased on advice from one of the world's top consulting firms, we're also embarking on a major project to optimize our sales operating model, account coverage framework, compensation structure, pricing strategy and the way that we leverage our channel partner ecosystem. As we disclosed in the supplemental forecast posted on Akamai's Investor Relations website, we believe that the combination of double-digit security growth, very fast growth in cloud computing, a stabilizing delivery business and a constantly improving product mix should enable us to accelerate revenue growth in the years ahead and to achieve double-digit revenue growth by the end of the decade, if not sooner.\nIn fact, if you remove the impact of foreign exchange headwinds in the large customer I mentioned earlier, you can see that the acceleration is already underway. Excluding these 2 factors, revenue growth accelerated in 2024 over 2023. And as Ed will describe shortly, we anticipate further acceleration in 2025.\nWe believe that improving our top line growth and product mix, combined with our continued efforts to improve efficiency, will help to improve operating margins. so that we can meet and then exceed our goal of 30% over the next several years. We also believe that we can resume growing our non-GAAP EPS in 2026. While we still have much to do, we're very optimistic about the future. Our cloud computing strategy is taking hold as we envisioned. Our expanded security portfolio is enabling us to deepen and expand our relationships with customers and partners. And we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also maintaining strong profitability.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our results and our outlook. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Before I begin, I want to reiterate what Mark mentioned at the start of the call, and highlight some of the new disclosures we issued earlier today. The materials we posted to the IR section of our website include a bit more detail than what we will cover in today's prepared remarks. Our aim is to provide deeper insights into our business and present our updated long-term goals. While we do not intend to provide this level of disclosure every quarter, we will occasionally offer additional context if we believe it will be helpful.\nToday, I plan to cover our Q4 results, provide some color on 2025, including a few new disclosures and then cover our Q1 and full year 2025 guidance and I will close with our long-term thoughts on revenue and profitability goals. Now let's cover our Q4 results, starting with revenue.\nTotal revenue was $1.020 billion, up 3% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We continue to see solid growth in our compute and security portfolios during the fourth quarter. Edgio contributed approximately $9 million of revenue in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Compute revenue grew to $167 million, ,a 24% year-over-year increase as reported and 25% in constant currency. In the fourth quarter, Compute revenue was comprised of $65 million from our cloud infrastructure services and $102 million from our other cloud applications. As Tom pointed out, one of our largest customers has committed to spending at least $100 million on our cloud infrastructure services over the next few years. We expect that their workloads will begin ramping up by the end of 2025.\nMoving to security revenue. Security revenue was $535 million, growing 14% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. During Q4, we had approximately $12 million of onetime license revenue compared to $5 million in Q4 of last year. As noted in our added disclosure, our security revenue was comprised of $205 million from Zero Trust Enterprise plus API security, which grew 51% in constant currency year-over-year and $1.84 billion from all other security products, which grew 14% in constant currency year-over-year. Combined, compute and security revenue grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 17% in constant currency in Q4 and now represents 69% of total revenue.\nOur delivery revenue was $318 million, slightly ahead of our expectations and down 18% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We anticipate an improvement in delivery revenue in 2025 driven by a more positive outlook on delivery, as Tom discussed earlier. International revenue was $490 million, up 2% year-over-year or 4% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q4. Finally, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $8 million on a sequential basis and a negative $6 million impact on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving to profitability. In Q4, we generated non-GAAP net income of $254 million or $1.66 in earnings per diluted share, down 2% year-over-year, flat in constant currency and well above the high end of our guidance range. These EPS results exceeded our guidance driven primarily by slightly higher-than-expected revenue lower-than-expected transition services or TSA costs related to the Edgio transaction, greater savings from the head count actions we announced in Q3 and lower payroll costs due to some hiring pushing from Q4 into Q1. Finally, our Q4 CapEx was $193 million or 19% of revenue.\nMoving to our capital allocation strategy. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $138 million to buy back approximately 1.4 million shares. For the full year, we spent $557 million to buy back approximately 5.6 million shares. We ended 2024 with approximately $2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. It's worth noting that over the past decade, we have not only met our objective of buying back shares to offset dilution from our employee equity programs, but we have also decreased our shares outstanding by approximately 16% over that time frame. Going forward, our capital allocation strategy remains the same: to continue buying back shares over time, to offset dilution from employee equity programs and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I move to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight to help with your 2025 models. The first relates to revenue from the Edgio transaction. we now expect approximately $85 million to $105 million in Edgio revenue for 2025. In addition, we expect to have approximately $6 million of TSA costs in Q1 related to Edgio. Approximately $4 million of those costs will be included in cost of goods sold and the remainder in operating expense. We do not anticipate any TSA costs beyond Q1.\nSecond, we expect our CapEx to be approximately 2 percentage points higher than last year for the following reasons. First, we plan to increase spend by about 1% of revenue to accommodate the increased traffic resulting from the Edgio transaction. Second, we anticipate approximately another 1% of revenue will be used for a geo-specific infrastructure builds to support the recently signed $100 million cloud infrastructure services contract we announced earlier today. Additionally, we expect our CapEx spend will be heavily front-end loaded with the first quarter seeing significantly higher expenditures compared to the rest of the year. This is due in part to the items I mentioned above in our plans to pull forward approximately $10 million to $15 million of CapEx into the first quarter to help mitigate the risk of potential tariffs that may be announced later this year.\nThird, we expect interest income to decline in 2025 due to lower cash balances resulting from recent acquisitions and our plan to retire our $1.15 billion convertible debt instrument that matures on May 1, 2025, along with expected lower investment yields as interest rates come down throughout the year. Fourth, for 2025 we anticipate continued heightened volatility in foreign currency markets driven by unpredictable timing and magnitude of Federal Reserve policy changes and their impact on interest rates.\nAs an example of how impactful FX can be to our results. since our last earnings call in early November, the strength of the U.S. dollar has negatively impacted our 2025 expectations by approximately in revenue on an annual basis and negatively impacted our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 basis points and negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS expectations by approximately $0.09 per share. As a reminder, related to currency, we have approximately $1.2 billion of annual revenue that is generated from foreign currency with the euro, yen and great British pound being the largest non-U.S. dollar sources of revenue. In addition, our costs in non-U.S. dollars tend to be significantly lower than revenue and are primarily in Indian rupee is really checked and Polish lumpy.\nFifth and finally, as Tom mentioned and illustrated in our supplemental disclosure, the traction that we are seeing in our business is being obscured by the challenges facing our largest customer and the significant FX fluctuations. If we exclude the effect of this customer in FX, our revenue growth rate would have accelerated year-over-year in 2024 compared to 2023.\nNow moving to guidance. For the first quarter of 2025, we are projecting revenue in the range of $1 billion to $1.02 billion, up 1% to 3% as reported or up 3% to 5% in constant currency over Q1 2024. We anticipate that Q1 revenue levels will be slightly lower than Q4 due to the following: lower revenue from our largest customer, as we discussed earlier, the negative impact of foreign exchange, reduced onetime license revenue in Q1 from Q4 levels. Two, fewer calendar days in Q1 compared to Q4, that's 2 less days of usage revenue. And finally, a significant number of delivery customers have calendar year-end dates on their contracts. Therefore, the aggregate impact of all those renewals tends to have a negative impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels. Note that we expect these items will be partially offset by a full quarter's benefit from Edgio.\nAt current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $7 million impact on Q1 compared to Q4 levels and a negative $15 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 72%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $310 million to $316 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margin of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense of $132 million to $134 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28%. And with this overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.54 to $1.59, we are down 6% to 3% as reported and down 2% to up 1% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $57 million to $59 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $237 million to $245 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 24% of total revenue. As noted earlier, we anticipate that our CapEx spending will be heavily front-end loaded with the first quarter seeing significantly high expenditures compared to the rest of the year. Looking ahead to the full year. We expect revenue of $4 billion to $4.2 billion, which is flat to up 5% as reported and up 1% to 6% in constant currency. We are providing a wider range than past practice due to the larger scale of our business the uncertainty around our largest customer and continuing macroeconomic and geopolitical factors.\nWe would expect to come in at the higher end of that range if we see significant weakening of the U.S. dollar, traffic growth materially exceeds our current levels and there is no ban in the U.S. for our largest customer. We would expect to come in at the lower end of this range if we see significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Traffic materially slows from current levels, and our largest customer is band in the U.S.\nMoving on to security. We expect security revenue growth of approximately 10% in constant currency in 2025. In Q4 included in security of the combined ARR for our Zero Trust enterprise and API security solutions was approximately $247 million. We expect the combined ARR of these 2 products to increase by 30% to 35% year-over-year in constant currency for 2025. For compute, we expect revenue growth to be approximately 15% in constant currency. Included in compute, our cloud infrastructure services delivered $259 million in ARR exiting 2024. We expect Cloud Infrastructure Services ARR year-over-year growth in the range of 40% to 45% in constant currency for 2025. At current spot rates, our guidance assumed foreign exchange will have a negative $38 million impact to revenue in 2025 on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving to operating margins. For 2025, we are estimating a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% as measured in today's FX rates. Decline in operating margin for the full year '25 is due mainly to depreciation expense being approximately 90 basis points higher than last year and the negative impact of foreign exchange year-over-year. We anticipate that our full year capital expenditures will be approximately 19% of total revenue, up approximately 2 points from 2024 due to the items that I listed earlier. As a percentage of total revenue, our 2025 CapEx is expected to be roughly broken down as follows: approximately 4% for delivery and security, approximately 6% for compute, approximately 8% for capitalized software and the remainder is for IT and facilities related spending. Moving to EPS. For the full year 2025, we expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $6 to $6.40. This non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 152 million shares.\nBefore closing, I want to comment on our revenue and profitability goals for the next 3 to 5 years. Cloud Infrastructure Services is experiencing significant growth, which we believe will be the main driver of our total compute revenue in the near to medium term. Our goal is to grow total compute revenue at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 20% over the next 3 to 5 years. Moving to security. Given the size and scale in our security business, it is natural that we will see some products reach maturity and experience slowing growth rates, while other products in emerging areas will see more rapid growth.\nAs a result, we expect security growth over the next 3 to 5 years to be led mainly by our newer Guardicore platform and API security products. However, some of our largest security products like Web Application Firewall or WAF and Prolexic, are examples of some of our more mature products. We've been offering these products for over a decade and have reached a very high penetration rate within our customer base. As a result, we expect the growth rate for these products to begin slowing in 2025 and continue to moderate throughout the remainder of the decade.\nGiven these dynamics in our security portfolio, our goal is to grow total set revenue at an overall compounded annual growth rate of about 10% over the next 3 to 5 years, including our typical level of M&A. We anticipate delivery revenue declines will moderate in 2025 with increasing stabilization expected over the next few years. In summary, we anticipate that the combination of double-digit growth of our security products the rapid expansion in our compute services, a stabilizing delivery business and a continuously improving product mix away from delivery will allow us to achieve double-digit top line revenue growth by the end of the decade, if not sooner. As for profitability, we expect operating margins to reach 30% plus by the end of the decade. And with accelerating top line and expanding operating margins, our goal would be to deliver strong growth in non-GAAP EPS over the next few years. Finally, while we're not providing specific guidance for 2026, we do anticipate revenue acceleration and margin expansion compared to 2025 levels.\nWith that, I'll wrap things up, and Tom and I are happy to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions]\nPlease note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Stoutenberg\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the indication of any acquisition and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K, in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on August 8, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics today. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nI'll now hand the call off to our Co-Founder and CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. I'm pleased to report that in the second quarter, Akamai delivered continued strong momentum in compute, strong growth in our security portfolio, steady operating margins and healthy earnings growth on the bottom line.\nSecond quarter revenue grew to $980 million, up 5% year-over-year as reported and up 6% in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.58, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. These results are in line with or above our guidance.\nBefore I provide more color on our performance, I'd like to review how Akamai is evolving as we grow. As most of you know, Akamai first made its name with the invention of content delivery services, and we're still the world's leader in that market today. We stand out for providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure and near flawless digital experiences. Recent examples were delivering the Euro's football tournament and the summer games in Paris for top broadcasters around the world. As we've said in previous calls, our delivery business has been challenged in recent quarters by macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. Our plan for delivery is threefold.\nFirst, we will remain disciplined when it comes to the profitability of traffic that we choose to serve. Second, we will continue to leverage our market leadership position and installed base of major enterprises to generate cross-selling opportunities. And third, we will continue to take steps to retain our market leadership while also reinvesting most of the cash flow from our delivery product line into the fast-growing areas of the business.\nIn Q2, delivery accounted for 1/3 of our revenue or $329 million. This is quite a change from 5 years ago when delivery accounted for 2/3 of Akamai revenue. The diversification of our revenue across new markets through continuous innovation has long been a core part of Akamai's strategy for long-term profitable revenue growth. A little more than a decade ago, we expanded our business into security with the creation of web app Firewall as a cloud service. We did this to meet what we recognized as a growing customer need. In a way that was complementary to what Akamai was already doing for customers with delivery. The opportunity was clear to us because we listen to our customers. We created what has proved to be a very successful cloud service for web app firewall.\nAnd now for the first time in Akamai history, Security delivered the majority of Akamai's revenue. $499 million in Q2, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. This amounts to an annual run rate of about $2 billion per year. Of course, we greatly expanded our security product set over the years. We now offer market-leading solutions for DDoS prevention, bot management, account and content protection, app and API security and Zero Trust enterprise security led by our Guardicore segmentation solution.\nCustomer interest in our security solutions is strong and we had many significant wins in Q2. One of the world's largest energy companies became a new Zero Trust customer with Akamai. One of the top 3 airlines in the U.S. is moving from a legacy VPN architecture to a Zero Trust architecture with Akamai. We provided Akamai app and API protector to one of the largest providers of HR management software and services in the U.S. and to German retailers to Life, Douglas, [ Bodner ] and [ Zalando ]. [ Epaflex ], the German maker of high-speed industrial doors purchased our segmentation solution as did a major stock exchange and a leading cybersecurity company in Latin America.\nWe provided DDoS protection to one of the largest banks in the world and to a government ministry in the Middle East. And at one major electric utility in Southeast Asia, we replaced a well-known competitor in a 5-year deal for our web app firewall, DDoS protection, bot management, account takeover prevention and API security.\nWe're especially excited about the most recent additions to our security portfolio. In Q2, we announced our new Akamai Guardicore platform. The first of its kind to enable Zero Trust security through a fully integrated combination of micro segmentation, Zero Trust Network access, multifactor authentication, DNS firewall and Threat Hunting. If single agent and unified control console powered by Gen AI are designed to strengthen and simplify enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls. The new Gen AI interface enables our customers' operations teams to ask questions in a human language to gain information about their enterprise networks. The new Akamai Guardicore platform reflects our evolution as a security vendor, growing beyond point solutions to a broader and more comprehensive security offering. Customers tell us they want to consolidate security products and tools with vendors they can trust, and we think this will appeal to their needs.\nIn Q2, we also closed the acquisition of Noname Security, as we accelerate our momentum in the fast-growing API security market. IDC forecast this market will grow at a CAGR of 34% to nearly $1 billion by 2027. With Noname, we believe that Akamai now has one of the most comprehensive API security solutions in the industry. Within 2 weeks of the close, Akamai offered Noname customers, our new Edge connector. And integration with Akamai web app and API protector that works with a click of a button. Noname saw a significant increase in closed deals in Q2, and including wins at some of the largest banks and insurance companies in North America and at leading software companies in Europe and Asia. We're also beginning to see a good upsell motion with early Noname adopters. For example, one of the largest U.S. health care insurers more than doubled their Noname contract in Q2 to over $1.7 million annually.\nAbout a decade after we entered the security market we again expanded Akamai's future opportunity by developing a much broader offering in cloud computing. As many of you know, Akamai has offered function as a service in our Edge platform for many years. This kind of edge computing has been used by thousands of our customers, and it is deeply integrated into our delivery and security services. But our customers ask for more, they wanted us to offer full stack cloud computing so that they can run their VMs and containers on the Akamai platform. And they wanted us to do it in a way that would be more efficient and less costly than comparable offerings provided by the hyperscalers. They wanted Akamai to do this because they were already delivering and securing their sites and apps on our platform. They like our track record of reliability, and they knew they could trust Akamai to be a good partner. Many of them also like the fact that we don't compete against them unlike hyperscalers.\nAdding cloud computing to our portfolio also makes good sense for Akamai. In addition to satisfying customer demand, we can reap the advantages from offering customers delivery, security and compute on the same platform. The synergies include improved performance seamless integration and other operational efficiencies, bundling for cross-selling and strong customer retention, increased margins for all of our services, deepening relationships with carrier networks, capacity to quickly detect and stop massive cyber attacks at the edge, unmatched visibility into enormous volumes of traffic and the security insights and threat intelligence that we gain as a result.\nIf you step back and look at how the marketplace has evolved, you can see how the hyperscalers have worked to achieve a similar suite of offerings, although they've taken a different route to get there. They started with cloud computing and infrastructure as a service and then moved into security and delivery, validating our view that there is synergy in offering customers all 3 together. The hyperscalers also have a more centralized architecture. While Akamai has the world's most distributed cloud platform, with more than 4,100 points of presence in over 700 cities across 130 countries. We believe that being more distributor provides customers with better performance, better economics and greater reliability.\nAs we reported in our last earnings call, the initial response from customers to our new cloud offering has been very encouraging. The strong early momentum that we achieved in Q1 continued in Q2 with compute revenue growing to $151 million, up 23% year-over-year and up 24% in constant currency. New compute customers added in Q2 include one of the world's best known media and entertainment brands based here in the U.S., The [indiscernible] cybersecurity company, [ sequoa.io ]. [ Clare video ], the video brand of the biggest telco in Latin America, [ MWAreTV ], a technology platform for IPTV and OTT services. In a cable satellite IPTV provider that reaches almost half the households in Australia. Customers are also leveraging our ISV partners which we call qualified compute partners to run low latency workloads on our compute platform. These include solutions for observability into workload behavior, cybersecurity and large-scale events where the need to store very large sets of data makes Akamai a more attractive and cost-effective option than competitors.\nOur media customers can now take advantage of a full suite of media workflow offerings on Akamai Connected Cloud which provides valuable synergy with our delivery platform for more efficient image manipulation, decisioning and video transcoding. And with Akamai's latest qualified compute partner and customer [ Yospace ], media companies around the globe can leverage their advanced ad tech and ad strategies at scale across the Akamai Connected Cloud. Customers are also building new apps on our platform where low latency data distribution and processing provides a better user experience for their customers at significantly reduced cost. One customer is training and testing the machine learning engines that power their security scanning product. Another is building an AI-powered chatbot application to improve their customer experience and streamline operations with intelligent conversational customer engagement. Such AI-powered applications are increasingly popular with recent advances in large language models. Akamai is also a very large user of our new cloud solution.\nAs a result of migrating most of our own apps from the hyperscalers to Akamai connected cloud, we're seeing better performance and greatly reduce cost. In fact, we expect to reduce our spending on third-party clouds to less than 1/3 of what it would have been this year and we stayed on the hyperscalers, saving us well over $100 million in annual OpEx. It sure feels good, not writing a 9-figure check to your competitors every year, and this is a feeling that we look forward to providing to our large enterprise customers.\nIn summary, Akamai has undergone a fundamental transformation. We transformed from a content delivery pioneer into the cloud company that powers and protects life online. Compute and Security now generate 2/3 of our revenue, and we believe that they provide Akamai with excellent potential for future growth and profitability. And we've achieved this transformation while successfully maintaining robust margins because both of our fast-growing product areas, our large security portfolio and our rapidly growing cloud computing portfolio, are built upon and enabled by the foundation of our business, our highly efficient and massively distributed delivery platform. Our near-term operating margin goal remains 30%, and we see potential margin upside over time as the fast-growing areas of the business expand our profitability.\nLooking back at the first half of 2024, we're pleased by our strong performance in security and compute. Looking ahead, we're very excited about our potential for future growth as we integrate Noname and is our fast-growing compute offerings continue to gain traction with customers.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q2 results and our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q2 results and then provide some color on our expectations for Q3 and the full year. Turning to our second quarter results. Total revenue for the second quarter was $980 million, up 5% year-over-year as reported and 6% in constant currency. Compute revenue was $151 million, up 23% year-over-year as reported and 24% in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the level of enthusiasm in the market as more and more customers are leveraging our enterprise compute solutions.\nIn particular, we are seeing a broad array of enterprise impute use cases, including live transcoding, secure access, observability, object storage, real-time log aggregation and insight, spatial computing and deep learning AI models across many verticals, including media, e-commerce, software and financial services.\nMoving to security revenue. In the second quarter, Security revenue was $499 million, up 15% year-over-year as reported and 16% in constant currency. We're very pleased by the continued performance of our Guardicore Zero Trust solution and highly encouraged by the traction we are seeing in our recently launched API security solution. It's worth noting that the Noname transaction closed in late June, and the revenue contribution in the second quarter was less than $1 million. Combined, compute and security revenue grew 17% year-over-year as reported and 18% in constant currency, representing 66% of total revenue.\nMoving to delivery. Revenue was $329 million, which declined 13% year-over-year as reported and 12% in constant currency. The decline in delivery revenue was primarily related to the revenue impacting items that I outlined last quarter and was in line with our expectations. International revenue was $471 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 5% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q2. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $5 million on a sequential basis and a negative $10 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $243 million or $1.58 of earnings per diluted share, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. And our non-GAAP operating margin in Q2 was 29%.\nMoving now to cash and our use of capital. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.9 billion. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $128 million, repurchasing approximately 1.4 million shares. We now have an aggregate of roughly $2.3 billion remaining in our share buyback authorization. We also used approximately $450 million in cash in the second quarter for the acquisition of Noname. As it relates to our use of capital, our intention remains the same to continue buying back shares over time to offset dilution from employee equity programs and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I provide our Q3 and updated full year 2024 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, regarding the close of the Noname Security acquisition. We expect this transaction to add approximately $8 million to $10 million of revenue in Q3 and approximately $18 million to $20 million in revenue for the full year 2024. We also expect it to be dilutive to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.04 to $0.05 for the full year 2024 and to be dilutive to non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 to 40 basis points in 2024. As a reminder, our updated full year guidance includes the impact of the acquisition.\nSecond, and specific to traffic. We expect a modest uptick in year-over-year traffic in Q3, primarily due to the Paris Summer Games. This event is expected to drive approximately $3 million to $4 million of additional revenue in the third quarter. And while Q4 is typically our strongest quarter seasonally, we saw a more muted impact of that seasonality last year, and we expect to see a similar result this year.\nThird, the country of India recently announced plans to eliminate its digital service tax effective as of August 1, 2024. We are working with our tax advisers to determine the full impact of this tax change on our non-GAAP effective tax rate. Based on our initial tax assessment, we believe this could result in a small increase in our effective non-GAAP tax rate, and we have adjusted our guidance accordingly.\nFinally, the macroeconomic environment remains challenging, and geopolitical tensions persist. Any negative developments could have a meaningful impact on our business. So with those factors in mind, I'll move our Q3 guidance.\nFor Q3, we're projecting revenue in the range of $988 to $1.008 billion were up 2% to 4% as reported and 3% to 5% in constant currency for Q3 2023. The current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels, a negative $5 million impact year-over-year. At the revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $307 million to $312 million. We expect Q3 EBITDA margin of approximately 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $129 million to $131 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q3.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend $166 million to $174 million. This represents approximately 17% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.56 to $1.62. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $59 million to $60 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19%, 20%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 154 million shares.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.970 to $4.010 billion, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as reported and up 5% to 6% in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $20 million impact to revenue in 2024 on a year-over-year basis. We continue to expect security revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024, including the contribution from the acquisition of [ El ]. And given the strong momentum in adoption from both new and existing enterprise compute customers, we now expect Enterprise Compute annualized revenue run rate to double from the $50 million we reported last quarter to over $100 million as we exit 2024. As a result, we are now increasing our overall expected compute revenue growth to approximately 23% to 25% in constant currency for the full year 2024.\nMoving to profitability. We estimate non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%, non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.34 to $6.47. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 20% a fully diluted share count of approximately 154 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of total revenue.\nIn closing, we are pleased with the traction we are seeing in enterprise compute and look forward to helping our customers migrate services to the Akamai Connected Cloud. Thank you.\nTom and I would now be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mark Stoutenberg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nMark Stoutenberg\n\nHead-Investor Relations, CenturyLink, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical development.\nAdditional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 9, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nI will now hand the call off to our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mark. Akamai got off to a strong start for the year with our security and compute portfolios, and we continue to experience industry headwinds with our delivery product line. .\nFirst quarter revenue grew to $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.64, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. The fast-growing parts of our business, security and cloud computing grew to represent almost 2/3 of total revenue in Q1. And combined, they grew 22% over Q1 of 2023. The continued shift in Akamai's revenue mix towards security and compute is a clear indicator that our growth strategy is achieving the intended results. We continue to successfully leverage the market leadership and cash flow of our delivery product line to invest in our faster growing and more profitable security and cloud computing portfolios. And we're excited about the opportunity we have ahead of us, especially with our planned acquisition of Noname Security, which we announced this week, I'll say more about no name in a minute.\nBut first, looking at our security portfolio more broadly. Security revenue grew 21% year-over-year in Q1 to $491 million, driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution. Customers who purchased segmentation from Akamai in Q1 included one of the top telcos in the U.S., a supermarket chain with more than 1,500 stores across Canada and a major business management software company in Latin America. Our Zero Trust Network Access solution is also seeing good traction. For example, the United States Army announced last month that it selected Akamai for Zero Trust security in Battlefield networks. After a competitive evaluation of more than 40 vendors, The Army will use Akamai for its tactical identity credential and access management to enhance defenses and high-risk operational environments and limit network access to authorized users, devices, applications and services.\nIn response to customer requests to bring our enterprise Zero Trust solutions together into a single platform, we've integrated Guardicore with our other enterprise security solutions to form our recently announced Akamai Guardicore platform. This new platform is the first of its kind to enable Zero Trust security through a fully integrated combination of micro segmentation, Zero Trust network access, multifactor authentication, DNS firewall and threat hunting, all designed to strengthen and simplify enterprise security with broad visibility and granular controls through a single console. We think it will appeal to customers looking to consolidate security vendors and integrate their security tools.\nWe also continue to see strong customer interest in our app and API security solutions. Customers who purchased Akamai API Security in Q1 included a major consumer financial services company, a U.S. supermarket chain with more than 1,200 stores and a leading U.S. manufacturer of electric vehicles. Last month, one of our largest customers, a well-known hyperscaler was hit with a massive denial of service attack, 24 million requests per minute. Using our rate controls and custom web app firewall rules, the customer successfully forded 99.999% of the attack traffic. That's 5 9s of protection. The customer was delighted telling us, that's an A+ by just about every calculation unlike some of our competitors who struggled to defend against far smaller DDoS attacks in recent months,\nAkamai is capable of protecting even the hyperscalers. The scale of Akamai defenses and the depth of our expertise really matter for customers, who named Akamai a customer's choice for the fifth year in a row in the new Gartner Peer Insights Voice of the Customers report for cloud, web app and API protection. And soon, our suite of app and API security solutions will become even stronger with the planned acquisition of no-name Security. The use of APIs has exploded in nearly every industry driven by digital transformation, the widespread adoption of mobile phones and IoT devices and the increased sharing of data between third-party providers. The increasing use of APIs also opens up new threat factors for attackers and the need for API security. For example, we saw API attacks on our platform more than double from January 2023 to January 2024. And IDC research now predicts that the API security market will grow at a CAGR of 34% to nearly $1 billion by 2027. That's one reason why we're so excited about our plan to acquire Noname, as we accelerate our momentum in this fast-growing segment.\nAs one of the market-leading API security offerings, Noname delivers visibility into API business logic abuse, and contextual awareness between API requests and responses to ensure that anomalous traffic is detected, inspected and blocked when warranted. We believe that the addition of no name to our API security solution will offer Akamai customers enhanced attack analysis, more flexible deployment options and extensive vendor integrations. Ed will share some financial details about the acquisition shortly.\nTurning now to cloud computing. I'm pleased to say that 2024 is off to a great start with strong early momentum across multiple verticals. Customers are excited about our differentiated cloud platform, which offers superior performance through a more distributed footprint, cloud diversification and lower costs. Examples of major enterprises using our cloud computing platform now include one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, several global auto manufacturers. Several large direct-to-consumer and OTT providers, several global SaaS providers, numerous travel and hospitality companies, including one of the world's largest cruise lines and a large airline in Asia, one of the largest credit unions in the U.S., a multinational financial services company, an iconic global corporation that manufactures and sells consumer electronics computer software and online services, a European cybersecurity company and a leading ad tech company.\nJust this week, we signed up one of the world's best-known media companies to a 2-year deal worth several million dollars per year for compute. Yet another great example of major enterprises using our new cloud computing platform is Sony Group. Sony is excited about Akamai's investment into edge compute and has multiple latency-sensitive compute workloads that are running on Akamai. Current use cases include Playstation.com, leveraging edge compute to improve search engine optimization and PlayStation Direct, leveraging edge compute to ensure a fair experience for customers purchasing PlayStation hardware. We're also seeing strong early traction with our independent software vendor or ISV partners. They offer solutions that run on our compute platform in which our go-to-market teams co-sell to help customers solve big challenges with a better together solution. For example, a media workflow provider, which powers OTT video, now offers its live encoder solution on Akamai Connected Cloud. The solution is designed to increase efficiency for large-scale streaming while also lowering egress fees by as much as 90% according to their calculations. Joint customers of the offering include OneFootball, one of the world's biggest digital soccer platforms backed by clubs such as Real Madrid, Manchester City and Bayer and Munich.\nIn partnership with an observability solution provider, we won cloud computing deals in Q1 with one of the world's leading gaming companies, a leading luxury goods brand in Europe and one of India's largest conglomerates. Their solution powers observability using Akamai cloud computing and enables real-time data ingestion at scale, lightning fast query performance and extensive data retention at a fraction of the cost of other platforms.\nAnother ISV partner that is providing distributed database services enabled a well-known online travel marketplace to go live in Q1 with a geo location implementation that uses Akamai's edge computing to execute code at the edge for optimal performance. The travel site invoked more than 68 billion edge compute instances in March alone.\nBy the end of Q1, we had over 200 customers spending $36,000 or more in annual recurring revenue for our new compute services with about half spending $100,000 or more and spending over $1 million per year, all just for compute. All of these customer counts are triple what we had in Q1 of last year. Collectively, these customers are spending over $50 million annually coming out of Q1 for our new cloud computing solutions, which is up more than 4x year-over-year.\nBeginning this quarter, our global enterprise cloud sales team is now led by Dan Lawrence, who joined us from AWS, where he ran data and analytics for its private equity segment. Before that, Dan ran the Americas Analytics business for 5 customer segments, including gaming and high-tech SaaS. Dan joined Akamai for the potential he sees to combine Akamai's trusted brand and edge computing platform with a large market opportunity in distributed cloud.\nI'll now say a few words about content delivery, which represents a little over 1/3 of our overall revenue. Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure and near flawless digital experiences. That said, our delivery revenue was less than expected in Q1 due to slowing traffic growth across the industry and a large social media customer that is now optimizing their business to reduce costs. As a result, and as Ed will discuss shortly, we now expect our delivery revenue to decline at a higher rate this year. As we've noted before, delivery continues to generate profits that we use to fuel our future growth. It also helps our security and cloud computing portfolios as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security and compute on the same platform. Of course, we're not happy to see the declining revenue in our delivery portfolio. And while it remains difficult to predict exactly when that business will begin to stabilize, we believe that Akamai CDN remains a critical enabler of doing business on the Internet. This has been the case for the past 25 years, and we remain convinced that businesses will continue to need Akamai's superior scale, reliability and security in the future as they migrate more workloads to the cloud, seek to cure their internal and external applications and look to unlock the promise of AI, often while also leveraging Akamai's security and compute capabilities.\nMoreover, given the exciting growth we're seeing in our security and compute portfolios, we believe it is only a matter of time before these businesses drive accelerating revenue growth for Akamai as a whole.\nIn summary, we're pleased by the strong performance of our security and compute portfolios to start the year, and we're very excited about our potential for future growth and profitability. As we add no name to our security portfolio and as our fast-growing compute portfolio contributes a larger share of revenue.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q1 results and then provide some color on our Q2 expectations and our updated full year 2024 guidance, along with the financial impact of our recently announced acquisition of no-name Security.\nBefore we get into that, I wanted to address a few items, including what Tom mentioned in his remarks that have caused us to reduce our guidance for the remainder of the year. First, the U.S. dollar has strengthened significantly since the start of the year. As we have noted on many prior calls, foreign exchange fluctuations can significantly impact our top and bottom lines.\nBased on the strength of the U.S. dollar, we now expect FX to have a negative impact of approximately $40 million on our top line outlook for the full year 2024. That translates to a negative impact of approximately $0.12 to our expected non-GAAP EPS for 2024. In addition, we expect this will negatively impact our full year 2024 non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 30 basis points. Second, as Tom mentioned, a large social media customer has recently taken steps to lower its costs through a series of optimizations across its platform. As a result, they have reduced their overall traffic. Therefore, we now expect approximately $40 million to $60 million less revenue from this customer for the full year than we previously thought. This change will primarily impact our delivery product line.\nFinally, as Tom mentioned in his remarks, in addition to the large social media customer, we have seen lower-than-expected traffic in our delivery business over the past 2 months, most notably in gaming and video. This is in line with similar patterns that were cited earlier this week in a research note from a leading Wall Street bank that stated video streaming services, we're seeing a drop in loads and active users during April. The note also mentioned that weakness was coming from streaming service providers pushing for ad-supported versions and password sharing crackdowns to stay ahead in the streaming wars.\nAs a result of these recent market conditions, it's prudent to assume that this traffic weakness will continue for the remainder of 2024, this lower traffic outlook would translate into approximately $20 million to $30 million less delivery revenue for the remainder of the year than we previously expected. The good news is that in contrast to some other competitors in the industry, both our delivery business and the overall company continue to be highly profitable. As a result, the significant cash flows we generate give us the financial flexibility to execute strategic acquisitions, return capital to shareholders, invest in our future growth and further diversify our business away from delivery and into the faster-growing and even more profitable areas of security and compute.\nTurning now to our first quarter results. Total revenue for the first quarter was $987 million, up 8% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. Our 2 fastest-growing offerings compute and security grew 22% year-over-year on a combined basis and now represent 64% of total revenue. Computer revenue was $145 million, up 25% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, we have more than 200 enterprise customers using our cloud computing solutions. Our offerings clearly resonate well with customers, and we remain optimistic about the early traction we see from large enterprise businesses. It's worth noting that the annual run rate of our enterprise compute revenue is now over $50 million and is growing at over 300% year-over-year. Security revenue was $491 million. Security revenue grew 21% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We are very pleased by our continued performance with our Guardicore Zero Trust solution and highly encouraged by the traction we are seeing in our recently launched API security solution.\nMoving to delivery. Revenue was $352 million, which declined 11% year-over-year as reported and 10% in constant currency. International revenue was $475 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 8% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q1. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and a negative $4 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.64 of earnings per diluted share, up 17% year-over-year and up 18% in constant currency. And finally, our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 30%.\nMoving now to cash and our use of capital. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.3 billion. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $125 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. We now have roughly $400 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback authorization. As noted in today's press release, our Board authorized a new buyback program of up to $2 billion effective today and running through the end of June 2027. Combining the 2 authorizations, we currently have roughly $2.4 billion available for share repurchases. Our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nEarlier this week, we announced our intent to acquire Noname security for approximately $450 million. We believe this acquisition demonstrates our continued balanced approach to capital allocation by opportunistically buying back shares over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself.\nBefore I provide our Q2 and full year 2024 guidance, I wanted to touch on some housekeeping items. First, regarding our planned acquisition of Noname Security. We expect this transaction to add approximately $20 million in revenue for the full year to be dilutive to non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.10 and to be dilutive to non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 50 basis points in 2024. We expect that the acquisition will close sometime in June. We do not expect the acquisition to have a material impact on Q2 results. And as a reminder, our updated full year guidance includes the impact of the acquisition.\nFinally, specific to traffic, we expect a modest uptick in media traffic in Q3, primarily due to the Olympics. This event is expected to drive approximately $3 million to $4 million of additional revenue in the third quarter. And while Q4 is typically our strongest quarter seasonally, we saw a more muted impact of that seasonality last year, and we expect that we will see a similar result this year.\nSo those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $967 million to $986 million or up 3% to 5% as reported and 4% to 6% in constant currency over Q2 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $5 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $9 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72% to 73%. Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $302 million to $307 million. We expect Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 41% to 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $126 million to $128 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29% for Q2.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $175 million to $183 million. This represents approximately 18% to 19% of our projected total revenue. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.51 to $1.56. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $59 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.950 billion to $4.020 billion, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as reported and up 4% to 6% in constant currency. We now expect security revenue growth of approximately 15% to 17% in constant currency in 2024, including the contribution from the acquisition of Noname.\nAnd with a strong start for our compute offerings in Q1, we now expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 21% to 23% in constant currency for the full year 2024. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29%. We now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $6.20 to $6.40. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 19% to 19.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.\nFinally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 16% of total revenue. This updated CapEx is higher than our original expectations outlined last quarter due to our lower revenue outlook, slightly higher software capitalization rates across the business as more work is being on capitalized projects and higher-than-expected server component costs, driven primarily by NAND storage pricing in certain servers that support our cloud computing buildout. In closing, we are pleased with our progress in security and compute to start the year.\nTom and I would be very happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments.\nAdditional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on February 13, 2024. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nBefore I turn the call over to Tom, I'd like to let everyone know that I have transitioned ahead of Akamai Investor Relations role to Mark Stoutenberg. Many of you have met Mark over the past year, and I'm confident you will find him extremely helpful about all things Akamai. I'll be moving into another role internally, and I want to thank Tom personally for bringing me into the Akamai culture 10 years ago. It's been a privilege to work with so many wonderful people both here at Akamai, and of course, all of you externally. I wish you all happiness and good fortune. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you very much for the terrific job that you've done over the last 10 years at Akamai. It's truly been a pleasure working with you. And I'd like to join you in welcoming Mark as your successor.\nTurning now to our Q4 results. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered a strong finish to a very successful 2023. Fourth quarter revenue grew to $995 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $1.69 up 23% year-over-year and up 22% in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.81 billion, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Full year non-GAAP earnings per share was $6.20, up 15% year-over-year and up 16% in constant currency. Security revenue in Q4 grew 17% year-over-year and was up 18% in constant currency, contributing nearly half of our total revenue in the quarter. Security growth was driven in part by continued strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution as more enterprises relied on Akamai to defend against malware and ransomware. Customers who purchased segmentation in Q4 included one of the largest global tech firms in India and a leading payment systems company based in Hong Kong that handles 15 million transactions a day.\nWe've also seen strong interest in our new API security solution that we announced in August. Early adopters of this new solution include three major financial institutions, several major retail brands in Europe and North America and a leading industrial automation company in Europe. Our customers are seeing the value of this new capability with several already paying over $0.5 million per year for the service.\nAkamai's API security solution also earned recognition from industry analysts in Q4. KuppingerCole named Akamai an overall industry leader in their API security and management Leadership Compass Report. And Gartner validated our strong and expanded API capabilities in its market guide for cloud, web application and API protection.\nTurning now to cloud computing. I'm pleased to say that we accomplished what we set out to achieve last year in terms of infrastructure deployment, product development, jump-starting our partner ecosystem, onboarding the first mission-critical apps from some major enterprise customers and achieving substantial cost savings as we moved our own applications from hyperscalers to the Akamai Connected Cloud. After launching Akamai Connected Cloud last year, we rolled out 14 new core computing regions around the world, giving us a total of 25 overall. We also enhanced our cloud compute offering by doubling the capacity of our object storage solution and adding premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation. Also, our Akamai global load balancer is now live. This integrated service is designed to route traffic request to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure.\nLast year, we also amplified our go-to-market approach with our cloud computing partner program. The collaborative nature of the program provides a unique model for Akamai to engage with customers at a consultative level to deeply understand their requirements and pain points and to provide a complete solution, leveraging the combined strength of the partner's technology and Akamai's distributed compute platform. We've already partnered with several leading SaaS and PaaS providers in cloud, data and processing platforms. We're very pleased with the progress that we've made thus far and are looking forward to adding more new partnerships in 2024.\nWe've also begun to gain traction with some of our largest customers as they migrate mission-critical apps on to our cloud platform. For example, one of the world's best known social media platforms spent approximately $5 million on computing services with us last year, and they're already on a run rate to do more than double that this year. And two of the world's best-known software companies recently signed on and are already spending about $0.25 million per month on cloud computing with Akamai.\nIn Q4, we also signed up a major global media measurement and analytics company, and we displaced a hyperscaler when we signed BluTV, the largest VOD streaming company in Turkey. The streaming customer told us that they found our platform to be simple to use, automated and intuitive cloud agnostic for a smooth multi-cloud migration and affordable with very low egress costs, all backed by a trusted and reliable partner.\nIn addition to exceeding our full year cloud computing revenue goal of $500 million last year, we also derive significant cost savings by migrating several of our own applications from hyperscalers to Akamai Connected Cloud. Our Bot Manager and Enterprise Application Access Solutions were among the first to migrate. Together, these products are used by over 1,000 customers and they generate over $300 million in annual revenue for Akamai. But all that is just the beginning.\nToday, we're excited to announce the next phase of our multiyear strategy to transform the cloud marketplace, taking cloud computing to the edge by embedding cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's massively distributed edge network. Akamai's new initiative, codenamed Gecko, which stands for Generalized Edge Compute combines the computing power of our cloud platform with the proximity and efficiency of the edge to put workloads closer to users than any other cloud provider. Traditional cloud providers support virtual machines and containers in a relatively small number of core data centers. Gecko is designed to extend this capability to our edge [ pops ] bringing full stack computing power to hundreds of previously hard-to-reach locations. Deploying our cloud computing capabilities into Akamai's worldwide Edge platform will also enable us to take advantage of existing operational tools, processes and observability, enabling developers to innovate across the entire continuum of compute and providing a consistent experience from centralized cloud to distributed edge. Nobody else in the marketplace does this today.\nIn the latest implementation phase that we're announcing today, Akamai aims to embed compute with support for virtual machines into about 100 cities by the end of the year. We've deployed new Gecko architected regions in four countries already as well as in cities that lack a concentrated hyperscaler presence. These initial locations are listed in today's press release. Following that, we plan to add support for containers. And then we plan to develop automated workload orchestration to make it easier for developers to build applications across hundreds of distributed locations.\nWe've been conducting early trials of Gecko with several of our enterprise customers that are eager to deliver better experiences for their customers by running workloads closer to users, devices and sources of data. Their early feedback has been very encouraging as they evaluate Gecko for tasks such as AI inferencing, deep learning for recommendation engines, data analytics, multiplayer gaming, accelerating banking transactions personalization for e-commerce and a variety of media workflow applications such as transcoding. In short, I'm incredibly excited for the prospects of Gecko as we move full stack compute to the edge.\nTurning now to content delivery. I'm pleased to report that Akamai remains the market leader by a wide margin, providing the scale and performance required by the world's top brands as we help them deliver reliable, secure and near-flawless online experiences. Our delivery business continues to be an important generator of profit that we use to develop new products to fuel Akamai's future growth. And it's an important driver of our security and cloud computing businesses as we harvest the competitive and cost advantages of offering delivery, security and compute on the same platform as a bundle.\nAs we've noted in past calls, we're selective when it comes to less profitable delivery opportunities. And this is a discipline that we intend to maintain and in some cases, increase in 2024. To be clear, we still aim to be the best in delivery for our customers, and we believe that our disciplined approach will benefit our business by allowing us to focus more of our investment in security and cloud computing which are now approaching 2/3 of Akamai's revenue and growing at a rapid rate.\nIn summary, we're pleased to have accomplished what we said we would do in 2023. Our cloud computing plans are taking shape as we envisioned. Our expanded security portfolio is enabling us to deepen our relationships with customers, and we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth, while also enhancing our profitability.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our results and our outlook for Q1 and 2024. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. I would also like to thank Tom Barth for his incredible service for 10 years as our Head of Investor Relations. Now moving on to our results. Let me start by saying that I'm very pleased with our fiscal 2023 year results, delivering $6.20 of non-GAAP earnings per share, capping off a year of double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders. Today, I'll cover our Q4 results, provide some color regarding 2024, including some items to help investors better understand a few factors that will impact our upcoming results, and enclosed with our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance.\nStarting with revenue. Q4 revenue was $995 million, up 7% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We saw continued strong growth in our compute and security businesses during the fourth quarter. Our compute business grew to $135 million, up 20% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the feedback regarding our cloud compute offerings, and we are very optimistic about the early traction we are seeing from enterprise customers.\nMoving to security. Revenue was $471 million, growing 18% year-over-year and up 17% in constant currency. Our security revenue continues to be driven by strong growth in our Guardicore segmentation solution and our industry-leading web app firewall, denial of service and bought management solutions. In addition, and as Tom mentioned, we are encouraged by the early traction of our new API security solution. During the fourth quarter, we signed 17 API security customers, including 4 with annual contract values in excess of $500,000 per year.\nOur delivery revenue was $389 million, including approximately $20 million from the contracts we recently acquired from StackPath and Lumen. International revenue was $479 million, up 8% year-over-year or up 6% in constant currency representing 48% of total revenue in Q4. Finally, foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and a positive $6 million benefit on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving to profitability. In Q4, we generated strong non-GAAP net income of $263 million or $1.69 of earnings per diluted share up 23% year-over-year or 22% in constant currency and $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range. These stronger-than-expected EPS results were driven primarily by continued progress on the cost-saving initiatives we have previously outlined and approximately $6 million in lower-than-expected transition services or TSA costs associated with the StackPath and Lumen contracts as our services organization migrated the customers onto our platform much faster than we expected.\nQ4 CapEx was $143 million or just below 15% of revenue. We were very pleased with our continued focus on lowering the capital intensity of our delivery business. This effort, along with our very strong profitability enabled us to deliver very strong free cash flow results in Q4.\nMoving to our capital allocation strategy. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $55 million to buy back approximately 500,000 shares. For the full year, we spent approximately $654 million to buy back approximately 8 million shares. We ended 2023 with approximately $500 million remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Going forward, our intention is to continue buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I move on to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight in order to give investors some greater insight into the business. The first relates to our delivery revenue. In the first half of 2024, 7 of our top 10 CDN customers' contracts come up for renewal, as we've discussed in the past, this type of renewal generally leads to an initial drop in revenue. And then we typically see revenue grow again as traffic increases over time. We have factored the expected outcome of these renewals into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance.\nIn addition, as Tom mentioned, we plan to continue to optimize our delivery business by focusing on how we charge certain high-volume traffic customers for their usage on our network, all with an eye on profitability. For example, we plan to start charging a premium for higher cost delivery destinations. We expect to continue to optimize the ratio of peak to day-to-day traffic and we plan to negotiate different pricing for API traffic versus download traffic. choosing to shed some less profitable traffic will result in a more balanced and profitable approach to pricing, which we believe is the right strategy for the company.\nSecond, OECD member countries continue to work toward the enactment of a 15% global minimum corporate tax rate. And in particular, in December 2023, the Swiss Federal Council declared the rules in effect for Switzerland beginning in 2024. As a result, we anticipate that our non-GAAP effective tax rate will increase by roughly 1.5 to 2 percentage points to approximately 18.5% to 19%. We estimate this increase in our tax rate will have a negative impact on Q1 non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share and a negative impact on full year non-GAAP EPS of approximately $0.12 to $0.15 per diluted share. The impact of this tax rate change has been factored into our Q1 and full year 2024 guidance.\nThird, we expect to generate significantly more free cash flow in 2024 compared to 2023 levels. This is primarily due to much lower capital expenditures in 2024, along with our continued focus on profitability. Please note that the full cost to build out our Gecko compute sites we announced earlier today is included in our Q1 and full year 2024 capital expenditure guidance.\nFourth, I want to remind you of the typical seasonality we experienced on the top and bottom lines throughout the year. Regarding revenue, the fourth quarter is usually our strongest quarter. Regarding profitability. In Q1, we incurred much higher payroll taxes related to the reset of social security taxes for employees who maxed out during 2023 and from stock vesting from employee equity programs, which tend to be more heavily concentrated in the first quarter. It's also worth noting that in Q3, our annual company-wide merit-based salary increases go into effect so we tend to see higher operating costs in Q3 compared to Q2 levels.\nFinally, for 2024, we anticipate heightened volatility in foreign currency markets driven by the unpredictable timing and magnitude of Federal Reserve policy changes and their impact on interest rates. With this in mind, forecasting the trajectory of FX in the latter part of the year poses a formidable challenge. Thus, for the full year, we plan to provide annual revenue growth, security and compute revenue growth, non-GAAP EPS growth, non-GAAP operating margin and CapEx only in constant currency, based on [ 12/31/2023 ] exchange rates. However, for the coming quarter, we will provide both as reported and constant currency guidance.\nAs a reminder, we have approximately $1.2 billion of annual revenue that is generated from foreign currency with the euro, yen, great British pound being the largest non-U.S. dollar sources of revenue. In addition, our costs in non-U.S. dollars tend to be significantly lower than our revenue and are primarily in Indian rupee Israeli Shekel, and Polish zloty.\nMoving now to guidance. Our guidance for 2024 assumes no material changes, good or bad in the current macroeconomic landscape. For the first quarter of 2024, we are projecting revenue in the range of $980 million to $1 billion or up 7% to 9% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q1 2023. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a negative $4 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margin of approximately 73% as reported and in constant currency. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $310 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 42% to 43% as reported and in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense of $127 million to $129 million. We expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% as reported and in constant currency for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.59 to $1.64 or up 14% to 18% as reported and 16% to 19% in constant currency. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $56 million to $58 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $146 million to $154 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter, this represents approximately 15% of total revenue. Looking ahead to the full year for 2024, we expect revenue growth of 6% to 8% in constant currency. We expect security revenue growth of approximately 14% to 16% in constant currency we expect compute revenue growth to be approximately 20% in constant currency, and we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% in constant currency. And full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 15% of total constant currency revenue, which again includes the Gecko compute build-outs. We expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows: approximately 3% of revenue for our delivery and security business, approximately 4% of revenue for compute, approximately 7% of revenue for capitalized software and the remainder for IT and facility-related spend. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share growth of 7% to 11% in constant currency. And as we mentioned earlier, this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 18.5% to 19% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the strong finish to 2023. We continue to be excited about our growth prospects and driving profitability across the business. Now Tom and I would like to take your questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. .\nThe factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on November 7, 2023. The Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered excellent results in the third quarter with revenue, operating margin and earnings all exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew to $965 million in Q3, up 9% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31%, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.63, up 29% year-over-year. Ed will cover the key factors that drove our bottom line performance in his portion of the call. I'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main product areas, starting with security, our largest source of revenue.\nSecurity revenue grew 20% year-over-year in Q3. The acceleration in security growth was driven in part by especially strong demand for our market-leading Guardicore segmentation solution as enterprises confront the ever-present threats from malware and especially ransomware. CISOs and corporate boards everywhere have seen the recent headlines about devastating ransomware attacks, including at 2 casino hotels in Las Vegas, a major manufacturer of cleaning products in the U.S. and at a multinational provider of systems for smart buildings. One of them reportedly paid $15 million to get ransomware out of their systems, another is reportedly spending $25 million to deal with the after effects and a third has reported more than $100 million in losses from the attack.\nCustomers who purchased our Segmentation solution last quarter include a major global services provider, one of the world's most recognized entertainment brands and a leading bank in Switzerland that renewed their segmentation protection with a significant upgrade. We also saw strong demand for our market-leading web app firewall solutions in Q3 where we continue to win against competitors who are challenged to provide the levels of reliability and performance required by major enterprises. Customers who switched to Akamai, including a nationwide retail chain in the U.S. and a leading global manufacturer based in India, also told us that our competitors simply can't provide the level of support and professional services that they need and have come to depend on from Akamai.\nCustomers also value being able to purchase an entire suite of integrated security products from Akamai, a provider who they trust to keep them safe against a wide variety of attacks. For example, we're seeing very strong interest in our new API security solution that we announced last quarter. This new product is in its very early days, but we've already integrated it with our market-leading web app firewall solution to make it even easier for customers to implement. At the Black Hat security conference last quarter, Akamai API Security was named 1 of the 20 hottest new cybersecurity tools by CRN, a major trade publication for channel resellers. And as with Guardicore, you don't need to be a CDN customer to benefit from this new solution.\nTurning now to cloud computing. I'm pleased to say that we're on track with our product development, infrastructure deployment and conversations with customers about use cases well suited for the Akamai Connected Cloud. Since our last call, we've gone live with 7 more core compute regions in Amsterdam, Jakarta, Los Angeles, Miami, Milan, Osaka and Sao Paulo. In addition to the 6 that we opened earlier this year and the 11 that we acquired from Linode, this brings our total to 24 core compute regions to serve Akamai Connected Cloud customers. Of course, there are other cloud companies with a few dozen data centers, but Akamai is unique in having these data centers interconnected to the world's most distributed edge platform with more than 4,100 points of presence across 750 cities and 130 countries.\nAs one trade pub, Blocks & Files recently wrote Akamai is focusing on a future where scale becomes more about the size of the network versus the size of its data centers, more effectively powering modern applications, we agree. Akamai's massively distributed edge network, 25 years in the making and managed by Akamai's team of experts around the world is a key differentiator in our strategy. We believe that next-generation applications will need next-generation cloud infrastructure, and we intend to chart the course for the next decade of cloud computing when more of the compute will be done closer to the end user, and where we believe our platform will have an important edge over more centralized models. As IDC put it in July, Akamai brings the simplicity, affordability and accessibility of its cloud computing services to larger commercial customers on an architecture built for the next decade not the last.\nThe Akamai Connected Cloud will put containers and VMs closer to end users and bring enterprise workloads to locations around the world that are otherwise difficult for organizations to reach. Customers are responding to Akamai's unique offering, and we've already gained cloud computing business across multiple verticals in every major geography, including a European streaming media company, a digital advertising company in Japan, a large financial institution in Indonesia, an e-commerce platform in Korea, major carriers in EMEA and Central America and a television network in South America.\nIn addition to direct sales, we're seeing good traction in our cloud computing partner ecosystem where we're acquiring new customers by selling with cloud service providers and managed service providers. We've also partnered successfully with independent software vendors and SaaS and PaaS providers. In fact, we recently signed one of the world's best-known SaaS providers and our second largest cloud computing deal since we acquired Linode. Turning now to content delivery. I'm pleased to report that we saw an acceleration of traffic growth in Q3. In addition, we acquired enterprise customer contracts from StackPath and Lumen Technologies following their decisions to exit the CDN market.\nAs Ed will talk about shortly, the financial terms of the acquisitions were very attractive for Akamai shareholders. In addition to the delivery business that we acquired, we're planning to introduce these customers to our full portfolio of security and cloud computing solutions to help them power and protect their businesses online. In summary, we are very pleased by our performance in Q3. Our expanded security portfolio is deepening our relationships with customers. Our cloud computing plans are executing on schedule, and we continue to invest in Akamai's future growth while also enhancing our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q3 results and our outlook for Q4 and the full year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a strong and very profitable quarter in Q3. In my remarks today, I'll cover our Q3 results and then provide some perspective on Q4, share some details on our recent customer contract acquisitions and closed with our increased full year 2023 guidance. First, let's discuss revenue. Total revenue for the third quarter was $965 million, up 9% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. In the third quarter, Security revenue was $456 million, growing 20% year-over-year as reported and 19% in constant currency. Security revenue growth was primarily driven by continued strength in our Segmentation product, which is now over $100 million on an annualized run rate basis and up 97% year-over-year.\nI'll note that during the quarter, we had approximately $6 million of onetime Segmentation license revenue. Adjusting for that onetime license revenue, total Security growth for the third quarter would have been 18% year-over-year as reported and 17% in constant currency. And Segmentation revenue growth would have been approximately 62% year-over-year and 60% in constant currency. In addition to strength in segmentation, we also saw very strong growth in our flagship web application firewall or WAF product family. This growth was primarily driven by stronger-than-expected adoption of new security bundles offered to new and existing customers that we introduced this year.\nThe new security bundles include additional security entitlements such as more security policies, additional security configurations and more advanced rate control policies. Many existing customers are seeing greater value in these new bundles and as a result, are spending more with us. Moving to compute. Revenue was $130 million, growing 19% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency.\nOn a combined basis, our securities and compute business product lines represented 61% of total revenue growing 20% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency. Shifting to delivery. Revenue was $379 million, declining 4% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. It's worth noting that delivery was aided by approximately $4 million in revenue from the selected CDN customer contracts we acquired from StackPath. International revenue was $467 million, up 11% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $3 million on a sequential basis and a positive $7 million benefit on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving now to company profitability. Non-GAAP net income was $251 million or $1.63 of earnings per diluted share, up 29% year-over-year and up 28% in constant currency. These especially strong EPS results exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.11. They were driven primarily by higher revenues and continued progress on the cost savings initiatives we outlined over the last few quarters.\nAs an example, we continue to reduce our third-party cloud spend by migrating internal workloads to our Connected Cloud platform. In Q3, our third-party cloud spend declined 26% year-over-year. Moving to margins. Our cash gross margin was 73%. Included in our Q3 cost of goods sold was approximately $5 million of transition services agreement or TSA costs paid to StackPath. With customer contract acquisitions, TSA payments are used to cover the seller's customer-related network and support costs during the migration period. I'll provide further detail on expected TSA costs going forward in the Guidance section in a few moments.\nAdjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 31%, 2 points ahead of our guidance, driven by our revenue outperformance and continued focus on driving down costs across the business. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $2.1 billion, which includes the proceeds from the convertible debt raise we did during the quarter.\nAs a reminder, in August, we issued $1.265 billion of senior unsecured convertible debt that will mature on February 15, 2029. The notes will bear interest at a rate of 1.125% per year payable semiannually. Finally, the net proceeds of approximately $1 billion from this offering have been invested in highly liquid marketable securities. These securities yield approximately 5.25% on a weighted average basis with maturities close to May 2025. And as we intend to use these proceeds to pay off approximately $1.15 billion of convertible notes that mature in May 2025. For the third quarter, we spent roughly $113 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares. We now have roughly $600 million remaining on our previously announced share buyback authorization.\nOur approach to capital allocation remains the same to opportunistically buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Before I cover Q4 guidance, I want to provide a quick reminder about our typical fourth quarter dynamics and add some color to our 2 recent transactions with StackPath and Lumen. As in prior year, seasonality plays a significant role in determining our financial performance for the fourth quarter. Typically, we see higher-than-normal traffic from large media customers and may pick up in seasonal online retail activity from our e-commerce customers.\nBoth of these traffic patterns are difficult to predict. Q4 also tends to have higher operating expenses than in Q3, driven by higher sales commissions due to accelerator payments for sales reps who overachieved their annual quotas. As it relates to the transactions with StackPath and Lumen, first, both transactions were acquisitions of selected CDN customer contracts, including over 200 net new customers to Akamai. We did not acquire any other assets or liabilities of either company.\nSecond, we expect the 2 transactions combined will add approximately $17 million to $20 million of revenue in Q4. Third, we expect to record approximately $13 million to $14 million of StackPath and Lumen TSA costs in Q4. These costs will be recorded in our cost of goods sold and will have a negative impact of approximately 1 percentage point on gross margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and non-GAAP operating margin.\nCombined, the StackPath and Lumen TSAs will negatively impact our Q4 EPS by approximately $0.06 to $0.07. We do not expect to incur any material TSA costs in 2024. And finally, our expectations for these customer acquisitions remain the same as we disclosed previously for the full year 2024. As a reminder, we expect the customer contracts acquired from StackPath to add approximately $20 million of revenue in 2024 and to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share by $0.03 to $0.05. And we expect the customer contracts acquired from Lumen to add approximately $40 million to $50 million of revenue in 2024 and to be $0.08 to $0.12 accretive to non-GAAP EPS.\nWith all that in mind, we are now projecting fourth quarter revenue in the range of $985 million to $1.005 billion or up 6% to 8% as reported and in constant currency over Q4 2022. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $8 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a positive $2 million impact year-over-year. Taking into account the impact of the StackPath and Lumen TSAs, for the fourth quarter, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 72%. Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $305 million to $311 million. We expect Q4 adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $123 million to $125 million, and we expect a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q4.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $143 million to $153 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the fourth quarter. This represents approximately 15% of our projected total revenue for the fourth quarter Additionally, our CapEx guidance includes the integration requirements to support the traffic for both CDN customer contract acquisitions. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.57 to $1.62. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $50 million to $52 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17%.\nIt also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we have increased revenue to a range of [ $3.802 billion to $3.822 billion ], which is up 5% to 6% year-over-year as reported and 6% in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $18 million impact on revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We are raising our security revenue growth expectations to approximately 15% for the full year 2023, and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from Compute in 2023. And despite a year of significant investment, we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%. With all that in mind, we have raised our estimated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of $6.08 to $6.13. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be 19% of total revenue. In closing, we are very pleased with how the business is performing in 2023 as we continue to invest for revenue growth, and improve our profitability.\nWith that, we now look forward to your questions.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on August 9, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law. As a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com. And with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and slower Internet traffic growth. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security and compute businesses, which when taken together were up 30% in constant currency. These 2 business lines now account for 54% of our overall revenue. Q2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.35 per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year, but up 0.5% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $223 million in Q2 and it accounted for 25% of revenue. We've been leveraging our financial strength to make substantial investments in enterprise security and cloud computing. We've also used some of this cash to buy back additional stock. In the first half of the year, we spent $268 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. This puts us on track to go beyond what's needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs this year.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business: security, compute and delivery, starting with security. Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2, up 17% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency. Growth in security was driven primarily by our app and API security portfolio, which includes our market-leading web app firewall, bot manager, Account Protector and Page Integrity Manager solutions. Our Zero Trust enterprise security portfolio, led by Guardicore, also performed well in Q2 with numerous significant customer wins. A leading global provider of financial data concerned about ransomware, added Guardicore core segmentation solution to the 7 security products they already buy from Akamai. A major insurance company in France became a new customer for Akamai when they adopted our Guardicore solution to help meet European financial regulations. The sale led by 1 of our carrier partners is indicative of the excitement we're seeing for our Zero Trust solutions among our partners. In Australia's largest telecom provider, Telstra, expanded their business with us by adding our Secure Web Gateway solution to their portfolio of Akamai products. They told us \"as part of Telstra's journey in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions, Akamai has been a key industry partner with network-based anti-phishing malware protection and content filtering. Telstra blocks millions of threats every single day, and Akamai is a key partner in that protection\". Overall, our Zero Trust Solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2 and up 59% year-over-year in constant currency. This is an area where we're making -- continuing to make major investments and where we anticipate significant future growth.\nTurning now to compute. I'm very pleased to report that the revenue for our Compute Product group was $106 million in Q2, up 74% year-over-year and up 78% in constant currency. As a reminder, the compute product group includes Linode and Akamai solutions for edge computing, storage, cloud optimization and edge applications. A common theme that I heard when I met with executives from around the world in Q2 was their growing concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming large and rapidly increasing shares of their IT budgets. They want more choice in compute and are open to alternative clouds like Linode as a more efficient way to build, run and secure their applications. As a result, many large enterprises have begun testing the anode platform, including a major U.S. airline, 1 of the world's top gaming companies and a global provider of weather data. Major media companies, in particular, expressed significant concerns with their growing use of the giant clouds. Not only are the costs high in part because of the fees from moving data [Technical Difficulty]\n\nOperator\n\nPardon Ladies and gentlemen, we have to interrupt the call at this time. One moment, please.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nOkay. Sorry about that, everyone. We are ready to begin the real call. That was the warm up. I apologize again. And what I'd like to do is introduce our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. .\nJust stand by for a minute. Operator. Could you put the call on hold for me. We just had a little trouble with technical difficulties on the phone here.\n\nOperator\n\nYes. Thank you, everyone. We'll be on hold while you gather your information and get going again. Thank you, everyone.\n[Technical Difficulty]\nThis is the operator. Thank you for holding standing by. We have Mr. Tom Barth, ready to take over again for the call. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nOkay. Thank you, everyone, for your patience today. We're -- again, I apologize for the technical glitch, but we are ready to go. And I'd like to reintroduce our CEO, Dr. Tom Leighton. Tom?\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Sorry about the production snafu there. Anyway, I am very pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter, with revenue coming in near the high end of our guidance range and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 Revenue grew to $936 million in Q2, up 4% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. And non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.49, up 10% as reported and up 11% in constant currency. As you can see, and as Ed will explain in his portion of the call, our actions to increase profitability are delivering good results.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main product areas, starting with security, which is our largest source of revenue. Security revenue grew to $433 million in Q2, up 14% year-over-year, both as reported and in constant currency. The improvement in our security growth rate was driven by multiple products with especially strong growth for our market-leading segmentation solution. We entered the segmentation market with our acquisition of Guardicore in Q4 of 2021. We and we're nearing an annualized revenue run rate of $100 million. At this scale, segmentation is having a bigger impact on our overall security growth rate. Customers are adopting our segmentation solution to help defend against ransomware and data exfiltration attacks, which have become more frequent and damaging. For example, last quarter, we signed a 3-year $8 million segmentation deal with 1 of the world's largest carriers. Large carriers and banks want to protect their consumer data from losses that can damage their brands and trigger large fines from regulators. They also appreciate spending less on legacy firewalls that no longer provide adequate protection. We also saw strong growth in Q2 for our market-leading web app firewall and bot management solutions, where we continue to fare well against the competition due in part to their challenges with reliability and performance. For example, we recently took business away from a competitor, 1 of the world's largest micro blocking platforms. outages on their former providers platform made the customers seek a more reliable partner. So they switched to Akamai for their global expansion plan in Europe and Asia. In another example, a leading Asian financial institution recently returned to Akamai, also because of reliability challenges with this competitor's platform.\nAs we look to the future, we're also excited about our new API security solution that we announced last week, enabled in part by our acquisition of NeoSec in May. API security is rapidly emerging as a critical need for major enterprises. That's because as enterprises modernize their infrastructure to create better digital experiences. They're making increasing use of APIs to improve developer agility and end user performance. The problem is that these APIs are often not adequately secured, and they open up new vectors for attack. Our new API security product leverages AI-based analytics and threat hunting capabilities to discover APIs, analyze their behavior, identify vulnerabilities and help customers defend against attacks. Customers who thought they had 1,000 APIs might turn on API security and Discover hundreds more they never knew they had. With vulnerabilities lurking within legacy infrastructure or new applications. This is why banks are establishing API governance group today, and it helps to explain why IDC and Gartner project that the API security market will surpass $1 billion by 2027. Like our segmentation solution, customers can buy our API security product without being an Akamai CDN customer. These security solutions are CDN agnostic demonstrating how we can go to market as a security provider first.\nWe also continue to make good progress on the cloud computing front. Akamai is taking a fundamentally new approach to cloud computing making it fully distributed with many more points of presence that are available with traditional solutions. By leveraging Akamai's unique platform and capabilities, we believe that we can offer enterprises better latency, better performance, automated scalability and portability and reduce costs, especially for applications that incur high egress fees with the hyperscalers. Since our call with you in May, we've gone live with 3 new cloud computing sites in Washington, D.C., Chicago and Paris, and we plan to open 10 more later this year. These new sites are part of our plan to connect compute, storage, database and other services into the same platform that powers our edge network today, a massively distributed footprint that spans more than 4,100 locations and 130 countries. Last month, we also announced a doubling of the capacity of our object storage solution a new premium instances for large commercial workloads that are designed to deliver consistent performance with predictable resource and cost allocation and our plan to launch in beta the Akamai Global load balancer later this quarter. This new integrated service is designed to route traffic request to the optimal data center to minimize latency and ensure no single point of failure. We believe that the Akamai connected cloud will be ideally suited for applications that benefit from being closer to end users. For example, in e-commerce, our customers want to tailor their online shopping experience to the individual user. They also want the better performance you get by being closer to the end user. That's because better performance translates into higher conversion rates. In video and gaming, our customers want the game engine closer to the end user to reduce latency. And to tailor experiences based on the user's device type and connectivity. In AI, the basic models will be generated and trained in the core. But the inference engines, which generate alerts and responses to queries will be more efficient to run at the edge, where and when they're needed. And the cyber attackers exploit advances in AI to create more forms of malware and more dangerous bots, more security will be deployed at the edge to intercept attacks before they can reach and swap a customer's data center in the core. In all these areas, our customers also want the ability to spin up instances to handle flash crowds on demand. something that's very hard to do with competing cloud solutions. In summary, we believe that next-generation applications will need next-generation cloud infrastructure and Akamai is charting the course for this next decade of cloud computing. When more of the compute will be done closer to the end user and where we believe our platform will have an important edge over more centralized models.\nTurning now to content delivery. I'm pleased to report that we continue to be the market leader, providing industry-leading performance and scale as we continue to support the world's top brands by delivering reliable, secure and near flawless online experiences. We enjoy a strong synergy between our delivery, security and cloud computing offerings as we power and protect life online. The synergy is both on the top line as long-time delivery customers buy our security and cloud computing products and also on the bottom line as we realize the cost benefits of using a single infrastructure to provide security and compute services as well as delivery. Overall, I'm pleased to see that Akamai performed well in the first half of the year. Despite the macroeconomic challenges, we continue to invest in the key areas that we expect to drive our future growth while also taking actions to improve our profitability. Now I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q2 results and our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q2 results and provide some color on Q3, along with our increased full year 2023 guidance. I'm pleased that Q2 was another strong and very profitable quarter. I'll have more to say about our double-digit EPS growth in a moment. First, let's discuss revenue. Total revenue for the second quarter was $936 million, up 4% year-over-year. In the second quarter, Security revenue was $433 million, growing 14% year-over-year. As Tom mentioned, security revenue was driven by strong demand for our WAC, slot management and segmentation solutions.\nMoving to compute. Revenue was $123 million, growing 16% year-over-year as reported and 17% in constant currency. On a combined basis, our security and compute product lines represented 59% of total revenue growing 14% year-over-year and 15% in constant currency.\nShifting to delivery. Revenue was $380 million, declining 9% year-over-year as reported and 8% in constant currency. International revenue was $456 million, up 7% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency and now represents approximately half of our total revenue. Foreign exchange fluctuations were flat on a sequential basis and negative $6 million on a year-over-year basis.\nMoving now to profitability. Non-GAAP net income was $228 million or $1.49 of earnings per diluted share, up 10% year-over-year and up 11% in constant currency. The strong EPS results exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.07 and were driven primarily by higher revenues, saving from savings from the head count actions we took earlier in the second quarter and continued progress on our cost savings initiatives. As a reminder, those cost savings initiatives include third-party cloud savings, rationalization of our real estate costs, depreciation expense and other operating costs associated with lower CapEx related to our delivery business, disciplined spending with vendors and tighter travel and expense policy management.\nWith respect to third-party cloud spend, I'm pleased to report that for as long as we attract this expense, Q2 was the first quarter where total third-party cloud spend declined year-over-year. While the decline was relatively modest, it reflects disciplined vendor management as well as the beginning of savings related to the migration of our workloads onto our own cloud platform. This migration effort to move away from third-party clouds is in the early stages, and we are seeing promising signs. For example, our bot management solution is now running production workloads for hundreds of customers on our own cloud computing platform. As a reminder, we anticipate that the amount of savings we will be able to achieve will start to ramp through the end of 2023 and into 2024 as we bring online the needed capacity and features.\nMoving to margins. Our cash gross margin was 73%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 41%, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, slightly ahead of our guidance. Moving now to cash and our use of capital. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1 billion. During the second quarter, we spent roughly $137 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares. We now have about $700 million remaining in our previously announced share buyback authorization. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same to opportunistically buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself. Finally, I'm pleased to announce that Akamai has obtained investment-grade credit ratings from Moody's and S&P. These ratings are part of a broader financial policy to further reinforce our business and financial strength, not only with investors but also with customers, vendors and other parties that we engage with from a commercial perspective. The credit rating also broadens our financial toolkit, allowing us to evaluate all available financing instruments to determine what's best suited for our financial goals.\nFinally, as a reminder, Akamai currently has 2 convertible debt instruments outstanding, $1.15 billion due in May 2025 and $1.15 billion due in September 2027. Before I provide our Q3 and full year 2023 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. First, our annual merit-based wage increases became effective July 1. This will result in an additional net operating costs of approximately $12 million per quarter. Second, in late July, the IRS released a notice that granted temporary relief for determining eligibility of foreign tax credits. This will result in a lower-than-expected non-GAAP effective tax rate in Q3 and for the full year. And finally, the guidance I will provide assumes no change, good or bad to the current macroeconomic environment.\nSo those factors in mind, I'll turn to our Q3 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $937 million to $952 million or up 6% to 8% as reported and 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q3 2022. The current spot rates foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $1 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a positive $10 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $297 million to $302 million. We expect Q3 EBITDA margin of approximately 42%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $121 million to $123 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% for Q3.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $162 million to $170 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the third quarter. This represents approximately 17% to 18% of our projected total revenue for the third quarter. Based on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS to be $1.48 to $1.52. The CPS guidance assumes taxes of $42 million to $45 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Looking ahead to the full year, we have increased revenue to a range of $3.765 million to $3.795 billion, which is up 4% to 5% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $4 million impact to revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We are also raising our security revenue growth expectations to 12% to 14% for the full year 2023 and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from compute in 2023. And despite a significant year of investments, we are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29%. With all that in mind, we have raised our estimated non-GAAP earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.87 to $5.95. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 155 million shares. Finally, our full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 19% of total revenue.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our financial achievements for the first half of the year, in our ability to increase our overall revenue, security revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance for the full year. We believe that Akamai is a special class of businesses that have the ability and discipline to invest in future revenue growth while continuing to be extremely profitable and generate significant cash flows. With that, we now look forward to your questions. Operator?"

[Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments.\nAdditional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 9, 2023, and Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, Akamai delivered strong results in the first quarter, with both revenue and earnings exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Revenue grew to $916 million, and non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 29% in Q1. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.40.\nIn what has been a good start to the year for Akamai, we've continued to invest in the key areas that we expect to drive our future growth while also taking actions to improve margins. As Ed will explain in his portion of the call, we remain focused on returning to our operating margin target of at least 30% as we work to accelerate growth.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main product areas, starting with Security. For the first time in Akamai's 25-year history, Security represented the largest share of Akamai's revenue in Q1. This marks a significant milestone for Akamai since our expansion into security a decade ago. While we take pride in this achievement, we're focused on accelerating our security revenue growth rate from here, both organically and through disciplined M&A. For example, this past week, we closed our acquisition of Neosec, which complements Akamai's market-leading app and API security portfolio by extending our capabilities in the rapidly growing API security market.\nLast year saw a record number of web app and API attacks more than double the number in 2021. The rapid rise in API attacks is becoming a critical challenge for enterprises across all verticals and with IDC and Gartner now projecting the API security market to exceed $1 billion by 2027. The company we acquired, Neosec, is a powerful SaaS security platform that leverages AI-based behavioral analytics, unmatched visibility and threat hunting capabilities to discover APIs, analyze their behavior, identify vulnerabilities and help customers defend against attacks.\nWe plan to take Neosec to market immediately while our combined teams work together on product innovation with the majority of its engineers located in Tel Aviv, where we already have a significant security engineering presence we expect Neosec will be an excellent fit with our culture. And like our Guardicore acquisition, we can sell Neosec to customers that don't use our CDM. Speaking of Guardicore our segmentation solution to protect against ransomware continued to achieve strong traction with new customers in Q1, including with one of the largest banking groups in Europe and one of the largest airlines in the U.K.\nWe're also continuing our organic investment in innovative new products to help protect major enterprises. For example, at the RSA conference 2 weeks ago, our new Brand Protector Solution was named 1 of the 20 hottest security products by CRM. Another trade publication, CSO listed both Brand Protector and our new Prolexic Network Cloud Firewall among the most interesting products to see at RSA this year.\nAt RSA, we also featured a new managed security service called Akamai Hunt, Akamai agentless segmentation and multiple enhancements to our market-leading bot management solution. In addition to our investments in new products, we're focused on accelerating security growth by winning new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers. For example, one of the biggest security threats in the news last quarter was Kill net's coordinated series of DDoS attacks against some of the top medical centers in the U.S. In response, some very prominent health care institutions adopted Akamai's industry-leading solution for DDoS protection. In recognition of the value Akamai provides, the CIO of a world famous clinic e-mailed us afterward, thanking Akamai for enabling him to sleep well at night.\nWe're also making good progress on the cloud computing front. Last quarter, we acquired the cloud storage company, Ondat. Storage is a key component of cloud computing -- and we expect that Ondat's technology and considerable expertise will further enhance our enterprise-grade storage solution for Akamai Connected Cloud. Akamai intends to offer the world's most distributed platform placing compute, storage, databases and other cloud services closer to end users and enterprise data centers.\nAs a result, we believe that Akamai will be able to offer customers better performance, more points of presence and lower cost for many mission-critical enterprise workloads. That's the fundamental difference in our approach compared to other providers. We already have partners working with Akamai to run globally distributed databases with very low latency for synchronization. We have partners utilizing our cloud platform to provide customers with real-time visibility into telemetry from their end users around the world.\nWe're working with customers in e-commerce, travel, hospitality, software as a service, media and entertainment to improve their ability to personalize experiences monetize content, accelerate data processing, facilitate collaboration, simplify management, improve performance and reduce costs, in some cases, by large amounts. And we're having early discussions about potentially leveraging Akamai Connected Cloud for AI inference engines. Each of these use cases plays to Akamai's advantage in terms of numbers of POPs, global reach performance and cost.\nAnother advantage that we hear repeatedly from customers, including those I met with last month at the NAB conference is that they trust us. They value the years of highly reliable service that we provided in delivery and security, and they trust us not to use their data to compete with them.\nI'll now say a few words about our delivery business. which experienced an encouraging uptick in traffic growth late in Q1. Akamai continues to be the market leader in delivery, providing industry-leading performance and scale as we continue to support the world's top brands by delivering reliable, secure and near flawless online experiences. And we continue to see a strong synergy between our delivery business and our security and compute offerings, especially for customers in the gaming, media and commerce verticals. The synergy is both on the top line as long-time delivery customers buy our security and compute products and also on the bottom line as we realize the cost benefits of using a single infrastructure to provide security and compute services as well as delivery.\nWe plan to pass some of the cost savings on to our customers. which is especially valuable for customers who are paying exorbitant egress fees to the hyperscalers to access or move their data. The synergy of having a single cloud platform will also help us in our ongoing effort to improve profitability. Not only can we leverage existing infrastructure, but we can also leverage existing talent as we shift resources and focus from delivery to compute.\nAs Ed will explain shortly, we are very focused on managing costs and deploying resources where they generate the best long-term returns. As one part of this effort, we plan to reduce our worldwide workforce by a little less than 3% this quarter. This was a difficult decision, but it was necessary for us to prioritize investments in the areas with the greatest potential for future growth as we strive to deliver greater value for shareholders. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all of our employees for their hard work on behalf of our customers and shareholders.\nFrom our developers and engineers who build and operate the services that power and protect life online, to our sales, services and marketing teams who do such a great job helping our customers in this challenging environment, and our back office and administrative support teams who help make Akamai be such a great place to work. It really is a privilege for me to be able to work with such an outstanding group of people as we make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day.\nWhile this is a time of substantial macroeconomic uncertainty, I believe that it is also a time of great future opportunity for Akamai as we bring new security and compute capabilities to market and as we deploy Akamai Connected Cloud. As you may know, I continue to be a personal buyer of Akamai stock under the 10b5-1 plan that I filed last year. And I'm pleased to let you know that Akamai repurchased 4.6 million shares of Akamai stock in Q1 for a total of $349 million.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Today, I plan to review our Q1 results and provide some color on Q2 and our updated full year 2023 guidance where we increased our expectations for revenue, non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP EPS while decreasing our planned CapEx spend for the year. We were very pleased with our strong Q1 results in light of the continued difficult macroeconomic landscape.\nTotal revenue for the first quarter was $916 million, up 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. Security revenue was $406 million and is now our largest business representing 44% of total revenue. In the first quarter, Security revenue grew 6% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. As a reminder, last year, we had roughly $7 million of upfront license revenue in Q1. If you normalize for this onetime impact, the security growth rate would have been approximately 11% in constant currency. Finally, I was also pleased to see we had a very strong bookings quarter in securities, specifically with our Guardicore segmentation and Lab Solutions.\nMoving on to Compute. Revenue was $116 million, growing 49% year-over-year as reported and 51% in constant currency. On a combined basis, our Security and Compute product lines represented 57% of total revenue, growing 13% year-over-year and 16% in constant currency.\nNow on to Delivery. Revenue was $394 million, which declined 11% year-over-year and 9% in constant currency. Delivery continues to provide strategic value in its customer base and generate strong cash flows. I'm optimistic about improving traffic volumes over the past 2 months and to a lesser extent, the slightly better pricing dynamics we've recently seen in the market.\nInternational revenue was $442 million, up 5% year-year and 9% in constant currency, representing 48% of total revenue in Q1. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a positive impact on revenue of $11 million on a sequential basis and a negative $21 million impact on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $218 million or $1.40 of earnings per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency and $0.06 above the high end of our guidance range.\nTurning now to margins. Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 was 29%. This was slightly above our plan, primarily due to higher-than-expected revenue and continued focus on operational efficiencies. During the first quarter, we recorded a $45 million restructuring charge, primarily related to severance costs, along with facility-related charges as we continue to reduce our real estate footprint.\nThe impact of these charges has been incorporated into our second quarter and full year 2023 guidance. In addition to these specific actions, we also continue to be very focused on cost savings initiatives I described last quarter, which include third-party cloud savings, continued real estate rationalization, depreciation expense and other operating costs associated with lower CapEx related to our delivery business. disciplined spending with vendors and tighter travel and expense policy management. I'm pleased with our progress on these initiatives, which helped drive improvements to our margins in Q1 compared to our expectations coming into the year.\nMoving now to cash and our use of capital. As of March 31, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.1 billion. During the first quarter, we have spent approximately $349 million to repurchase approximately 4.6 million shares. We now have just under $850 million remaining on our previously announced buyback authorization. In addition to being aggressive with our buyback program, we have made 2 acquisitions since our last earnings call that will help drive revenue growth with Ondat in the first quarter and Neosec in the second quarter. We believe this demonstrates our continued balanced approach to capital allocation, opportunistically buying back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time while maintaining sufficient capital to deploy when strategic M&A presents itself.\nBefore I provide our Q2 and full year 2023 guidance, I want to touch on some housekeeping items. Regarding our 2 acquisitions, while neither was material to revenue, both are expected to be dilutive to non-GAAP EPS in 2023, with Ondat dilutive by $0.02 to $0.04 and Neosec dilutive by $0.04 to $0.06. Finally, as you build out your models, I'd like to remind you our annual merit-based wage increases become effective in Q3. From a seasonality perspective, Q4 is typically our strongest financial performance quarter and the guidance I will provide assumes no change, good or bad to the current macroeconomic environment.\nSo with those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $923 million to $937 million, up 2% to 4% as reported and 3% to 4% in constant currency over Q2 2022. At current spot rates, foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $2 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $3 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%.\nQ2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $300 million to $305 million. We expect Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $116 million to $118 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28.5% for Q2. Moving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $195 million to $202 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the second quarter. This represents approximately 21% to 22% of our projected total revenue.\nBased on our expectations for revenue and costs, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.38 to $1.42. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $45 million to $47 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5% to 18%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.740 billion to $3.785 billion, which is up 3% to 5% year-over-year as reported and in constant currency. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes foreign exchange fluctuations will have a positive $3 million impact on revenue in 2023 on a year-over-year basis. We continue to expect Security revenue growth to be in the low double digits for the full year 2023, and we continue to expect to achieve approximately $0.5 billion in revenue from Compute in 2023.\nWe are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 28% to 29%, and we now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.69 to $5.84. Our non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17.5% to 18% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 153 million shares.\nFinally, our updated full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 18.5% to 19% of total revenue. This CapEx is lower than our original expectations outlined last quarter due to strong pricing negotiations, resulting in better-than-anticipated server pricing, along with improved efficiencies, integrating Linode with Akamai's existing supply chain earlier than expected.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the strong start to 2023, and we look forward to your questions.

(Operator Instructions) Please note that this conference is being recorded.\nI'd now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of IR, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Call.

Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the fourth quarter, exceeding the high end of our guidance range on both the top and bottom lines despite ongoing challenges with the global economic environment. Q4 revenue was $928 million, up 6% year-over-year in constant currency. Our revenue growth was driven by continued strong demand for our security products, our fast-growing Compute business and by higher-than-expected delivery traffic. Security and Compute accounted for 55% of our overall revenue in the fourth quarter and grew a combined 22% year-over-year in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 28%. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.37 per diluted share, down 2% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, revenue was $3.62 billion up 8% over 2021 in constant currency. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%, down from 32% in 2021 and slightly below our goal of 30%. The decline last year was due to the impact of foreign exchange, the challenging macroeconomic environment, the investments we made to grow Guardicore's segmentation product and the rising cost of third-party cloud services.\nAs Ed will describe in a few minutes, we're taking several actions to reduce costs and to shift resources to areas with the strongest potential for growth, such as cybersecurity and especially cloud computing. Going forward, we anticipate that our margins will likely remain slightly under 30% in the near term, and our goal is to grow margins back over 30% during the medium to long term. Non-GAAP EPS last year was $5.37, down 1% over 2021 in constant currency. 2022 was another strong year for cash generation at Akamai, with $816 million in free cash flow, representing 23% of revenue.\nAkamai's strong cash generation enables us to make strategic acquisitions while also returning value to shareholders. In 2022, we spent $608 million to buy back 6.4 million shares. Over the last 10 years, we've reduced the number of Akamai shares outstanding by approximately $21 million or 12%.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business, starting with Security. Our Security products generated revenue of $400 million in Q4 and up 14% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, Security revenue reached $1.54 billion and grew 20% over 2021 in constant currency. We saw especially strong growth through our market-leading Guardicore segmentation product with revenue reaching $68 million for the full year.\nNew segmentation customers in Q4 included one of the largest insurance companies in the U.S., a leading Internet services conglomerate in Japan and one of the largest banks in Scandinavia. Enterprises are choosing our segmentation solution because of its ability to protect against ransomware and data exfiltration attacks and also for the visibility it provides into their internal infrastructure. These are also among the reasons that Akamai was named as the leader in the Forrester New Wave for Micro-Segmentation last year. We also saw large wins for our market-leading application security solutions in Q4, including at one of the U.K.'s largest multinational energy companies, one of the big 3 multinational banks in Singapore and 2 of the largest tech hardware companies in the U.S.\nOverall, Security accounted for 43% of our revenue last year, up from 39% in 2021. In 2023, we expect Security to become our largest line of business. This represents a significant milestone in our evolution since we pioneered the CDN marketplace 25 years ago. That said, and as the Security business becomes larger and with customers becoming more cost conscious due to the challenging macroeconomic environment, the growth rate of our Security business has slowed, a trend that we anticipate will continue over the coming year.\nAs you might expect, we're working hard to realize the full potential of our security business, both in terms of growth and efficiency. For example, we're in the process of moving the Compute components of our security products from third-party cloud providers to our new Akamai connected cloud platform, a transformation that will save us a substantial amount of OpEx over the next several years. We're redeploying resources within security from lower growth areas to high-growth areas such as segmentation. And we're redeploying go-to-market resources to achieve stronger cross-sell and penetration within our existing base.\nWe're also working more closely with partners to drive better adoption among new customers. And we're continuing to innovate new capabilities, such as our recently released Account Protector and our new Brand Protector solutions to keep our customers safe amidst the rapidly evolving attack landscape.\nWhile we believe that our security business will continue to generate strong returns for our shareholders, we foresee an even bigger opportunity in cloud computing and its potential to return Akamai to double-digit top line growth over the longer term. Our Compute business performed well in Q4 with revenue of $112 million, up 65% year-over-year in constant currency. For the full year, Compute revenue was $405 million and grew 64% over 2021 in constant currency.\nEarlier today, we unveiled Akamai Connected Cloud, our massively distributed platform for cloud computing, security and content delivery. Akamai Connected Cloud links Linode's 11 core data centers with Akamai's 4,100 Edge computing locations. In addition, we're in the process of building out 14 more core enterprise scale data centers with at least 3 expected to come online in the next few months. We believe integrating these core cloud computing data centers with our unique Edge platform will allow us to offer customers better performance, greater scale and lower cost for enterprise workloads.\nWe also plan to have our new virtual private cloud capability and the first of more than 50 distributed cloud computing sites available in the second half of the year. The distributed sites will enable us to bring cloud computing much closer to end users around the world, which will further enhance the performance benefits of Akamai Connected Cloud.\nOf course, and as Ed will describe shortly, we'll be incurring substantial CapEx and co-location costs associated with the build-out of our Compute infrastructure over the near term. We're also in the process of recasting approximately 1,000 positions or about 10% of our workforce to spend the majority of their time working on the development, deployment, support and go-to-market efforts associated with Akamai Connected Cloud. Because of the natural synergy and close integration between cloud computing and our existing edge platform, we believe we can accomplish this transformation without adding significant headcount to the business.\nThis shift will also further enhance the efficiency of our delivery business. We're undertaking this ambitious investment in Akamai Connected Cloud because we believe it will create substantial value for shareholders in the medium and long term. We expect to achieve nearly $0.5 billion in revenue from Compute in 2023, and the investment we're making this year should help drive that number substantially higher in 2024 and beyond as we use the new capabilities and capacity to support mission-critical enterprise workloads.\nI think it's worth noting that Akamai is taking a fundamentally different approach to the cloud computing market than providers who base their platforms solely on core data centers. Our strategy is to offer the world's most distributed platform, placing Compute storage, database and other cloud services closer to end users and enterprise data centers. As IDC's VP of Research, Dave McCarthy says, \"The cloud's next phase requires a shift in how developers and enterprises think about getting applications and data closer to their customers. It redefines how the industry looks at things like performance, scale, cost and security as workloads are no longer built for one place but are delivered across a wide spectrum of compute and geography.\" IDC adds that Akamai's innovative rethinking of how this gets done and how it is architecting the Akamai connected cloud puts it in a unique position to usher in an exciting new era for technology and to help enterprises build, deploy and secure distributed applications.\nWe couldn't agree more. Distributed applications require a distributed architecture. Akamai's leadership position at the edge of the Internet enables us to scale just about everything we touch. We scale content, putting digital experiences closer to users than anyone. We scale cybersecurity keeping threats farther away from business and people. And now we're building on Akamai's 25 years of experience with scaling and securing the Internet for the world's largest enterprises so we can scale cloud computing and provide better performance at lower cost.\nAlthough we still have much work to do, we're encouraged by the reaction from customers who want to realize the value of our approach. Last quarter, a well-known digital fitness platform brought business to us that they previously did with a major cloud provider. They chose Akamai Connected Cloud because we can optimize their performance and provide better economics.\nWhen a gaming company suffered a DDoS attack that took out their Internet relay chat servers, they turn to Akamai Connected Cloud to get back online. After utilizing Connected Cloud for a few weeks, they also migrated their peer-to-peer matchmaking servers to Akamai. This is what they say to other gaming businesses with similar use cases. \"our adoption of Akamai's Cloud Computing solution was painless and turnkey. Akamai has a great backbone network and the connective layer between our global servers has been rock solid. With Akamai's extensive global network, we provide a better experience to our gamers by delivering from the Edge and reducing latency. With Akamai, there's no reason to go anywhere else.\"\nAs you can see from this example, there's a strong synergy between our emerging cloud computing business and our delivery and security businesses, especially for customers in the gaming, media and commerce verticals.\nTurning now to content delivery. Our CDN business generated revenue of $415 million in Q4, down 8% from Q4 and 2021 in constant currency. For the full year, delivery revenue was $1.67 billion, also down 8% year-over-year. Traffic on the network was better than expected in Q4, reaching a new peak record of 261 terabits per second on December 14 as we supported more than 50 customers globally in delivering the World Cup, along with other streaming, gaming and software download businesses.\nThis World Cup was the first time in Akamai's 25-year history when we delivered more than an exabyte of data for an event. How much is an exabyte? It's 1,000 petabytes. That's 1 billion gigabytes. For the person transcribing this call, that's 1 byte with 18 zeros after it. That's a lot of zeros and a lot of traffic. I doubt if anyone has managed such a feat before. Once again, Akamai finished the year as the CDN market leader by far, as we continue to support the world's leading brands by delivering reliable, secure, high-performing online experiences.\nLooking back at 2022, we're pleased that we continue to grow the business and add significant new capabilities in the face of serious global macroeconomic challenges. Today, we're redefining our future with Akamai Connected Cloud to become the world's most distributed cloud platform with leading solutions for delivery, security and cloud computing. With our expanded strategy and business model, we believe that we're on a path to provide even greater value for shareholders and to make Akamai the cloud company that powers and protects life online.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on our Q4 and full year results and our outlook for 2023. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Principal Financial Officer, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. Today, I plan to provide brief highlights of our strong Q4 results, some color on 2023 and touch on some items to help you with your models and then close with our Q1 and full year 2023 guidance.\nStarting with Q4 highlights. We were very pleased with our strong Q4 results despite continued difficult macroeconomic conditions. Q4 revenue was $928 million, up 2% year-over-year or 6% in constant currency. We saw very strong growth in both our Compute and Security businesses as well as better-than-expected traffic in our delivery business during the fourth quarter.\nAs Tom mentioned, our Compute business was $112 million, growing 61% year-over-year as reported and 65% in constant currency. We continue to be very pleased with the initial feedback from our customers on our future Compute capabilities, and we are very optimistic about capturing a meaningful share of our customers' cloud spend in the years to come.\nOur Security revenue was $400 million, up 10% year-over-year and up 14% in constant currency. Our delivery revenue was $415 million, which declined 12% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. Traffic exceeded our expectations during the quarter, led by higher video traffic, stronger-than-expected commerce traffic and record-setting World Cup online viewership.\nInternational revenue was $445 million, up 4% year-over-year, or up 12% in constant currency, representing 48% of our total revenue in Q4. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $2 million on a sequential basis and negative $36 million on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million or $1.37 of earnings per diluted share, down 8% year-over-year and down 2% in constant currency, but $0.07 above the high end of our guidance range.\nMoving to our capital allocation strategy. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $178 million to buy back approximately 2.1 million shares. For the full year, we spent approximately $608 million to buy back approximately 6.4 million shares. We ended 2022 with approximately $1.2 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases. It's worth noting that in addition to offsetting dilution we have reduced shares outstanding by approximately 21.2 million shares or 12% since January 1, 2013.\nBefore I move on to guidance, there are several items that I want to highlight to help you with your 2023 models. The first relates to a change in our network server useful lives. As some of you may recall, we announced on our Q4 2018 earnings call that we were required to extend the useful life of our network servers from 4 years to 5 years based on the actual server useful life trends. We carefully monitor the useful lives of all of our capital assets annually. And based on the outcome of our most recent review, we now are extending the useful lives of our servers from 5 years to 6 years. Similar to when we made the change 4 years ago, this extended useful life is a direct result of the continued software and hardware initiatives that we have put in place to manage our global network more efficiently.\nBecause we are now using the servers in our network for an average of 6 years, we are required under GAAP accounting to adjust our useful life policy to 6 years beginning in Q1 of 2023. Please keep in mind that this change has no impact on cash flow, but will result in a depreciation benefit of roughly $56 million in 2023 and approximately $31 million in 2024. We have provided a supplemental table in the Investor Relations section of our website that details the impact of this change.\nSecond, we are expecting non-GAAP gross margins to decline by approximately 2 points in 2023 due to 2 primary items. First, as we build out our new compute locations, we are required to account for our colocation leases under GAAP accounting standard, ASC 842. In order to achieve more favorable unit economics, we often sign longer-term colocation agreements that include certain financial commitments. ASC 842 requires we straight line the cost of those future financial commitments over the life of the agreement. As a result, we expect to record approximately $40 million of noncash colocation costs related to this accounting standard in 2023. The second item impacting gross margin is our third-party cloud costs, as we've mentioned in the past, we expect to migrate the majority of our third-party cloud spend onto our own cloud infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months. That said, we expect the majority of the migration effort to impact the back half of the year, we expect we will incur just over $100 million of third-party cloud costs and cost of goods sold in 2023. We do, however, expect we will exit the year on a path to significantly lower our third-party cloud costs in 2024.\nThird, we expect international sales will represent nearly half of our total revenue in 2023 and the currency markets remain incredibly volatile. I will provide more detail on the impact of currency on each quarter's earnings call, but it's important to note that the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar can have a material impact on our reported results and guidance. As a reminder, the currencies that have the largest impact on our business are the euro, the yen and the Great British pound.\nFourth, I want to remind you of the typical seasonality that we experienced on the top and bottom lines throughout the year. Regarding revenue, the fourth quarter is usually our strongest quarter, and we typically see a step down in Q1 revenue from Q4 levels. Regarding profitability, as a reminder, in Q3, we have the annual company-wide merit increase, and in Q4, we typically see higher sales commission expense.\nAnd one final thought before we move on to guidance. Tom mentioned that we will be investing in what we believe will be 2 areas of higher growth for the company for years to come, security and compute. While we expect to manage the business below our target operating margin of 30% in 2023, and we expect 2023 to be a higher-than-normal year for CapEx, we will continue to reduce costs and drive efficiency gains in key areas such as third-party cloud savings. We expect to save over $100 million in annual cost as we migrate workloads from the hyperscalers to our own platform over the next 12 to 18 months. Real estate rationalization; as our employees have largely elected to work remotely, we expect to reduce our real estate costs by approximately $20 million in 2023 and achieve further savings in 2024.\nShifting resources. As Tom mentioned, we'll be incurring substantial CapEx and colocation costs associated with the build-out of our compute infrastructure over the near term. As a result, we are prioritizing certain actions and re-tasking approximately 1,000 positions from other parts of the business to our compute business. In addition, during the fourth quarter, we closed approximately 500 open positions and we will continue to be very prudent with any headcount additions during the year.\nFinally, we are lowering CapEx related to delivery. We expect to reduce our CapEx related to the delivery business to 4% of revenue in 2023. Now moving on to guidance. Our guidance for 2023 assumes no material changes, good or bad, in the current macroeconomic landscape, which we view as challenging, but navigable. For the first quarter of 2023, we are projecting revenue in the range of million to $900 million to $915 million, were up 0% to 1% as reported or 2% to 3% in constant currency over Q1 2022. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a positive $13 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels, but a negative $19 million impact year-over-year.\nAt these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 73%.\nQ1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $299 million to $303 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 39% to 40%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $109 million to $111 million and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% for Q1. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.30 to $1.34. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $43 million to $44 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 17.5%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 157 million shares.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $220 million to $228 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 24% to 25% of anticipated total revenue.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we expect revenue of $3.7 billion to $3.78 billion, which is up 2% to 4% year-over-year, both in as reported and in constant currency. We expect Security revenue growth to be in the low double digits for the full year 2023. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 27% to 28% and full year CapEx is expected to be approximately 21% of total revenue.\nWe expect our CapEx to be roughly broken down as follows: approximately 4% of revenue for our delivery business, approximately 9% of revenue for our compute business, of which roughly $100 million of that will be for internal workloads moving in-house and the remainder for future revenue growth. Approximately 7% of revenue per capitalized software and the remaining about 1% for IT and facility-related spend.\nWe expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.40 to $5.60. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 17.5% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 157 million shares.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with the strong finish to 2022, and we are excited about our growth prospects in both security and cloud computing.\nNow Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note today's event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of IR, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments.\nAdditional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on November 8, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we'll be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the third quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and the effects of a strong U.S. dollar.\nQ3 revenue was $882 million, up 3% year-over-year and up 7% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued strong growth of our security and compute businesses, which collectively grew 23% year-over-year and 28% in constant currency. These 2 business lines accounted for 55% of our overall revenue in the quarter.\nQ3 non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. And non-GAAP EPS was $1.26 per diluted share, down 13% year-over-year or down 7% in constant currency. EPS was negatively impacted once again by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $271 million in Q3, and it amounted to 31% of our revenue.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business, starting with security. Our Security solutions generated revenue of $380 million in Q3, up 13% year-over-year and up 19% in constant currency. The growth was particularly strong for our enterprise Zero Trust products, which were up 51% year-over-year in constant currency.\nOur Guardicore Segmentation solution continued to lead the way with several major customer wins. For example, one of the largest energy companies in the world adopted Guardicore to help protect against SolarWinds types of ransomware attacks. A leading global developer of dietary supplements adopted our Segmentation solution to help meet European regulations and limit cybersecurity risk. And a major South American broadcaster deployed Guardicore to protect their reporting of election results.\nOur market-leading app and API protection products also performed well in Q3, with many wins against the competition. For example, the largest bank in Southeast Asia came to Akamai last quarter after suffering repeated outages by a competitor that had lured them in with low pricing. When the bank faced large fines from regulators for the extended outages, they saw more value in being back on Akamai's platform.\nOne of the top banks in North America is in the process of bringing all of their traffic back to Akamai after struggling with outages at another competitor who would also lure them in with lower pricing, but couldn't deliver the performance and reliability needed by a major enterprise. After testing our capabilities against competitors, one of the world's largest financial services companies expanded their relationship with us, contracting for 10 of our products and services, including Bot Manager and Page Integrity Manager.\nA Fortune 100 food processor and commodities trader became a new Akamai customer last quarter after an anonymous threat drove them to seek better DDoS and web app protection than they were getting from a competitor. And in Germany, an online advertising business with one of the country's busiest websites suffered severe account takeover attacks, load problems and reputation damage before coming to Akamai for bot management and app and API protection.\nGiven such examples, it's not surprising that Akamai's web app and API protection was named a leader in both Gartner's Magic Quadrant and in Forrester's Wave report last quarter. Our compute product group also performed well in Q3 with revenue of $109 million, up 72% year-over-year and up 77% in constant currency.\nWe're continuing to make good progress on integrating Linode into our edge platform and on adding the capabilities and scale needed to support mission-critical applications for major enterprises. In particular, we've connected all of Linode's 11 existing locations into our private backbone, enabling us to provide lower latency, higher throughput and improved egress economics. We've also expanded the capacity of these facilities and are in the process of adding 13 additional sites, 5 of which are expected to go live in Q1 with 8 more planned for Q2.\nAs we discussed at our Analyst Day in May, we're also developing a lighter-weight deployment model that is suitable for distribution at a broad scale. This will enable us to get compute much closer to end users around the world. We plan to deploy several dozen of these lighter-weight sites next year, at which point we expect to compare well with the hyperscalers in terms of points of presence and proximity to both enterprise data centers and end users.\nOf course, we plan to have all of our compute sites integrated into Akamai's unique edge platform, which has over 4,000 locations for edge computing. As a result, we expect to be able to offer superior performance as well as lower total cost of ownership for enterprise computing needs.\nWe've also made significant progress on adding new and improved enterprise capabilities to our compute platform. We launched Database-as-a-Service with managed MySQL in May and managed Postgres in June. We released the next generation of our Kubernetes platform in Q3 to enhance performance and reliability. We expect to launch early versions of an enhanced object storage product as well as next-gen serverless capabilities next quarter. And we expect to become SOC 2 and ISO 27001 compliant this quarter with PCI compliance expected to follow in the first half of 2023.\nAlthough we still have much work to do, we're encouraged by the customer use cases that our compute platform began serving in Q3. One of the world's top development studios for gaming moved their matchmaking service to Akamai to help them with data processing and analysis. A large online legal services platform in India chose Akamai as part of their multi-cloud strategy after they concluded that we could help them optimize their cloud computing budget.\nAnd a large media workflow company in Germany is planning to migrate their apps from a hyperscaler to Akamai, calling our new capabilities a great addition, especially with the plans for a high number of distributed sites and the tight integration with Akamai content delivery.\nOver the past few months, I've spoken with many of the world's leading enterprises about our plans for cloud computing. Most tell me that they want more choice in cloud computing, and they often express concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming larger portions of their IT budgets, especially in cases when their cloud vendor is also a direct competitor. Customers also understand the value of leveraging a more widely distributed cloud platform and one that directly connects to Akamai's unique edge platform with over 4,000 points of presence.\nTurning now to our CDN business. Our delivery products generated revenue of $393 million in Q3, down 15% year-over-year and down 11% in constant currency. These results reflect continued deceleration in traffic growth among our largest customers and the impact of some large renewals that we completed in the first half of the year.\nAs we said at our Analyst Day in May, we've aligned our pricing strategy with the slower traffic growth rates we've experienced this year. In addition to scaling back discounts upon renewal, we're continuing to decline business from a very small number of customers who have extreme traffic peaks compared to their daily usage patterns.\nWhile this resulted in less revenue in Q3, it's enabled us to meaningfully lower our delivery network CapEx as we direct cash flow from our delivery business to our compute and security businesses where we have a higher ROI.\nAs Ed will detail shortly, we're also taking several steps to reduce OpEx, including reducing our real estate footprint and limiting hiring to our most critical areas. Although we're facing the same challenging macroeconomic environment as other companies, I believe that Akamai is on the right path to long-term growth and success with our disciplined management of expenses and strong focus on opportunities for future growth such as cloud computing.\nBecoming a force in the enormous cloud computing market won't be easy, but I believe that it's something that Akamai can accomplish. Akamai has a strong track record of continuous innovation and business expansion. Along the way, we've achieved significant milestones that many thought were impossible.\nIn our first decade, we pioneered the CDN industry. a multibillion dollar market, where we remain the leader by far. In our second decade, we created the industry for app and API protection as a cloud service, our second multibillion dollar market, where we are the leader by a wide margin. Looking ahead, Akamai is on the cusp of another major phase of expansion with our foray into cloud computing.\nHaving already scaled content delivery and cloud security into billion dollar businesses, we now have an opportunity to do it again with cloud computing. In fact, I believe our opportunity in cloud computing is even larger than it's been for delivery and security.\nCloud computing is a $100 billion market growing at a very rapid rate. We believe we're in an excellent position to capture a share of this business, particularly from companies that value our market-leading delivery and security solutions and that don't want to be locked in to more expensive options with a cloud giant that competes against them.\nAkamai is a company that enterprises can trust to be their partner, to scale with their business and to provide the best when it comes to security, reliability and performance. By adding compute to our unique edge platform, we can provide a full suite of cloud services that will help lower our customers' cost to build, run, deliver and secure their applications.\nIn summary, my confidence in Akamai's future prospects for growth and success has never been higher. In fact, my confidence in what I see ahead for Akamai has led me to take steps to put in place a 10b5-1 trading plan, not to sell, but to buy $3 million in Akamai stock over the next 6 months. We expect to announce the adoption of my plan in a formal filing later this week.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q3 and our outlook. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Principal Financial Officer, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a solid quarter in Q3 despite a very challenging macroeconomic environment. Q3 revenue was $882 million, up 3% year-over-year or 7% in constant currency. The stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 4 points or about $39 million of revenue year-over-year and $14 million on a sequential basis.\nOn a combined basis, our security and compute businesses represented 55% of total revenue, up 23% year-over-year and 28% in constant currency. Security revenue was $380 million and grew 13% year-over-year and 19% in constant currency, led by another strong contribution from Guardicore. Guardicore delivered approximately $14 million of revenue in Q3. Security represented 43% of total revenue in Q3, which is up 4 points from Q3 a year ago.\nCompute revenue was $109 million in Q3, up 72% year-over-year and 77% in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, while we are in the early innings of our cloud computing journey, we are very excited about initial feedback from customers and the significant growth opportunity ahead.\nDelivery revenue was $393 million, down 15% year-over-year and down 11% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets were $421 million and represented 48% of total revenue in Q3, up 1 point from Q2. International revenue was up 2% year-over-year or 12% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $461 million, up 3% year-over-year.\nMoving now to costs and profitability. Cash gross margin was 75%. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 61%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $291 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $368 million, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 42%. Non-GAAP operating income was $243 million, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 28%. It is worth noting that on a year-over-year basis, our non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates.\nCapital expenditures in Q3, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $111 million. As we mentioned on our Q2 earnings call, our strategy in our delivery business is to be more selective on the peak traffic levels we will take on our network. As a result, delivery network CapEx, excluding Linode, was just under 4% of revenue in Q3.\nGAAP net income for the third quarter was $108 million or $0.68 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $200 million or $1.26 of earnings per diluted share, down 13% year-over-year and down 7% in constant currency. It's worth noting that on a year-over-year basis, foreign exchange rates negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.10 in Q3.\nTaxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $41 million based on a Q3 effective tax rate of approximately 17%. This was about 1 point higher than our guidance due to a more unfavorable mix between U.S. and foreign earnings.\nNow moving to cash and our use of capital. As of September 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.4 billion. During the third quarter, we spent approximately $163 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 1.8 million shares.\nOur ongoing share repurchase activity has resulted in a net reduction in our non-GAAP fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 5 million shares or roughly 3% on a year-over-year basis. We ended Q3 with approximately $1.4 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I provide our Q4 outlook and an update to our 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, with nearly half of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a significant headwind to our reported results. At current spot rates, our guidance now assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $130 million impact to revenue in 2022 on a year-over-year basis.\nAs I mentioned previously, the strong dollar also impacts our margins and earnings. We estimate FX will negatively impact our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings by approximately $0.34 for the full year 2022. Second, we have seen a lengthening in some of our sales cycles. We believe that is -- this primarily reflects the uncertain macroeconomic conditions that our customers are experiencing, and it is visible in many parts of our business.\nFinally, we continue to closely monitor our costs in light of ongoing inflationary and macroeconomic pressures across the globe. We have made good initial progress on our cost-cutting measures that we mentioned on our last call, which include real estate costs, where we sublease some of our underutilized office space in Q3, and we'll continue to look for additional savings going forward.\nReducing our third-party cloud expense in 2023, where we look forward to making significant progress on shifting workloads to Linode. And lowering network CapEx associated with our delivery business, where I noted our continued progress on reducing spend significantly related to traffic delivery.\nIn addition to these items, as Tom mentioned, we plan to be very disciplined with headcount and focus our investments on higher growth areas like cloud computing and security. In particular, we are closing over 500 open positions and re-tasking many other employees to work on compute. These closures went into effect today.\nAnd just a quick reminder about our typical fourth quarter dynamics before I turn to our Q4 guidance. As in prior years, seasonality plays a large role in determining our fourth quarter financial performance. We typically see higher-than-normal traffic for our large media customers and from seasonal online retail activity from our e-commerce customers, which are both difficult to predict, especially during this more challenging macroeconomic environment.\nWith that in mind, we are projecting Q4 revenue in the range of $890 million to $915 million or down 2% to up 1% as reported or up 3% to 6% in constant currency over Q4 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $11 million impact on Q4 revenue compared to Q3 levels and a negative $44 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. This roughly 1 point sequential decline is primarily driven by increased third-party cloud costs and some compute-related data center build-out costs.\nQ4 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $298 million to $306 million. We anticipate Q4 EBITDA margins of approximately 40% to 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $125 million to $126 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27% for Q4.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $122 million to $127 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the fourth quarter. This represents approximately 14% of projected total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q4 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.23 to $1.30. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $38 million to $40 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 158 million shares.\nAnd finally, for the full year 2022, we now expect revenue of $3.58 billion to $3.6 billion, which is up 3% to 4% year-over-year as reported or up 7% to 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect security growth of approximately 20% in constant currency for the full year 2022.\nWe now estimate non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 28% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.23 to $5.30. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16.5%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 116 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 13% of revenue.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with how the business is continuing to perform despite a very challenging macroeconomic backdrop. We are very excited about our future growth opportunities ahead. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

(Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of IR, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.\nThe forward-looking statements included in this call represent Akamai's view on August 9, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that Akamai delivered strong results in the second quarter despite the ongoing challenges with the global economic environment and slower Internet traffic growth. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our Security and Compute businesses, which when taken together, were up 30% in constant currency. These 2 business lines now account for 54% of our overall revenue.\nQ2 non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. Q2 non-GAAP EPS was $1.35 per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year, but up 0.5% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS was negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates and a higher effective tax rate compared to last year. Free cash flow was very strong at $223 million in Q2 and it accounted for 25% of revenue.\nWe've been leveraging our financial strength to make substantial investments in enterprise security and cloud computing. We've also used some of this cash to buy back additional stock. In the first half of the year, we spent $268 million to repurchase 2.6 million shares. This puts us on track to go beyond what's needed to offset dilution from employee equity programs this year.\nI'll now say a few words about each of our 3 main lines of business: Security, Compute and Delivery, starting with Security. Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $381 million in Q2, up 17% year-over-year and up 21% in constant currency. Growth in security was driven primarily by our app and API security portfolio, which includes our market-leading web app firewall, Bot Manager, Account Protector and Page Integrity Manager solutions.\nOur Zero Trust enterprise security portfolio, led by Guardicore, also performed well in Q2, with numerous significant customer wins. A leading global provider of financial data concerned about ransomware, added Guardicore segmentation solution to the 7 security products they already buy from Akamai. A major insurance company in France became a new customer for Akamai when they adopted our Guardicore solution to help meet European financial regulations. The sale, led by one of our carrier partners, is indicative of the excitement we're seeing for our Zero Trust solutions among our partners.\nIn Australia's largest telecom provider, Telstra, expanded their business with us by adding our Secure Web Gateway solution to their portfolio of Akamai products. They told us, \"As part of Telstra's journey in delivering fit-for-purpose solutions, Akamai has been a key industry partner with network-based anti-phishing malware protection and content filtering. Telstra blocks millions of threats every single day, and Akamai is a key partner in that protection.\"\nOverall, our Zero Trust solutions delivered $43 million of revenue in Q2, up 59% year-over-year in constant currency. This is an area where we're making -- continuing to make major investments and where we anticipate significant future growth.\nTurning now to Compute. I'm very pleased to report that the revenue for our Compute product group was $106 million in Q2, up 74% year-over-year and up 78% in constant currency. As a reminder, the Compute product group includes Linode and Akamai solutions for Edge computing, storage cloud optimization and Edge applications.\nA common theme that I heard when I met with executives from around the world in Q2 was their growing concern about being locked into contracts with cloud giants that are consuming large and rapidly increasing shares of their IT budgets. They want more choice in compute and are open to alternative clouds like Linode as a more efficient way to build, run and secure their applications. As a result, many large enterprises have begun testing the Linode platform, including a major U.S. airline, one of the world's top gaming companies and a global provider of weather data.\nMajor media companies, in particular, expressed significant concerns with their growing use of the giant clouds. Not only are the cost high, in part because of the fees from moving data from cloud storage to a CDN for delivery, but they're also concerned about their increasing reliance on a direct competitor. As an example, I'm very pleased to announce that we recently signed a contract with one of the world's largest media companies to run a critical new workload on Linode. The service is live today, and we anticipate that it will generate millions of dollars of annual revenue as their usage grows over time.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to our potential for future revenue growth in Compute. Cloud computing is a fast-growing, multi-hundred billion dollar market. And as we scale Linode to be enterprise grade with pops and hundreds of locations around the world, we should be in an excellent position to capture a share of this market, particularly from companies that value our industry-leading security and delivery solutions and that don't want to be locked in to more expensive options with a cloud giant that competes against them.\nOur Delivery products generated revenue of $417 million in Q2, down 11% year-over-year and down 8% in constant currency. These results were clearly impacted by a continued deceleration in traffic growth among our largest media customers and by the lower unit pricing we provided as part of their recent contract renewals.\nIt's important to note that Akamai remains the market leader in delivery by far. Moreover, customer churn in the first half of this year remained at record lows, and lost annual revenue from churned accounts in Q2 was even less than in Q1.\nWe also saw some notable delivery customers move business to our platform in Q2 after trying out competing solutions. No matter which competitor they've been working with, they chose Akamai because of our superior performance and reliability.\nLike many companies, we're managing through a time of substantial economic headwinds and uncertainty with escalating inflation, the strengthening U.S. dollar, growing concerns about a global recession, escalating geopolitical tensions and conflicts, and a slowing of Internet traffic growth as the world tries to return to normal in the midst of a pandemic. As Ed will talk about shortly, I think it's prudent to assume that these headwinds will dampen our growth rates and profitability over the next several quarters, particularly in our Delivery business, which is being impacted by the challenges that many major media companies have recently reported.\nGiven the enormous market opportunity in front of us, we will continue to focus our investment on Zero Trust enterprise security led by Guardicore, and cloud computing, led by Linode. These investments, combined with the economic headwinds I just mentioned, will likely result in our operating margin remaining below 30% in the near term. We expect our margins to improve over time as our Security and Compute businesses continue to grow and account for a larger share of total revenue.\nIn addition, we're embarking on several major initiatives to reduce cost and improve operational efficiency that should help return our margins to 30% or better in the medium to longer term. As Ed will discuss further, these initiatives include leveraging Linode to significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers, slowing the capital expenditures for our delivery platform and optimizing our real estate footprint.\nWhile these are challenging times to be sure, I believe that Akamai is on the right track for long-term growth and success and that we're well positioned because of our unique global-edge platform, our market-leading security and delivery solutions, our new compute capabilities which provide great performance at an affordable cost, our premier enterprise customer base and our strong financial position and profitable business model.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Ed for more on Q2 and our outlook going forward. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Principal Financial Officer, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered another solid quarter in Q2. Q2 revenue was $903 million, up 6% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Revenue was in line with our guidance and was led by our Security and Compute businesses. As we mentioned on our last call, we expected significant foreign exchange headwinds to impact our revenue in Q2. The much stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted our year-over-year growth rate by 3 points or approximately $29 million of revenue year-over-year and $14 million on a sequential basis.\nOn a combined basis, our Security and Compute businesses represented 54% of total revenue, growing 26% year-over-year and 30% in constant currency. Security revenue was $381 million and grew 17% year-over-year and 21% in constant currency, with continued strength from our Zero Trust business led by Guardicore. Guardicore delivered approximately $14 million of revenue in Q2. Security represented 42% of total revenue in Q2, which is up 4 points from Q2 a year ago.\nCompute revenue was $106 million in Q2, growing 74% year-over-year and 78% in constant currency. Linode contributed revenue of approximately $32 million in the second quarter. Delivery revenue was $417 million, down 11% year-over-year and 8% in constant currency. It's worth noting that while traffic on our network continued to grow, the rate of that traffic growth declined sequentially in Q2.\nAs Tom mentioned, we believe that the current macroeconomic environment has had the greatest impact on customers in our media vertical, most notably in advertising and gaming. These challenges are most apparent in our delivery results.\nAlso, as we talked about at our Analyst Day in May, we started to align our pricing strategy with the new traffic growth rates we have seen on our network over the last 2 quarters. In addition to scaling back discounts provided upon renewal, we decided to turn away some business from a very small number of customers who have extreme traffic peaks compared to their daily usage patterns. While this will result in slightly less revenue, it will enable us to significantly lower our network CapEx as we focus on cash flow from our Delivery business to help accelerate our investments in faster-growing areas like Compute and Security.\nSales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q2, unchanged from Q1. International revenue grew 6% year-over-year or 13% in constant currency. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $477 million and grew 6% year-over-year.\nGoing now to costs and profitability. Cash gross margin was 75%. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 62%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $292 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $388 million and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%. Non-GAAP operating income was $262 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. It is worth noting that our non-GAAP operating margin was negatively impacted by approximately 1 point due to unfavorable foreign exchange.\nCapital expenditures in Q2, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $104 million. This was much better than we expected, partly due to some Linode specific CapEx that pushed from Q2 into Q3 as well as some savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic. These savings were most apparent in our network CapEx, excluding Linode, which was only about 3% of revenue.\nGAAP net income for the second quarter was $120 million or $0.74 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $216 million or $1.35 of earnings per diluted share, down 5% year-over-year and up 1/2 of 1% in constant currency. It's worth noting that foreign exchange negatively impacted our non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.07. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $42 million based on a Q2 effective tax rate of approximately 16%. This was about 1.5 points higher than last year.\nMoving now to cash and our use of capital. As of June 30, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion. During the second quarter, we spent approximately $165 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 1.6 million shares. Our ongoing share repurchase activity has resulted in a net reduction in our non-GAAP fully diluted shares outstanding of approximately 4 million shares or roughly 2% on a year-over-year basis.\nWe ended Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I provide our Q3 outlook and an update to our 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, with nearly 50% of our revenue coming from outside the U.S., foreign exchange continues to be a significant headwind to our reported results. At current spot rates, our guidance now assumes foreign exchange will have a negative $114 million impact to revenue in 2022 on a year-over-year basis.\nAs I mentioned previously, foreign exchange also impacts our margins and earnings. We estimate FX will negatively impact non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 1 point year-over-year and non-GAAP earnings by approximately $0.31 for the full year 2022.\nSecond, we are incrementally more cautious on the outlook for traffic growth in Q3 and Q4. Based on our year-to-date trend, plus what we are hearing from other large Internet companies, we are anticipating a slower than usual traffic growth rate for the remainder of 2022. Third, as a result of the expected slower traffic growth rate and our updating pricing strategy that we noted earlier, we anticipate CapEx to be significantly below our previous outlook.\nFinally, as Tom mentioned, we expect the more challenging macroeconomic environment to dampen our revenue growth and margins in the near term. When combined with the impact of renewing 8 of our top 10 customers in the first half of the year, we expect Delivery revenue to decline at a slightly higher rate on a year-over-year basis for the next 2 quarters. As a result of these factors, we also expect margins to decline over the near term as well.\nWe believe strongly in the long-term opportunities in front of us, especially in Security and Compute, and therefore, planned to continue to invest to exploit the market opportunity in these areas. That said, as Tom highlighted, we are embarking on several major initiatives to reduce costs and improve operational efficiency. Potential savings for each of these areas is in the tens of millions of dollars.\nSpecifically, we are planning to do the following 3 things. First, significantly reduce our cloud spend with hyperscalers as we migrate internal Akamai workloads to Linode. Second, realized savings from our strategy of being more selective on certain types of customer traffic, which we expect will result in both lower capital expenditures and depreciation expense. And third, optimize our real estate footprint as the hybrid work experience becomes more permanent.\nNow turning to our Q3 guidance. We are projecting revenue in the range of $868 million to $883 million or up 1% to 3% as reported or 5% to 7% in constant currency over Q3 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $11 million impact on Q3 revenue compared to Q2 levels and a negative $36 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 74%. In the short term, our gross margin is negatively impacted by our continued investment in Guardicore and the Linode-related headcount as well as higher third-party cloud costs.\nHowever, we are confident that this is a short-term impact only. We expect our gross margin to expand to the high 70% long-term target model as we see continued strong growth from both Guardicore and Linode as we reduce our third-party cloud costs over time.\nQ3 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $283 million to $291 million. We anticipate Q3 EBITDA margins of approximately 41%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $125 million to $128 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 27% for Q3.\nAs mentioned previously, the near-term decline in operating margin is due to slower traffic and revenue growth, our annual merit-based wage increase, which become effective July 1, the negative impact from foreign exchange, investments associated with Guardicore and Linode and increased third-party cloud costs. As our Security and Compute business continue to grow and we reap the benefits of the cost savings actions I described earlier, we are confident that our operating margins will return to 30% and then grow from there.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $109 million to $119 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the third quarter. This represents approximately 13% of projected total revenue. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q3 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.21 to $1.26. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $37 million to $38 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.57 billion to $3.61 billion, which is up 3% to 4% year-over-year as reported or up 6% to 8% in constant currency. We continue to expect Security growth of approximately 20% in constant currency for the full year 2022. We now estimate non-GAAP operating margins to be approximately 28% to 29% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.19 to $5.37. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16% and a fully diluted share count of approximately 160 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 12% to 13% of revenue.\nIn closing, while the macroeconomic backdrop has become more uncertain, we believe that we are in the right markets with differentiated products that remain highly valued by our customers. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the First Quarter 2022 Akamai Technologies Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of IR, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nPlease note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. The factors include any impact from macroeconomic trends, uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from geopolitical developments.\nAdditional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent the company's view on May 3, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect new information, future events or circumstances, except as required by law.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section of akamai.com.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Tom.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Our Q1 revenue was $904 million, up 7% year-over-year and up 9% in constant currency. This solid result was driven by the continued rapid growth of our security and compute businesses. Q1 non-GAAP operating margin was 30%, Q1 non-GAAP EPS was $1.39 per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency. As Ed will discuss later, EPS came in at the low end of our guidance range, primarily due to an adverse tax impact of $0.03.\nSince our last call with you on February 15, we've seen the development of several major global events and financial headwinds. It's remarkable how quickly the world has changed with the war in Ukraine, the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar, escalating inflation, increasing concerns about a recession, and a moderation of Internet traffic growth as many countries remove mask mandates.\nSince these developments are all fairly recent, they had a relatively small impact on our Q1 results, but it's prudent to assume that they'll impact our results more meaningfully for the rest of the year. For example, at current spot rates, the strengthening dollar will adversely impact full year 2022 revenue by about $100 million. About $55 million of that impact has come since we issued guidance on February 15.\nAs we disclosed in our 8-K filing on March 7, about 1% of our revenue comes from Russian companies or is derived from delivering traffic into Russia. We have since terminated our business with several majority state-owned Russian companies and our traffic delivered into Russia and Ukraine on behalf of other global customers has declined dramatically since the war began. As a result, it's reasonable to assume that we will no longer generate most of the revenue that had been associated with Russia and Ukraine.\nLastly, data from some of our large customers in the media and commerce verticals suggest that they may be transitioning from an environment of above normal online consumption fueled by COVID-related restrictions to an environment with more macroeconomic uncertainty, which could moderate their traffic growth in the near term.\nDiscussions with many of our large carrier partners across the world, have reinforced the view that traffic growth rates may be moderating across the Internet as a whole. In particular, they've told us that they've recently seen a moderation in their year-over-year traffic growth, and that the current levels of traffic on their networks are less than what they'd expected. This is consistent with what we've recently seen.\nTraffic is still growing at a fast pace on the Akamai platform, but at a more moderate pace than we've observed over the last few years. As a result of these largely external factors, and to be conservative in our outlook, we feel it is prudent to lower our expectations for the full year. Ed will provide more detail shortly.\nThat said, and this is important to emphasize, Akamai's business continues to be very strong and highly profitable. Traffic growth on our platform remains substantial and the data we've received from our customers and carrier partners indicates that our market share remains stable or is modestly increasing.\nIn addition, our customer churn levels continue to be at record lows. Lost annual revenue from churned accounts in Q1 amounted to less than 0.5% of total annual revenue, and churn due to competitors was much less than half of that already small amount. As a result, our market-leading delivery business continues to generate substantial cash and to power our unique edge platform.\nOur security business has reached an annual revenue run rate of over $1.5 billion and continues to grow over 20% annually in constant currency. And we believe that our compute business is poised to achieve about $400 million in revenue this year, with a growth rate of over 60%. And perhaps most important of all, the combination of our security and compute businesses now represents the majority of our revenue. We expect these businesses to generate about $2 billion of revenue this year with a growth rate of about 27% in constant currency.\nI'll now talk about each of our 3 major business lines, starting with security, which we believe will soon become our largest business line. Our Security Solutions generated revenue of $382 million in Q1, up 23% year-over-year and up 26% in constant currency. This very strong growth was driven primarily by our flagship security products, Kona Site Defender and Bot Manager, and also by our new Guardicore micro-segmentation solution to stop ransomware.\nIn Q1, we finalized the largest deal in Guardicore's history valued at more than $10 million over the next 3 years expanding our long-time relationship with 1 of the largest banks in the world. The size and scope of the deal illustrates why we're so excited about our opportunity in micro-segmentation.\nFinancial services firms, in particular, are frequent targets of ransomware and malware and large banks with security risks face financial penalties from regulators if they fail to address them. So from a compliance perspective, adopting micro-segmentation can reduce risk and prevent large fines in the process.\nBy reducing spending on their legacy static firewalls, the bank that's adopting our micro-segmentation solution will free up resources to implement stronger defenses as they move to a new Zero Trust security architecture. And by converting to our more flexible software-based solution, they can achieve greater agility to compete with fast-moving fintech services.\nThis example demonstrates how Guardicore can help Akamai expand long-time relationships with customers to become a more valuable strategic partner in the future. Guardicore is also helping us win new accounts in verticals such as critical infrastructure. For example, one of the largest railroads in the world recently became a multimillion dollar Guardicore customer.\nOn April 20, cybersecurity authorities in the U.S. and other major countries warned that the war in Ukraine raises the risk of cyber-attacks. Their recommended defenses align well to Akamai's security solutions for micro segmentation, DDoS protection and web app firewall.\nWeb application attacks experienced by customers grew by nearly 200% year-over-year in Q1, the largest increase we've seen in several years. Web app attacks are a critical vulnerability for any company moving to the cloud, building micro services or integrating third parties via APIs, which is why app and API protection is a critical priority for major enterprises.\nAkamai is a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for web app and API protection. And in Q1, Akamai's Web app and API protection are in Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice distinction for the third year in a row. Also in Q1, Forrester named Akamai a leader in its new way for micro-segmentation.\nAs we discussed during our last call with investors in February, we will be reporting on our delivery and compute product line separately going forward. In Q1, our delivery products generated revenue of $444 million, down 6% year-over-year and down 4% in constant currency. Revenue for our Compute Product group was $78 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and up 35% in constant currency.\nAs I mentioned earlier, traffic on our platform has been growing at a substantial rate. In fact, just last week, we set another record when we delivered over 250 terabits per second of peak traffic more than 20% higher than our previous peak reached in February.\nThe Akamai Edge platform continues to be the top choice for large media companies worldwide due to its unique scale and performance. In a recent review of CDN vendors worldwide, IDC said, \"Akamai's balanced and comprehensive portfolio, spanning media and web delivery, emerging edge applications, extensive security capabilities and programmable edge addresses the needs of all enterprise segments and the developer community.\" The report also noted how Akamai's appetite for innovation is showcased by the fact that it continues to expand its services and capabilities beyond CDN to address new areas.\nAkamai is the market leader in delivery by far and the income generated by our delivery business helps to fund our investments in the fast-growing areas of security and compute, including our game-changing acquisitions of Guardicore and Linode.\nOur compute product group includes Akamai's capabilities in compute, storage, cloud optimization, developer tools, edge applications and now, Linode, which joined Akamai on March 21. We're encouraged by how customers and industry analysts have responded to our acquisition of Linode. In fact, several have used the word transformational to sum up the potential impact of our combination in the marketplace.\nThe CEO and Co-founder of Macrometa, a Linode partner that enables web and cloud developers to run and scale data-heavy real-time cloud applications has called Akamai's acquisition of Linode, a watershed moment for the cloud because it fundamentally reconfigures the landscape in many ways. Those are his words. And he says that Akamai provides that layer of reach and distribution in a way that cloud providers are very challenged to be able to do. \"I'm excited about that,\" he said.\nOf course, we're excited, too. Linode was an early pioneer in creating the market for alternative clouds, offering developers a platform to build new applications in ways that are simple to use and affordable. With high performance and competitive, transparent and predictable price points and backed by strong customer support after the sale.\nToday, nearly 3/4 of enterprises are pursuing multi-cloud strategies, which means that new workloads will be cloud agnostic and portable, free to move and choose the best place to be. In fact, IDC just issued a report on workload deployment optimization that urges buyers to consider suppliers of infrastructure as a service beyond the hyperscalers. Our acquisition of Linode was the first alternative IDC highlighted as an example that can offer better cost and performance while retaining the level of redundancy and coverage demanded by enterprises.\nIn the coming years, we expect that customers will have a growing need for a continuum of compute from the cloud to the edge, to be closer where billions of end users are and where tens of billions of connected devices will be, especially as 5G and IoT take hold and grow. Building the bridge that enables developers to move from the cloud to the edge and have one place to build, run and secure apps is a key reason why we're expanding our offering with Linode.\nAt our Analyst Day coming up on May 18, we'll talk more about the potential for substantial future growth in this new and exciting part of Akamai's portfolio as we become the cloud company that powers and protects life online.\nThe soundness of our overall strategy was validated in visits I had with dozens of Akamai customers across EMEA and APJ last month. Common concerns expressed by customers and prospects included the war in Ukraine, the heightened level of cyber-attacks as well as risk to trade and supply chains, energy costs and currency valuations. Customers expressed very strong interest in our security strategy and Guardicore, in particular.\nAs you can imagine, their Boards are asking them how they can prevent a crippling ransomware attack. And Guardicore is the perfect solution. They know that malware always finds a way in. The key is identifying it and stopping it spread before it can cause serious damage. And that's exactly what Guardicore is designed to do.\nMost of the customers I met with were also interested in exploring our cloud compute offering as a more affordable and easier way to build, run and secure their new applications. The tight labor market, employee attrition and the desire of employees to work remotely, we're also top of mind for customers in every location. Several companies that I met with are reducing their real estate footprint, and one of them told me they could only do this because they secure their remote work environments with Akamai's enterprise application access.\nHere, at Akamai, we faced the same macro trends as our customers. But in spite of the headwinds, we feel good about the growing demand from customers for our security and compute solutions, the expertise of our team and the addition of capabilities and talent from Guardicore and Linode, and how all of this gives Akamai not 1, but 2 rapidly growing and highly synergistic businesses, further diversifying our revenue.\nWe've also performed well on the retention of our talent, employees appreciate our flexible workplace policy and culture of teamwork. Akamai scores very high on third-party rankings of the best places to work. I'm proud of the way that our employees have managed and I want to thank our extended team around the world for doing such a great job for our customers. They are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day.\nNow over to Ed for more on Q1 and our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. Ed?\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP, CFO, Treasurer & Principal Financial Officer, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Tom. As Tom mentioned, Akamai delivered a solid quarter in Q1. Q1 revenue was $904 million, up 7% year-over-year or 9% in constant currency. Revenue was led by continued strong growth in security and compute. The strength was partially offset by a significant strengthening U.S. dollar and a slight moderation in traffic growth rate in our delivery business during the last month of the quarter.\nSecurity revenue grew 23% year-over-year and 26% in constant currency, led by a reacceleration of growth in our application security business and continued very strong performance from Guardicore. Security represented 42% of total revenue in Q1, which is up 5 points from Q1 a year ago.\nGuardicore delivered revenue of $19 million in the quarter. Included in our Guardicore was approximately $7 million of term license deals from 4 customers. As a reminder, while the majority of Guardicore deals are Software-as-a-Service and revenue is recognized monthly under ASC 606, some customers, specifically in financial services and health care, do from time to time, require on-premise deployments.\nThese deployments result in term license accounting treatment where we are required to recognize a significant portion of the revenue upfront when the product is delivered or spreading the revenue over the contract term. It's worth noting the impact of these deals resulted in a pull forward from Q2 to Q4 into Q1 of approximately 1 percentage point of revenue growth.\nCompute revenue in Q1 was $78 million, and grew 32% year-over-year and 35% in constant currency. As Tom mentioned, we were very pleased with the initial performance of our Linode acquisition, which closed in late March and contributed revenue of approximately $3.5 million in Q1.\nDelivery revenue was $444 million in Q1 and declined 6% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. As discussed last quarter, several of our top customers are expected to renew in the first half of 2022. Our first quarter revenue was impacted by the renewals of half of these customers, and we expect the remaining customers to renew by July 1. So far, the pricing for the renewals has been in line with our expectations.\nAdditionally, we started to notice the growth rate of traffic on our network moderate a bit in March, specifically in gaming and OTT verticals as some pandemic-related restrictions were lifted in countries throughout the world.\nSales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q1. International revenue grew 11% year-over-year with 16% in constant currency. The negative impact of foreign exchange on our Q1 results increased by approximately $2 million from our February earnings call as the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen significantly in March. Foreign exchange fluctuations had a negative impact on revenue of $4 million on a sequential basis and negative $18 million on a year-over-year basis. Finally, revenue from our U.S. market was $481 million and grew 4% year-over-year.\nNow moving on to costs. Cash gross margin was 76%, in line with our expectations. GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 63%. Non-GAAP cash operating expenses were $295 million.\nNow moving on to profitability. Adjusted EBITDA was $391 million. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 43%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating income was $270 million, and non-GAAP operating margin was 30%. Capital expenditures in Q1, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest expense, were $116 million. This was slightly better than our guidance range as we continue to see greater efficiency on our network.\nGAAP net income for the first quarter was $119 million or $0.73 of earnings per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $225 million or $1.39 of earnings per diluted share, up 1% year-over-year and up 4% in constant currency.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share was negatively impacted by approximately $0.03 in Q1 due to a higher-than-expected non-GAAP effective tax rate. Taxes included in our non-GAAP earnings were $43 million based on a Q1 effective tax rate of approximately 16%.\nThis was approximately 1.5 points higher than we had expected and due primarily to 3 reasons: first, a higher-than-expected mix of U.S. revenue with foreign exchange rate fluctuations, a significant contributing factor along with the addition of Linode revenue; second, an unfavorable change to foreign tax credits in Q1 based on the most recent treasury guidance; and third, a refinement of our previous assumptions related to R&D tax law changes from the 2017 U.S. tax reform that became effective in Q1 2022.\nMoving now to cash in our use of capital. As of March, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $1.3 billion. During the first quarter, we spent approximately $103 million to repurchase shares, buying back approximately 900,000 shares. In addition to share repurchases, in March, we spent approximately $900 million to complete our acquisition of Linode.\nWe ended Q1 with approximately $1.7 billion remaining on our current repurchase authorization. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic in both M&A and share repurchases.\nBefore I provide our Q2 and 2022 guidance, I want to highlight several factors. First, our guidance now includes Linode. We expect Linode to contribute revenue of approximately $100 million and add approximately $0.05 to $0.06 to non-GAAP EPS in 2022. This is unchanged from the assumptions we shared on our last call.\nSecond, the dollar has continued to strengthen meaningfully since we reported in mid-February. As a result, we currently expect a much greater foreign exchange headwind for the remainder of 2022.\nAt current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $100 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis. This compares to our prior guidance of a negative $45 million impact to revenue. This change in FX from our prior guide will also negatively impact non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.16 for the full year 2022. It's worth emphasizing that currency markets have been extremely unsettled and about as volatile as I have ever seen. As a result, it is impossible to predict whether and how the impact could change going forward.\nThird, we now expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for 2022 to be approximately 16%, which is approximately 1.5 points higher than our prior assumption based on the items I mentioned before. The change in tax rate will also negatively impact the full year 2022 non-GAAP EPS by approximately $0.11.\nFourth, as Tom discussed, regarding our business in Russia and Ukraine, it is reasonable to assume that most of that revenue goes away.\nFinally, as mentioned earlier, our traffic growth rate moderated a bit in March, and we've seen that trend continue in April. While traffic continues to grow at a strong rate and is at record levels, the growth rate is lower than we originally expected. Therefore, we are taking a more conservative approach to forecasting our traffic and corresponding revenue for the remainder of the year.\nThat said, we do not believe this trend is a permanent consumer shift or due to us losing share but rather is likely driven by some of the significant external factors we're seeing in the market place and geopolitically. Said another way we believe that traffic growth in online activity will return to more historical norms at some point. So with all those factors in mind, turning to our Q2 guidance. We are now projecting revenue in the range of $890 million to $905 million or up to 4% to 6% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency of our Q2 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to having negative $14 million impact on Q2 revenue compared to Q1 levels and a negative $30 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 75%.\nQ2 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $282 million to $289 million. We anticipate Q2 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $129 million to $130 million. And we expect non-GAAP operating margin to decline to approximately 29% for Q2 due largely to the change in FX and some Linode integration costs.\nMoving now to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $150 million to $155 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the second quarter. This represents approximately 17% of projected total revenue. A significant portion of the increase in the spend this quarter is related to Linode, in anticipation of significant demand.\nWith the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q2 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.28 to $1.33. This EPS guidance assumes taxes of $40 million to $41 million based on an estimated quarterly non-GAAP tax rate of approximately 16%. It also reflects a fully diluted share count of approximately 162 million shares.\nLooking ahead to the full year, we now expect revenue of $3.62 billion to $3.67 billion, which is up 5% to 6% year-over-year as reported or up 7% to 9% in constant currency. We expect security revenue to grow at least 20% or greater for the full year 2022 in constant currency.\nWe now estimate non-GAAP operating margin to be approximately 29%, based primarily on the impact of FX and some of the Internet traffic dynamics I previously discussed. We now estimate non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.32 to $5.44. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 16%, a fully diluted share count of approximately 161 million shares. Finally full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 14% of revenue. It's worth noting our CapEx assumption now includes Linode that we talked about on our last quarter, partially offset by lower network CapEx given the slower traffic growth rate that we now project.\nIn closing, while the macroeconomic environment has become more challenging since our last earnings call and the U.S. dollar continues to be a major headwind for us, we remain very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us, especially in security and compute. As Tom mentioned, I look forward to seeing you at our Analyst Day in New York City on May 18. Thank you. Tom and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter 2021 Akamai Technologies Earnings and Acquisition of Linode Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised today's conference may be recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI'd now like to hand the conference over to Tom Barth, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Barth\n\nHead of IR, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining Akamai's Fourth Quarter 2021 and Acquisition of Linode Conference Call. Before we get started with the Linode acquisition that we just announced, today's earnings call format will be a bit different than normal. We will be presenting slides and associated content, and the link to the webcast can be found in the Events section of our Investor Relations website. We plan to post the full slide deck following the call, and I am now on Slide 2.\nAs you can see from our agenda, speaking today will be Tom Leighton, Akamai's Chief Executive Officer; Adam Karon, Akamai's Chief Operating Officer and General Manager of the Edge Technology Group; and Ed McGowan, Akamai's Chief Financial Officer.\nMoving to Slide 3. Please note that today's comments include forward-looking statements, including statements regarding revenue and earnings guidance. While I don't intend to read this slide, these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and involve a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. These factors include uncertainty stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the integration of any acquisitions and any impact from unexpected geopolitical developments. Additional information concerning these factors is contained in Akamai's filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this call represent company's view on February 15, 2022. Akamai disclaims any obligation to update these statements to reflect future events or circumstances.\nAs a reminder, we will be referring to some non-GAAP financial metrics during today's call. A detailed reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP metrics can be found under the financial portion of the Investor Relations section at akamai.com.\nAnd with that, let me turn the call over to Tom, and he'll start on Slide 4.\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. Today is a very exciting day for Akamai. This afternoon, we announced that we've signed a definitive agreement to acquire Linode. We see this as a tremendous opportunity for Akamai, and we believe that it will be transformational as we expand our business into adjacent markets, become even more strategic for our customers and accelerate our growth and evolution as a company. We'll talk more about Linode in a few minutes. But first, I'd like to review some of the highlights from a very strong Q4 and 2021.\nTurning to Slide 5. Q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year-over-year. Our revenue growth was driven by the continued strong demand for our security products as well as our fast-growing edge applications business. Non-GAAP operating margin in Q4 was 31%, up 1 point over Q4 in 2020. Q4 non-GAAP EPS was $1.49 per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year. For the full year, revenue was $3.46 billion, up 8% over 2020. We expanded non-GAAP operating margin to 32% last year, and we achieved this result while investing for future growth. Non-GAAP EPS last year was $5.74, up 10% over 2020.\n2021 was also a very strong year for cash generation at Akamai. We generated $859 million in free cash flow last year, an increase of 78% over 2020. I think it's important to note that our excellent cash generation has allowed us to make strategic acquisitions like Guardicore in Q4 and now Linode to fuel our future growth while also returning capital to shareholders. In Q4, we spent $271 million to buy back just over 2.4 million shares of stock. Over the course of the full year, we spent $522 million to buy back approximately 4.7 million shares.\nOur primary use of cash is for M&A and offsetting the dilution from our equity compensation programs. Over the past 10 years, Akamai has also engaged in opportunistic buybacks that have resulted in a reduction of our fully diluted share count by about 12%.\nLast quarter, security products continued their rapid growth, generating revenue of $365 million, up 23% year-over-year. For the full year, security revenue reached $1.33 billion and grew 26% over 2020. Security represented 39% of our revenue last year, up from 33% in 2020. In recent years, Akamai has built one of the world's leading cloud security businesses. Our security solutions are highly differentiated and recognized as best in class by our customers, who rely on Akamai to protect their most important digital assets from very determined and highly capable attackers.\nResults in Q4 were especially strong for our Bot Manager solution, which helps to defend against a wide range of automated attacks. Our new Account Protector solution, which provides account takeover protection, also performed very well in Q4 in only its second quarter of availability. Our web app firewall offerings also posted excellent results in Q4. And Akamai was recognized as a leader in Gartner's 2021 Magic Quadrant for web application and API protection, scoring the highest of 11 vendors in ability to execute.\nIn October, we acquired Guardicore to extend our Zero Trust solutions to help stop the spread of ransomware. As a part of Akamai, Guardicore has continued its strong growth momentum and closed major deals last quarter at one of the largest freight railways in the U.S. and at one of the largest telecommunication companies in South America. We're very excited about the value that Guardicore's micro-segmentation capabilities bring to our customers. And as Ed will talk about shortly, we now believe that Guardicore will drive significantly more revenue this year than we'd initially forecast when we announced the transaction last fall.\nOur CDN business generated revenue of $541 million in Q4, down 2% from Q4 in 2020. Traffic on our platform continued to be strong in Q4, peaking at over 200 terabits per second. Our edge application solutions had a great Q4, exiting the year with an annualized revenue run rate of more than $200 million and growing 30% for the full year. Our Akamai EdgeWorkers solution was adopted by a top sporting equipment company, a global business travel service and one of the largest banks in the U.S.\nOverall, we're very pleased with our performance last year on both the top and bottom lines. We achieved our goals in 2021 and then some. And I want to thank our employees for delivering such strong results as they continue to cope with the challenges of the pandemic.\nI'll now move on to Slide 6. As many of you know, Akamai's mission is to power and protect life online. And our purpose in doing that is to make life better for billions of people, billions of times a day. Akamai has been doing this for more than 20 years, enabled in part by a series of market-defining innovations, starting with the invention of content delivery networks in the late 1990s.\nAs you can see on the next slide, #7, we follow this breakthrough in Internet technology with fundamental advances in video streaming, application acceleration and web security. In each of these areas, Akamai was a major pioneer in enabling new capabilities. And in each of these areas, we're still the market leader today by far. Throughout the past 20 years, we've also been a pioneer and a leader in edge computing, beginning with the invention of Edge Side Includes in the early 2000s, a technology that's still used by thousands of our customers today.\nAnd now turning to Slide 8. We're taking the next major step in our evolution by creating the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge, making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications online. As you can see in this afternoon's press release, we've entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Linode, the privately held company that makes cloud computing simple, affordable and accessible. Linode is known for its developer-friendly services, the quality of their support and as a trusted Infrastructure-as-a-Service platform provider.\nBy combining Linode's developer-centric cloud advantages with Akamai's deep enterprise strengths, we believe that we can provide tremendous value to developers and enterprises as they build cloud applications on Akamai. We see plenty of opportunity for a differentiated offering among customers who desire ease of use, wider reach beyond just a few POPs, lower latency, stronger security and greater resiliency, all from a single platform and all at an affordable price point.\nAkamai's highly distributed edge platform has the global reach to enable any cloud application to deliver the best end-user experience anywhere that users or services consume apps, from the cloud to the edge, where more compute services will live as 5G and IoT take hold and expand. The Akamai platform is uniquely suited for workloads that require high throughput, low latency and instant scalability on demand. Akamai has been perfecting this capability for many years, and it's very hard to do.\nAkamai also has the capabilities needed to integrate seamlessly with both DIY cloud apps and third-party cloud vendors as part of the larger cloud ecosystem. We believe that this flexibility will appeal to enterprises that want a multi-vendor cloud strategy to mitigate their vendor concentration risk and to ensure resiliency and seamless availability in case one vendor service experiences an outage. And with Akamai's category-leading security solutions, customers will be able to secure their apps from their point of origin to the edge, all under Akamai's protective umbrella.\nSecurity delivered at the edge offers unique advantages since it enables customers to manage security policies across all their apps and infrastructure wherever they're located. We believe that such an end-to-end security approach will appeal to customers who want increased efficiency and greater resiliency along with lower security risk. The net of all this is that we believe that Akamai and Linode can solve customers' needs in ways that are not addressed in the market today, forming a powerful winning combination that will enable customers to build, deliver and secure their apps on the platform that powers and protects life online.\nMoving to Slide 9. We see the acquisition of Le node as a transformational opportunity for Akamai. This slide shows the way that we presented our business at our Investor Day last year. With Linode, Akamai will expand beyond security and delivery into the world's most distributed cloud services provider with leading solutions for security, delivery and compute, as shown here on Slide 10.\nWe'll offer customers a breadth and depth of services uncommon in the cloud space today, a massive content delivery platform, the best application performance, easy-to-use cloud and edge compute and category-leading security solutions, all backed by expert services and support professionals to help power and protect life online.\nGiven that we're announcing this acquisition at the same time as our earnings, I thought it would be helpful to have Adam Karon join us on the call today to talk more about Linode. Adam is our COO, and he's responsible for running our compute and delivery businesses. Later this year, we'll also plan to hold an Investor Day, when you'll be able to hear from Mani Sundaram, who leads our security business, as well as from other Akamai executives. After Adam speaks, Ed will cover the financial aspects of the acquisition and provide our outlook for 2022. Adam?\n\nAdam Karon\n\nCOO & GM of Edge Technology Group, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Tom. I'll start on Slide 12. Tom just spoke about the 3 core product pillars we have at Akamai: security, delivery and compute. I'm going to focus a bit deeper into the compute portfolio and what we think it will look like after the integration of Linode.\nTurning to Slide 13. I'll start with the existing Linode product portfolio, which is split into 4 product groupings: the first being compute, which has offerings like dedicated and shared CPUs, BareMetal, GPUs and Kubernetes; the next being storage, which provides services like block storage, object storage and a managed database service in beta; next, cloud orchestration; and finally, an award-winning set of developer tools that make it really easy for developers to use their platform. Their products are sold in traditional cloud models using online trials and online purchases.\nTurning to Slide 14. After the acquisition closes, the Akamai compute product portfolio we envision would consist of 5 product groupings: the first being compute inherited from Linode, containing shared and dedicated CPUs, GPUs, Kubernetes; storage, which would contain the block and object storage that came from Linode but would also now include Akamai's net storage; we have cloud optimization that would include Akamai's Global Traffic Manager, Cloud Wrapper and Direct Connect solutions; next, the developer tools we get from Linode as well as the existing Akamai developer tools now make the Akamai compute platform easy and accessible to developers all over the world; and last, but certainly not least, our edge applications, which contain our EdgeWorkers and EdgeKV products that execute compute right at our edge. It will also include our Cloudlet's image and video manager and, of course, our API acceleration product.\nOne of the exciting synergies would be in go-to-market. Akamai's compute products would not only be sold online, but because our current globally located enterprise sales force works closely with the buyers for cloud compute, they have the right relationships, and we would not need to create an overlay sales force. Another exciting go-to-market synergy would be our existing robust and global channel ecosystem that could also take these cloud compute offerings to market. And in both cases, new wallet share within the customer base could be open for future growth.\nTurning to Slide 15. Now let's talk about how we think about compute. Now computing at the edge or near end users and devices brings unique benefits for critical use cases that are in many locations and when data is in motion or ephemeral, whereas computing in the cloud brings other benefits that are usually for applications running in a smaller number of locations and where data is stored and persistent. Our combined platform would have both edge and cloud computing. And since modern applications are built as a collection of services, each with differing compute needs and data needs, only by combining the edge and cloud can we fulfill the varied needs of our customer base like data localization and low-latency containerized compute as well as more typical compute needs that are persistent and in fewer locations.\nThe unique capabilities can come together when we are able to combine Akamai's Edge platform with Linode's cloud computing capabilities and then add in our Global Traffic Manager product to round across multiple clouds and cloud locations our global large private network that efficiently connects cloud and edge locations and messaging, bringing it all together, coordinating cloud and edge services. You end up with the world's most distributed compute platform from cloud to edge making it easier for developers and businesses to build, run and secure applications.\nNow on Slide 16. While Linode and Akamai can solve a number of customer use cases separately, I thought it would be useful to cover just a few examples of the use cases we believe we can help fulfill for our customers with this unique combination of products. In the sports vertical, you could imagine a sports league could leverage the new Akamai platform to deploy WebRTC services to enable a watch-along app that allows a group of friends to watch a game in sync while communicating with each other in real time. And they would be able to do that using our distributed VMs, load balancing and high-throughput egress.\nWhen you think of IoT and fleet management, you could see a shipping company building a distributed app to collect and parts video and telemetry data from trucks and route before backhauling the data to their data warehouse. And they'd be able to do that using our support of MQTT, our distributed VMs and direct connect capabilities.\nAn e-commerce site can leverage Akamai to dynamically personalize their site based on the user's previous and current browsing activity without having to go back to their data lake, all using our managed database services, Kubernetes and Functions as a Service. In the metaverse, we can help create a persistent virtual experience when a game studio needs to connect users from across the globe in a fully immersive VR experience from any console, mobile device or browser, all using our distributed GPUs, low-latency and private backbone. And in health care, a hospital to leverage Akamai to create a platform that captures and archives videos of surgical procedures to help train doctors on new and emerging techniques using BareMetal and our object store.\nNow turning to Slide 17. The combination of Akamai and Linode can be a truly unique offering in the market. We plan to combine the ease of use and developer-friendliness Linode is known for with the wider reach, lower latency, strong security and greater resiliency that are Akamai's hallmarks. We expect our new combined offering to appeal to developers by offering core cloud compute functionality, ease of use and tools they need appeal to enterprises with security, uptime and reliability and drive future use cases as new applications can take advantage of the throughput performance and distribution of a market-leading global network.\nTurning to Slide 18. So with Akamai and Linode, we can have highly secure, elastic compute along with storage capabilities on the world's largest edge network, category-leading security, an edge computing platform for latency-sensitive workloads, all on Akamai's large global private network with a globally located enterprise sales force and robust channel ecosystem, all setting us up to win in the marketplace.\nAnd now I'll pass it to Ed to discuss the transaction details.\n\nEdward J. McGowan\n\nExecutive VP, CFO & Principal Financial Officer, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThank you, Adam. I will start my remarks with brief highlights of our very strong Q4 results, then provide some insight into the financial aspects of the Linode acquisition and then close with our Q1 and full year 2022 guidance.\nSo moving to Slide 20. Starting with the Q4 highlights. We are very pleased with our strong Q4 results, capping off an excellent year for Akamai. Q4 revenue was $905 million, up 7% year-over-year or 8% in constant currency. Revenue was led by another quarter of very strong growth in security as well as strength in our edge applications business. Security revenue growth in Q4 was 23% year-over-year or 25% in constant currency, with Guardicore contributing revenue of approximately $10 million. We are very pleased with the initial momentum we've seen from Guardicore as well as the continued growth of the pipeline. It is also worth noting that our edge applications business surpassed a $200 million annual revenue run rate in Q4 and grew 30% for the full year in 2021.\nInternational revenue growth was another bright spot with revenue increasing 13% year-over-year or 16% in constant currency. Sales in our international markets represented 47% of total revenue in Q4, up 2 points from Q4 2020. These strong results were despite foreign exchange fluctuations, which had a negative impact\nbasis and negative $10 million on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $243 million or $1.49 of earnings per diluted share, up 12% year-over-year, up 14% in constant currency and $0.05 above the high end of our guidance range. Finally, as Tom mentioned, we had an exceptional year from a cash flow perspective.\nMoving to capital deployment. During the fourth quarter, we spent approximately $271 million to buy back approximately 2.4 million shares. Our intention is to continue to buy back shares to offset dilution from employee equity programs over time and to be opportunistic, both M&A and share repurchases.\nTurning now to Linode on Slide 21. As you heard from Tom and Adam, we believe the combination of Akamai and Linode will create the world's most distributed platform for developers and businesses to build, run and secure their applications. Under the terms of the agreement, Akamai has agreed to acquire Linode in exchange for approximately $900 million of cash. The transaction will be treated as an asset purchase for tax purposes. And as a result, we anticipate significant cash income tax savings over the next 15 years. While this benefit will not impact our non-GAAP effective tax rate, we estimate the present value of these savings to be approximately $120 million.\nTurning to Slide 22. We believe that Linode currently has a very attractive financial profile and that there are considerable revenue and cost synergy opportunities in the future. Assuming a late Q1 close, in 2022, we expect the acquisition to: add revenue of approximately $100 million, have no material impact to our non-GAAP operating margin and be accretive to non-GAAP EPS by $0.05 to $0.06 per share.\nLooking beyond this year, we expect Linode to be additive to our non-GAAP operating margin as we continue to capitalize on revenue and cost synergies, including leveraging our go-to-market channel and marketing organizations to accelerate revenue from enterprise customers, realizing significant cost savings by utilizing our very large global private network that Adam previously talked about as well as leveraging our significant scale and supply chain along with our network deployment expertise.\nFrom a CapEx perspective, we expect Linode to add approximately 2 points to CapEx as a percentage of revenue in 2022 as we plan to expand Linode's capacity and locations to meet anticipated customer demand. However, over the long term, we do not expect the acquisition to meaningfully change our previously communicated goal of CapEx being in the mid-teens as a percentage of revenue.\nTurning to Slide 23. As Tom and Adam previously mentioned, upon closing the acquisition, we plan to update our revenue reporting to reflect 3 separate business groups: security, delivery and compute. The first revenue grouping, security, will remain unchanged from the existing reporting of our Security Technologies Group. The second revenue group will be delivery. Delivery will be comprised of edge delivery and services portion of our existing ETG organization but will exclude our net storage and edge application businesses that were previously included as part of ETG revenue. For context, our edge applications business, which had revenue of approximately $196 million in 2021 and our net storage business, which had revenue of approximately $57 million in 2021, will move to our new compute business.\nThe third and final revenue group will be called compute. Compute will include Linode, plus our edge applications and net storage businesses I just mentioned. We believe that with strong execution, we can deliver more than $500 million of annual compute revenue in 2023.\nTurning to Slide 24. Before I provide our Q1 and 2022 guidance, I wanted to highlight a couple of factors to consider for your models. First, the Q1 and full year 2022 guidance I am about to provide does not reflect the revenue and non-GAAP EPS contribution we anticipate from Linode that I previously mentioned since the acquisition has not yet closed. We plan to update our full year guidance to include Linode on the first earnings conference call after the deal has closed.\nSecond, international revenue now represents nearly half of our total revenue. And the dollar has continued to strengthen since we reported in early November. Therefore, we currently expect a meaningful foreign exchange headwind in 2022. At current spot rates, our guidance assumes that foreign exchange will have a negative $45 million impact on revenue on a year-over-year basis.\nFinally, similar to 2019, we have 8 of our top 10 customers renewing in the first half of the year. As a reminder, we define our top customers as anyone contributing revenue of 1% or more. And that customer -- that group of customers contributed approximately 19% of total revenue in 2021. Although we expect to see a negative impact to revenue growth in the near term, we expect to see incremental revenue over time as these customers' traffic grows with us.\nI'd also note that while the cluster timing of these renewals is unusual, the pricing, contract terms are consistent with the broader trends in the market, and these renewals have been factored into our guidance.\nSo with all that in mind, turning to our Q1 guidance on Slide 25. We are projecting revenue in the range of $896 million to $910 million or up 6% to 8% as reported or 8% to 10% in constant currency over Q1 2021. Foreign exchange fluctuations are expected to have a negative $2 million impact on Q1 revenue compared to Q4 levels and a negative $17 million impact year-over-year. At these revenue levels, we expect cash gross margins of approximately 76%. Q1 non-GAAP operating expenses are projected to be $292 million to $296 million. We anticipate Q1 EBITDA margins of approximately 43%. We expect non-GAAP depreciation expense to be between $123 million to $124 million, and we expect non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 30% for Q1.\nMoving on to CapEx. We expect to spend approximately $120 million to $124 million, excluding equity compensation and capitalized interest in the first quarter. This represents approximately 13% to 14% of anticipated total revenue, which is down approximately 4 points from Q1 2021 levels. And with the overall revenue and spend configuration I just outlined, we expect Q1 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.39 to $1.43.\nWe expect security revenue growth to be at least 20% for the full year 2022. This includes an expected Guardicore contribution of approximately $50 million to $55 million. We are estimating non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 29% to 30% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $5.82 to $5.97. And this non-GAAP earnings guidance is based on 162 million shares. Finally, full year CapEx is anticipated to be approximately 13% to 14% of revenue.\nIn closing, we are very pleased with our 2021 performance and are excited to close on Linode and help customers build, run and secure their applications.\nNow I'd like to turn the call back over to Tom to say a few words before we take your questions. Tom?\n\nF. Thomson Leighton\n\nCo-Founder, CEO & Director, Akamai Technologies, Inc.\n\nThanks, Ed. I'll wrap up now on Slide 28. As I mentioned earlier, Akamai has had a rich and exciting history of innovation that has fundamentally enabled the Internet to provide enormous benefit to billions of people around the world. We are truly making life better for billions of people, billions of times a day.\nAs incredible as Akamai's contributions to the Internet have been, I want you to know that I couldn't be more excited about Akamai's potential for the future as we expand our business with Linode and Guardicore, provide even greater value for our customers and shareholders and make life even better for Internet users everywhere.\nEd, Adam and I will now be happy to take your questions."

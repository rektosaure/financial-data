As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen Sagot, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Karen.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Third Quarter 2025 Earnings Review. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com/ir. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors discussed in our earnings news release, during today's conference call and in our SEC filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nPlease read our cautionary statement and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation.\nOur Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today. He will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. They will discuss the team's continued strong execution and performance on key financial metrics as well as our bright outlook and positive momentum as we close the year.\nTopics include raising our full year 2025 guidance midpoint and narrowing the range, increasing our 2025 capital plan, our expectations for incremental investment opportunities and our progress and time frame on regulatory activities.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. We are having a great year with strong results across all of our key financial metrics. Yesterday, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.76 per share compared to $0.73 in the third quarter last year. Core earnings were $0.83 per share for the quarter compared to $0.76 in the third quarter of 2024. For the year-to-date period, our core earnings were $2.02 per share compared to $1.76 in 2024, an increase of 15%.\nOur results benefited from strong execution of our customer-focused investment plan, Pennsylvania base rates that went into effect in January and strong financial discipline. Through the first 9 months of 2025, we invested $4 billion of capital in our regulated utilities. This is a 30% increase compared to last year. We are pleased to be in a position to put even more resources into system reliability and resiliency for our customers.\nToday, we are announcing a 10% increase to our 2025 capital investment program to $5.5 billion. With our strong year-to-date results, we are raising our 2025 guidance midpoint and narrowing our range to $2.50 to $2.56 per share. We remain positive about the opportunities ahead.\nWe are reaffirming our core earnings compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. And early next year, we expect to roll out a higher CapEx plan for the 2026 through 2030 planning period.\nTurning to Slide 6. Load growth from data centers continues to transform our industry. FirstEnergy service territory, expertise and assets are ideally positioned to support the remarkable demand growth and economic opportunity within and adjacent to our footprint. Within our operational area, data center interest remains high. Our long-term pipeline of demand, which includes interconnection requests from serious and reputable customers, has nearly doubled since our fourth quarter earnings call in February.\nOur contracted customer demand increased by over 30% during the same period. The impact of this demand will be tremendous. Based on data center customers who are contracted or in our pipeline, we expect FirstEnergy system peak load to increase 15 gigawatts or nearly 50% from 33.5 gigawatts this year to 48.5 gigawatts in 2035.\nAcross PJM, peak load projections are forecasted to increase by nearly 48 gigawatts by 2035 or 30% of the current peak load of 162 gigawatts.\nFirstEnergy is uniquely situated to support this growing demand through customer-focused investments, specifically in our transmission system. This system is located in the heart of PJM and interconnecting with a broad number of neighboring utilities and encompassing strategic high-voltage corridors that are a vital part of the transmission grid.\nTurning to Slide 7. Earlier this month, we submitted our integrated resource plan in West Virginia that lays out our recommendations to keep power affordable, accessible and reliable over the next decade. The IRP indicates a capacity need in West Virginia beginning in 2027. Our preferred plan provides the flexibility to adapt to the rapidly changing energy landscape while delivering reliable and cost-effective energy to West Virginia homes and businesses.\nKey aspects of the plan include adding 70 megawatts of utility scale solar in 2028, and adding 1.2 gigawatts of dispatchable gas combined cycle generation around 2031, keeping our Fort Martin and Harrison coal plants operational through the planning period and using short-term power purchases to bridge the gap until new resources are online.\nThe proposed gas and solar investments are aligned with Governor Morrisey's 50-50 initiative which aims to boost West Virginia's energy capacity to 50 gigawatts by 2050. We are pleased to pursue generation projects in a state with strong executive, legislative and regulatory support.\nTo provide the best outcomes for West Virginia, we plan to issue a build-own-transfer RFP for up to the full 1.2 gigawatts of natural gas resources. We are also evaluating building a portion for the entirety of this generation on our own.\nIn the first quarter of 2026, we plan to file with the Public Service Commission seeking approval of the new gas generation. The proposed assets represent a 35% increase to our current regulated generation portfolio. This is an exciting opportunity for FirstEnergy, and we are pleased to support customer needs and economic growth in West Virginia.\nTurning to Slide 8. As I mentioned earlier, our transmission system will require significant incremental investments to ensure reliable electric service. At our stand-alone transmission and integrated segments, we need to ensure our critical infrastructure is resilient and reliable, especially as demand is projected to increase in the region. This includes investments to replace aging infrastructure, improve system performance and increase operational flexibility.\nWe are also participating in regional network upgrades, which are the investments awarded through PJM's RTEP open window process. This includes required system upgrades and improvements to address reliability, security and load demands of the bulk electric system.\nOver the last few years, we have been awarded $4 billion of capital investments through the PJM open window process. We recently submitted proposals of capital investments through the 2025 open window to support increasing demand in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. These proposed investments include several new and upgraded substations and high-voltage lines needed to support the increase in customer demand.\nThe PJM Board is expected to award transmission projects in this open window by the first quarter of 2026. Any projects awarded to FirstEnergy in this open window will be included in our new 5-year plan. We now expect transmission investments included in the 2026 to 2030 capital plan to increase by 30% versus our current 5-year plan. This includes increases from reliability enhancements and regulatory required investments to improve the overall health and performance of our most critical assets on the system and to address growing demand and changes in generation in the region.\nOur company-wide transmission assets are a terrific growth engine. Our investments are expected to result in a compound transmission rate base growth of up to 18% per year through 2030. This means total transmission rate base would more than double through the planning period.\nOn the generation side, we have a significant incremental investment opportunity associated with adding the 1.2 gigawatts of natural gas generation in West Virginia by 2031. This project had an initial estimate of $2.5 billion, will be included in our long-term plan after we receive regulatory approval.\nMoving to Slide 9. We're in a strong position to make all of these investments that benefit our customers while keeping affordability a top priority. Today, our bills are on average 2.5% of our customer share of wallet and on average, are 19% below our in-state peers. Even with an increasing investment plan, we will be below our in-state peers for the foreseeable future. However, we recognize that affordability is top of mind for our customers, and that, on average, electric bills have increased 11% for our customers in our 4B regulated states over the last year.\nAs we drill into this, the generation component of the bill is driving 85% of this increase. This type of increase is not sustainable and needs to be addressed with new dispatchable generation. In that regard, we are advocating on behalf of our customers and working with state leadership in our deregulated states on how they can take the lead to drive meaningful change and attract new generation. It's a different story in West Virginia, our one traditionally integrated state.\nTotal customer bills remained flat from 2024 to 2025, and the state is taking proactive steps through its IRP process and 550 program to maintain and expand its generating capacity. We are also working to protect current customers as demand increases from data center developers. This includes utilizing volumetric commitments and customer credit support as needed. Our approach leverages the balance sheet of the data center developers to protect existing customers.\nTurning to Slide 10. We are on track to have a successful year and look forward to a strong finish. Our updated earnings guidance of $2.50 to $2.56 per share is in the upper half of our original range. We are reaffirming our 6% to 8% core earnings CAGR through 2029. We are on pace to execute our 2025 to 2029 capital investment plan. And looking ahead, we see significant increase in our next 5-year investment plan.\nMost of this growth will come from high-quality transmission investments, backed by forward-looking rates with constructive ROEs. We're also excited about new opportunities to invest in generation in a state that is supportive of these efforts. Our value proposition remains strong, encompassing robust growth, consistent financial discipline an attractive risk profile and a 10% to 12% total shareholder return opportunity with upside potential. We are on course, and we are committed to achieving our goals and realizing our bright future as a premier electric company.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon. Jon?\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We had another strong quarter and continue to make excellent progress this year. We delivered on each of our key financial metrics, including core earnings, capital investments, base O&M and cash from operations. You can review more details about our results, including reconciliations for core earnings and business segment drivers and the strategic and financial highlights presentation posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon.\nWe delivered third quarter core earnings of $0.83 per share, a 9% increase versus 2024. This improvement was largely a result of new distribution base rates in Pennsylvania that went into effect earlier this year and total transmission rate base growth of 11% including 9% for our ownership in stand-alone transmission rate base and 16% in transmission rate base within our integrated business.\nAdditionally, as a result of our strong performance this year, especially with our controllable operating expenses, we were able to move a modest amount of maintenance work into the third quarter from future years, which gives us flexibility within our plan. Through the first 9 months of the year, core earnings improved to $2.02 per share, a 15% increase from the first 9 months of 2024. Again, our strong year-to-date results largely reflect the execution of our regulated strategies, stronger customer demand and transmission rate base growth.\nI want to take just a second to highlight the financial performance and growth in each of our regulated businesses. In our distribution business, the $0.20 improvement in year-to-date earnings is a result of the $225 million annual rate adjustment in Pennsylvania that supports the capital investments and operating expenses we are deploying back into that business, as well as higher customer demand and lower operating expenses as we execute on continuous improvement initiatives.\nIn our Integrated segment, earnings improved $0.05 per share or 7% for the year-to-date period resulting primarily from formula rate investments in the transmission system in New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland and higher customer demand, partially offset by higher depreciation.\nAnd finally, in our stand-alone transmission business, earnings increased approximately 7%, resulting from our strong capital investment program, delivering on rate base growth of 9% and which was partially offset by the impact of new debt at FET Holding Company and the full year dilution impact of the FET minority interest sale.\nAs you can see, our performance year-to-date at our regulated businesses is a testament to the execution on our regulated strategies, the constructive rate designs we have in each of our businesses, our strong customer-focused investment programs and a focus on financial discipline.\nThrough the first 9 months of 2025, sales were 1% higher than last year and essentially flat on a weather-adjusted basis. For our industrial class, based on ramp-up schedules of some of our data center customers, we expect to see more meaningful increases in industrial load beginning in Q4 and into next year.\nAs Brian mentioned through September, we deployed $4 billion of customer-focused investments, which is a 30% increase as compared to the same period of 2024. The majority of this increase was associated with transmission capital both at our stand-alone transmission and integrated businesses, which in total was $1.9 billion of CapEx through the first 9 months of the year, representing a 35% increase as compared to 2024.\nFor 2025, we are increasing our planned investments from $5 billion to $5.5 billion, over half of the increase is in transmission CapEx with the remaining on the distribution system largely reflecting reliability and storm restoration investments. The team continues to do a nice job ensuring that our capital investments are targeted at improving reliability and the customer experience.\nAdditionally, even though our CapEx programs have increased significantly over the past few years, we have strong confidence in our ability to deliver, if not exceed these plans given our capital planning process, which is based on known and specific projects with resiliency built into the portfolio and our broad and deep relationships with our vendors and suppliers.\nFor O&M, we continue to track better than planned and largely in line with last year despite executing additional maintenance work this year that will enhance reliability and give us flexibility as we finish this year and look to 2026.\nOur financial performance resulted in a consolidated return on equity of 10.1% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is slightly above our targeted ROE of 9.5% to 10% and represents a 70-basis point improvement from our 2024 consolidated return of 9.4%. Through September 30, to support our capital investments of $4 billion, cash from operations was $2.6 billion, which is better than our internal plan and an increase of more than $700 million as compared to 2024. And we successfully completed our 2025 financing plan with 8 subsidiary debt transactions totaling nearly $3.5 billion at an average coupon of 4.8% and including a $450 million transaction at FirstEnergy Transmission and a $1.35 billion financing at JCP&L in the third quarter.\nIncluding the successful $2.5 billion eCorp convertible debt operating in June, our 2025 capital markets program encompassed close to $6 billion of debt financing all significantly oversubscribed at a weighted average rate of 4.4%, demonstrating the attractive credit profile of our utilities and business mix.\nAnd finally, to close out my updates, we do expect an order in the Ohio base rate case in November. As soon as practical after that, we plan to file a multiyear rate plan to ensure timely recovery of the important investments needed in the state. We are very pleased with our progress as we closed out 2025.\nAs I mentioned earlier, we are ahead of plan on all of our key financial metrics and look to carry this momentum in the final months of this year and as we begin 2026.\nIn closing, the team is extremely focused on the value proposition that we offer to shareholders. We are focused on delivering enhanced customer experience through strong customer-focused investments, which in turn will allow us to provide solid risk-adjusted returns to our investors. The future is bright for FirstEnergy, whether it be industry-leading transmission investment opportunities, significant reliability investments in the distribution system, or the build-out of regulated generation in a supportive state like West Virginia, we have a strong business plan and the right team to execute.\nWe are committed to continuing our positive momentum and delivering value for our shareholders.\nThank you for your time. Now let's open the call to Q&A."

Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen Sagot, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Karen.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nHead Of Investor Relations\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Second Quarter 2025 Earnings Review. Our earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com/ir.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors discussed in our earnings news release, during today's conference call and in our SEC filings could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Please read our cautionary statement and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation. Our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today. He will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nThey will discuss our strong performance on each of our key financial metrics. our progress delivering on our target of 2025 core earnings in the upper half of our guidance range, FirstEnergy's excellent position to enable the economic growth and investment highlighted at the recent Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, the significant long-term investment opportunities within our well-situated transmission operations and our progress on strategic, regulatory and legislative activities.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Before we get started, I would like to express my condolences to those who are impacted by the tragic events earlier this week in New York City. On behalf of the FirstEnergy family, please accept our thoughts, prayers and love as you breathe the loss and celebrate the lives of your loved ones.\nThis morning, I'll provide an update on our second quarter and year-to-date performance and key developments that we believe are transforming FirstEnergy into a premier electric company. GAAP earnings for the second quarter were $0.46 per share compared to $0.08 in the second quarter of 2024. Core earnings were $0.52 per share for the quarter compared to $0.51 in the second quarter of last year. We are on track to deliver results in the upper half of our full year 2025 guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share.\nSecond quarter core earnings benefited from the strong execution of our investment strategy, reflecting new base rates in Pennsylvania that went into effect in January. Quarterly results also reflect increased investments in our transmission system, which benefit from formula-based rates. Our team continues to demonstrate strong financial discipline on operating expenses. Jon will speak more about this in a moment.\nThrough the first 6 months of 2025, we invested $2.5 billion in our infrastructure through Energize 365. We are on pace to deploy $5 billion in capital this year, and we have confidence in our $28 billion capital investment plan through 2029 to improve system resiliency and reliability and to support the level of service customers expect. Providing reliable service is at the heart of our mission. This summer, severe weather strained the system in several of our locations. We are committed to resolving these issues quickly and to making the long-term investments to prevent outages before they happen. Our investment plan supports the customers and communities we are privileged to serve and drives long-term value for our shareholders.\nTurning to Slide 6. At the recent Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh hosted by Senator McCormick, I had the opportunity to address a distinguished group of government and business leaders about our significant investments in and commitment to Pennsylvania. A larger, resilient and reliable electric grid is essential to all of the energy and technology investments announced at the summit. We are proud to be the largest electric utility in the state, which has a constructive regulatory environment to support investment and economic growth. Between our distribution operations and the Pennsylvania portion of our stand-alone transmission business, the Commonwealth represents approximately 35% of our total rate base and earnings. And FirstEnergy Pennsylvania is our largest utility subsidiary.\nThrough our 2029 planning period, we expect to invest $15 billion in the Commonwealth, consisting of $4.3 billion in distribution capital investments to deliver safe and reliable power, $5.5 billion in transmission capital investments for a modern energy system that can support the growing demand and over $5 billion in operating expenses that support good paying electric industry jobs. Our Pennsylvania capital investment plans are designed to improve reliability and resiliency and drive economic development. These investments are recovered through constructive rate mechanisms such as forward-looking base rates, distribution investment surcharges and forward-looking transmission formula rates.\nGovernor Shapiro's economic development strategy is fueling innovation and growth in sectors like AI and energy. As Pennsylvania's economic development strategy materializes, it will require incremental electric infrastructure investments well beyond our current plan.\nSlide 7 illustrates the remarkable growth we are experiencing in our data center pipeline and contracted data center load. Since February of this year, our long-term pipeline for data center load has increased over 80% to 11.1 gigawatts from 6.1 gigawatts. Our contracted data center load through 2029 has increased approximately 25% since February of this year to 2.7 gigawatts from 2.2 gigawatts. So far this year, we have received requests for 40 new large load studies greater than 500 megawatts each. And since the beginning of 2024, we have received requests for over 95 gigawatts of large load studies.\nFor reference, the FirstEnergy system coincident peak load for this summer was approximately 33,475 megawatts. Much of the increase in large load studies this year are coming from the states of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Data center growth, both in our system and from those adjacent to our footprint is likely to require additional transmission investments.\nTurning to Slide 8. Our transmission system represents a significant growth opportunity for FirstEnergy. The combination of our stand-alone transmission and integrated transmission systems spans 6 states and about 24,000 line miles. FirstEnergy is one of the largest transmission asset owners in PJM. Organic investments in our transmission system are expected to drive rate base growth at a 15% compound annual growth rate between now and 2029. During this period, our annual transmission CapEx is expected to grow from $2.4 billion to $3.4 billion.\nIn addition, our transmission system is ideally located geographically in the middle of PJM to garner incremental investment associated with data center load growth, both on our own wires and on systems adjacent to ours. Over the last 3 years, FirstEnergy has secured approximately $3.1 billion of investments through competitive open windows through Valley Link and in our stand-alone transmission and integrated segments. We see the incremental transmission expansion associated with load growth as a recurring opportunity for our company. PJM recently initiated the 2025 open window for reliability investment opportunities that we believe are comparable to those in the 2024 RTEP. Our proposals will seek to build on our record of success in the RTEP process.\nWith the need for a more resilient and reliable electric grid to support economic development and data center growth, we expect transmission investment to increase up to 20% in our next 5-year plan. Moving on to Slide 9 on regulatory and legislative updates. In Ohio, our state President, Torrance Hinton, and his team have done an excellent job moving our base rate case forward. We believe a decision from the PUCO is likely by the end of the year. We are also preparing for the upcoming transition to Ohio's new regulatory framework, which includes multiyear rate cases and forward test years. The new framework supports important capital investments to benefit customers and greater transparency and predictability for our business and investors. In West Virginia, we are preparing to file our 10-year integrated resource plan by October 1.\nIn that plan, we will provide an updated load forecast and our recommendations to address generation requirements. We expect the IRP will highlight the need for new dispatchable generation in the state. Last week, PJM announced the results from its capacity auction for the 2026 to 2027 delivery year. Prices cleared at the administratively set cap, which is 22% higher than the 2025 to 2026 delivery year with no new dispatchable coal, gas or nuclear generation. It is clear that the capacity auction construct does not provide the incentives necessary to finance and build the much-needed dispatchable generation in deregulated states. We will continue to advocate on our customers' behalf for cost-effective solutions that actually add needed generating capacity to meet growing demand and drive economic development in our states.\nMoving to Slide 10. Our progress so far this year reflects our work to optimize FirstEnergy for performance, growth and financial strength. Our leadership team is charged with energizing our culture, delivering improved service to the 6 million customers who depend on us and creating significant value for our investors. Greater accountability means faster results. We are seeing this in the financial discipline that is helping us drive more efficiencies in our cost structure and in a workforce that is more agile and responsive to customers' needs. We are on track for a successful year. We are reaffirming our 2025 core earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share and are on track to deliver results in the upper half of the range.\nWe are also reiterating our 5-year $28 billion base capital investment program with no incremental equity needs in the plan. These customer-focused investments drive our targeted compound annual growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2029. It is our goal to be recognized as a premier electric company that operates at a high level and consistently delivers growth at or above the midpoint of our guidance range. We offer shareholders a compelling value proposition with a strong growth outlook, demonstrated financial discipline, attractive risk profile and a targeted shareholder return opportunity of 10% to 12% with upside potential. We are committed to operating at a high level, delivering stable growth and realizing our bright future for our customers, communities and investors. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our progress so far this year. Through the first half, we have delivered on each of our key financial metrics, including core earnings, capital investments, base O&M, which reflects discipline with our operating expenses, and cash from operations, our low-cost funding source for capital allocation. You can view more details about our results, including reconciliations for core earnings and drivers for individual business segments in the strategic and financial highlights document posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon.\nLooking at our second quarter, core earnings were $0.50 per share versus $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2024. Our results, which are ahead of plan, reflect the new base rates in Pennsylvania that went into effect at the start of the year, formula rate transmission rate base growth of 10% when combining our transmission investments at our stand-alone transmission and integrated businesses as well as financial discipline with operating expenses in our distribution and integrated segments. Full details for each of our business segments are available in our highlights document.\nThrough the first half of the year, core earnings of $1.19 per share reflects strong growth of 19% versus the first half of 2024, with meaningful increases in our distribution and integrated businesses that reflect execution of our regulated strategies, strong financial discipline and higher customer demand, reflecting more normal weather versus the same period of last year. Our financial performance resulted in a consolidated return on equity of 9.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, which is in line with our targeted ROE of 9.5% to 10% and at a 30 basis point improvement since the end of last year. We are very pleased with our results through the first 6 months and remain focused on execution to achieve core earnings per share at the upper half of our guidance range.\nAs Brian mentioned, we continue to focus on financial discipline and continuous improvement, including reducing maintenance costs through more strategic capital investments, focusing on efficiency in our maintenance plans and enhancing customer processes that will drive better service at a reduced cost. Our year-to-date O&M expenses are lower than planned by nearly 4%, and we expect to continue this trend through the balance of the year. The team is fully committed to identifying sustainable solutions in our cost structure that offset inflation as well as building in flexibility to our financial plans as needed.\nOur $5 billion investment plan for 2025 is on track with capital deployment of more than $1.4 billion in the quarter and slightly more than $2.5 billion through the first half of the year. This is 29% ahead of the first 6 months of 2024 with more than 2/3 of the increase in transmission investments in our stand-alone transmission and integrated segments. As Brian mentioned, we continue to see significant needs to invest in our system to improve reliability and resiliency and to support expected increases in customer demand and economic development. Our investment program is funded with internally generated cash flow and utility debt issuances.\nThrough June 30, our cash from operations was $1.7 billion, an increase of 60% as compared to 2024. This reflects recovery of our capital investments and financial discipline, not only with our operating expenses, but also with discipline around working capital, including managing customer collections, vendor payables and inventory levels. Through the first 6 months of the year, we completed 6 subsidiary debt transactions totaling $1.6 billion, with an average coupon of 5%. This includes $1 billion in new money to fund our capital programs. We expect to complete the remaining 2 transactions in our 2025 financing plan later this year. In addition, in June, FE Corp opportunistically executed a $2.5 billion convertible debt offering in 2 tranches and at a 3- and 5-year tenure at an average coupon of 3.75% with a 20% conversion premium.\nThis transaction priced 125 basis points lower as compared to the unsecured debt at FE Corp. Proceeds from this transaction will refinance FE Corp.'s $1.5 billion convertible bonds expiring May 2026, $300 million in short-term borrowings that fully redeemed FE Corp's March 2025 bond maturity and a $300 million January 2026 bond maturity. The remaining $400 million will be used to support our capital investment programs or for general corporate purposes. This transaction provides a natural hedge to our overall financing plan as it reduces the company's 2026 financing risk by more than 40% and as with all holding company financing requirements for the next years. Investor demand for our debt remains strong, highlighting the appeal of our core regulated businesses and a solid balance sheet.\nOur last 3 utility bond issuances, we received significant interest with transactions oversubscribed by an average of over 9x. We remain committed to a strong balance sheet and investment-grade metrics targeting FFO to debt of 14% plus through 2029. Finally, consistent with our commitment and focus on our core regulated businesses, I am pleased to report that we successfully sold our minority ownership position in the Signal Peak coal mine earlier this month for $47.5 million. This is a full exit, and we have no remaining financial or operational liability. Through the first half of the year, we're executing well on our regulated strategies and investment plan and I am pleased with the financial discipline demonstrated across the organization.\nOur key metrics for financial performance through the first 6 months are better than planned and last year, reflecting our commitment to delivering shareholder value. We look forward to continuing this momentum through the balance of the year and as we execute against our long-term plan. We are focused on fulfilling our commitments to all of our stakeholders and delivering on our shareholder value proposition.\nThank you for your time. Now let's open the call to Q&A."

First Quarter 2025 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen Sagot, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Karen.\n\nKaren Sagot\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's First Quarter 2025 Earnings Review. Our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com/ir. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors discussed in our earnings news release during today's conference call and in our SEC filings could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Please read our cautionary statement and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. We're off to a strong start this year with results that reflect solid execution on our regulated strategies, robust capital investments and financial discipline. We're on track to meet our 2025 core earnings guidance we provided in the fourth quarter call. Today, we will review our financial performance and highlights for the quarter, provide updates on regulatory and legislative matters, detail some growth opportunities and review the value proposition we offer shareholders.\nFor the first quarter of 2025, the company delivered GAAP earnings of $0.62 per share, compared to $0.44 per share in 2024. Core earnings for the first quarter of this year were $0.67 per share, a significant improvement over $0.49 in the first quarter of last year. Core earnings benefited from execution across our regulated businesses, including the impact of base rate cases that were approved last year in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and New Jersey as well as a return to more normal weather for the first quarter of this year.\nIn addition, the team did a nice job of managing operating expenses in the first quarter. O&M is in line with our plan, slightly lower than last year, and leadership continues to pursue further cost reductions. Consistent with our plan, we implemented organizational design changes in the first quarter aimed at creating a more sustainable and efficient operating structure that moves management and decision-making closer to our customers, employees and regulators.\nThese changes, which allowed us to reduce headcount, involve flattening layers of management, consolidating functions and better aligning work across the company. We are focused on becoming an agile and effective organization with continuous improvement as a part of our DNA going forward. Jon will provide more details later in the call.\nOur investment program is on track, and we are making positive impact on system reliability and resiliency. In the first quarter, we invested more than $1 billion in our system through our Energize365 capital program. This is an increase of 15% compared to last year. We remain confident in our plan to deploy $5 billion of customer-focused investments this year, an 11% increase compared to 2024 as well as the $28 billion of investments in our plan through 2029. We are pleased to make these investments that will deliver value and reliability improvements to our customers.\nOur refreshed and experienced leadership team is now in place, and they are bringing new energy to the company. Together, we are committed to executing our strategies, meeting our commitments and making FirstEnergy a premier electric company. Reflecting our confidence, last month, the Board approved a 4.7% increase in our quarterly dividend. Subject to continued Board approval, the new quarterly payment of $0.445 per share equates to an annual rate of $1.78 per share. This represents an increase of 11% in annual declared dividends since 2023.\nMoving to Slide 6. I'll discuss current regulatory and legislative activity. First, in Ohio, we are pleased that our base rate case is progressing. Last month, our Ohio companies and various interveners filed responses to the independent audit report that was published in late February and public hearings were held earlier this month. We initiated settlement discussions in the base rate case and hope to continue those through the pendency of the case. Hearings are scheduled to begin on May 5, and we look forward to the case proceeding expeditiously.\nOn the legislative front, there has been a tremendous amount of activity in Ohio with House Bill 15 and Senate Bill 2. We expect legislation to be sent to the governor in the May or June time frame that will provide a transparent and predictable regulatory structure for Ohio utilities. Key provisions of the House and Senate Bills include establishing multiyear rate plans with forward test years, which we view as constructive. We have been in active discussions with the governor, legislators and other policymakers to offer perspective on certain aspects of the legislation. As it makes its way to being a final bill, our focus is on ensuring a reasonable transition to the new regulatory framework.\nIn New Jersey, we recently reached a settlement in our infrastructure investment program, Energize New Jersey, which was approved by the BPU yesterday. The plan includes investments of $335 million over 3.5 years, of which approximately $202 million have formula rate treatment. It includes capital investments in grid modernization, system resiliency and substation modernization work, work that is designed to upgrade JCP&L's distribution grid in targeted neighborhoods with an expansion of smart grid technology. We are pleased to move forward with these investments, which are included in our capital plan.\nTurning to Slide 7. There are a number of opportunities for continued growth in our regulated footprint. In West Virginia, we are preparing our integrated resource plan, which is due by the end of this year. The IRP covers a 10-year period and includes new load forecast for the state as well as our proposals to address West Virginia's future generation needs. As we prepare for this filing, we continue exploring options to build new dispatchable generation in the state, which would allow for expanded growth and economic development. West Virginia's fully integrated regulatory framework provides it with a competitive advantage for economic development and a path for investment in new dispatchable generation.\nUnder the existing regulatory framework, we would be prepared to make these investments to meet West Virginia's economic development aspirations. As I discussed on our last call, we remain excited about the data center development we are seeing across our footprint. Our plan through 2029 includes 2.6 gigawatts of data center demand that is active or contracted with more in the project pipeline that would be incremental to our base plan.\nEarlier this month, Meta announced an investment of more than $800 million to build their new Bowling Green Data center in our Toledo Edison service territory and is expected to come online by the end of the year. This data center will be optimized for Meta's AI workloads. The transmission CapEx associated with this facility is included in the current capital plan.\nIn the first quarter of this year, we received 15 large load study requests for data centers, representing approximately 9 gigawatts of load. 11 of these studies are for locations in Pennsylvania and Ohio. We have not experienced any slowdown of data center interest in our service territory. We are also excited about the significant growth opportunities for transmission investment. During the first quarter of 2025, the PJM Board approved approximately $3 billion of investment for the Valley Link joint venture between FirstEnergy, AEP and Dominion. We believe this innovative collaboration will enhance our competitiveness in future open windows.\nOur investment in Valley Link, which will be owned by FirstEnergy Transmission, recently filed for a forward-looking transmission rate at FERC, requesting a 10.9% base ROE with a 50 basis point incentive and a capital structure targeting 60% equity. The Valley Link investment, when combined with another $300 million recently approved by -- for FirstEnergy subsidiaries, represents a new total company investment opportunity of approximately $800 million.\nTurning to Slide 8. Today, we are reaffirming our 2025 core EPS guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, and we continue to target the top half of that range. This growth, when combined with our current dividend yield, represents a total annual shareholder return proposition of 10% to 12% with potential upside through P/E expansion. We are also reaffirming our 6% to 8% core earnings compound annual growth rate based on our $28 billion capital investment program through 2029. As you would expect in a fully regulated domestic business, our tariff exposure is de minimis, representing less than 0.2% on our $28 billion capital investment program. Proactive management of our supply chain since COVID has resulted in a diversified supplier base with little exposure to single-source suppliers.\nIn addition, the majority of our operations and maintenance expense is labor, which has no tariff exposure. We expect any meaningful increases in our CapEx program to be driven by increased investment opportunity rather than supply chain pricing. We are off to a good start in 2025, and we remain steadfast on delivering on our commitments with stable growth fueled by our strong organic investment program. I am excited about the progress we are making to become a more efficient and customer-focused organization. We are committed to executing our strategy, delivering value and driving results. With that, I will turn the call over to Jon.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We feel very good about the start to the year and our ability to deliver on our commitments with all of our key financial metrics through Q1 in line with or in some cases, better than our plan. You can find more details on our results, including reconciliations for core earnings in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to the IR website yesterday afternoon.\nLooking at our first quarter results, core earnings of $0.67 a share is a 37% improvement from $0.49 a share in the first quarter of last year. Our solid results reflect strong top line revenue growth and financial discipline as a result of the capital investments we are deploying on behalf of our customers. Our rates and investment strategy significantly impacted our Q1 results, mainly from updated base rates in Pennsylvania, together with the full year impact of new base rates in New Jersey and West Virginia, which went into effect during the middle to latter part of Q1 of last year.\nAdditionally, as I'll speak to in a minute, we continue to see the benefits of our strong formula rate investment program, reflecting solid regulatory outcomes that not only contribute to meaningful customer-focused investments, but also provide for solid regulated returns for our investors. This winter weather impacts were on balance, consistent with our normal expectations. By contrast, in 2024, temperatures were significantly milder than normal with heating degree days 15% below normal. The return to a more typical winter in the first quarter of this year resulted in much stronger customer demand as compared to last year, with total customer demand increasing more than 4%, led by a 10% increase in the high-margin residential sector.\nOn operating expenses, O&M was in line with our plan and 3.5% lower than last year, largely due to our continuous improvement and cost-saving initiatives across the company. Turning to our segment results for the first quarter. In our distribution business, core earnings increased $0.10 a share, reflecting new rates in Pennsylvania and stronger customer demand. As a reminder, in December, new base rates in Pennsylvania were approved for a net annual increase of $225 million beginning in January, which includes the recovery of deferred costs and additional maintenance expenses.\nIn our Integrated segment, core earnings also increased $0.10 a share, resulting from approved base rates in New Jersey and West Virginia in Q1 of last year, strong rate base growth of 19% in formula rate transmission programs, higher customer demand and lower O&M. In the stand-alone transmission business, core earnings were $0.14 a share, compared to $0.18 a share in the first quarter of 2024. Rate base increased 10% year-over-year, resulting from our Energize365 investment program, but this was offset by the final quarter of dilution from the 30% interest sale of FirstEnergy Transmission to Brookfield, which closed in March of 2024.\nFinally, in our Corporate segment, results improved $0.02 a share compared to the first quarter of 2024 due to lower financing costs associated with lower holding company long-term debt of approximately $760 million and lower average revolver borrowings of $450 million. Overall, we feel very good about execution against our plan, which resulted in an improvement in our consolidated ROE of 40 basis points since Q4, up to 9.8% on a trailing 12-month basis.\nLooking at the full year, we are reaffirming our 2025 core earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 a share and targeting the upper half of the range. Our 2025 $5 billion investment plan is on track with capital deployment of over $1 billion in the first quarter. This is 15% above last year with the majority of the increase in formula rate programs.\nOur investment program is funded with internally generated cash flow and utility debt issuances. As discussed on our Q4 call, we plan to issue approximately $3.6 billion of debt, of which $2 billion is new money to fund our capital programs. We completed the first of these transactions earlier this month, pricing $600 million of 5-year senior unsecured notes for Trans-Allegheny Interstate Line Company, or TRAIL, at a coupon of 5%, representing a 100 basis point spread to the 5-year treasury rate. We continue to see strong investor demand for our debt offerings reflected the attractive profile of our fully regulated diversified business, combined with our strong balance sheet.\nAnd on financial discipline, as Brian mentioned, the team is very focused on driving more efficiencies and cost reductions compared to our $1.365 billion base O&M plan for 2025. These opportunities include lower back-office spending through the use of existing and new technology, optimizing our maintenance costs through more targeted capital investments and through various supply chain initiatives. We are building this type of continuous improvement thinking into our culture and into the expectations of the leaders across the organization. All of our leaders are highly engaged in ensuring that our operating costs support and enable the long-term objectives of the company.\nSo to close out our prepared remarks, we're happy with the start to the year with solid execution against our regulated strategies, our investment plan and with financial discipline. Our earnings and financial performance across our key metrics are where we expect them to be or even better.\nOur first quarter core EPS of $0.67 a share is aligned with our plan and significantly stronger than last year. With over $1 billion in capital investments during the quarter, we're on track with our plan and 15% above Q1 last year. Our base O&M of $340 million reflects strong financial discipline and is in line with our plan and improvement to the first quarter of last year and first quarter cash flow of $637 million is better than our plan and significantly better than our results from Q1 2024.\nThis is the type of performance that supports our value proposition, including the total shareholder return opportunity that we are focused on delivering for our shareholders. Thank you for your time this morning. We are highly focused on delivering on our commitments to all of our stakeholders.\nNow let's open the call to your Q&A."

Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Karen [indiscernible], Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Karen.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Review. Our Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Please read our cautionary statement and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures on Slides 2 and 3 of the presentation.\nFactors discussed in today's earnings news release, during today's conference call and in our SEC filings, could cause our actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. The appendix of today's presentation include supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy.\nI would like to welcome Karen [indiscernible] to FirstEnergy as our Head of Investor Relations. This is Karen's first of what I hope will be many earnings calls with us. She has quickly become a valued member of the management team.\n2024 was a year of extraordinary structural change for our company, and I'm proud of what we've accomplished. We significantly derisked our business from financial and regulatory perspectives and put together a team of leaders who are focused on driving a high level of performance for customers, employees and investors. We also activated a powerful business model to invest in our electric infrastructure and our people, operate safely and efficiently with a focus on continuous improvement, recover our prudently incurred investments and finance our regulated operations.\nTogether, these efforts are making a positive impact for our 6 million customers, energizing and engaging our employees and supporting our sustainable long-term growth objectives. I'll start today's call with a look at our 2024 financial performance and key milestones over the past year. I will discuss our outlook for 2025 and beyond and review the value proposition we offer shareholders.\nWe delivered 2024 GAAP earnings of $1.70 per share. Operating earnings were $2.63 per share within the forecasted guidance range. Our 2024 results benefited from new rates and investments in our regulated businesses, execution on our capital plan and O&M discipline. Earnings were also impacted by several headwinds throughout the year. These included lower sales volumes, partially due to mild weather conditions versus normal throughout much of the year. In the summer, we also experienced an unusual amount of storm activity that didn't meet the regulatory requirements for deferral.\nIn the second half of the year, our Ohio revenues were below our plan due to the ESP V order, which I will discuss in more detail a bit later. Employees did a great job of navigating these headwinds. A primary focus of our new leadership team is making the company more resilient, so we can drive results consistent with our plan and realize our company's potential. We're working across the organization to drive performance excellence and build a strong culture of continuous improvement. This includes ensuring our processes, performance and accountability are consistent with being a premier electric company.\nThe financial and regulatory milestones we achieved in 2024 and over the last couple of years have strengthened our foundation and reduced the risk profile of our underlying business. The success of the significant regulatory program we launched in 2023 has been instrumental to executing our strategy. We have now completed rate reviews in 4 of our 5 states since the fourth quarter of 2023, derisking 83% of our rate base when including transmission formula's rate investments. Approved rate cases over the past 18 months in Maryland, West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have resulted in a net annual revenue increase of approximately $450 million and allows us to make the necessary investments for a stronger and more reliable grid.\nMost recently, in November, the Pennsylvania Commission approved our $225 million base rate case settlement with new rates effective January 1, 2025. We were pleased to reach this constructive outcome, which builds on service reliability enhancements made in recent years. We also resolved several additional proceedings in 2024 to facilitate our investment plans and recover specific costs. The Pennsylvania Commission approved our third long-term infrastructure investment plan known as LTIP 3 in December. This program will track approximately $1.6 billion of capital targeted at grid modernization and reliability in Pennsylvania over the next 5 years.\nThis includes planned investments of approximately $300 million in 2025 to improve circuits, deploy reclosers and other sectionalizing devices and replace overhead equipment to reduce customer outage times.\nAlso in December, our Grid Mod II settlement was approved by the Ohio Commission. This is a 4-year program that includes capital investments of just over $400 million to bring smart meter technology to all of our Ohio customers.\nIn New Jersey, the BPU approved JCP&L's Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan in November, which will help customers save on their electric bills. Total program costs of $817 million from January 2025 through June of 2027 with an authorized return of 9.6% on program investments.\nTurning to our balance sheet. Completing the sale last March of the incremental 30% of FirstEnergy Transmission's equity interest was a transformative milestone for our company. It marked the final phase of our $7 billion multiyear effort to improve our balance sheet and fuel our investment plan. Successfully closing the transaction was the catalyst for our return to investment-grade status and all 3 credit rating agencies. Across our holding company and subsidiaries, we achieved a total of 40 ratings upgrades in 2024, more than double the number of upgrades in the entire U.S. electric utility sector in 2023.\nToday, all FirstEnergy subsidiaries are investment grade, and substantially all of our companies have their highest ratings in more than 20 years, and we are committed to maintaining these metrics. We put the power of our stronger financial position behind our comprehensive capital investment program, Energize365 to forge a smarter, more reliable grid. In 2024, we invested $4.5 billion in our system through this plan, surpassing our original plan by 5% and an increase of more than 20% compared to 2023.\nTo ensure we're performing at the highest levels, we transformed our organization and implemented an operating model that moves decision-making closer to our customers and the employees doing the work. We then recruited external candidates and advanced internal talent to lead our companies forward. In total, we have placed 24 individuals into critical roles at the Vice President level and above. This includes 9 members of the senior leadership team, including our business unit presidents, as well as other key leadership roles. This new leadership team is applying their deep experience and building a high-performance culture based on accountability, operational excellence, financial discipline and achieving constructive regulatory outcomes.\nAnother milestone in 2024 was resolving certain Ohio legacy proceedings, allowing us to focus our vision on the future.\nFinally, we delivered to shareholders a solid dividend with 2024 declarations totaling $1.70 per share, an increase of just over 6% versus those declared in 2023. The successes we achieved in 2024 strengthen our foundation and support our vision for the company's bright future.\nTurning to Slide 7, let's give a quick regulatory overview, starting with Ohio, which represents 17% of our rate base. As many of you know, the commission's long-awaited auditor's report in our base rate case was made public last Friday. We believe the auditor's report was constructive on several issues and look forward to filing our response in the near term. The Ohio Commission has been diligent in separating legacy issues from traditional rate proceedings and has maintained that diligence in this case.\nThe auditor's report focused mainly on a rate request. We have not experienced regulatory overhang in our interactions with the commission. In regards to the electric security plan, the commission approved our withdraw of ESP V in December. The Ohio companies reverted back to ESP IV on February 1, but without revenue increases for our distribution capital recovery rider. ESP IV should remain in place until ESP VI goes into effect which is expected to be close in time to when the base rate case is effective.\nLike ESP V, our ESP VI proposal focuses on reliability, affordability and stewardship. ESP VI defines distribution riders for the full term of the ESP and proposes increases to the DCR tied to reliability performance to better align with in-state peers and support significant capital investments. In the coming weeks, our Ohio companies will update the pending base rate case to remove provisions that are now appropriately addressed in our ESP VI filing.\nIn New Jersey, we continue working towards a settlement related to our infrastructure investment program EnergizeNJ, which includes investments targeting system resiliency and substation modernization.\nIn West Virginia this year, we will file our required integrated resource plan. Ten-year plan will include updated load forecast and provide options around future generation needs to serve our customers and support economic development. Given the energy needs in West Virginia, we plan to explore building new dispatchable generation in the state. Should this be approved, it would be incremental to our investment plan.\nTurning to Slide 8. Over the last few years, we had remarkable growth in our core regulated earnings, but this growth did not come through clearly because of noncore components of operating earnings. Today, to assist investors in assessing our performance in our core business, we are introducing core earnings, which are the earnings of our distribution, integrated, stand-alone transmission and corporate segments, excluding the earnings contribution from pension and the Signal Peak mine and special items.\nFrom 2022 to 2024, high-quality core earnings have grown by 33%. During the same period, noncore earnings from pension and Signal Peak, which are volatile and often outside of management's control, decreased by 59%. As we have in the past, we will continue to seek an exit from our Signal Peak ownership position. We believe that core earnings better reflect the true performance of the regulated utilities we manage and the necessary corporate functions of the company.\nBeginning in 2025 and for future periods, we will provide guidance for core earnings and core earnings growth rates. For 2025, we are introducing a core earnings per share guidance range of $2.40 per share to $2.60. This compares to core earnings of $2.37 per share in 2024. At the midpoint of 2025 guidance, this would represent growth of 5.5% or 7% when adjusted for the dilutive effect of the 2024 FET transaction.\nOur 2025 guidance includes continued solid growth from investments in our regulated operations. Our new guidance also accounts for several unanticipated factors that developed since our third quarter call. These include the impact of higher-than-anticipated financing costs including significantly higher interest rates. The removal of a 50 basis point incentive from ATSI transmission rates, consistent with the decision by the U.S. 6 Circuit Court of Appeals in January, and Ohio DCR revenue caps, which were frozen at May 2024 levels, consistent with the commission's December order and our return to ESP IV in February.\nIn addition, the settlement in the Pennsylvania rate base calls for incremental spend on reliability-related maintenance activities, which is fully recovered in new rates. Initially, our plan included reductions in O&M in all of our segments so that total baseline O&M, inclusive of the increase in Pennsylvania, would be flat to 2023 and 2024. ultimately, we concluded that doing so would not be sustainable and would not support the long-term operating, regulatory and financial objectives of our company. Our core earnings guidance for 2025 reflects financial discipline from a targeted program being led by the new management team.\nThe program includes organizational design changes as well as programs focused on procurement and contractor staffing. With this program, we expect O&M in 2025 to be flat to 2023 and 2024, with the exception of the Pennsylvania related increases. Jon will provide more detail on O&M discipline later in the call. This approach was developed with the new leadership of our operating companies. In this model, decision-making is closer to the customer, employee and regulator. We will operate and invest consistent with the regulatory outcomes and commitments we have made to our customers in each jurisdiction.\nWe anticipate investing $5 billion in our regulated properties during the year, an increase of approximately 11% over 2024. This investment is enabled by recent rate activity.\nSubject to Board approval, we anticipate annual dividend declarations totaling $1.78 per share in 2025 and a payout ratio of 60% to 70% of core earnings over the planning period. For the 2025 through 2029 investment horizon, we are providing forecasted core earnings compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8%. We're extending our Energize365, $28 billion investment program, through 2029. This represents an 8% increase from our previous 5-year plan and results in a 9% compounded annual rate base growth during the period.\nFor our base investment plan, we do not anticipate incremental equity needs beyond our ongoing employee benefit programs. We are committed to our investment-grade credit ratings. And as we have incremental investment opportunities, we will consider a broad range of financing operations. Our CapEx plan is solid and has the flexibility to handle changes to individual projects.\nWe believe that FirstEnergy represents a low risk, reasonable return investment proposition to investors, with an attractive total return opportunity of 10% to 12%.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Jon for more detail. Jon?\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Brian. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining the call. Today, I will briefly review our 2024 performance, provide additional detail on regulatory matters and discuss our outlook for '25 and beyond. You can find more detail on our results, including reconciliations for core earnings in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon. As Brian mentioned, going forward, we will report our results using core earnings, which reflects the results of our regulated operations and holding company activity, excluding the earnings from Signal Peak and the mark-to-market impact of our pension plan.\nThis was a very thoughtful decision, and as the result of the volatility in these two income streams that, quite frankly, we don't control. For example, in addition to the volatility we've seen since 2022, in 2024, the earnings contribution of Signal Peak and pension was $0.26 a share. Our initial expectation for these contributions for 2025 was a little south of $0.20 a share, but that outlook improved as of the end of Q3 as our expectation for interest rates would remain low and commodity prices on Signal Peak coal were stable. In Q4, interest rates increased significantly, negatively impacting the pension and commodity prices, have significantly decreased, impacting the profitability of Signal Peak.\nThe contribution of these two items have declined significantly from our expectation, and this type of volatility is not sustainable and the reason for the change to reporting on core earnings. To close out 2024, I'll walk you through our results relative to the guidance we provided on operating earnings.\nOperating earnings for 2024 are $2.63 a share, which compares to $2.56 a share in 2023. Results are at the lower end of our revised earnings guidance range due to the impact of unanticipated lower customer demand, in part due to milder temperatures in Q4. The combined impact of our legacy nonregulated Signal Peak investment and net periodic pension income decreased 30% from $0.36 a share in 2023 to $0.26 a share in 2024 and comprised about 10% of our 2024 operating earnings.\nOur full year results benefited from new base rates in our integrated business and growth from formula rate transmission and distribution investment programs, which resulted in a significant improvement across our regulated businesses as compared to 2023.\nIn our Distribution segment, earnings increased $0.04 year-over-year, primarily from higher weather-related distribution sales, lower Ohio rate credits and higher revenues associated with the Pennsylvania disc program. This was partially offset by the impact of the Ohio ESP V order, which negatively impacted results by $0.04 a share, as well as higher non-deferred storm costs.\nIn our Integrated segment, earnings increased $0.29 a share, primarily due to new base rates in New Jersey, West Virginia and Maryland and higher weather-related distribution sales, partially offset by a higher effective income tax rate. The 3 base rate cases in this segment resulted in a significant improvement in the returns in these jurisdictions with ROEs at the end of 2024 ranging from 8.3% to 9.3% on the equity portion of rate base.\nIn the stand-alone transmission business, earnings declined $0.12 a share. Our investment programs increased earnings by $0.07 a share or more than 10% versus 2023. However, this was more than offset by the dilution from the 30% interest sale of FET, which closed in March of 2024. FE owned rate base in this business was $5.3 billion at the end of 2024, which represents year-over-year growth of 10%.\nFinally, in our Corporate segment, losses increased $0.04 a share year-over-year, largely due to the absence of a state tax benefit recognized in 2023. This was partially offset by lower interest expense, reflecting $460 million in debt redemptions at FE Holdco as part of the planned use of proceeds from the FET transaction.\nTurning to the balance sheet. As part of our 2024 financing plan, during the fourth quarter, we issued $700 million in debt securities with registration rights at JCP&L. The bond issuance was oversubscribed by 8x with a coupon of 5.1%, representing a spread of 95 basis points. All in, our 2024 financing plan included five transactions totaling $2.1 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%.\nAdditionally, we continue to mitigate risk associated with our pension plan. In January, we completed a $650 million lift out associated with the company's former generation subsidiaries at 99% of par. In combination with the lift out in December of 2023, we have removed approximately $1.4 billion of gross pension obligations from the balance sheet, representing the obligation and funding risk related to our former generation subsidiaries.\nLooking at our credit metrics, FFO to total debt was impacted by the SEC and OOCIC settlement payments, as well as a historic storm event in Cleveland last August. Excluding these unique payments, which negatively impacted the metrics by 150 basis points. FFO to total debt was 14% in 2024. A strong balance sheet remains paramount to our strategy.\nShifting gears, let's talk about our expectations for 2025 and our 5-year planning period through 2029. The materials posted to our website yesterday afternoon included updated financial outlook, including our base capital plan and rate base growth, which supports our targeted core earnings compounded annual growth rate of 6% to 8% through 2029. Our expanded 5-year Energize365 capital investment program of $28 billion includes increasing annual capital investments from $5 billion in 2025 to $6.4 billion in 2028, resulting in compounded annual rate base growth of 9% through the end of the 5-year period.\nFor 2025, these capital investments will be financed with a combination of internally generated cash flow and debt issued at our operating companies. This year's debt financing planning currently consists of 8 transactions, approximating $3.6 billion, of which $2 billion is new money requirements.\nApproximately 75% of the planned investments are in formula rate or formula-like recovery mechanisms that provide real-time returns. And nearly half of the total investments are in FERC-regulated assets which resulted in -- which resulted in a 10% compounded annual rate base growth in our stand-alone transmission segment and 24% growth in transmission rate base in our integrated business. Our financial results for 2024 resulted in a consolidated return on equity of 9.4% on a rate base of $25.9 billion, which compares to 8.8% in 2023.\nOur financial plan improves upon the efforts we've made to enhance our returns over the last few years, targeting actual returns consistent with allowed returns on a consolidated basis. Capital deployment, continued focus on financial discipline with operating expenses, and regulatory outcomes that support fair returns on our investments, our pillars to our plan. Additionally, through the recent base rate cases, we have made significant improvement in aligning our regulatory returns as disclosed in our materials with our core earnings, with adjustments or differences being more traditional and largely limited to AFUDC equity, the recovery of retirement benefits and items such as nonoperating income and interest synchronization.\nOur well-positioned footprint continues to be very attractive to data center developers. Through 2029, our plan includes 2.6 gigawatts of data center demand that is active or contracted and we are seeing data center growth in our pipeline of just over 5.5 gigawatts through that same period, which would result in an incremental $350 million to our base capital program. Beyond 2029, the pipeline includes over 6 gigawatts of data center activity and even greater potential with a steady influx of load studies we've seen over the past year.\nOur current forecast, which only includes contracted data center demand includes compounded annual sales growth for an industrial class of 5% from '25 to '29 and in the near term, 8.5% from '25 to '27. This forecast would increase as projects in the pipeline become contracted in addition to providing incremental transmission investment opportunities.\nTurning to our financial plan for 2025. As Brian mentioned, since our Q3 call, there have been some developments that have lowered our core earnings forecast for '25 versus our most recent expectation, including higher financing costs, which is comprised of increased borrowings and higher interest rates, mainly attributable to the yield on the 10-year treasury increasing about 100 basis points since the first part of October. Regulatory outcomes that were slightly less than planned, specifically related to Ohio DCR revenues being held flat as part of the ESP V withdrawal and the 50 basis point reduction in the ATSI ROE as well as a decision on base O&M that Brian discussed earlier.\nWe are providing a 2025 core earnings guidance range of $2.40 to $2.60 a share with a $2.50 per share midpoint, representing 5.5% growth off of 2024 core earnings of $2.37.\n2025 is primarily driven by the outcome of the approved Pennsylvania base rate case in our Distribution segment, which resulted in a net annual revenue increase of $225 million beginning January 1 of this year and includes recovery of expenses for additional operational and maintenance work, such as an enhanced vegetation management program as well as storm cost and other deferred cost recovery.\nAdditionally, the integrated segment is positively impacted by the first full year of new rates in West Virginia and New Jersey and continued growth in our formula like and formula rate investment programs. As Brian discussed, we are driving meaningful changes across FirstEnergy to enable our long-term success as a premier electric company. This requires investments to modernize the way we work and improve the customer experience. While we strive for a balance, we are focused on meeting our regulatory commitments and doing this work as effectively and efficiently as we can.\nOur plan supports this foundational work to achieve our vision. For example, consistent with our approved base rate case in Pennsylvania, our O&M expenses in 2025 includes increased scope to drive reliability improvements, mostly through an enhanced vegetation management program. Absent the higher O&M in Pennsylvania, which is fully recovered through revenue increases, our 2025 planned O&M is flat to 2024 and 2023 levels.\nWe are focused on financial discipline across the business, including supply chain optimization, reducing reliance on contractors and staff augmentation and driving efficiencies throughout the entire organization. This is work that is extremely important and will be a continued focus of the management team. We have made tremendous progress to execute on our business model, derisk the company, invest in the opportunities across our businesses to improve the reliability and resiliency of the electric system, and enhance the customer experience. We also have a new organizational structure and leadership team in place to deliver on our commitments to our stakeholders.\nWith a concrete focus on our core business, we are excited about the future and look forward to building on our momentum and delivering value as a premier electric company.\nNow let's open the call to Q&A."

Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Please go ahead, Irene.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. I will review our financial performance and highlights for the second quarter as well as our progress executing our business plan. I will also provide updates on recent regulatory and legacy issue developments, discuss trends we are seeing in the industry and review the value proposition we offer our shareholders.\nLooking at our second quarter results, GAAP earnings were $0.08 per share in the second quarter of 2024 compared to $0.41 per share last year. We recorded a number of special items that impacted second quarter GAAP results, which Jon will address in a few minutes.\nOperating earnings quarter were $0.56 per share versus $0.47 per share last year, an increase of 19%, positively impacting second quarter operating earnings were rate adjustments and associated investments to better serve our customers. Customer demand was also a positive impact for the quarter with weather-adjusted residential and commercial sales up 4% and 7%, respectively. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher planned operations and maintenance expenses and expected dilution from the 30% sale of FET. The items driving growth for the quarter point to the expected trend of improving utility earnings quality. Our capital investments to improve the customer experience increased 22% for the first 6 months of the year. This is reflective of our improved balance sheet that enables our Energize365 capital plan.\nWe are executing well in 2024 and are on track to achieve the goals we've outlined. Today, we are reaffirming our 2024 operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 per share to $2.81 per share. We are reaffirming our 2024 CapEx plan of $4.3 billion versus $3.7 billion in 2023, and we are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term annual operating earnings growth rate.\nJune 1 marked my 1-year anniversary with FirstEnergy. Our employees have made a significant amount of progress in the last year, positioning the company for success. From an operations standpoint, we have organized FirstEnergy into 4 new segments representing our 5 major businesses. We have restructured the company into a strong operating company model and recruited external and promoted internal executives to lead these businesses. These changes put leadership, responsibility and decision-making closer to the customer. We are investing in our people by engaging with our unions to enact mid-cycle pay adjustments to help ensure we are paying competitive wages to our representative workforce. We started an effort to hire journey level line workers to better serve our customers, and we are forming a new apprenticeship program to further support a skilled and well-trained workforce to serve our customers going forward.\nRegarding capital investment, we initiated our new 5-year $26 billion capital investment program, Energize365 to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience. Energize365 represents a 44% increase development over our previous 5-year plan. On the regulatory front, we concluded constructive regulatory engagements in Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia, representing 35% of FirstEnergy's rate base. In Ohio, we currently have 3 traditional rate proceedings in flight. We received a constructive order in May for our ESP V case, but one that left a number of unresolved issues. We have asked for rehearing on those issues and are seeking to obtain more clarity during this phase.\nWe filed a partial settlement agreement in our Grid Mod II case in April, focused on deploying automated meters for all of our customers. Hearings concluded on this noncontroversial issue on July 2, and we are anticipating an order in the fourth quarter. We filed our base rate case in late May, requesting a 10.8% ROE and an average equity ratio of approximately 55%. We will be updating that filing today to reflect changes from the ESP V order and other updates. We expect this case to continue well into 2025.\nIn Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case in early April, requesting a $502 million rate adjustment including an 11.3% ROE and an equity ratio of 53.8%. As is customary in Pennsylvania, we will engage with intervening parties in an effort to reach a settlement prior to the scheduled hearings in mid-August. New rates are expected to be effective January 1, 2025.\nAlso in Pennsylvania, we filed our long-term Infrastructure Investment Plan 3 on July 22. This 5-year plan will result in approximately $1.6 billion in investments to support enhanced reliability. The proposed LTIP 3 is about twice the investment of the prior plan and demonstrates our ability to invest our strong balance sheet for the benefit of our customers.\nFinally, in New Jersey, we are currently in settlement discussions for Energize New Jersey plan, which was filed in November and updated in February. This is a $935 million plan designed to upgrade Jersey Central Power & Light Electric Grid infrastructure, using modern technology and smart devices to help reduce the size and duration of outages. We are currently in settlement discussions and hope to reach a constructive outcome.\nFrom a financial standpoint, the strides FirstEnergy made over the past year to improve its balance sheet were nothing short of remarkable. On March 25, the company closed its transaction to sell 30% of FET. This was the final transaction of a multiyear $7 billion equity raise that has transformed future prospects of the company.\nOn July 17, the company received the last $1.2 billion of the $3.5 billion sale. This cash has been used to pay down short- and long-term debt and reequitize our operating companies.\nRating agencies have taken notice with all 3 rating FirstEnergy Corp.'s senior unsecured rating as investment grade and S&P and Fitch retaining positive outlooks. Last week, S&P increased FET's senior unsecured rating from BBB- to BBB+ and retained its positive outlook. This 2-notch upgrade reflects FET's enhancements in liquidity, governance and cash management practices and places FET's senior unsecured credit rating at or above the rings of our fully regulated utilities.\nThis significantly strengthened balance sheet represents a major transformation for FirstEnergy, as well as a significant differentiator from many of our peers. It is on the basis of this balance sheet that we were able to introduce Energize365 and make the investments needed to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience. Many of our peers still have to raise significant amount of equity to continue to grow or we'll have to issue large debt volumes higher rates. FirstEnergy does not have to do either. The balance sheet component of our transformation is complete. We are now focused on executing our operating and regulatory plans for the benefit of our customers.\nTurning to Slide 9. Let's talk about data centers. We are getting a fair number of load study requests from data center developers across our service area. Large load studies for this type of development have more than doubled from last year. We are fortunate that in much of our service territory, we have excess transmission capacity to serve this and other economic development priorities. This capacity comes from previous manufacturing processing and generating facilities.\nWe are also participating in the PJM open windows related to data center and other load growth. We were successful last year in the Window 3 RTEP selecitation process, and we'll be submitting proposals for the current one. Generation resource adequacy has become a very hot topic over the past year. It appears that load growth and baseload generating retirements could outpace dispatchable generating resource additions. You know in 4 of our 5 states, we are wires-only utilities. We are working with customers, states and other interested parties to help ensure there is adequate capacity to meet growing load and enable the energy transition.\nFinally, regarding potential retail tariff changes, we are reviewing our current tariffs and think there is enough flexibility to us to negotiate terms for us to serve new loads and at the same time, maintain existing customer protections. We need to be able to serve all loads affordably. If we find the need for future tariff adjustments, we will file them on a state-by-state basis.\nDuring the second quarter, we made significant progress resolving legacy issues. On July 21, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Ohio filed a status report confirming that FE successfully completed the obligations, it was required to perform for a 3-year period under the deferred prosecution agreement, including remediation measures and the implementation of a compliance and ethics program. As a result, the report requirements related to those obligations have ended.\nAs provided under the DPA, we will continue to fully cooperate with the DOJ on other outstanding matters, and we will continue other reporting obligations. This was an important step as we put the past behind us and move forward as a stronger company with the robust culture of ethics, integrity and compliance.\nWe have reached an agreement in principle with the SEC staff subject to the approval of the commission which would settle the SEC security claims against FirstEnergy. The proposed settlement is based on the fact set forth in the DPA. We have recorded a reserve of $100 million for this settlement. Similarly, we are in the final stages of a resolution with the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission. The resolution is expected to include a non-prosecution agreement based on the facts and the DPA and is expected to resolve the Ohio Attorney General Civil Case against FirstEnergy. We have recorded a reserve of $19.5 million in anticipation of resolving both Ohio matters.\nThe 3 docketed cases related to these legacy issues continue to move forward at the PUCO. An audit report is due on August 28 on the political and charitable spending review. Discovery continues and hearing is scheduled for October 9 on the corporate separation review. Discovery is ongoing with a hearing scheduled for February 3 on the Rider DMR/DCR audit. We continue to cooperate in these audits and appreciate that these cases are the appropriate form for a review of this activity and not our business as usual rate cases.\nLet's take a moment to review FirstEnergy's value proposition to shareholders. Our 6% to 8% operating earnings growth rate is predicated on an average annual growth in rate base of 9%. Our ability to invest in our system for the benefit of our customers as enabled by our strong balance sheet. We have the need, opportunity and means to make the necessary investments to enable the energy transition and improve reliability and the customer experience.\nFirstEnergy has an attractive low-risk profile that supports solid BBB credit metrics. We are targeting a 14% to 15% FFO to debt profile over the horizon and do not anticipate incremental equity needs for our Energize365 investment plan beyond our employee benefit programs. The increase of traditional utility earnings means that our earnings quality has improved and our customer affordability is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future. Our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate combined with our dividend, represent a total shareholder return proposition of 10% to 12%. We have made significant progress on strengthening our balance sheet, restructuring our business putting legacy issues behind us and focusing on our operational, regulatory and financial plans. The men and women of FirstEnergy are singularly focused on that execution and serving our customers.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jon, I would like to mark 2 significant management transitions for FirstEnergy. 2 executives have recently notified me of their decision to retire after many years of service to the company. Chris Walker, our Chief Human Resources Officer, will be retiring with nearly 39 years of service. I would like to thank Chris personally for all she has done for me over the past year, and also thank her for her many years of dedicated service on behalf of our employees. We owe Chris ahead of gratitude and wish her well in retirement.\nAfter more than 40 years of service, Irene Prezelj has decided to retire. Many of you have gotten to know Irene as our Head of Investor Relations and Commissions. For many years, Irene has been the face of the company to investors in the public alike. We are grateful to Irene for her leadership and dedication to serving our employees, investors, customers and the public. We wish her the best going forward.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jon.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I also want to extend my sincere gratitude and best wishes to Chris and Irene. They have been great to work with over the years and have always been there for me and the employees of the company. I wish them every bit of happiness in their retirement.\nToday, I'll review our financial performance, discuss economic and customer trends and provide an update on our regulatory and financial initiatives. Let's start by reviewing the larger special items that impacted our second quarter GAAP results. These include increased asset retirement obligations recognized in connection with the planned transfer of a legacy impoundment site to a third-party and the impact from the new EPA legacy coal combustion residuals rule. Costs associated with redeeming high-cost debt using the proceeds from the FET transaction, charges connected to the anticipated resolution of the OOCIC and SEC investigations, partially offset by the receipt of insurance proceeds associated with the shareholder derivative lawsuit settlement and regulatory charges resulting from a commitment in the Ohio ESP V order.\nWe continue to see strong execution on our Energize365 capital investment program, solid financial discipline and a culture of continuous improvement. And because of that, we delivered second quarter operating earnings of $0.56 per share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance and compares to $0.47 per share for the second quarter of 2023. The results primarily reflect new base rates in our integrated business, strong invested capital across all of our businesses and formula rate investment programs and significantly higher year-over-year customer demand.\nLooking at our segment results for the quarter, in our distribution business, operating earnings were $0.22 per share compared to $0.24 per share in the second quarter of last year. This reflects planned increases in operating expenses we discussed previously, partially offset by higher customer demand and rate base growth rate investment programs and a lower customer rate credit in Ohio as part of our 2021 earnings test settlement.\nIn our Integrated segment, operating earnings were $0.21 per share versus $0.12 per share in the second quarter of last year. Results primarily reflect new base rates in Maryland, West Virginia and New Jersey that went into effect over the past 8 months. Rate base growth in distribution and transmission formula rate investment programs and the impact of higher customer demand, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Operating earnings in our stand-alone transmission segment were $0.14 per share compared to $0.18 per share in the second quarter of 2023. Year-over-year rate base increased more than 10% as a result of our transmission investment program, but this was offset by the dilution from the 30% interest sale of FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield, which closed in March of this year.\nFinally, in our Corporate segment losses were $0.01 per share versus $0.07 per share in the second quarter of 2023. This improvement is the result of ongoing lower financing costs from the redemption of high-cost debt. More detail on our second quarter and year-to-date results can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website yesterday afternoon. Looking ahead, we are providing guidance of $0.85 to $0.95 per share for the third quarter, which reflects the continued impacts of new base rates in our integrated business, continued rate base growth and higher customer demand partially offset by a lower planned earnings contribution from Signal Peak.\nAnd as Brian mentioned earlier, we are reaffirming our 2024 guidance of $2.61 to $2.81 per share. as well as our long-term 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. In his remarks, Brian shared a look at the trends related to data center growth in our service territory. I want to expand on that by taking a quick look at some of the broader economic and load activity in our region. Recent economic trends over the past year are positive in our region, including GDP that has averaged just over 2% for the past year, and employment growth of just under 1.5% over the past 12 months. And from a customer demand perspective, we're seeing positive weather-adjusted customer demand of 1% over the last 12 months. primarily resulting from increases of 1.3% in the commercial and 1.1% in the industrial customer classes with demand in the auto and services sectors, up 14% and 7%, respectively. And so we believe we're in a great position to serve our customers and our investment program will adjust as needed to ensure capacity and reliable service.\nFrom a financing plan perspective, earlier this month, we received the remaining $1.2 billion in proceeds from the $3.5 billion, 30% FET interest sale to Brookfield. You'll recall that we received the initial proceeds of $2.3 billion when the transaction closed in March, the remaining $1.2 billion in interest-bearing notes that were extinguished with Brookfield's final payment on July 17. We're deploying those proceeds in a credit accretive manner, consistent with our plan to further transform our balance sheet and support our Energize365 grid investment program.\nAs we've discussed, the sale completes a series of transactions over the last 2.5 years that resulted in nearly $7 billion in equity capital at an equivalent share price of $87 a share or 36x trailing PE multiple. In total, these proceeds were used for over $3 billion in high-cost debt reductions at FE Corp, including the remaining $460 million of the 2031 bonds in the second quarter, nearly $2 billion in utility long-term debt redemptions and $2 billion to pay off short-term debt that would have otherwise been financed with long-term debt at our utilities.\nFollowing the closing of this transaction in March, our corporate credit rating was upgraded by Moody's and S&P, restoring it to investment grade at all 3 rating agencies. The credit ratings at our subsidiaries were also upgraded and this momentum continued last week as S&P further upgraded FET and its subsidiaries. Going forward, our focus is on continued execution of our plan, achieving cross-supportive regulatory outcomes, moving past legacy issues and financing our robust investment plan in a credit-supportive manner, consistent with a BBB flat credit profile.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, we launched a request for proposal for a second pension lift-out transaction to eliminate the remaining $700 million in nonregulated pension liability. This transaction is successful would eliminate all nonregulated pension liability, further reduce pension volatility and improve the quality of earnings of the company. Recall that in December of last year, we executed the first pension lift-out transaction, removing approximately $720 million of pension liability at $0.95 on the dollar.\nTurning now to recent regulatory activity. In Ohio, we filed our base rate review on May 31, request was for a $94 million rate adjustment on rate base of $4.3 billion, a 10.8% proposed on equity and a 55% equity capitalization ratio based on a 2024 test year. The rate adjustment supports recovery investments in the distribution system and customer experience enhancements while keeping rates affordable for customers. The case includes recovery of investments in Riders DCR and AMI, which includes the Grid Mod I capital investments in base rates and resetting those riders to zero. It also includes a request to change the recovery of pension costs from service cost only to total pension costs, including previously incurred actuarial losses as well as a request for a pension tracking mechanism to avoid volatility in the future. And it includes recovery of other costs previously incurred, including the major storm restoration costs and a program to convert street lights to LEDs.\nToday, the Ohio companies will file an update to the base rate case review filing with an updated rate request. The update is necessary to include the impacts addressed in the May 15 ESP V order and to update 2024 test year financial information through May 31 to reflect actual operating results.\nOur initial request represents an estimated overall bill impact for typical residential customers ranging from a rate decrease of 1.3% in Toledo Edison to a 3.5% increase in CEI or an average increase of 1.4% across Ohio.\nAlso in Ohio, on May 15, the PUCO issued an order approving our ESP V with modifications, which became effective June 1. The order extended Rider DCR through the conclusion of the base rate case, but excluded certain investments from recovery in Rider DCR. The order also provided for recovery of vegetation management expenses for the first 2 years of the ESP and prospective deferral of major storm expenses. While we appreciate the support for key terms of our ESP V in the near term, the order did not provide clarity regarding these key terms of the ESP for the entire 5-year period with many directed to the base rate case for resolution.\nWe subsequently filed an application for rehearing seeking greater certainty regarding key terms as well as proposed modifications which included shortening the ESP V term to 3 years, providing full recovery of investments in the DCR through the conclusion of the base rate case and other proposals that preserve the economic value of the order for customers.\nEarlier this month, the PUCO granted the applications for rehearing filed by all parties for the purposes of further consideration. This step gives the PUCO more time to make its final decision, their statutory deadline for the decision. The summer hearings were held in our Ohio Grid Mod II settlement, and we anticipate an order during the fourth quarter.\nIn Pennsylvania, earlier this month, we filed the third phase of our long-term infrastructure improvement plan known as LTIP III, which part of our Energized 365 investment program. LTIP III includes a total projected investments of $1.6 billion over 5 years, building on the projects completed in LTIP I and LTIP II third phase of the program supplements reliability investments and includes both grid modernization and system resiliency projects. This includes targeted investments to accelerate infrastructure improvements and help enhance service reliability for the more for more than 2 million customers in the state while remaining focused on affordability. Investments are recovered through a distribution system improvement charge, or DISC based on actual capital structure and the benchmark ROE, which is currently 9.8%. The cumulative average residential customer rate impact recovered through DISC is $2.88 or a 2% increase. Pending PUCO approval, we expect capital deployment to begin in the first quarter of 2025 with DISC revenues estimated to begin in the second quarter of 2026.\nAlso in Pennsylvania, in mid-August, hearings will begin in our base rate review filed in April. As we discussed on first quarter's call, this is a request for a $502 million rate adjustment on rate base of $7.2 billion, with an 11.3% proposed return on equity and a 53.8% equity capitalization ratio. The review built on our service liability enhancements in Pennsylvania with additional investments in a smart, modern electric grid and customer-focused programs while keeping rates comparable to other utilities in the state. Key components include implementing a 10-year enhanced vegetation management program to reduce tree-caused outages, reduced outage restoration time and reduce future maintenance costs, recovery of costs associated with major storms, COVID-19 and E-Street light conversions, changing pension recovery from average cash contributions to traditional pension expense, including previously recognized actuarial losses. The review also includes a blended federal statutory tax rate of approximately 27%, but also continues to provide customer savings from previous legislative changes to federal and state tax rates.\nAdditionally, the application proposes a pension OPEB normalization mechanism to track and defer differences between actual and test year expense to reduce volatility from the pension. And as Brian mentioned, we are engaging with the intervening parties in an effort to reach settlement prior to the scheduled hearings in mid-August. Finally, in addition to the settlement discussions on our Energize New Jersey infrastructure improvement proposal, we are also engaged in settlement discussions for our New Jersey Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan. This plan, which was filed with the BPU in December 2023, covers the period from January 1, 2025, through June 30, 2027, with a proposed budget of approximately $964 million. It consists of a portfolio of programs addressing energy efficiency, peak demand reduction and building decarbonization with recovery of lost revenues and provides a return on the investments. The BPU suspended the procedural schedule July 1 in light of these settlement discussions. A final BPU decision and order is required no later than October 15 of this year.\nWe're making good progress in 2024, we're executing well. We have a strong strategy and opportunities to continue our positive momentum and growth.\nThank you for your time today, and I'll open the call to your questions."

Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he will be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com.\nToday's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in FirstEnergy. This morning, I will review financial performance and highlights for the first quarter, provide some updates on key regulatory developments and review FirstEnergy's shareholder value proposition.\nFor the first quarter, FirstEnergy delivered GAAP earnings of $0.44 per share compared to $0.51 per share in 2023. Operating earnings were $0.55 per share, $0.02 higher than the midpoint of guidance for the quarter versus $0.60 per share last year.\nIt is important to note that higher revenues from investments to better serve our customers and more favorable weather compared to last year were offset by higher planned O&M expenses and the expected decrease in Signal Peak earnings resulted in higher quality utility earnings for the quarter. Jon will provide additional details later in the call.\nDuring the last earnings call, we announced our 5-year $26 billion investment program to better serve our customers, branded as Energize365. That plan, combined with our ongoing regulatory updates and our continuous improvement program, give us the confidence to affirm our 6% to 8% long-term operating growth rate. We are also affirming our operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 per share for 2024. We are providing guidance of $0.50 to $0.60 per share for the second quarter of this year.\nOur confidence in the future gave us the opportunity to increase our dividend again to $0.425 per share payable in June. On an annual basis, this would represent an increase of 6.25% versus dividends declared in 2023.\nWe are continuing to make progress on recruiting and hiring executives to run our 5 primary businesses. We expect to make announcements in the near term.\nEarlier this month, we announced the hiring of John Combs as our Senior Vice President of Shared Services. John was most recently an SVP and Chief Technology Officer at JPMorgan Chase. John's deep background in technology and leadership as well as his financial acumen, make him the perfect person to lead our IT, supply chain, flight operations and corporate and cybersecurity organizations. We are thrilled to welcome John to the team.\nOn March 25, FirstEnergy closed on the final phase of our multiyear $7 billion equity raise to improve our balance sheet and fuel our growth. We received $2.3 billion of the $3.5 billion proceeds with a balance in interest-bearing notes that are expected to be repaid this year. We are excited to have Brookfield as our partner in the fast-growing transmission segment of our business.\nThe impact of this transaction on FirstEnergy, as the final phase of the $7 billion equity raise, cannot be overstated.\nThe total equity on the balance sheet increased 25% in the 3 months ended March 31. That's truly remarkable for a company of FirstEnergy's size.\nFor the first time in this company's history, we are fully regulated, mostly wires, with a strong balance sheet that enables organic investment in our utility companies to improve reliability and our customers' experience.\nFollowing the closing of the transaction, Moody's recognized the impact of the company by upgrading FirstEnergy Corp.'s senior unsecured rating to investment grade. On Tuesday, S&P upgraded FirstEnergy's corporate credit rating to BBB and our senior unsecured rating to investment grade with a positive outlook. The balance sheet strength and clean business model represented on this slide capture a lot about what excited me to come to FirstEnergy.\nLet me provide some updates on key regulatory initiatives. People have asked us how they will know when we are making progress on our regulatory plan. I tell them to look for milestones where we are getting fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes. During the quarter, we proved that we can obtain constructive regulatory outcomes across our jurisdictions.\nWe received approval of our rate case settlement in New Jersey, authorizing a 9.6% ROE and a 52% equity capitalization ratio. Even with this increase, JCP&L's rates remain 26% below our in-state peers.\nThe West Virginia Public Service Commission approved constructive depreciation and base rate case settlements. In addition, they approved an expanded net energy fuel charge settlement for recovery of about $0.25 billion through 2026 with no disallowances.\nFor investors looking for milestones that FirstEnergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes, we provided several examples during the quarter. Jon will provide additional detail on the results in his remarks.\nFor the balance of the year, we have an active regulatory schedule. In Ohio, we filed a settlement in our Grid Mod II case, asking for the opportunity to complete our advanced meter infrastructure rollout over 4 years. A hearing is scheduled for June 5. Approval of this noncontroversial settlement will bring us to parity with our in-state peers.\nWe are expecting approval of our ESP V filing this quarter, and we will file a base rate case next month. That case will seek a modest increase in base rates, but we'll reset a number of riders since the last base rate case.\nEarlier this month, in Pennsylvania, we filed a base rate case requesting an 11.3% ROE and a 53.8% equity ratio. We expect a decision in December, with rates effective in January of next year.\nBefore I turn the call over to John, I would like to highlight the value proposition that FirstEnergy offers to shareholders. We have completed the multiyear overhaul of our balance sheet and have achieved investment-grade status at both Moody's and S&P.\nOur strong balance sheet differentiates FirstEnergy from many of our industry peers and that we do not anticipate incremental equity needs to fund our $26 billion investment plan. Our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate, combined with our dividend yield, represent a total shareholder return potential of 10% to 12%.\nOur earnings quality is vastly improved, driven by growth in our core regulated businesses and our customers' affordability remains strong throughout the investment period.\nAt the end of a significant business transition led by our Board of Directors and management team, FirstEnergy represents a high-quality and attractive risk value proposition to our shareholders.\nWith that, I will turn the call over to Jon.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite another mild winter, we are off to a good start this year with strong execution and financial discipline from our team that resulted in operating earnings above the midpoint of our guidance. And we are reaffirming our full year operating earnings guidance range of $2.61 to $2.81 a share, which represents a 7% increase versus the midpoint of our 2023 guidance.\nToday, I'll review financial performance for the quarter, our progress on key strategic regulatory initiatives and close with some details around the balance sheet.\nLooking at our financial performance for the quarter. Operating earnings were $0.55 a share, which is above the midpoint of our guidance despite the mild temperatures this winter that impacted retail sales and includes a planned increase and operating expenses as discussed on the fourth quarter call. This compares to 2023 1st quarter operating earnings of $0.60 a share.\nAs we also mentioned on the fourth quarter call, earnings growth this year will be back-end loaded, given the effective dates of rate cases in West Virginia and New Jersey, and planned increases in operating expenses in the first half of this year associated with the timing of maintenance work. Our first quarter results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night.\nAt a consolidated level, first quarter earnings of $0.55 per share were impacted by higher planned operating expenses and improved earnings quality from an expected decrease in earnings from Signal Peak, partially offset by increases from new base rates and rate base growth in formula rate programs. And although customer demand was not a significant driver year-over-year given the mild winter in the first quarter of 2023, retail sales were down 6% versus planned, primarily associated with heating degree days that were 14% below normal, impacting results by $0.07 a share versus our plan.\nSo let's also take a few minutes to review our segment results, which you will notice in our filings and presentation, the segment reporting change, consistent with how we're managing the business. We are now organized into easy-to-follow segments of distribution, integrated stand-alone transmission and corporate. This streamlined and transparent reporting places entire companies and individual segments, simplifying reporting and eliminating reconciliations.\nIn our distribution business, operating earnings were $0.30 a share versus $0.33 per share in the first quarter of last year, impacted largely by the planned increase in operating expenses I mentioned earlier, specifically around vegetation management work, partially offset by an increase in rates from capital investment programs and lower rate credits in Ohio.\nIn our integrated segment, operating earnings were $0.15 a share compared to $0.14 per share in the first quarter of last year. Results increased largely due to the implementation of base rates in all 3 jurisdictions in this business and rate base growth in formula rate programs, including integrated transmission investments, partially offset by planned increases in operating expenses.\nIn our stand-alone transmission segment, operating earnings were $0.18 a share versus $0.17 per share in the first quarter of 2023, resulting from a 9% year-over-year rate base growth from our formula rate transmission capital investment program.\nAnd finally, in our corporate segment, losses were $0.08 per share versus $0.04 per share in the first quarter of 2023, primarily reflecting the lower planned earnings contribution from our 1/3 ownership interest in the Signal Peak mining operation, decreasing from $0.08 per share in the first quarter of last year to $0.03 per share in the first quarter of this year.\nTurning briefly to capital investments. First quarter CapEx totaled just under $900 million, an increase of nearly 22% versus 2023 levels and slightly ahead of our plan across each of our businesses, focusing on grid modernization, transmission and infrastructure renewal investments. As a reminder, CapEx for this year is planned at $4.3 billion versus $3.7 billion in 2023.\nTurning to regulatory activity. We are very pleased with the outcomes in the recent base rate case orders, consistent with our plan that allows for solid regulated returns for our investors while keeping rates affordable for customers. And we're committed to our customers and our communities to enhance reliability performance and support the energy transition through our Energize365 capital investment program.\nAs Brian mentioned, in mid-February, the New Jersey BPU issued a final order on JCP&L's base rate case. The new rates, which customers will see effective June 1 and continue to be well below our in-state peer average, represent an $85 million rate adjustment on rate base totaling $3 billion, an ROE of 9.6% and a 52% equity capitalization ratio. And we are currently working through our Energize New Jersey infrastructure improvement proposal initially filed in November, including over $900 million in capital investments over 5 years aimed to enhance reliability and modernize the distribution system.\nIn West Virginia, on March 26, we received a final order from the Public Service Commission on our base rate case with rates effective March 27. The case resulted in a $105 million rate adjustment on rate base of $3.2 billion, an allowed ROE of 9.8% and a 49.6% equity ratio. Rates for our West Virginia customers remain about 22% below our in-state peers.\nAdditionally, as Brian mentioned, in West Virginia, we received an order on our ENEC case for an increase of $55 million. We have been successful in reducing the $255 million deferral down to $168 million with full recovery expected by 2026.\nNow let's move on to current activity with Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, we filed a base rate case requesting a $502 million rate adjustment on rate base of $7.2 billion, an 11.3% proposed return on equity and a 53.8% equity capitalization ratio. The case builds on our service reliability enhancements in the state with additional investments in a smart, modern energy grid and customer-focused programs while keeping rates comparable to other Pennsylvania utilities.\nKey components of the case include implementing a 10-year enhanced vegetation management program to reduce [ tree caused ] outages reduce outage restoration time and reduce future maintenance costs, recovery of costs associated with major storms, COVID-19 and LED streetlight conversions and changing pension and OPEB recovery to the delayed recognition method, which is based on traditional pension expense with amortization of previously recognized cumulative actuarial losses.\nThe case also includes a blended federal state statutory tax rate of approximately 27%, but also continues to provide customer savings from previous changes to federal and state tax rates.\nAdditionally, the application proposes a pension OPEB normalization mechanism to track and defer differences between actual and test year expense using the delayed recognition method. In addition to the base rate case, we plan to file a third phase of our long-term infrastructure improvement program this summer, which will include capital investment programs to improve reliability for the customers of Pennsylvania.\nAnd finally, turning to Ohio. Earlier this month, we filed a settlement for the second phase of our distribution grid modernization plan, Grid Mod II. The settlement includes a $421 million 4-year capital investment program to continue modernizing the distribution electric system by completing the deployment of 1.4 million smart meters to our customers in Ohio.\nFinally, next week, we plan to file a prefiling notice of our Ohio base rate case with a full application and supporting schedules by the end of May.\nKey highlights of the case will include a 2024 test year with over $4.3 billion in rate base and an equity capitalization ratio reflecting the actual capital structure of the companies, a plan to recover investments in riders' DCR and AMI, which includes the grid mod capital investments in base rates and reset those riders to 0 and some of the same other features that we included in other rate case applications, including pension recovery and pension tracking mechanisms.\nThe current expectation is a proposal of a modest net increase to customers of less than $100 million compared to current revenues and an overall average impact of less than 5% of total revenues across all customers. which will be refined over the coming months.\nAnd finally, just to touch on the balance sheet and the closing of the FET transaction. Obviously, a lot of hard work goes into any transaction like this, but this was a great team effort, and we couldn't be more pleased with the results.\nOf the $3.5 billion in total proceeds, $2.3 billion was received at the end of March and was deployed immediately, consistent with our plan to pay off short-term debt and to redeem long-term debt totaling close to $1.4 billion, of which $460 million was at FE Corp. We expect to receive the remaining $1.2 billion later this year, which will be used to fund our capital programs and additional liability management, depending on market conditions.\nThis transaction completes a series of transactions over the last 2.5 years that resulted in over $3 billion in high-cost debt redemptions at FE Corp., close to $2 billion in utility long-term debt redemptions and $2 billion to pay off short-term debt that would have otherwise been financed with long-term debt at our utilities. And we are pleased to be back with an investment-grade credit rating with all 3 rating agencies and understand and appreciate and respect the importance of this to all of our stakeholders.\nThank you for your time today. We're off to a solid start this year with strong execution and a significantly stronger balance sheet to fuel our growth going forward. Now let's open the call to Q&A."

Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Review. Our President and Chief Executive Officer, Brian Tierney, will lead our call today, and he'll be joined by Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's session will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll discuss third quarter and year-to-date results, some key developments over the last few months and our outlook for the future.\nFor the third quarter, we delivered GAAP earnings of $0.74 per share versus $0.58 last year. Operating earnings for the third quarter were strong at $0.88 per share at the upper end of our guidance range and compared favorably to $0.79 per share last year. Our financial performance was a result of discipline and operating expenses as well as execution of our regulated capital investment plan to improve system resiliency and reliability.\nAlso, as previewed on the second quarter call, we realized a tax benefit in the quarter related to a state tax adjustment, which reduced our effective tax rate to 17% for the year-to-date period. Our service territory continued to experience very mild temperatures impacting earnings by $0.06 per share compared to last year.\nIn addition, quarterly results were impacted by lower pension credit and higher financing costs, primarily as a result of higher debt balances used to fund our capital investment program. Through strong execution by our treasury group, our consolidated long-term borrowing rate remained essentially flat.\nFor the year-to-date period, we reported GAAP earnings of $1.66 per share versus $1.42 per share last year. Operating earnings for the 9-month period were $1.94 per share compared to $1.91 in 2022. As you know, we have faced some headwinds in 2023 from both the impact of market conditions to our pension plan and the impact of the extremely mild temperatures on distribution sales. Our employees have risen to these challenges by focusing on the things within our control, allowing us to meet our financial commitments despite these headwinds. Examples include demonstrating financial discipline.\nOur employees were able to reduce base O&M by over $130 million or 13% year-over-year by executing on various continuous improvement initiatives. Employees executed on our capital plan with CapEx increasing $410 million year-to-date, mostly in transmission, which is 50% ahead of 2022 levels. Our treasury organization executed on a strategic low cost of capital, convertible debt issuance that was used to retire high-cost debt and fund our pension. Jon will discuss these drivers and others in more detail in just a few minutes.\nThe key takeaway is that we've had tremendous operational and financial execution to allow us to meet our targets. We intend to build on this performance, continue to change our culture and improve resiliency and reliability for our customers. We are providing a fourth quarter guidance range of $0.55 to $0.65 per share, which assumes normal weather. We are also narrowing our 2023 operating earnings guidance range to $2.49 per share to $2.59 per share from our original range of $2.44 per share to $2.64. In addition, we are reaffirming our 6% to 8% targeted long-term growth rate off of the original midpoint of prior year's guidance.\nBefore I move to key developments in the quarter, I want to address a couple of other topics. First, I want to briefly address the Ohio Organized Crime Investigation Commission, subpoena. We have no new material update at this time, and we continue to cooperate with the commission and address their questions.\nTheir focus continues to be on activities that were detailed in the deferred prosecution agreement with nothing new. FirstEnergy has taken full responsibility for those activities and implemented corrective actions to ensure that those type of activities never happen again. We will continue to cooperate with the OOCIC as we focus on executing our strategy and fulfilling our vision to transform FirstEnergy into a top-performing utility.\nThe last subject before we move on is that I believe we are uniquely well positioned for the current interest rate environment. We expect to close on the FET transaction early next year and to receive the full proceeds of $3.5 billion in 2024 with the majority funded at close. In addition, our debt maturities are light over the next couple of years, on average, approximating 6% of our total debt outstanding. This positioning supports our robust capital plan. This year, we're on track for $3.7 billion in capital investments, up from our original plan of $3.4 billion.\nIn 2024 and 2025, our planned capital investments are $3.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. This brings our total capital investments over the 3-year period to approximately $12 billion. This capital investment plan is comprised of 47% transmission and 51% distribution, supporting 7% rate base growth over the period and we're reviewing additional investments to serve our customers.\nTurning to Slide 6. Let's review some recent key developments. In September, our Board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share payable December 1. This represents a 5% increase compared to the quarterly payments of $0.39 per share paid since March of 2020. The increase corresponds with our targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70% that was approved by the Board earlier this year. It sets the stage for future dividend growth that is aligned with our long-term operating earnings growth as we continue to work -- as we continue working to enhance value for investors.\nDuring the quarter, we also achieved some important regulatory milestones that support our strategy of investing to improve reliability, resiliency and the customer experience. On October 18, the Maryland Public Service Commission approved our distribution base rate case including a $28 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 53%. We are pleased with this outcome, which support continued investments in the state and helps us deliver on our commitment to providing dependable and affordable electricity to our customers in Potomac Edison's Maryland service territory.\nWe're also excited to move forward with the first of our 3 utility-scale solar generation sites in West Virginia, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity. Our proposal, along with the small construction surcharge was approved by the West Virginia Public Service Commission in August. We plan to seek approval from the PSC to build an additional 2 solar sites, representing another 20 megawatts once customer subscriptions reach the 85% threshold. Jon will address the regulatory items and discuss the progress we're making with other filings, including the Pennsylvania consolidation case and our rate proceedings in New Jersey, Ohio and West Virginia.\nWe are focused on making the necessary investments in our regulated businesses, our employees and in systems and our systems to enhance the customer experience and create new opportunities from the energy transition. To execute that vision, we are shifting decision-making and accountability closer to where the work is being done to serve customers. We are making progress to fill several key executive positions in an organization that will be structured to allow greater execution at the business unit level.\nIn the near future, we expect to announce a President, FirstEnergy Utilities, as well as a Chief Operating Officer. President, FirstEnergy Utilities, will oversee 5 business unit executives who will lead our state operations and our stand-alone transmission companies. In our new organization, the business unit executives will have P&L responsibility and will be accountable for regulatory direction and outcomes as well as operational performance.\nThe Chief Operating Officer, will lead the customer experience group and a range of T&D functions, including planning, construction, system operations, safety and compliance. Five months into my role, I'm more excited than ever about the future of FirstEnergy. We are building a strong foundation of operational and financial excellence. We are using our strengthened balance sheet to invest in our people and our system for reliability, resiliency and in support of the energy transition. We are poised to capitalize on these opportunities to continue to grow the company and create a strong investment opportunity for investors.\nThank you for joining us today. I look forward to seeing many of you at the EEI conference next month and talking more about the progress we're making at FirstEnergy.\nNow I will turn the call over to Jon for more financial detail.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. We had a strong quarter, which showcased our commitment to operational excellence and financial discipline. This work enabled us to offset the impact of continued unseasonably mild temperatures across our service territory and deliver operating results near the top end of our guidance. In addition, we're also making good progress on our regulatory initiatives, which I'll review in more detail in a few minutes.\nLet's start with a review of our financial performance. As Brian mentioned earlier, third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.74 a share and operating earnings were $0.88 a share. This compares to 2022 third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 a share and operating earnings of $0.79 a share. And on a year-to-date basis, operating earnings are $1.94 a share compared to $1.91 a share in 2022 despite significant headwinds from our pension plan and lower weather-related distribution sales.\nOur performance in large part is due to intense focus on our operating expenses. Lower company-wide O&M improved operating results by $0.08 a share in the third quarter and $0.21 a share on a year-to-date basis, representing a 13% reduction when compared to the first 9 months of 2022. And our expectation for the full year is an O&M reduction of roughly 15% versus 2022 levels. About 50% of that is unique in nature, including spending we accelerated in 2022, with the other 50% being sustainable cost reductions that we will build upon in 2024 and beyond, primarily related to improved productivity across the entire organization, reduced use of contractors and lower spending on branding and advertising, just to name a few.\nWe're also running ahead of plan with capital spending in both our transmission and distribution businesses. Strong planning and execution across our operations and supply chain teams as well as the need to respond to more severe and capital-intensive storm events, resulted in an increase to our 2023 forecasted capital investment of nearly $300 million to $3.7 billion from our original plan of $3.4 billion.\nLooking now at the drivers for each of our business units for the third quarter. Results in our distribution business benefited from the diligent focus on operating expenses as well as our formula rate capital investment programs and rate structures. Together, these helped to offset the impact of a lower pension credit, higher financing costs, mostly associated with new debt issuances and the impact of mild weather on distribution sales.\nMild summer temperatures with cooling degree days 17% lower than the third quarter of 2022 and 6% below normal drove a 3% decrease in total customer demand and impacted earnings by $0.06 a share compared to last year. Sales to residential customers decreased nearly 4% compared to the third quarter of 2022 resulting from a 6% decrease due to the mild summer weather, partially offset by a 2% increase on a weather-adjusted basis.\nYear-to-date, weather-adjusted usage in this customer class is about 2% higher than our forecast and last year, and about 5% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. In the commercial sector, demand decreased just over 1%, resulting from a 2% decline in the mild temperatures but increased over 1% quarter-over-quarter on a weather-adjusted basis.\nYear-to-date weather-adjusted usage is flat to last year and continues to lag pre-pandemic levels by about 5%. Finally, sales to industrial customers were flat compared to the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2022 and remain slightly lower than pre-pandemic levels.\nLooking at our transmission business, third quarter results increased as a result of rate base growth of 8% associated with our Energizing the Future investment program. So far this year, we deployed $1.2 billion of capital in our transmission business, an increase of $400 million or 50% versus last year and nearly $200 million or approximately 20% above our plan.\nHighlighting just a few of the many projects currently underway, in Northeast Pennsylvania, we're rebuilding 20-mile 115 kV transmission line to enhance service reliability and improve system resiliency. In Ohio, we're rebuilding a 20-mile section of a 138 kV power line in Belmont and Harrison Counties which is in the third phase of a larger 64-mile project to enhance service reliability, improve system resiliency and accommodate increasing customer demand.\nAnd in West Virginia, we're upgrading 4 miles of a high-voltage transmission power line in Preston County to reinforce local transmission system against severe weather, meet future energy demands of the region and enhance service reliability for 5,000 customers in the Kingwood area.\nFor the full year, we now anticipate transmission formula rate investments of over $1.8 billion versus our original plan of just under $1.7 billion. In our corporate segment, our results for the third quarter largely reflect the tax benefit from the expected use of state net operating loss carryforwards, which we discussed on the second quarter call, that reduced our consolidated effective tax rate for the year.\nAs Brian mentioned, throughout 2023, our consistent operational and financial execution, including growth from our investment plan, significant cost control and other financing and tax benefits has more than offset the headwinds from pension and the impact of lower weather-related distribution sales which for the first 9 months of this year impacted results by $0.18 per share versus normal. I'm proud of how all of our employees have addressed these challenges and supported our commitments.\nWhile 2023 is not over, our 2023 debt financing plan is now complete, with 6 long-term debt transactions at our regulated operating companies totaling $1.6 billion, with an average coupon of 5.41%, slightly below our plan of 5.5%. Also earlier this year, FE Corp. issued $1.5 billion of convertible debt with a coupon of 4% that allowed the company to refinance revolver borrowings costing more than 7% and to make a voluntary pension contribution to eliminate minimum funding requirements in 2025.\nAdditionally, earlier this month, we extended the maturity date on our $4.5 billion revolving credit facilities to October 2027 and added 2 new revolving credit facilities, including a $1 billion facility at FET LLC and $150 million facility at CatCo. Moving forward, we will have $5.65 billion of credit facilities to support our increasing capital programs.\nAs we look to 2024 and 2025, our debt financing plan is minimal since the majority of the FET asset sale proceeds will be received at closing, with the remainder anticipated before the end of 2024. We plan to use these proceeds to repay costly revolver borrowings and depending on the interest rate environment will be used to redeem high coupon holdco debt, such as the 738 notes of which $460 million remain outstanding, retire maturing utility debt and/or defer other utility debt issuances.\nThe funding from the FET transaction, our light debt maturity schedule plus the decision we made to issue the low-cost convertible debt provides significant flexibility with our utility debt financing plan, which other than refinancings and new money requirements at our stand-alone transmission companies could be as low as $2.1 billion over the next 2 years.\nAnd as for FE Corp's holdco debt, we only have $300 million that matures in 2025. All that said, we're uniquely well positioned for the current interest rate environment with minimal earnings sensitivity to interest rate increases over the next couple of years.\nNow let's turn to an update on our rate proceedings and other regulatory activity. As we've discussed, we filed 3 base rate cases earlier this year, representing more than $7 billion of rate base. As Brian said, last week, we received an order in the Maryland base rate case that aligns with our goals to continue meeting the energy demands of Potomac Edison's rapidly growing population.\nThe order authorized an equity capitalization ratio of 53% with an equity return of 9.5%, recovery of regulatory assets associated with both COVID and electric vehicle infrastructure, while also providing support to help our strategy of strong reliability and resiliency in support of the energy transition. The new rates went into effect October 19.\nWe're also happy with the progress on the New Jersey and West Virginia base rate cases. In New Jersey, we've entered into settlement discussions on our proposed revenue increase of $192 million, and in West Virginia, our hearing is set for late January and our $207 million base rate case with new rates expected to be effective in March of next year. Other recent regulatory updates include in Pennsylvania, FERC approved our application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania distribution utilities in August, and the parties to the case filed a settlement agreement with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission on August 30. The settlement includes $650,000 in bill assistance for income-eligible customers over 5 years, supports unification of rates over time and includes a tracking mechanism to share certain cost savings associated with the legal entity consolidation with customers.\nWith the ALJ's recommended approval of the settlement, which is pending final regulatory approval, we expect the consolidation to close by early 2024. This consolidation aligns with our state operating model is an important step to simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy.\nIn Ohio, hearings for our Grid Mod II filing are scheduled to begin in December. This 4-year $626 million capital investment plan will support our continued work delivering safe, reliable power, offering modern customer experiences and supporting emerging technologies. And in November, hearings are scheduled to begin on our fifth Ohio electric security plan which supports our generation procurement process for nonshopping customers as well as investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management riders and energy efficiency programs.\nOur proposal also supports low-income customers and electric vehicle incentives. We have requested approval for the new ESP effective June 1 of next year. In West Virginia, we reached a unanimous settlement in our depreciation case, with an agreed-upon $33 million increase in depreciation rates, those rates will be effective upon conclusion of the West Virginia base rate case.\nAnd as Brian discussed, we received approval from the West Virginia Public Service Commission in August to move forward with construction of the first 3 utility-scale solar generation sites in the state. We expect the first site to be in service by the end of this year and all 5 sites to be completed before the end of 2025. And at a total investment cost of approximately $110 million.\nJust as a reminder, summaries of our key filings together with news releases and links to dockets are all available on the regulatory corner section of our Investor Relations website. Looking ahead, we plan to file our New Jersey infrastructure investment program in the next few weeks. And as you know, we are preparing for an active regulatory calendar in 2024. The performance of our team has been second to none by focusing on what we can control and a commitment to continuous improvement. We've delivered outstanding operational and financial performance.\nWe've overcome the impact of historic unseasonable weather and other challenges to deliver solid results through the first 9 months of this year. We're on track to meet our financial commitments, and we're building a strong foundation for continued growth.\nThank you for your time today. Now let's open the call to your questions.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nJon, real quick, before we go to Q&A, I'd like to share some late-breaking news from last night. Yesterday evening, PJM released the results of its open window process to address reliability concerns with data center load growth in the Dominion and APS service territories. Based on our preliminary review of these results, we are on track to gain a substantial portion of the projects. The recommendations still need to move through TAC and the PJM Board, but we anticipate that happening by year-end.\nWhile these projects won't come to fruition until the latter half of the decade, we're really excited about this opportunity. It builds on our successful bid for the onshore transmission construction that supports New Jersey's offshore wind project, and it further highlights the significant transmission build-out we anticipate in our footprint to support the energy transition. We look forward to talking more about this opportunity at EEI once we've had a chance to fully understand the details.\nNow let's move to your questions."

Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to FirstEnergy's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Review. Leading our call today is Brian Tierney, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.\nOur earnings release, presentation slides and related financial information are available on our website at firstenergycorp.com. Today's discussion will include the use of non-GAAP financial measures and forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause our results to differ materially from these statements can be found in our SEC filings. The appendix of today's presentation includes supplemental information, along with the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures.\nNow it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Brian.\n\nBrian X. Tierney\n\nChief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President, American Electric Power Co., Inc.\n\nThank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. This is my first earnings call as President and CEO of FirstEnergy, following John Somerhalder, who did an outstanding job leading this company during a period of transition. I am thrilled to be here with you today and look forward to talking about our second quarter and year-to-date results, a dividend update, some discussion of why I came to FirstEnergy, learnings from key stakeholder engagement and the outlook for FirstEnergy's future.\nLet's start with a quick look at the results we announced yesterday. We delivered second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.41 per share versus $0.33 per share last year. The company reported second quarter operating earnings of $0.47 per share at the upper end of our guidance range versus $0.53 per share last year. Mild temperatures continue to affect our service territory, impacting earnings by $0.06 in the quarter. Cooling degree days were 40% below normal and 48% below last year. Pension, signal peak and financing costs were negative in comparison to last year. Our results were favorably impacted by a strong focus on operating expenses and continued execution on our regulated capital investment program for the benefit of our customers.\nFor the year-to-date period, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.92 per share versus $0.83 per share last year. Operating earnings for the period were $1.06 per share compared to $1.12 for the first half of 2022. The impact of mild weather in the first half of the year reduced earnings by $0.18 per share compared to 2022, with heating degree days being 16% below last year and cooling degree days being 47% lower. The positive impacts of investments made for the benefit of our customers and operations and maintenance cost discipline partially offset the negative impact of pension and financing costs.\nDespite the impact of the mild weather, we're working hard to be disciplined about our cost structure and to have our investments reflected in rate base. As such, we are confident reaffirming our 2023 operating earnings guidance of $2.44 per share to $2.64 per share. Last week, our Board declared a dividend of $0.39 per share, which is payable September 1. Subject to Board approval, we expect to have one additional dividend payable this year. At that time, it's our expectation that we will be in a position to resume dividend growth in line with the new targeted payout ratio of 60% to 70%, which the Board approved earlier this year. This ratio is more in line with our peers and reflects our improved credit profile as well as our commitment to enhancing value for investors.\nMany of you know that I recently returned to the electric industry. I decided to come to First Energy because I thought the company had evolved from a business and cultural perspective to a point where my background experience could help further that evolution and growth. I could not be more excited to be working with my colleagues to provide the service that is the lifeblood of modern living to our communities. The employees of FirstEnergy don't just view their service as a job, it is a vocation that they take very seriously. This location and the service we deliver are more important than ever. Electricity demand is growing through the electrification of sectors like transportation and home heating.\nOn the supply side, request for interconnection of distributed energy resources and renewables is putting more stress on the electricity grid. As a wires-only company in 4 states and a fully integrated company in one state, I can think of no other electric utility that is better positioned to enable to increase demand and facilitate the energy transition than FirstEnergy. Through several strategic transactions, including great execution of a $1.5 billion convertible senior note transaction in the second quarter, the Board and the management team have strengthened the balance sheet to invest in our regulated businesses in our service territories. This will lead to better customer reliability, system resiliency and higher growth for the company.\nIn the time before I arrived, the new Board and management had done a commendable job of taking responsibility for and putting the activities of the past few years in the rearview mirror. On July 20, the company filed the second of 3 planned updates to the Department of Justice on the company's deferred prosecution agreement. It was a very positive report detailing the progress the company has made on people, processes and training to preclude such activities from happening again. We continue to cooperate with the department on any and all requests they make to us.\nDuring the quarter, the company received a subpoena from the Ohio Organized Crime Investigations Commission related to matters already detailed in the deferred prosecution agreement. We have cooperated with the commission, and we'll continue to do so. Over the past 60 days, I've had the opportunity to meet with key company stakeholders. I have listened and learned a lot about where the company is in its evolution and some of the key elements required for future success. I've had many town hall in person and virtual meetings with employees and union leadership. We've estimated that I've been able to reach about half of our 12,000 employees so far. This is a very engaged and dedicated workforce. Employees are asking for resources to better serve our customers.\nI have committed to them that we will invest in our system and them by making sure that we have the right complement of employees with the right training and the right equipment to serve our customers. These employees were not distracted by the events of the past few years and remain focused on safety and our customers. They will lead us into the future with their hard work, skill and determination. Their commitment was on display again this weekend as our employees work to restore power to customers impacted by the recent storms. I've had the opportunity to meet with 3 of our 5 commissions and 2 of our state governors. In talking with them, I committed that the company will take responsibility for the actions of the past when those dockets come before them. I also expressed our desire to engage constructively in normal course of business with the commissions for the benefit of our customers.\nEach of the commissions I spoke with want FirstEnergy to keep up with the normal day-to-day business of investing in our utilities and serving our customers. I have not detected any regulatory overhang associated with the past that would impact our forward-facing activities before the commissions. This is really important because we have a full regulatory schedule that Jon will take you through in detail. Camilo Serna and his regulatory team are engaged in base rate cases in Maryland, New Jersey and West Virginia that represent about $7 billion in rate base with returns that need to be updated. We have important ESP V and [ grid mod ] 2 filings in Ohio and the consolidation case in Pennsylvania. We anticipate base rate filings in Ohio and Pennsylvania next year with current combined rate basis of about $10.5 billion with returns that also need to be updated.\nWe spent a lot of time together as a management team and with the Board discussing how to best organize the company to reach our goals quickly and sustainably. There are key roles that need to be filled. In July, we added 2 key hires: Abigail Phillips as Chief Risk Officer; and Amanda Mertens Campbell, our Vice President of External Affairs. These are experienced professionals who have hit the ground running and are already making an impact. We are currently looking to fill our Chief Operating Officer role. We have attracted well-known industry-leading candidates and hope to be able to make announcements in the near future.\nOver the past 2 years, FirstEnergy has consolidated key functions like engineering, HR, workforce development and others. These actions led to efficiencies and consistency and standards. At the same time, there is a sense that certain decision-making would be better if it were closer to the customer and to the employees providing the service. We are looking at ways to make that happen, and we'll be updating you on this in the months to come. I spent a considerable amount of time with investors talking about our plans for organic investment and growth. These discussions have focused on the investment needed in our electric grid, management additions we plan to make and the regulatory schedule necessary to convert investment into growth.\nI've had the opportunity to meet with 3 of the major rating agencies. I've committed to further optimizing our financing plan and improving our credit metrics and balance sheet. This included paying down short-term borrowings and repurchasing high-coupon debt in the open market with the proceeds of the convertible bond offering from earlier in the quarter. We anticipate FFO to debt being in the 14% to 15% range by 2025.\nFollowing meetings with these and other stakeholders, I have not found any surprises relative to what I knew coming into the company. What I have found are some key indicators for success, a skilled, engaged and dedicated workforce, a constructive regulatory environment focused on customer affordability and reliability, a system in need of investment for reliability, resiliency and to support the energy transition; and finally, a strengthened balance sheet to be able to make that investment and to support organic growth.\nI believe in this company's strategy of making necessary investments to improve reliability, resiliency and the customer experience. In addition to reaffirming the company's guidance for 2023, I am reaffirming our 6% to 8% long-term growth rate off of the original midpoint of prior year's guidance. We have a strong platform to build upon. We are getting and will continue to get the right people in place to lead this company to sustainable growth. I am incredibly excited about this company, and I'm thrilled to be here at the start of what I know will be a very bright future.\nWith that, I will turn it over to Jon for more financial detail.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Despite the extremely mild temperatures across our service territory in the second quarter, our focus on efficient operations and financial discipline allowed us to deliver operating results above the midpoint of our guidance. I'll start today with a review of our financial performance and outlook then provide an update on recent regulatory activity.\nAs Brian mentioned, second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.41 a share, and operating earnings were $0.47 a share. This compares to 2022 2nd quarter GAAP earnings of $0.33 a share and operating earnings of $0.53 a share. Second quarter results in our distribution business benefited from our ongoing capital investment programs and our laser focus on operating expenses. Together, these helped offset the impact of lower distribution sales which largely resulted from mild temperatures as well as a lower pension credit. Mild temperatures with cooling degree days 48% below the second quarter of 2022, impacted residential demand by more than 8% and total customer demand by 4% with a year-over-year impact of $0.06 a share. Total residential sales decreased 11% from the second quarter of 2022 or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis.\nOn a trailing 12-month basis, weather-adjusted residential sales continue to trend about 4% higher than 2019 pre-pandemic levels. And for the June year-to-date period, they are 2% higher than last year. In the commercial sector, lower related demand drove a 6% decrease compared to the second quarter of 2022, while demand was down 3% on a weather-adjusted basis. Usage by commercial customers over the trailing 12-month period continues to trend below 2019 levels by nearly 5% on a weather-adjusted basis.\nFinally, sales to industrial customers increased by just over 1% compared to the second quarter of 2022 and continue recovering toward pre-pandemic levels. As a reminder, revenue from our C&I customer classes are not as sensitive to sales volumes, as a result of rate design for these classes, which is typically based off peak usage. In our transmission business, our results benefited from our Energizing the Future investment program and associated rate base growth of more than 8% compared to the second quarter of 2022. Favorable weather and accelerated material deliveries allowed us to deploy nearly $400 million of capital into our transmission investment program during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date investments to nearly $750 million, which is over 20% ahead of our internal plan, and $260 million or more than 50% ahead of last year.\nLooking at our corporate segment, second quarter results benefited primarily from lower operating expenses and lower interest costs which helped to offset a lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak. We are very pleased with how we responded to the challenges we faced this year, especially the impact of the extremely mild temperatures on distribution sales which on a year-to-date basis is $0.18 per share below last year and $0.16 per share off plan.\nThe team's effort allows us to confirm our guidance range this year of $2.44 to $2.64 a share. First, our focus on our cost structure, particularly our operating expenses has been second to none. As you can see, our O&M has improved $0.13 a share year-over-year and is well ahead of our internal plan. Our focus on managing our labor costs through productivity improvements and selective hiring is paying off. In addition, in May, we announced an involuntary separation program and a voluntary early retirement program impacting approximately 550 employees. And we continue to focus on third-party and other operating costs, including corporate facility costs, branding and sponsorships and improved customer collection rates, which has helped us lower our bad debt expense.\nCurrently, through June, our base O&M is running about 6% below plan and 11% below last year and the expectation in the second half is for that trend to improve versus last year given some of the steps we have taken to further reduce costs and the maintenance work we accelerated from '23 into '22. Second, in early May, we completed a very successful sale of $1.5 billion in convertible senior notes with a coupon rate of 4%. The initial conversion price represents a premium of approximately 20% from our closing share price on May 1. We consider this a cost-effective bridge to when we receive the full $3.5 billion from our previously announced agreement to sell a 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC.\nThe use of proceeds will be EPS accretive as we repaid high-cost short-term borrowings, reduced 7 and 3/8 coupon debt at FE Corp. and made a $750 million contribution to our pension plan, which had required contributions beginning in 2025. As a result, our net qualified pension obligation improved to approximately $800 million at the end of the second quarter, down from $1.7 billion at the end of last year, representing a funded status of 91% at the end of June. In addition, we don't have any minimum funding requirements through 2027. The convertible note issuance supports our ongoing work to optimize our financing plan, improve our credit metrics and our balance sheet as we target FFO to debt metrics of 14% to 15%.\nFinally, we do anticipate a lower effective tax rate for the year closer to 17%, resulting from the expected use of state net operating loss carryforwards. Again, despite the extremely mild temperatures we've seen this year, the team has worked extremely hard to rise to the challenges so we can deliver on our commitments. Now let's shift gears and talk about our rate proceedings and other regulatory activity in the quarter. I'll start with the 3 base rate cases we filed earlier this year, these cases, which represent over $7 billion of rate base and weighted average test year return on equity of less than 6% are progressing well through the regulatory process and consistent with our expectations.\nIn New Jersey, we received a procedural schedule for our proposed revenue increase of $193 million with evidentiary hearings to be held in early January of next year. In Maryland, very constructive evidence share hearings were held last month on our proposed $50 million rate case, which was filed in March and supports equity returns of 10.6%. We do expect new rates to go into effect in October of this year. And in West Virginia, our Mon Power and Potomac Edison West Virginia utilities filed a base rate case in May, requesting a $207 million increase in revenue to support reliability investments, grid resiliency, our generation assets and an enhanced customer experience while providing assistance to low-income customers. Key proposals in the filing include distribution rate base of $3.2 billion and return on equity of 10.85%. A hearing has been set for January of next year and new rates are expected to be effective by the end of March.\nImportantly, even with the proposed rate adjustments in each of these jurisdictions, our customers would continue to have some of the lowest residential rates among their end-state peers. Other regulatory activity also continues to progress. We filed our Ohio Electric Security Plan 5 in early April, as we discussed on our first quarter call, our proposal supports our generation procurement process for nonshopping customers, continued support for investments in the distribution system storm and vegetation management writers and energy efficiency programs. Our filing also includes proposals that support low-income customers and electric vehicle incentives. We have requested approval for the new ASP effective June 1 of next year when the ESP 4 ends and hearings are scheduled for November of this year.\nWe also received a procedural schedule last month for the Ohio Grid [ my 2 ] filing we made last summer. Under the scheduled hearings are planned for October of this year, and we look forward to advancing the $626 million capital investment plan to continue our work enhancing the delivery of safe, reliable power offering modern customer experiences and supporting emerging technologies. In Pennsylvania, hearings have been set for next week to consider our application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania distribution utilities. As we stated, this is an important step to align with our state operating model simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy, and we are in settlement discussions with the parties to the case.\nAnd in May, FirstEnergy and Brookfield submitted applications to FERC and to the Pennsylvania PUC to facilitate the FET minority interest sale that was announced in February. We have received approval for the sale from the Virginia State Corporate Commission and the transaction also requires a successful review by CFIUS. Finally, mine power is no longer reviewing the possible purchase of the Pleasants Power Station. Last week, FERC approved the sale of the plant to a subsidiary of Omnis Fuel Technologies. We will file an update with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when that sale is complete.\nSo all in all, several regulatory proceedings in flight, but everything is progressing very well and consistent with our plan. The regulatory team and the employees that support the regulatory filings are doing a terrific job, and we couldn't be happier with the progress. As a reminder, you can find summaries of our key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the regulatory corner section of the IR website. I'm very proud of our team's performance despite the challenges we have faced this year. We are on track with key regulatory initiatives, and we're executing very well in the areas that we control, with strong capital deployment and financial discipline with our operating expenses. Thank you for your time today. Now let's open the call to your questions."

First Quarter Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVice President-Investor Relations, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Welcome to our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. .\nWe will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair, Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session.\nNow I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder.\n\nJohn William Somerhalder\n\nInterim President, CEO & Director, CenterPoint Energy, Inc.\n\nThanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We've accomplished a lot since our last earnings call and continue to build on the positive momentum we have seen over the last couple of years. Our first quarter GAAP earnings are $0.51 per share. Despite the impact of extremely mild first quarter temperatures, operating earnings are $0.60 per share, which is within the guidance range and reflects the continued execution of our long-term regulated growth strategy. .\nWe continue to position FirstEnergy for greater resiliency and growth by strengthening our financial position, enhancing our operations, optimizing the customer experience and transforming our culture. When Brian Tierney joins us as President and CEO on June 1, he'll hit the ground running to build on these efforts. We're very excited to welcome him on board.\nClearly, we recognize how important it was to find the right leader for our company. And in Brian, we have a CEO who understands our industry and business and is the right leader to drive our strategy and accelerate our momentum. I know many of you worked with Brian during his time at AEP, and we know him as a highly respected executive with a unique blend of operational, financial and strategic skills and achievements.\nHis strong track record of driving results is very well aligned with our goals at FirstEnergy. He has expressed his support for the steps we've taken to position our company, and he intends to continue to advance our business strategy, building on the strong foundation we have in place today. We know we found the right person to lead our company.\nI know everyone is looking forward to hearing from him, and we will certainly give you that opportunity. He will have a busy calendar starting on June 1. In the meantime, I'm so proud of our employees and their excellent work to position our company for the future. I know they will double down in their efforts to support Brian to drive long-term sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. This work includes a very busy regulatory calendar that addresses the critical investments that support reliability and a smarter and cleaner electric grid. John will review our recent distribution filings in a few minutes, but first, I'll take a moment to provide an update on our transmission business.\nIn early February, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion, and this transaction remains on track to close in early 2024.\nBrookfield's partnership in FET supports our substantial long-term investments to build a more resilient and modern electric grid. We have a $1.7 billion transmission investment program this year and that's increasing to $1.9 billion by 2025.\nThe mild first quarter weather, coupled with strong planning and execution, helped us get off to a great start with our construction program. Our transmission capital investments of nearly $350 million are about 60% ahead of the first quarter of 2022 and about 50% ahead of our internal plan.\nExamples of this work include: upgrading an 8-mile 138 kV transmission line in Ottawa County, Ohio, near Toledo. This project, which is scheduled for completion in May includes streaming new, larger conductor that can handle additional demand, replacing older structures with monopoles and installing more than 40 new components and insulators, upgrading the high-voltage transmission line in New Jersey that is expected to improve system reliability for more than 3,000 customers.\nThis project includes the installation of 53 new wood pole structures to fortify and strengthen the line and help prevent outages. And our transmission program is also facilitating the energy transition by connecting clean energy resources to the grid. Earlier this year, JCP&L completed a grid connection for a 19.8 megawatt solar project located at a former landfill property in not all in New Jersey that is now delivering clean energy through FirstEnergy's transmission lines.\nWe are excited to continue making these types of investments across our service territory in support of the clean energy future. We are affirming our 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. As we discussed last quarter, the midpoint of this range represents 6% growth over our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share.\nWe are also introducing second quarter 2023 guidance of $0.40 to $0.50 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate. This represents year-over-year growth based off of prior year guidance midpoint. I want to spend a moment discussing our regulated earnings and earnings quality, particularly in light of the current contribution from the Signal Peak mining operation. While this is a legacy investment, that we need or control or operate, it has taken on a higher profile over the last year.\nBased on our plan, the earnings contribution from Signal Peak in 2023 is expected to be less than 15% of our $2.54 guidance midpoint and the expectation longer term is that Signal Peak contribution will decline on an absolute and relative basis, representing less than 10% of 2024 and 2025 consolidated earnings, improving the company's earnings quality over time.\nWe intend to continue providing transparency around Signal Peak's contribution going forward. Our focus is on our regulated operations, our state distribution companies and our transmission businesses and on improving the credit quality of the company. We expect significant growth from our regulated operations given current returns in our distribution companies and our customer-focused investment strategies across both distribution and transmission, which will more than offset the decline in Signal Peak and support our expectations of 6% to 8% consolidated average annual earnings growth. I believe we are on the right path to leverage our strengths and deliver value to all of our stakeholders.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nChief Accounting Officer, VP & Controller, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Although we were significantly impacted by the record-breaking mild temperatures this winter, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong and on track. I'll begin my remarks with a regulatory update, then I'll review our first quarter financial results. .\nLast month, we kicked off a period of significant regulatory activity. Since early March, this includes an application to consolidate our 4 Pennsylvania utilities, which is an important step to align with our state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy.\nWe also filed rate cases in New Jersey and Maryland that support critical reliability investments, a modern electric grid and enhancements to the customer experience, while maintaining the lowest residential customer rates among regulated electric distribution companies in both states.\nSince our last JCP&L rate case in 2020, we've made nearly $800 million in investments to modernize and strengthen the electric grid. The JCP&L proposal represents a $185 million revenue increase and supports distribution equity returns of 10.4%. It features enhanced recovery of storm balance costs, expanded vegetation management programs, recovery program costs related to AMI, in electric vehicles and a proposal to normalize pension OPEB costs. The proposal also confirms our plan to file an infrastructure investment program later this year.\nIn Maryland, our proposal for a $44 million net revenue increase supports equity returns of 10.6%. It includes a proposal for the second phase of the electric distribution investment surcharge program, a pension OPEB normalization mechanism and a cost recovery proposal related to COVID and electric vehicle balances.\nAnd in Ohio, we filed our fifth electric security plan to support our generation procurement process for nonshopping customers, continued investments in the distribution system, storm and vegetation management writers and energy efficiency programs. The filing also includes proposals to support low-income customers and the electric vehicle customer experience.\nWe requested approval for the new ESP to be effective on June 1, 2024, when the ESP 4 ends. We've included a summary of the key filings together with news releases and links to the dockets on the new regulatory corner section of our IR website. We received a lot of positive feedback about this resource, and we'll continue to update the site as we move through each of the proceedings.\nLater this quarter, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia. And looking further ahead, we are considering the appropriate time to file for new base rates in our third long-term infrastructure investment program in Pennsylvania, and we will file a rate case in Ohio in May of 2024.\nWhile each utility in each case have unique circumstances, we have noted that recent base rate cases involving other investor-owned utilities in Ohio have been resolved with equity capital structures in the 50% to 54% range and support of ROEs in the 9.5% to 9.9% range.\nThese outcomes align with our plan, which includes the financial impact of our 2021 approved settlement that provided for over $300 million in refunds and bill credits to customers as well as continued rate base growth and the accounting changes that we previously discussed, all of which significantly lowered the returns at our Ohio utilities.\nI want to spend a few extra minutes on the recent generation filing in West Virginia, where we're working with a broad group of stakeholders to ensure we find the best outcome for our customers. Last December, the Public Service Commission ordered Mon Power to provide an evaluation of purchasing and operating the Pleasants Power Station, a coal-fired plant that we understand is currently slated for closure on May 31.\nThe concept of a potential acquisition of Pleasants was suggested by stakeholders in West Virginia as a replacement for our Fort Martin station, which has a proposed end-of-life date of 2035. We responded to the commission last month indicating that additional time and analysis are needed to properly complete the necessary and complex assessment.\nMon Power proposed an option to enter into an interim arrangement with Pleasants' current owner that would keep the plant operational beyond its May 31 deactivation date. This would allow the needed time to do a thorough analysis and evaluation as requested by the West Virginia PSC.\nOn Monday, the commission approved our proposal. We will begin negotiations with the plant's current owner. If we reach an interim agreement that we believe is in the interest of customers and FirstEnergy, we will submit it to the commission. And if approved, this would allow recovery of associated costs through a surcharge.\nIf we can't reach an agreement that is in the interest of our customers, we will file an update with the commission. To be clear, we don't see it as a viable option for Mon Power to operate 3 coal-fired power plants in West Virginia. We will continue to work through the process with the PSC and strive for an outcome that best serves our customers, communities and employees in West Virginia.\nAt the same time, we are moving forward with our efforts to support the energy transition across our footprint, and we remain committed to our climate strategy and our goal to achieve carbon neutrality from our Scope 1 emissions by 2050. Mon Power continues securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in the state to purchase solar RECs from our [indiscernible] utility scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts.\nThis week, we filed an update with the commission to begin moving forward with 3 of the 5 sites, totaling 30 megawatts of capacity and to obtain approval of a small surcharge.\nTurning to first quarter results and other financial matters. First quarter GAAP earnings were $0.51 per share and operating earnings were $0.60 per share, which is just below the midpoint of our guidance despite the impact of a very mild winter across our footprint. Absent the impact of weather, we were on plan for the quarter. In our distribution business, first quarter results benefited primarily from our capital investment programs, higher weather-adjusted load and lower operating expenses, including employee benefit costs and the maintenance work we accelerated into 2022.\nThese were offset by a significant decrease in weather-related demand, lower pension credits and higher financing costs related to our financing activity in the second half of 2022. Record-setting mild temperatures this winter, with heating degree days 18% below last year, impacted total customer demand by 8% or $0.12 per share.\nOn a weather-adjusted basis, distribution deliveries increased more than 2%, which was very nice to see. Residential sales decreased 8% from the first quarter of 2022, but increased 5% on a weather-adjusted basis. Compared to prepandemic levels, weather-adjusted sales to residential customers are trending about 4% higher. In the commercial sector, deliveries decreased 7% compared to the first quarter of 2022 due to lower weather-related demand, but increased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers continue to recover, they lack 2019 levels by more than 4%.\nFinally, first quarter 2023 sales to industrial customers decreased slightly compared to the first quarter of 2022, driven by the chemicals, metals and plastics sectors. Industrial sales remained just below prepandemic levels, but we continue to see fairly strong growth in some of our other industrial sectors, such as steel, services and other manufacturing.\nAs for weather-adjusted load, we do expect a positive trend to continue relative to our plan, especially in the residential class, helping offset some of the lower weather-related sales we experienced in the first quarter. Additionally, operating expenses in our distribution business reflect the continued focus on our cost structure, and we are pursuing additional cost reductions to further offset the impact of mild first quarter temperatures.\nTurning to first quarter drivers in our transmission business. Results primarily benefited from rate base growth of 8% compared to the first quarter of 2022 associated with our Energizing the Future investment program, offset by dilution from the minority interest sale in FET that closed in May 2022. As Jon mentioned, we started the year off strong with our capital investment program in our transmission business, deploying nearly $350 million of capital, which is significantly above our internal plan.\nFirst quarter results in our Corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from Signal Peak and lower financing costs associated with holding company debt redemptions in 2022, which more than offset the lower pension credit.\nSignal Peak's contribution in Q1 of this year was $0.08 per share, but we expect a slight decrease to its projected earnings for the full year due to current forward market prices for coal. While weather had a significant impact for the first 3 months of the year, it's not taking us off our plan. We expect to offset the weather impact this quarter as well as projected lower earnings contribution from Signal Peak through stronger weather-adjusted load, additional cost reduction opportunities as well as opportunities to optimize our financing plans.\nThank you for your time this morning. We recognize we have some work to do given the mild winter temperatures this quarter, but we see this as manageable. We remain focused on executing our plan and creating long-term value for our investors, customers, communities and employees.\nNow let's open the call to your questions."

Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVP of IR & Communications, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year, can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session.\nNow I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder.\n\nJohn William Somerhalder\n\nInterim President & CEO and Chair of the Board, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We had a strong year in 2022, and we are excited to make even more progress on our goals in 2023. Our full year 2022 GAAP earnings are $0.71 per share and operating earnings are $2.41 per share, which is slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range.\nBefore I get started today, I would like to take a minute to say thank you to all of our employees for their efforts over the past year. I'm proud of what they've accomplished and the company we have become. Our progress this past year is due to the efforts of our 12,000 employees who are serving our customers and working to make this company better for the long term. Thank you. With that, we have a lot of ground to cover today, so let's get started.\nTwo years ago, we were taking some of the first steps to transform FirstEnergy. In 2022, we hit full stride, stretching ourselves to strengthen and enhance nearly every aspect of our organization. The scope and pace of these changes have been remarkable. Just to touch on a few of the highlights.\nFirst, we made significant improvements in our financial position. This includes deploying proceeds from the $1 billion common equity issuance that closed in late 2021, together with the $2.4 billion to 19.9% interest sale in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC that closed midyear to reduce debt by nearly $3 billion in 2022, most of which was at [Epicor].\nAs a result, we lowered holding company debt as a percentage of total debt to 24% from 33% at the end of 2021. On the operational front, we transitioned to a new 5-state operating model and engaged in more than 175 projects across the company to modernize the way we work and deliver a superior customer experience as part of our FE Forward program. At the same time, we continue to enrich our culture with an unwavering commitment to our core values.\nAs a result of this work, we're entering 2023 as a more innovative, efficient and forward-thinking organization where employees are sharing ideas and working to move the company forward. This year, we intend to build on our momentum. We're working to be a premier electric company with a strong foundation and a customer centered focus that is enabling the clean energy transition.\nEarlier this month, we announced an agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC to Brookfield's Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for $3.5 billion. This transaction, which is expected to close in early 2024, supports our plans to improve our balance sheet and for approximately $1 billion of incremental capital investments, which we believe will drive long-term value for all our stakeholders.\nAnd as Jon will discuss, our regulatory calendar will address the critical investments that support reliability and smarter and cleaner electric grid. We are introducing 2023 guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share. The midpoint of this range represents a 6% growth from our original 2022 midpoint of $2.40 per share, and it offsets the pension impacts we discussed last year.\nWe are also introducing first quarter 2023 guidance of $0.56 to $0.66 per share. In addition, we are affirming our targeted 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth rate, which represents year-over-year growth based off of the prior year guidance midpoint.\nI'd like to spend a moment to provide an update on the CEO search process and I realize there is much interest in this important topic. Late last year, we shared the broad criteria that we were looking for a strong track record of executive leadership within the utility industry, have demonstrated ability to execute on the regulatory front, leading operational and financial discipline and impeccable credibility with external stakeholders. And we always anticipated a 3- to 6-month time line.\nI can share that interest has been strong. The process has been quite active since the beginning of the year and discussions among the Board and select candidates continue. The Board is committed to selecting the right individual to lead our talented team, and we trust you will respect the process through its conclusion. We look forward to sharing the announcement when the Board completes its work.\nIn the meantime, we continue to execute on the strategy we have in place. The Board and the management team are fully committed to this path and the expectation is that the new CEO once named, will be as well. It's an exciting time for FirstEnergy as we're poised to leverage our many strengths from our diverse assets to the transformation that has taken place since 2020 to the talented employees who are making the company stronger with their drive, passion and ingenuity.\nI appreciate your continued support. We are concentrating our efforts on long-term stability and success as a leading utility. We will continue to navigate our path with the same determined focus you've seen over the last few years.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Strategy, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. I joined John in thanking our employees for their incredible work this past year. Their perseverance and commitment made it possible for us to navigate challenging conditions and make important progress on our goals. We have a busy year ahead of us as we continue driving towards our aspirations and laying additional groundwork for our future success.\nI'll start my remarks with a review of our top regulatory and business priorities. Then we'll move to a discussion of 2022 financial results and 2023 expectations. We have an active regulatory calendar this year Later this quarter, we'll file for new distribution rates in New Jersey and Maryland and file an application to consolidate our Pennsylvania legal entities. Then by midyear, we plan to file a rate case in West Virginia, an electric security plan in Ohio in an infrastructure investment program or IIP in New Jersey.\nBroadly speaking, the rate cases will address the significant customer-focused investments we've made since our last rate cases in each of the states and provide an opportunity to bring our distribution equity returns in line with the industry average allowed returns. At the end of 2022, our weighted average ROE was 7.7% and while authorized ROEs ranged from 9.6% to 10.5%. Our current residential rates are 10% to 40% below our peers in the states we serve and we are sensitive to the pressures of the current inflationary environment on our customers.\nOur rate cases this year will ensure we maintain our affordability position while enhancing the customer experience, provide further support for low-income customers and support the critical investments for a more reliable, resilient and smarter electric grid. Each filing will address unique elements to better serve customers in that state.\nFor example, the Maryland and New Jersey rate cases will highlight our plans to improve distribution reliability through incremental investments. In Maryland, we plan to file concurrently with the rate case for continuation of the electric distribution investment surcharge. And in New Jersey, our rate case will highlight our plan to file an infrastructure investment program by the middle of this year.\nThese programs will focus on investments such as circuit resiliency and reliability, feeder sectionalization and distribution automation and substation upgrades. In West Virginia, the rate case will reflect our recently filed proposal with the commission to update depreciation rates associated with Mon Power's 2 coal-fired generation assets, which based on the depreciation study, would have retirement dates of 2035 and 2040. Any increase in depreciation rates would not take effect until conclusion of the upcoming base rate case.\nTurning to consolidation of our 4 Pennsylvania utilities. This is an important step to align with our new state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing strategy. This consolidation won't represent any changes in current electric rates for our Pennsylvania customers. Those will be combined as appropriate over time through future rate case activity.\nIn Ohio, our ESP V will adjust generation procurement for non-shopping customers after the current ESP expires in May of next year. In addition, this filing will address other regulatory programs and mechanisms such as continuation of existing capital writers such as the DCR and AMI. And as we extend our commitment to have a broad stakeholder dialogue, we are considering programs that support energy efficiency, low income and additional customer-related initiatives.\nWe also look forward to advancing the $626 million Ohio Grid Mod Phase II capital investment plan, which was filed last July. If approved by the commission, Grid Mod II will continue our work to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power, offer modern customer experiences and support emerging technologies.\nAs we make each major regulatory filing, we'll post a convenient and comprehensive summary to our IR website. You'll find this information on the Investor Materials page of the site in a new section named Regulatory Corner.\nTurning to financial matters. Our recent agreement with Brookfield represents an excited milestone in our progress to be a premier utility with a strong financial position and sustainable long-term growth. The $3.5 billion transaction will deliver highly attractive, efficient equity financing. The transaction is structured with a $1.75 billion due at closing and aligned with our investment and financing plans an 18-month $1.75 billion note at 5.75% interest. Once the transaction closes, we intend to deploy the proceeds to further improve our credit metrics and our balance sheet, targeting FFO to debt metrics of 14% to 15%.\nThe proceeds also supported more than 10% increase in our 2024 and 2025 capital investment plans. We're infusing nearly $1 billion into the CapEx plan, bringing our target to approximately $18 billion over the 2021 to '25 period. Through this plan, we're targeting 75% formula rate investments and more than 7% average annual rate base growth beginning in 2024.\nWe will use NOLs and existing tax credits to offset most of the taxable gain on the transaction, resulting in an expected cash taxes of approximately $50 million. Beginning in 2023 and moving forward, we expect to be a federal cash taxpayer at approximately $200 million annually.\nOur agreement to sell an additional 30% interest in FET triggered a deferred gain on the prior 19.9% sale that was completed in 2022. We As a result, we recognized a $752 million noncash charge in our fourth quarter '22 GAAP results. Operating earnings were $0.50 per share for the fourth quarter of 2022 and on an adjusted basis, excluding unique drivers this year, which include the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions. Fourth quarter operating earnings increased $0.09 per share or 22% compared to the same period in 2021.\nIn our distribution business, fourth quarter results benefited from weather-related demand, along with the impact of our capital investment programs. These results nearly offset higher operating expenses, primarily associated with accelerating certain planned maintenance work, incremental reliability activities and higher material and storm costs.\nTotal distribution deliveries increased 2%, resulting from weather that was closer to historic norms compared to the very mild fourth quarter of 2021 and increased demand from industrial customers.\nResidential sales increased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2021, but decreased slightly on a weather-adjusted basis. Consistent with our observations on the October call, sales to residential customers remain about 3% higher than pre-pandemic levels. In the commercial sector, fourth quarter deliveries were up slightly from the prior year due to weather and decreased almost 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. While sales to commercial customers increased slightly overall in 2022, they continue to lag 2019 levels by more than 4%.\nFinally, sales to industrial customers increased nearly 2% compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, led by continued recovery in the automotive, mining, fabricated metals and steel sectors. Overall, industrial sales are trending closer to prepandemic levels with full year 2022 sales less than 1% below 2019 and fourth quarter 2022 sales flat to 2019 levels.\nIn our transmission business, fourth quarter results benefited from continued formula rate base growth of 9% year-over-year associated with our Energizing the Future investment program as well as lower financing costs.\nI want to take a quick second to recognize our transmission, supply chain and materials operations teams who overcame significant supply chain and other issues in 2022, investing nearly $1.4 billion in projects to improve grid reliability and resiliency. For example, we successfully completed the first segment of a 64-mile transmission line rebuild, that will enhance service reliability for customers in Eastern Ohio.\nAnd in Central New Jersey, construction is only on 2 projects that will upgrade 19 miles of transmission lines and benefit 50,000 customers. In 2023, our transmission investment plan is $1.7 billion, and we have a long project pipeline ahead of us in this premium business.\nAnd finally, our corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from the Signal Peak mining operation and lower financing costs associated with the holding company debt redemptions earlier this year.\nFor the full year, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share, largely reflecting the noncash tax charge I mentioned earlier. Full year 2022 operating earnings were $2.41 per share, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance. Again, on an adjusted basis, excluding the accounting changes, Ohio rate credits and equity transactions, we achieved a $0.26 improvement in operating earnings compared to 2021, which represents 12% year-over-year growth.\nOur solid financial performance resulted in $2.7 billion in cash from operations last year, which is in line with our expectations, and we made more than $3.2 billion in customer-focused regulated investments and plan to execute our 2023 capital investment plan of $3.4 billion.\nAnd we met our 2022 FFO to debt target, executed our financing plan and achieved investment-grade credit ratings with Fitch and just recently received a positive outlook from S&P. The materials posted to our website yesterday afternoon contain an updated financial outlook through 2025, including our capital plan, load forecast and financing plan.\nIt's our expectation that we will extend our outlook beyond 2025 later this year. As John mentioned, our 2023 earnings guidance of $2.44 to $2.64 per share reflects overcoming the enormous challenge we face related to the pension, which year-over-year was a $0.38 impact to our 2023 plan. The combination of accelerating O&M into 2022 together with lower interest expense resulting from debt reductions and earnings from Signal Peak support our projection for 6% growth year-over-year at the guidance midpoint.\nOur focus is executing on our plan to drive strong regulated earnings growth, resulting in our long-term 6% to 8% growth outlook, anchored by increasing transmission and distribution utility investments. While pension and the positive offset provided in the near term by Signal Peak have complicated our earnings story.\nWe are laser-focused as a management team to improve the earnings quality over time by replacing earnings from the Signal Peak and pension with high-quality core T&D earnings growth and the significant benefits associated with improving our balance sheet.\nIn terms of other 2023 drivers, our expectation is for the continued strong growth from the investments we're making for our 6 million customers in our distribution and transmission businesses. And an improvement in our cost structure, driven in part by the work we accelerated into 2022, but this is certainly an area we will need to keep an eye on with respect to inflationary pressures. And ending on another positive note, we are fresh off a recent Board meeting, where we discuss the importance of the dividend to our investors.\nThe Board approved a new dividend policy that raises our targeted payout ratio to 60% to 70% up from 55% to 65% previously. And we also expect to resume dividend growth subject to Board approval for dividends payable late this year. Our new payout ratio is more in line with our peers, and reflects the steps we've taken to improve our credit profile and our commitment to enhancing value for investors.\nAnd as I mentioned on Friday, S&P moved FirstEnergy to a positive outlook based on the announcement of the asset sale and our strategy to use those proceeds in a credit supportive manner. We're pleased with this action, which recognize our work to deliver on our commitments.\nI'm excited about our plans for this year and for the future. We've taken significant steps over the past few years in a broad range of areas to move the company forward from the cultural changes, the improvement of our financial and credit profile and the execution on our regulatory strategy focused on benefiting our customers. We feel like we have great momentum for the future focused on delivering value for our customers, shareholders and all of our stakeholders.\nAs always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy. Before we take your questions, I'm going to turn the call back over to John.\n\nJohn William Somerhalder\n\nInterim President & CEO and Chair of the Board, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Jon. We'll have plenty of time for your questions, but I wanted to take another opportunity to say how pleased I am with FirstEnergy's progress. As you've heard this morning, this team has delivered on our goals. They have diligently executed our plan, and they have exemplified our commitment to performance excellence. I'm proud of where we are as a company, and I'm excited about our future.\nNow let's open to Q&A."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you. You may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVP of IR & Communications, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you.\nWelcome to our Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.\nWe will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that support today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year-to-date can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with presentations from John Somerhalder, our Board Chair and Interim President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session.\nNow I'll turn the call over to John Somerhalder.\n\nJohn William Somerhalder\n\nInterim President & CEO and Chair of the Board, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Irene. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today.\nFirstEnergy continues to make significant progress in its transformation. Yesterday afternoon, we reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $0.58 per share and operating earnings of $0.79 per share. These results, which Jon will discuss in more detail later in the call, are at the upper end of our guidance and support our expectation for full year 2022 operating earnings in the top half of our full year guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share, assuming normal weather.\nIn addition to our strong financial and operational performance year-to-date, we continue to execute against our strategy to become a more resilient and forward-looking company that is positioned for long-term stability and success. We are building positive momentum through our ongoing efforts to strengthen our culture, rebuild shareholder trust, accelerate improvements of our balance sheet and drive operational excellence through innovation and continuous improvement efforts. And we are positioning our company to capitalize on significant opportunities for growth through long-term customer-focused investments.\nI'm privileged to work alongside the strong leadership team in this interim role, and I'm confident that this team and our committed employees will continue to execute on these strategies to transform the company into a best-in-class utility. And we intend to continue this momentum as we transition to a new Chief Executive Officer. The Board's external search is well underway, and we remain hopeful that we can make an announcement late this year or early in 2023.\nThe key attributes we're seeking include a strong track record of executive leadership within the utility industry, a demonstrated ability to execute on the regulatory front, leading operational and financial discipline and impeccable credibility with external stakeholders.\nOur Board is excited about the future of the company and is confident in the leadership team and our strategy. We expect to continue driving the efforts that are already underway to ensure FirstEnergy is built for long-term success, and it's our expectation that the new CEO will see the same strong future that we see for FirstEnergy.\nWe are entering this new chapter from a position of strength. As we continue to focus on balance sheet improvements through organic growth and operating cash flow and our plan to sell an additional minority interest in one of our distribution or transmission assets, we will further accelerate improvements in our credit metrics. Improving our balance sheet to be on par with premium utilities will support higher levels of capital deployment to harden and modernize the electric grid to support the energy transition.\nBefore I turn the call over to Jon, I want to thank our employees for their efforts to move FirstEnergy forward over the last few years. They have been asked to step up time and time again to serve our customers, meet our commitments to stakeholders and stay focused on strengthening our company for the future. They continually rise to the challenge. Their hard work is helping us make great strides towards implementing our strategy and achieving our vision, and the Board remains committed to providing them with the support and resources they need to carry this company forward. I'm confident in the strength and talent of our team and our future.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon Taylor.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Strategy, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you can join us for today's call.\nWe continue to execute on our strategies as we drive strong operational and financial performance. I'll start my remarks with a review of some regulatory and business updates, then we'll move to a discussion of financial results and expectations.\nStarting in Ohio, we are nearing completion of the first phase of our grid modernization program, which began in 2019 and included installing more than 700,000 smart meters with supporting communications and data management systems and voltage regulating and distribution automation equipment on over 200 circuits to help provide our customers with enhanced reliability and power quality along with greater visibility into their electric usage. We continue this successful work.\nIn July of this year, we filed for our grid modernization Phase 2, a 4-year $626 million capital investment program, that proposes to deploy an additional 700,000 smart meters, distribution automation equipment on nearly 240 circuits and voltage-regulating equipment on nearly 220 circuits. It also includes pilot programs related to electric vehicle charging and battery storage. Together, these programs are designed to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power while offering our customers modern experiences, emerging technologies and opportunities to help lower their bills.\nIn West Virginia, the Public Service Commission approved a settlement agreement for environmental compliance projects at the Fort Martin and Harris power stations to meet the U.S. EPA's current affluent limitation guidelines required to operate both plants beyond 2028 as well as a surcharge to recover the expected $142 million of capital investment along with annual operation and maintenance expenses. We currently expect to complete this construction by the end of 2025.\nThese projects allow us to responsibly operate these power plants for the benefit of our customers in the state through 2035 and 2040 as we continue to support a timely and clean energy transition.\nAt the same time, we continue securing commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers in West Virginia to purchase solar RECs from our 5 planned utility scale solar generation facilities totaling 50 megawatts. As part of the conditional approval by the West Virginia Public Service Commission, Mon Power is required to obtain subscriptions for at least 85% of the facilities prior to filing for final approval. The customer response has been favorable, and we expect to reach the 85% threshold before the end of the year.\nOur expectation is that our first solar generation site will be in service in 2023, with others to follow by 2025 at a total investment of approximately $100 million. This progress coupled with other regulatory outcomes this year around smart meter and electric vehicle programs in New Jersey go a long way in executing on our strategy to improve the customer experience through investments that modernize the grid and support the energy transition.\nAs we think about the future, we are preparing for an active regulatory calendar in '23 and '24. We've planned rate case filings in New Jersey, Maryland and West Virginia, all in the first half of 2023. For JCP&L, we last filed a case in 2020, and for West Virginia and Maryland, our last base rate case was filed in 2014 and 2018, respectively.\nThe planned rate cases will primarily address our lower equity returns, as highlighted in the presentation, which are the result of the significant capital investments we have made since our last rate case and changes in operating expenses, and include the accounting changes that we have previously discussed, such as vegetation management and corporate support costs.\nIn addition, the New Jersey rate case would address our smart meter and electric vehicle programs. The Maryland case would address our electric distribution infrastructure investment and EV program. And in West Virginia, we plan to file for new depreciation rates resulting from a depreciation case to be submitted later this year.\nAlso, as you recall, our existing Ohio Electric Security Plan expires on May 31, 2024. Thus, we plan to file a new ESP in the first half of 2023, which will include a proposal around our generation procurement plan. And ESP also provides an opportunity for provisions regarding distribution service such as capital recovery riders as well as additional programs that can provide benefits to our customers, such as energy efficiency. In the months ahead, we intend to engage Ohio stakeholders in a discussion about our proposed ESP V.\nAs we've mentioned on previous calls, we have been considering the potential consolidation of our Pennsylvania and Ohio operating companies into 2 state utilities. While we continue to evaluate our options in terms of timing for a potential Ohio consolidation, we expect to file an application in Pennsylvania within the next 6 months. Consolidating these utilities will align with our 5-state operating model, simplify our legal entity structure and increase the flexibility and efficiency of our financing needs. In 2024, we are required to file a base rate case for our Ohio utilities and we are beginning to explore the option of filing a rate case in Pennsylvania at some point within our current planning cycle.\nFinally, in these regulatory filings, we plan to address recovery of regulatory asset balances, such as deferred storm costs, which currently amount to approximately $680 million across all of our jurisdictions. In September, Ohio Edison issued $300 million of 10-year notes at 5.5%. And we have one more transaction to complete this year at West Penn Power as we continue executing our debt financing plan.\nWhile interest rates have increased, interest expense remains manageable through 2024 as our new money requirements are minimal, and our debt maturities over this same period have higher coupons averaging near 5%. Additionally, filing for new base distribution rates in all of our jurisdictions over the near term allow us an opportunity to address the increased cost of debt.\nWe remain focused on improving the credit profile of the company. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $140 million of holding company debt in the open market, bringing our total holding company debt reduction to $2.5 billion this year, which is more than a 30% reduction from the end of 2021. Also, as John mentioned, we are pursuing the sale of additional minority stake in one of our distribution or transmission businesses. This would follow our very successful transaction with Brookfield Super-Core Infrastructure Partners for a 19.9% interest in FirstEnergy Transmission LLC that was completed in May of this year at a 40x PE multiple or 3x rate base for approximately $2.4 billion.\nWhile we don't have any additional details at this time regarding a proposed transaction, we remain focused on accelerating our balance sheet improvement efforts in a cost-effective manner with a goal of achieving 14% to 15% FFO to debt much sooner than originally planned.\nWe had a robust discussion about the pension during our second quarter call and our approach has not changed. Extreme volatility in both interest rates and global equity markets continue. The discount rate that measures our pension obligation increased from 3% at the end of 2021 to approximately 5.5% as of September 30, while asset losses and our qualified pension trust were approximately 22% through the same date. Despite the asset performance, our net qualified pension obligation improved over $400 million from 2021 to approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter with the plan's funded status at 81%.\nThe potential 2023 EPS headwind from the qualified pension plan has increased from $0.30 as of June to approximately $0.45 as of September 30. As we communicated in July, we are confident in our mitigation plan to address the $0.30. This includes costs we have already begun accelerating into 2022, the benefits from our balance sheet improvement efforts, specifically the $1 billion of high coupon debt that we retired in June and the expected uplift from other corporate cost reductions and earnings from our legacy investment in the Signal Peak mining operation.\nWe will also continue contemplating longer-term regulatory approaches to moderate the impact of market volatility on our pension plan, and we would look for additional offsets if the outcome as of December 31 exceeds $0.30. While an impact larger than $0.30 would affect 2023 earnings, we don't plan to pursue shortsighted gains that could take us off track for the future. Our solid and sustainable investment pipeline focused on providing reliable service to customers continues to firmly support our long-term plan for 6% to 8% growth.\nOur focus remains on controlling what we can control and creating value over the long term through regulated investments, operational and financial discipline and an improved credit profile. Our financial performance this quarter speaks to the continued resiliency of our business.\nThird quarter GAAP earnings were $0.58 per share and operating earnings were $0.79 per share, near the top of our guidance range. GAAP results primarily reflect a onetime charge as a result of implementing recommendations from the FERC audit, which covered the period going back to 2015 and resulted in certain write-offs and expected refunds. On a proforma basis, excluding the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions, which are all unique drivers this year, our third quarter operating earnings increased $0.11 per share or 16% compared to the same period in 2021.\nOn a year-to-date basis, we reported GAAP earnings of $1.42 per share and operating earnings of $1.91 per share. Again, on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the accounting changes, the Ohio rate credits and equity transactions, we achieved a $0.17 improvement in operating earnings compared to the first 9 months of 2021 or nearly 10% year-over-year growth.\nThird quarter results in our distribution business benefited from higher weather-related demand, the positive impact of our capital investment programs and lower financing costs. These benefits offset higher operating expenses associated with accelerating future planned maintenance work from 2023 into 2022 and higher material costs.\nTotal and weather-adjusted distribution deliveries were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of 2021. Warmer summer weather and stronger demand from industrial customers, reflecting the continued rebound in many industrial sectors within our service territory, was partially offset by lower year-over-year weather-adjusted residential usage.\nResidential sales decreased 1% from the third quarter of 2021 and a little less than 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. However, sales to residential customers remain higher than pre-pandemic levels by nearly 3% on a trailing 12-month basis, reflecting a permanent structural shift in this high-margin customer class.\nDeliveries to commercial customers decreased 1% or close to 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. And sales to industrial customers increased approximately 2%, led by growth in fabricated metals, automotive, food manufacturing, education services and plastic and rubber.\nThird quarter industrial sales were down approximately 1% compared to pre-pandemic sales. In our transmission business, third quarter results primarily benefited from continued formula rate base growth associated with our Energizing the Future investment program and lower financing costs. Our ongoing investments in this important program have added more than $0.5 billion in additional rate base since the third quarter of 2021.\nKey projects currently underway include replacing more than 1,100 insulators along a 68-mile transmission line corridor in Northeast Ohio to ensure power reliability and resilience, a new substation in Ashland County, Ohio, to meet the area's future energy demands and supporting economic growth, and planning for a new high-voltage substation to support a data center campus that is under development in Frederick, Maryland.\nAnd finally, our corporate segment benefited from higher investment earnings from the Signal Peak mining operation and lower financing costs primarily related to our holding company debt redemptions throughout the year. With our strong results so far this year and our outlook for the next 2 months, assuming normal weather, we expect 2022 operating earnings at the top half of our guidance range. Additionally, we are on track to meet our cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion this year, and improve operating cash flow consistent with earnings over time.\nIn mid-February, along with announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, we plan to provide you with 2023 guidance, along with updated capital and other plans to support our future growth. I too am proud of our progress to revitalize our culture, optimize our performance and improve our financial profile. We are energized by our transformation and look forward to taking the next steps to become a premium utility.\nNow I'll open the line to your questions. As always, I appreciate your time and your interest in FirstEnergy."

Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President of Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVP of IR & Communications, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.\nWe will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year can be found in the Strategic and Financial Highlights document on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven E. Strah\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you, Irene, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today. Yesterday, we reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $0.33 per share and operating earnings of $0.53 per share at the upper end of our guidance range. Today, we are reaffirming our 2022 operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share. We are also affirming our long-term annual operating earnings growth rate of 6% to 8% and accelerating our FFO-to-debt target of 13% by 1 year to 2023 from 2024 with targeted metrics in the mid-teens thereafter.\nAs Jon will discuss later, given our strong year-to-date performance, we have begun strategically investing in maintenance activities in our distribution businesses to further improve reliability and get ahead of future planned work. This provides tremendous flexibility in our long-term plan. We will continue to accelerate these operating expenses during the second half based on the strong outlook for the remainder of the year.\nThrough the first half of 2022, we've made significant progress to strengthen our culture, optimize our operations, bolster our financial position and support the grid of the future, continuing our momentum to become a more customer-focused and sustainable utility. Across the company, we're continuing to amplify our core values of safety, integrity, diversity, equity and inclusion, performance excellence and stewardship. We've recently launched a new employee communication campaign to focus on each of these values and how they drive our success.\nIn addition, I personally connected with thousands of employees over the past several months to discuss our core values and to hear directly from them on what we can do to get better as a company. Since March, I've held about 50 virtual and in-person listening sessions with more than 4,000 employees across FirstEnergy. We've had a lot of great engagement during these sessions and it's been incredibly valuable for me to interact with employees and get their feedback. I'm very proud of how our employees are executing on our plan and of the company and the culture we're creating together.\nI'd also like to take a moment to welcome 2 new directors who were elected to the Board at our Annual Meeting in May. Sean Klimczak of Blackstone and Jana Croom of Kimball Electronics. In related developments, John Somerhalder was elected Board Chair and no longer serves as an executive of the company. And Lisa Winston Hicks was elected Lead Independent Director. I welcome the guidance, leadership and support from our refreshed Board.\nNow let's turn to some key accomplishments in the quarter. First, in May, we completed the sale of the 19.9% minority stake in FirstEnergy Transmission, LLC to Brookfield for approximately $2.4 billion. The proceeds from this historic transaction, together with the $1 billion Blackstone equity investment that closed in December have been deployed to strengthen our balance sheet and fund our regulated capital investments.\nAnd as Jon will discuss in more detail later, by paying down over $2.5 billion in long-term debt this year, we are driving meaningful progress and are ahead of our original plan to improve the credit profile of the company. Our transmission business continues to be one of the focal points of our strategy. Our Energizing the Future program has a relentless focus on reliability improvements for our customers.\nWe began the investment program in the ATSI region in 2014. And since that time, we have seen a 53% reduction in the interruptions to customers caused by transmission outages, a 49% decrease in transmission line outages and an 88% improvement of our protection systems. We're striving to build on this success within ATSI and across our territory as we continue to expand this investment program.\nSo far this year, we've completed important work across our footprint to reconfigure several substations, rebuild transmission lines, replace transformers and enhance network, cyber and physical security. These projects improve operational flexibility, upgrade the condition of equipment and enhance system performance. Our goals for the transmission business are aggressive yet achievable and we have the right strategies in place to ensure our success.\nWe're also making continued progress to advance our customer-focused, sustainable growth strategies on the distribution side of our business. In Ohio, earlier this month, we filed for the second phase of our grid modernization program, which builds off the system upgrades we've completed in the state since the PUCO approved our Grid Mod I program in 2019. The new 4-year Grid Mod II plan proposes a $626 million capital investment to expand our deployment of Grid Mod technologies designed to enhance the delivery of safe, reliable power, promote modern experiences for customers, offering emerging technologies and provide opportunities to help lower customer bills.\nThe second phase of our Grid Mod program includes installing automated equipment on nearly 240 distribution circuits that can isolate problems, minimize the number of customers impacted by an outage and quickly restore electric service. Energy-saving voltage-regulating equipment on nearly 220 circuits that can reduce the amount of energy that must be generated and more evenly distribute electricity down a power line. And an additional 700,000 smart meters along with the supporting communications infrastructure and data management systems.\nIn addition, the filing includes several pilot programs expected to provide enhanced customer benefits. These include supporting the adoption of EVs across our Ohio service territory by offering incentives to residential and commercial customers who participate in utility-managed charging of their electric vehicles and installing a battery storage system along the Ohio Turnpike that's designed to support increased EV charging load and enhanced grid reliability.\nIn the aggregate, we estimate the benefits to our Ohio customers of enhanced reliability, energy efficiency opportunities and the innovative products and services to exceed the cost of the Grid Mod II program by nearly $280 million in today's dollars.\nMoving to West Virginia. In April, the Public Service Commission provided conditional approval of our requested tariff to build a total of 50 MW of utility-scale solar generation in the state at a cost of approximately $100 million. In their order, the PSC required our Mon Power and Potomac Edison subsidiaries to subscribe at least 85% of the output before beginning construction on these facilities.\nWe began accepting commitments from residential, commercial and industrial customers to purchase solar RECs in May. We're making progress to meet the 85% threshold. And at that time, Mon Power and Potomac Edison will seek final approval from the commission for a surcharge to cover the balance of the project costs and begin full-scale construction. We expect the first solar generation site to be in service by the end of 2023, with the construction completed at the 4 other sites no later than the end of 2025.\nFinally, in New Jersey, JCP&L reached a settlement on our electric vehicle program with BPU staff, New Jersey Rate Counsel and others which was approved by the BPU without modifications in June.\nOur 4-year $40 million EV-driven program is designed to accelerate the adoption of light-duty electric vehicles with incentives and rate structures that continue to support the development of EV charging infrastructure throughout our JCP&L service territory. The cost of the program will be deferred into a regulatory asset. Capital costs will earn a return of 9.6% with recovery of those costs determined in JCP&L's next base rate case.\nBefore I pass the call over to Jon, we recognize there is significant interest in our pension plan performance in light of rising interest rates and the current bear market. We're committed to being transparent and flexible on this issue, and we'll keep you informed on our expectations and our plan as the year progresses.\nIn addition to the details Jon will provide on today's call, we've also published 2 new slides on this topic in our highlights document. I'm very pleased with our progress throughout the first half of this year. We remain committed to continuing our transformation and becoming an industry-leading utility that provides value to our investors, customers, employees and communities. Now I'll turn the call over to Jon.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Strategy, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for being here. I'll start with some additional perspective on the pension, then we'll move into a discussion of our earnings and other financial matters. To put this all in context, the impact of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and other macroeconomic factors has resulted in extreme inflation and market volatility that we haven't seen in over 40 years. And so we recognize that this is a topic that has a lot of attention today, but we don't consider this an issue that impacts the long-term value proposition of the company.\nThrough the first half of this year, interest rates have increased significantly with the discount rate that measures our pension obligation increasing from 3% at the end of 2021 to approximately 4.8% as of the end of June. Likewise, equity markets across the globe were down significantly with asset performance in our pension trust down approximately 15% through June. Although this results in an estimated earnings headwind of approximately $0.30 per share beginning in 2023, which reduces the noncash benefit from the pension from $0.40 per share in 2022 to an estimated $0.10 per share in 2023, the funded status of our qualified pension plan has improved from 82% at the end of 2021 to 84% at the end of June.\nAlthough we believe the earnings impact associated with the pension will normalize over time, we recognize that the historic market environment presents a challenge in the near term from an earnings perspective. And so let me take a minute to address this. First, our regulated strategy and capital investment program continues to be strong as we transition more of our capital investments to formula rates with real-time returns while working to lower our base operating expenses.\nOur base plan includes formula rate investments of approximately $2.4 billion in 2023 and $2.6 billion in 2024 that earned solid returns. In addition, as Steve mentioned, the outlook for 2022 is very strong given the successful tender offer completed in June at our holding company and higher-than-anticipated income from legacy, commodity-based investments. And our FE Forward program continues to be part of our plan, allowing us to optimize our cost structure and be more strategic with our operating costs.\nIn combination, these items allow us to accelerate future planned maintenance work into 2022 that will provide flexibility with operating expenses in future years while meeting our financial commitments for this year. We have also identified a number of other steps to address the pension headwind. These include accelerating additional capital investments and optimizing our financing plans, which includes moving $1 billion of planned debt financings from 2023 to future years, reducing corporate costs in our real estate footprint as well as anticipated benefits from continued improvements we are seeing in customer arrears.\nFrom a regulatory perspective, we are exploring proposed changes to rate treatment for our pension to moderate impacts of market volatility between rate cases. But this will take some time and will likely be executed as we file base rate cases in each jurisdiction over the next few years.\nAnd so I'll conclude the pension discussion to say this. We realize this is complicated and recognize the potential near-term earnings impact to the company. But we do believe there is a clear silver lining. As markets became volatile and interest rates increased, we were able to take advantage of the situation by retiring high key fund debt and amounts well above our original plan.\nAt the same time, rising interest rates reduced our pension liability by $550 million. And as a result, as Steve mentioned earlier, we made significant progress through the first half of this year, to improve our balance sheet and strengthen the credit profile of FirstEnergy.\nUtilizing the proceeds from the Brookfield and Blackstone transactions, we eliminated approximately $2.4 billion of holdco debt in the first 6 months of the year, which equates to $125 million in saved interest costs on an annual basis. This includes the early retirement of an $850 million FE Corp note in January, a $500 million FE Corp note in June and the repurchase of $1 billion in high coupon FE notes through our successful tender offer last month.\nThis surpasses our original plan for holding company debt reduction and brings FirstEnergy holdco debt as a percentage of total debt to 26% from 33% at the end of 2021. And based on our current forecast with these enhancements, we are tracking just under 12% FFO-to-debt in 2022 and plan to be at 13% FFO-to-debt in 2023, a year ahead of what we initially targeted.\nLast week, Fitch upgraded FirstEnergy and FET to investment grade and upgraded our utilities to a BBB flat rating, reflecting the successful completion of our equity transactions, use of those proceeds to pay down company debt and the expected strengthening of our credit metrics, our settlement to address key Ohio regulatory issues and our meaningful improvements on governance matters.\nWe are proud of the progress we made. And as we saw with the FET transaction, premium valuations of our businesses in the private sector give us significant optionality to further improve the balance sheet and increase value for shareholders.\nAnd now let's turn to a discussion of our financial performance for the quarter. Second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.33 per share and operating earnings were $0.53 per share and within the upper end of our earnings guidance range. The $0.20 of special items in the quarter include a charge of $0.17 per share associated with the redemption and early retirement of FE Corp notes that we discussed earlier. On a pro forma basis, excluding the impact of accounting changes, rate credits provided to Ohio customers and equity financing transactions, operating earnings increased by $0.06 per share or 13% compared to the second quarter of 2021.\nOn a year-to-date basis, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.83 per share and operating earnings of $1.12 per share. Again, adjusting for the impacts of accounting policy changes, Ohio rate credits and dilution, this represents a $0.06 improvement versus our operating earnings for the first half of 2021 or approximately 6% year-over-year growth.\nResults for the quarter in our distribution business decreased slightly compared to the second quarter of 2021, but remain consistent with our expectations. The positive impact of our investment programs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and New Jersey was offset by slightly lower residential customer demand, as I'll discuss in a moment, and higher planned operating expenses including planned maintenance outages at our generation facilities as well as the impact of accelerated maintenance work we mentioned earlier.\nI do want to note, despite the inflationary conditions, our year-to-date base O&M expenses are consistent with our operating plan, reflecting strong financial discipline. Total and weather-adjusted distribution deliveries increased approximately 1% compared to the second quarter of 2021 as a result of stronger demand from commercial and industrial customers, reflecting improving conditions versus last year.\nResidential sales decreased 1.6% on a year-over-year basis due primarily to milder weather compared to the second quarter of 2021. On a weather-adjusted basis, residential usage decreased slightly due to a continued shift to more normal work and social activities, albeit sales in this class continue to be elevated as compared to pre-pandemic levels.\nDeliveries to commercial customers increased 1.5% or 1.9% on a weather-adjusted basis and sales to industrial customers increased 2.4% versus last year. And for the first time, industrial sales were higher than pre-pandemic levels by close to 1%, reflecting strong recovery and growth in many sectors, including steel, fabricated metals, automotive and food manufacturing.\nIn our transmission business, second quarter results benefited from strong rate base growth associated with our ongoing investments in the Energizing the Future program to improve reliability for our customers. We currently have more than 1,000 transmission projects underway across our footprint, and we've been successful working through acute supply chain challenges to remain on track with our plan to invest $1.5 billion in our system this year.\nAnd finally, in our corporate segment, our results improved by $0.09 per share compared to the second quarter of 2021, largely impacted by higher profits from our legacy investment in a mining operation in Montana as well as lower interest costs from our efforts around the balance sheet I mentioned earlier.\nThe legacy investment is from the late 2000s where we are a minority investor with a 33% share in the facility. Historically, it has not been a significant driver of our results. However, given higher commodity prices, the mine is outperforming our expectations for 2022 with both earnings and cash distributions, which as I mentioned before, provides us significant flexibility to accelerate reliability and maintenance work in our distribution business.\nAlthough earnings from this investment may continue in the future years, our original plan did not include any earnings contribution beyond 2022. We're off to a solid start for the first half of the year with a strong outlook for the second half. As Steve mentioned, we are confirming our 2022 operating earnings guidance range of $2.30 to $2.50 per share and are also providing third quarter earnings guidance of $0.70 to $0.80 per share.\nWhile we're disappointed in our relative stock price performance since our first quarter call, given the progress we have made over the last years on many fronts, we're confident that our superior assets and clear strategy place us on strong footing to perform well in the future. With that, we'll go ahead and open the line for your questions. As always, thank you for your time and your interest in FirstEnergy."

First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. At this time, it is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you, Ms. Prezelj. You may now begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVP of IR & Communications, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Welcome to our first quarter 2022 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties, factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings. We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year on the Investors section of our website. We'll begin today's call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session. Now I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven E. Strah\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Irene, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're off to a solid start in 2022. Yesterday, we reported GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share and operating earnings of $0.60 per share, in line with the midpoint of our guidance. With our financial performance, operational momentum, portfolio of assets and robust long-term business model, we are in a strong position, and I'm optimistic and excited about the future.\nToday, we are reaffirming our operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 per share for 2022 and growth of 6% to 8% thereafter based on our 5-year $17 billion investment plan. And while the dividend is subject to Board approval, I can affirm that we will still expect to maintain our annual dividend rate of $1.56 per share this year with the objective to grow the dividend within our payout ratio as earnings increase from our 2022 base.\nThis year, we're focused on continuing our transformation into a company with a strong foundation, an unrelenting focus on our customers and a leader in the energy transition. Over the last couple of years, we've asked a lot of our employees as we implemented a series of changes. From FE Forward initiatives to our enhanced values, numerous updates to policies and procedures and multiple training sessions across the company, our employees have accomplished a lot. And they have done this while executing at a high level across the company. I am very grateful for all of them and incredibly appreciative of their work and strong performance over the many years, but especially, over the last 18 months. I am very proud of what they have done.\nBuilding off this momentum, we believe that our employees and culture will be the single most important value drivers of our long-term strategy. Earlier this year, we formed a cross-functional culture transformation working group to consolidate, coordinate and streamline our numerous initiatives designed to drive culture change with the goal of making these changes meaningful and impactful to employees. By better aligning our culture initiatives and narrowing the focus with a simpler, integrated culture change road map for 2022, we can help employees make meaningful steps in a few areas at a time.\nThe outcome of this work resulted in identifying 3 key focus areas for our culture transformation for 2022: embedding our refreshed values, integrity, safety, DE&I, performance excellence and stewardship into every aspect of our culture; fostering an open, trusting environment where leaders create opportunities for 2-way dialogue and employees feel valued and empowered; and improving advancement and development opportunities for our employees.\nWe are supporting these efforts by consistently demonstrating our values in action in communicating with employees, creating a culture champion network to support our transformation efforts, facilitating listening sessions hosted by me and other members of our senior leadership team, along with small group employee discussions and quarterly speak-up sessions that encourage open and transparent 2-way dialogue and enhancing our focus and accountability around more robust, meaningful discussions between employees and their supervisors that support career management and development. We're striving to empower employees to make their jobs more meaningful and encourage the candor and collaboration that can make our company more innovative, customer-focused and a great place to work.\nChanging a culture takes time, trust and persistent modeling as well as alignment with our employees' personal values and needs. I am deeply committed to this, as is our leadership team, and we view it as critically important work. By listening, being more open and transparent, we can do better and produce better results for all of our stakeholders, including our employees, customers and investors.\nTaking a more open and engaged approach is also a cornerstone of our efforts to prioritize our customers and enhance the customer experience. Last month, before winter utility disconnection moratorium is lifted in our areas, we launched an enhanced campaign to engage residential customers who may be facing financial hardships. We recognize that many customers in this position don't reach out for help, and they may be unaware of the various utility bill assistance programs available to them.\nTo reach these customers, we produced a video message featuring several members of our customer service team. They spoke passionately about their desire to assist customers, and we raised awareness of various programs and payment options that might help during these difficult times. Our goal was to reach out and invite customers to come to us for help. At the end of March, we had more than 0.25 million customers enrolled in utility assistance programs with $71 million in funding applied to those accounts. Compared to the first quarter of 2021, that's an increase of more than 17% in contributions directly benefiting customers enrolled in these assistance programs this year.\nThis effort also contributed to a continued decline of past due balances, which are now on par with prepandemic levels in Ohio and West Virginia, reducing the risk of bad debt. This campaign is the first step to enhance the customer experience, show customers that we care. And we will help them wherever they are on their journey.\nAs we discussed on our fourth quarter call, FE Forward is our engine for optimizing our organization and customer-focused initiatives, including numerous projects designed to enhance communications, self-service options and provide better experiences for customers who are in need of assistance. For example, we've recently enhanced our website to make it easier for customers to understand and pay their bills. They can also use new features to easily make a payment for a family member or a friend, enroll in payment plans that level out their billing, identify assistance programs and avoid service disconnection.\nFrom an organization standpoint, now that we've aligned our utility operations into a 5-state model to enhance collaboration, streamline processes and maximize efficiency, we are beginning a longer-term review to consider the possible benefits of combining our Ohio entities as well as those in Pennsylvania from a legal, financial, operational and branding perspective. And finally, FE Forward will improve productivity and our cost structure through investments in digital technologies, upgrading and integrating key systems and using data to help us make better, more efficient decisions for our customers. Through these investments, we anticipate significant productivity improvements, substantially reducing the need for high-cost external contractors that augment our workforce today.\nOur commitment to prioritizing customers also means providing excellent service and preparing for the grid of the future. In Ohio, we are nearing the end of the first phase of our grid mod program, which began in 2019 and includes investments in smart meters, distribution automation and voltage-regulating equipment. The program also supports our advanced distribution management system that is being installed to help automate the outage restoration process and optimize grid performance. We're excited about the benefits these investments can provide to our customers, including enhanced reliability, improved power quality and greater visibility into their electricity usage. We plan to file for a second phase of grid mod investments in Ohio in the third quarter to continue this successful program.\nIn New Jersey, JCP&L received approval from the BPU to begin installing smart meters on customer homes and businesses in 2023. The approved plan includes a capital investment of $421 million for the installation of more than 1.1 million smart meters over a 36-month period. Across our entire footprint, our utilities have installed more than 2.7 million smart meters since 2014, with implementation efforts nearly complete in Pennsylvania and currently underway in Ohio. In New Jersey, we are working towards a settlement of our proposed EV-driven program. The 4-year program is designed to accelerate the adoption of light-duty electric vehicles with incentives and rate structures that would support the development of an EV charging infrastructure throughout our JCP&L service territory.\nWe are also making solid progress to complete our sale of a 19.9% stake in FET to Brookfield. Last week, CFIUS notified FET and Brookfield that it's determined there were no unresolved national security issues and its review of the transaction was concluded. And yesterday, FERC issued its orders on the pending applications for Blackstone's designee to serve as a voting member on the FE Corp Board and for authority to close the transaction with Brookfield. We remain on track to close the sale of the FET minority interest in the second quarter of this year and deploy the proceeds thereafter.\nWe also continue to make progress in resolving outstanding litigation in order to provide certainty to stakeholders and focus our attention on the future. Last week, we reached a settlement in the Ratepayer civil RICO lawsuit in the amount of $37.5 million. We previously recognized a reserve for this settlement in our fourth quarter 2021 earnings. I'm looking forward to working with our refreshed Board, including new nominees, Sean Klimczak of Blackstone; and Jana Croom who is the Chief Financial Officer for Kimball Electronics. At the same time, I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to our outgoing Board members, Don Misheff, Mike Anderson, Julia Johnson, Tom Mitchell, Chris Pappas and Luis Reyes. I am very grateful for their expertise and guidance.\nThank you for your time today. We are committed to continue delivering financial and operational excellence as we execute our long-term business strategies and transform our company into a more innovative, resilient and industry-leading organization.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon for a financial update.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Strategy, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As Steve said, we're off to a solid start this year. Our first quarter GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share and operating earnings of $0.60 per share were in line with the midpoint of our guidance. Excluding the impact of our recently issued equity, rate credits provided to Ohio customers under our PUCO approved stipulation last year and accounting policy changes, operating earnings increased by $0.03 per share compared to the first quarter of 2021.\nOur first quarter results include several special items, the largest being a $0.06 per share charge associated with the redemption and early retirement of an $850 million FE Corp note in January of this year. Excluding the items I mentioned, the results in our distribution business decreased slightly but were consistent with our business plan. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by a slight increase in operating and other expenses, primarily related to planned plant outages in West Virginia and higher storm costs and employee benefits, partially offset by lower uncollectible expense. These costs were partially offset by higher customer demand and a continued economic recovery in the commercial and industrial segments. It's important to note that our operating costs were in line with our forecast, as discussed on the fourth quarter call.\nOur total distribution deliveries increased 3.6% compared to the first quarter of 2021, and we're only slightly off our load forecast for the first quarter. Breaking the year-over-year impact down by customer class, we saw a 2.2% increase in residential demand due primarily to weather. And on a weather-adjusted basis, customer usage decreased only slightly versus the first quarter of 2021 as customers continue resuming normal work and social activities. Deliveries to commercial customers increased 7.6% and 4.7% on a weather-adjusted basis, which is a significant increase in this customer class. While sales to industrial customers increased 2.5% with many sectors, including steel and automotive, showing recovery from recessionary conditions.\nOverall, customer demand continues to slowly return to pre-pandemic levels. Our 1-year residential sales trend is about 3% higher than 2019 levels, while commercial and industrial deliveries remain about 4% and 2% below 2019.\nIn our transmission business, first quarter results increased $0.03 per share, primarily due to rate base growth associated with our ongoing investments in our Energizing the Future program. And in our Corporate segment, our results compared to the first quarter of 2021 primarily reflect lower interest expense and higher investment returns.\nIn addition to our earnings guidance, we are on track to meet our cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion this year and improved operating cash flow consistent with earnings over time. We met with the rating agency earlier this month and had a good conversation about our progress including our ongoing efforts to improve our balance sheet and strengthen the credit profile of FirstEnergy as we work to reach 13% FFO to debt by 2024, targeting mid-teens thereafter.\nAs Steve mentioned, we're on track to close the FET transaction in the second quarter. As we said, we plan to use a significant portion of the $2.4 billion in proceeds from the Brookfield transaction, together with the $1 billion Blackstone equity investment, to strengthen our balance sheet by reducing debt or debt-like obligations and to fund our capital program. In addition to the $850 million FE Corp note we retired in January, we plan to retire an additional $500 million at the corporate level after the Brookfield transaction closes and recapitalize certain operating companies to enhance their credit metrics and capital structures. Later this year, we'll make a determination on the deployment of the remaining $800 million, which could be used for a voluntary pension contribution, further reductions in FE Corp debt or to fund CapEx.\nAs we have mentioned previously, 2022 is a light year on the debt financing front with up to $750 million of planned debt issuances. However, steep increases in interest rates and market volatility have impacted our pension plan. As of the end of the first quarter, the discount rate for our pension obligation increased nearly 75 basis points or 25% to 3.75%. While the assets in the pension plan had close to a 6% loss for the quarter. While the funded status has improved from 82% at the end of 2021 to 84%, the volatility in the interest rate and equity markets has created a potential headwind for higher pension expense in 2023 and beyond. This is something we will continue to watch throughout the remainder of the year, but we are already thinking through different opportunities to offset this potential headwind.\nYesterday, we affirmed our 2022 operating earnings guidance and provided guidance for the second quarter of $0.46 to $0.56 per share. Given the number of moving pieces we have this year, we recognized consensus estimates by quarter are somewhat challenging for analysts at the moment, and we appreciate your work to get through this period with us.\nWe're off to a solid start this year, and we've got an excellent transformation plan to continue becoming an industry-leading company focused on long-term value for investors, customers, our communities and employees. As always, I appreciate your time and your interest in FirstEnergy.\nNow we'll open the line for your questions."

Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.\nIt is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Irene Prezelj, Vice President, Investor Relations for FirstEnergy Corp. Thank you. Ms. Prezelj, you may begin.\n\nIrene M. Prezelj\n\nVP of IR & Communications, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThank you. Welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 earnings call. Today, we will make various forward-looking statements regarding revenues, earnings, performance, strategies, prospects and other matters. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these statements can be found on the Investors section of our website under the Earnings Information link and in our SEC filings.\nWe will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, the presentation that supports today's discussion and other detailed information about the quarter and year can be found in the strategic and financial highlights document on the Investors section of our website.\nWe'll begin today's call with presentations from Steve Strah, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jon Taylor, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Several other executives will be available for the Q&A session.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Steve.\n\nSteven E. Strah\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us, and we have a lot of ground to cover. Over the past year, our Board, leadership team and employees have worked together to dramatically reshape FirstEnergy. We have embraced important foundational changes to strengthen our culture and the core of our company. We're optimizing our operations through our transformational FE Forward initiative, and we bolstered our financial position to enable long-term strategic investments to modernize the electric grid and to deliver a superior customer experience.\nI'm extremely proud of our progress. This important work together with our continued strong operational performance is energizing our company. Our efforts in 2021 were the first steps on a journey to transform FirstEnergy into a more sustainable company, centered on our core values and built for the long term.\nWhile the deferred prosecution agreement, the approved Ohio settlement and the progress we announced yesterday in resolving outstanding litigation are all very important milestones, most of our significant work over the past year involves the cultural changes at our company. So I'd like to start by talking about that.\nWe are building a culture where all of us at every level in the organization feel valued and understand the importance of doing what is right. This means doing what is in the best interest of our stakeholders as well as the environment, working as 1 team across the company, and developing an inclusive and safe culture where employees feel empowered and motivated to speak up and bring their very best every day. This culture change is the foundation, the heart, if you will, of a new FirstEnergy, and I am deeply committed to making this change.\nMy vision is to be a company that all stakeholders trust that is focused on delivering value to our customers and where employees bring an innovative and continuous improvement mindset to work every day. Fulfilling this vision starts with our people. Through all of the tribulations over the past 2 years, our employees have risen to every challenge and shown true character. They've delivered strong results while demonstrating a passion for what they do and a passion for serving customers. They deeply care about the communities we serve and they have a strong sense of pride for this company.\nBut we know that pride was eroded by what happened related to House Bill 6. I, along with the board and the entire management team, am dedicated to restoring their pride by building a company that is grounded in an unwavering culture of compliance, ethics, integrity and accountability at every level.\nPeople are our greatest asset and through our employee-driven FE Forward program, we are implementing their ideas and solutions to create value for our company, our customers and other stakeholders. By investing $150 million in innovation, digital tools and technologies, we can work more safely and efficiently, deliver an exceptional experience for customers and unlock opportunities for growth that are embedded in the broad energy transition.\nFor example, our employees have determined that we can better serve our customers through a 5-state operating model with centrally driven best practices and processes as opposed to separate operating company management teams. And last week, we made that transition.\nEmployees are implementing enhanced communications and self-service options to improve the experience for customers when they need our assistance. They're using data and analytics to drive better decisions around our assets, sourcing and inventory, resulting in better reliability for customers, and they're capturing productivity improvements through system integration, automation and mobility tools that will significantly reduce day-to-day work we outsourced currently.\nThis is important work and coupled with our investments in a more modern and sustainable grid, we expect it to completely transform our company inside and out. We're enabling this transformation in part through an innovation center and digital factory. These functions, which will be staffed by over 140 professionals are focused on enhancing the use of technology across our company.\nTogether with IT and cyber and physical security, they're now led by our new Chief Information Officer, Steve Fortune, who joined us this week. Steve was formerly Group CIO at BP, where he led a major digital transformation. We're fortunate to be able to bring him on board.\nWe recognize this is a journey, and I'm sure we'll face challenges along the way, but I'm confident in our team's ability to execute and meet our commitments as they did through 2021.\nNow let's spend a few moments on recent developments. First, in November, we announced a $3.4 billion transformational equity financing with 2 premier global infrastructure funds, Blackstone Infrastructure Partners and Brookfield Supercore infrastructure partners. Blackstone purchased $1 billion in FirstEnergy common stock at $39.08 per share in a transaction that closed in December. As part of that investment, Blackstone has appointed Sean Klimczak, to serve as a Board observer, and we expect to nominate a director candidate recommended by Blackstone in our 2022 shareholder meeting.\nBrookfield is purchasing a 19.9% stake in FET, which owns our ATSI, MAIT and TrAILCo transmission companies. With an investment of $2.4 billion, this transaction represents a historic valuation in our industry. We expect that transaction to close in the second quarter. These strategic financings address all our equity needs, will strengthen our financial position, and support the incremental investment opportunities in our plan, focused on sustainable investments that support the energy transition.\nWe're pleased to be a partner with these experienced and capable infrastructure investors who fully support the execution and acceleration of our current business strategy and transformation. Notably, these transactions demonstrate confidence in our business plan, our talented team and our vision for long-term growth. They are also a key catalyst to executing our strategy for long-term 6% to 8% customer-focused growth.\nAlso in November, we were pleased to reach a unanimous settlement with a broad range of parties on multiple Ohio proceedings that were under consideration by the Public Utilities Commission. The $306 million settlement, which was approved by the PUCO in December, benefits our Ohio customers provides clarity around a wide range of topics and demonstrates our commitment to working openly and collaboratively with our stakeholders. We also continue to make substantial progress in resolving outstanding litigation in order to provide certainty to stakeholders and focus our attention on the future.\nWe announced yesterday that in conjunction with the Special Litigation Committee of the Board of Directors, the company agreed to a settlement to resolve multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits in Ohio. Because the shareholder derivative suits brought on behalf of the company and for the company's benefit. The settlement includes a payment to FirstEnergy of $180 million less plaintiff's legal fees to be paid by insurance.\nThe settlement also stipulates a series of corporate governance enhancements, which are outlined in the press release we issued yesterday and complement the substantial actions we have taken as a company to strengthen our governance and compliance program over the last 1.5 years. Upon court approval, this settlement fully resolves the derivative actions.\nThe settlement contains provisions for enhanced oversight and disclosure of political activities, third-party audits and action plans and a review of the current executive team to be conducted by a special board committee and further alignment of financial incentives of senior executives with compliance measures.\nAdditionally, 6 members of the Board who have served for a minimum of 5 years will not stand for reelection at the company's 2022 Annual Shareholder Meeting. On behalf of the company, we thank these directors for their commitment and years of service to FirstEnergy. I'll also note, we have been evaluating various options to reduce the size of the Board, following the addition of 7 new directors in 2021, with an eighth from Blackstone to be appointed at this year's annual meeting. The Board will continue to comprise an impressive mix of skills, focus areas and perspectives as it guides our company through the next phase of our growth.\nTurning to other regulatory matters. There's also been progress on the Ohio expanded DCR audit, the DMR audit and the corporate separation audit. The audit reports have been filed in all of these cases and will continue to work through the regulatory process on each.\nDuring our third quarter call in late October, we alluded to 2 forthcoming filings in West Virginia that support the transition to clean energy. In November, we filed with the West Virginia Public Service Commission, a plan to build 50 megawatts of utility scale solar generation in the state at a total cost of approximately $100 million.\nAnd in December, we filed a plan to comply with environmental rules and responsibly operate our 2 remaining fossil plants for the benefit of West Virginia customers beyond 2028. We intend to begin a broad stakeholder dialogue regarding our planned operational end dates of 2035 and 2040 for Fort Martin and Harrison, respectively, which further supports our climate goals.\nWe will also begin preparing for future rate case activity including base rate case filings in 2023 for Maryland, West Virginia and likely New Jersey. And in 2024 for Ohio as well as the Ohio Company's filing to address the end of their current ESP, which expires in May of 2024.\nAlso in 2022, we will continue our focus on ethics and compliance. These priorities include: continuing to build a more centralized and robust compliance organization for updating and refining our processes, policies and controls; creating multiple channels for incident reporting; and developing thorough and objective processes to investigate and address incidence of misconduct; seeking continuous improvement by monitoring, benchmarking and obtaining an independent assessment of the program; and completing the training for all employees on our new code of conduct, and rolling out additional training on our speak-up culture and compliance.\nFinally, our ongoing commitment to creating a more diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment is an essential part of our overall cultural transformation taking place at our company. I am determined to build on our progress in this area.\nThis is a time of historic change at FirstEnergy, change for the better. As we look to the future, I believe our company will emerge as a premier utility and a leader in our industry. And I believe we can deliver value to our investors that mirrors the value we provide to customers. In all my years at FirstEnergy, I've never been more excited about what's to come.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Jon for a financial update.\n\nK. Jon Taylor\n\nSenior VP, CFO & Strategy, FirstEnergy Corp.\n\nThanks, Steve. Good morning, everyone. I'm also excited about our future and the significant progress we've made to place FirstEnergy in a solid financial position. As I discussed, we have a lot of moving parts this year as we absorb the Ohio settlement, certain accounting changes and begin to deploy the proceeds from the equity financings that we announced last year. As we integrate these elements into our financial plan, 2022 will be a baseline for strong long-term growth.\nAs always, we provide materials on our website to supplement our discussion today. The fact book has been refreshed to include additional information about our company strategy and our financial plan through 2025. While we don't plan to publish the fact book quarterly in 2022, we will expand the quarterly strategic and financial highlights deck to also include updates on our strategic priorities.\nNow let's take a look at the financial results we reported yesterday. Since we have so much to cover, I'll keep this part of our discussion a little shorter than normal. Yesterday, we announced 2021 fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $0.77 per share and operating earnings of $0.51 per share, which is at the midpoint of our guidance, despite incredibly mild fourth quarter weather.\nThere were several special items for the quarter, including a $0.47 per share mark-to-market gain on our pension due mainly to a higher discount rate, as well as a $0.22 per share regulatory charge resulting from refunds to customers under our Ohio PUCO settlement and a recent order in Pennsylvania to refund additional tax benefits.\nIn our distribution business, fourth quarter results increased as a result of new base rates in New Jersey and higher revenues from capital investment programs. Fourth quarter earnings also improved over last year from the absence of the charge we took in 2020 related to our strategic decision to forgo collection of loss distribution revenues in Ohio. Also impacting the quarter was lower customer demand and higher operating expenses associated with strategic investments made to enhance reliability for customers.\nFor the quarter, total distribution deliveries increased about 1% on both an actual and weather-adjusted basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher industrial and commercial usage was partially offset by a 2% reduction in the higher-margin residential customer class.\nCompared to pre-pandemic levels, weather-adjusted demand continues to be strong with our residential customers, reflecting a 4% increase for the year. And although industrial and commercial customer demand continues to be lower than we saw in 2019, we have seen incremental improvement each quarter of 2021. And our fourth quarter results reflect industrial and commercial demand down just under 2% and 3%, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.\nIn our regulated transmission business, earnings were consistent with our updated forecast, benefiting from higher rate base related to our Energizing the Future investment program, but this was more than offset primarily by higher net financing costs and other charges. And in our corporate segment, our results for the fourth quarter reflect lower operating expenses and higher discrete income tax benefits as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020.\nFor the full year, we reported GAAP earnings of $2.35 a share and operating earnings of $2.60 a share, which is at the midpoint of the range we provided last fall, representing a 9% increase compared to 2020 operating earnings of $2.39 a share.\nOur strong financial performance also resulted in $2.8 billion in cash from operations last year, which was $200 million more than our original cash from operations guidance and above the midpoint of the revised guidance range we provided on our third quarter call in October, and also reflects over $300 million of nonrecurring cash payments such as the penalty under our deferred prosecution agreement.\nLast fall, we outlined our $17 billion sustainable investment plan through 2025, which includes our $3.3 billion investment plan this year, encompassing grid modernization resiliency, energy efficiency, enabling the energy transition and base reliability improvements. We expect these investments to not only drive our 6% to 8% growth rate but help us emerge as a leader in the energy transition.\nWe also plan to make further improvements to our balance sheet this year. On January 20, we redeemed $850 million of holding company debt and plan to retire another $500 million in holdco debt expiring later this year. We have begun to recapitalize certain of our operating companies to fund their capital programs and improve their credit profiles. For instance, we recently issued redemption notices for $150 million and $25 million of operating company debt at CEI and Toledo Edison, respectively. We also plan to recapitalize certain other companies later this year to fund growth and enhanced credit metrics and capital structures as we plan to be much more active with rate proceedings in the future.\nFor 2021, our CFO to adjusted debt, as defined by Moody's, was 11.5%. This excludes the onetime nonrecurring payments I mentioned earlier, and that's our $1.5 billion cash position with debt. We are pleased with our progress, and we remain well positioned to achieve 13% CFO to debt by 2024.\nAs we consider the full deployment of the proceeds from the equity transactions, we will remain flexible considering market conditions to optimize our balance sheet and to fund our capital programs, including further reducing balance sheet debt at our holding company, optimizing utility capital structures to fund capital programs or voluntary pension contributions. Our qualified pension status has improved to 83% funded given the current interest rate environment.\nAs Steve discussed, FE Forward is transforming our organization and setting the stage for us to deliver a superior customer experience. In 2021, we achieved $300 million in total cash flow improvements from the program, compared to our original expectation of $240 million. This included $170 million in net CapEx efficiencies, along with $130 million in working capital improvements. As we look through 2025, we anticipate cash flow improvements to fund $1.6 billion in sustainable investments in our distribution business to support the energy transition while keeping customer rates affordable.\nSteve touched on several of our forward focus areas, and I'd like to expand on one more. As we all know, unprecedented supply chain issues have impacted virtually all industries throughout the pandemic. We have successfully served our customers and continued our infrastructure investment programs despite these challenges. However, through FE Forward, we are investing in our supply chain function to drive more integrated and strategic sourcing, improved market intelligence, resulting in better pricing decisions and to optimize performance in terms and conditions with our suppliers.\nWe have also integrated our warehouse and inventory management group into our procurement function to complement our demand management forecasting with long-term purchasing decisions. By leveraging technologies and investing in resources, we're streamlining our processes, achieving cost savings and better cash flow and working to mitigate risk the entire industry is experiencing.\nWhile FE Forward is focused on transformation and innovation, we are seeing efficiencies in our operating and maintenance activities, which will provide for flexibility with our operating costs. In fact, from our 2022 base O&M of $1.4 billion, we anticipate that FE Forward will naturally reduce O&M levels at least 1% annually starting in 2023. We -- this will afford added flexibility to be strategic with O&M as we were in 2021 and will also mitigate the impact on customer rates as we think about future rate cases.\nWe recognize that we have a lot of moving parts this year. However, by applying the same focus that has changed our company for the better over the past 12 months, I'm confident we will continue to implement the plans we've outlined and further transform our company into an industry leader.\nAt the same time, we'll deliver on our financial commitments, including achieving our 2022 operating earnings guidance of $2.30 to $2.50 a share, with growth of 6% to 8% thereafter, delivering on our 2022 cash from operations target of $2.6 billion to $3 billion, and growing operating cash flow consistent with earnings over the planning period.\nExecuting our $17 billion investment plan, which includes $3.3 billion of investments in 2022. Maintaining our anticipated annual dividend rate of $1.56 a share this year with the objective to grow the dividend within our payout ratio as earnings increase consistent with our plan. Successfully closing on the FET minority interest sale. And finally, making progress toward improving our balance sheet and strengthening the credit profile of FirstEnergy, as we work to reach 13% FFO to debt by 2024, with mid-teens thereafter.\nBefore we open the line for questions, I want to thank you for your time and your interest in the company. We are proud to be building a long-term, sustainable company and culture centered on our core values and the vision Steve shared with you today. I would be happy to take your questions."

Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in Firstenergy.\n\nIt's hard for me to believe that I've been with the company for eight months already.\n\nIt's flown by as I've gotten to know the fantastic employees of this company, who are dedicated to serving our customers every day.\n\nSome of you have heard me say previously that I consider myself to be a good Taylor of great stories.\n\nEmployees have given me a great story to tell for 2023 and I'll do my best to tell it well.\n\nThis morning, I'll provide an overview of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023 I'll.\n\nIll discuss some regulatory milestones that we recently achieved.\n\nWe are also unveiling today, an exciting capital investment program focused almost entirely on our wires business.\n\nOver the next five years, we plan to invest $26 billion and our regulated system to improve reliability and the customer experience.\n\nThis represents an increase of more than 44% compared to our last five year plan.\n\nWe will maintain our vigilance on affordability as our current rates are below our instate peers, John will provide more detail on this later.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2023, Firstenergy delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of 30 per share compared to a loss of 71 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nOperating earnings for the quarter was 62 per share, which was above the midpoint of our quarterly guidance range and compared to 50 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nFor the year 2023, the company delivered GAAP earnings from continuing operations of $1 96 per share and operating earnings of $2 56 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range.\n\nEmployees worked diligently throughout the year to overcome significant headwinds the impact of market conditions on our pension plan, creating an earnings drag of 30 per share an unusually mild weather impacted earnings by 28 per share.\n\nThrough our continuous improvement program employees were able to drive base O&M down over $200 million or 14% versus 2022.\n\nHalf of those savings are sustainable and this tremendous effort buoyed our full year results by 32 per share, allowing us to meet our operating earnings targets.\n\nIn 2023, the company put three $7 billion of Capex to work to improve reliability and the customer experience.\n\n16% more than was invested in 2022, 9% more than budget.\n\n93% of the 2020 through Capex was invested directly into our wires businesses.\n\nOur projects in construction organizations, we're able to take advantage of the improving supply chain environment and the mild weather to put incremental dollars to work.\n\n2023, with a game changing year for the company in terms of strengthening its balance sheet to enable future investment and growth and are mostly wires regulated business.\n\nIn February 2023, the company announced the second transaction with Brookfield to sell 30% of SVT for $3 $5 billion.\n\nWith the successful completion of our Pennsylvania consolidation and the anticipated order approving the filed settlement of the transaction. We are on track to close on this asset sale by the end of March.\n\nAt that time, we will receive the majority of the proceeds in cash with the balance to be paid before the end of the year.\n\nIn May we successfully executed a $1 5 billion convertible debt issuance at a 4% coupon we.\n\nWe use these proceeds to pay down debt and make a $750 million contribution to our pension assets.\n\nIn late December we executed a $700 million pension lift out representing over 8% of our total pension liability and reducing volatility in our pension plan by 10%.\n\nOur improved financial condition gave the board the confidence to raise the targeted dividend payout ratio to 60% to 70% of operating earnings in.\n\nIn September the board had the confidence to raise the quarterly dividend for the first time in more than three years.\n\nOf course subject to board approval. Our 2024 plan includes dividend declarations of $1 70 per share versus $1 60 per share in 2023.\n\nThis represents a 625% increase.\n\nGoing forward, we anticipate growing our dividend with operating earnings growth.\n\nThe significant improvement in our balance sheet puts firstenergy and a growth and investment mode. The fact that we do not expect incremental equity to fund our capex growth beyond our employee benefit programs differentiates firstenergy for many of our peers.\n\nWe are introducing a 26 billion five year capital investment program to improve reliability and our customers experience.\n\nWe are branding this program energized $3 65, and John will provide more details in his remarks.\n\nThese investments should enable 9% average annual growth in rate base over the period.\n\nWe are guiding to $4 $3 billion of investment in 2024, an increase of 15% over 2023.\n\nEnergized $3 65 represents a significant increase in our investments and rate base with improved earnings quality.\n\nWe expect to maintain a strong customer affordability position versus our instate peers.\n\nWe are reaffirming our 6% to 8% long term annual operating earnings growth rate.\n\nFirstenergy plans to execute on our long term growth rate year by year.\n\nThis is why we are announcing a 2024 operating earnings guidance range of $2 61 per share to $2 81 per share.\n\nThe midpoint is 7% above 2020, Three's operating earnings guidance midpoint.\n\nTurning to slide six let's take a look at our regulatory calendar.\n\nOne of the questions investors have asked is how would we know with firstenergy can obtain fair and reasonable regulatory outcomes the answer.\n\nWe have given is to look for milestones and our near term results.\n\nIn 2023 in early 2024, we have achieved several milestones demonstrating constructive regulatory outcomes.\n\nWe highlight a few.\n\nAs we mentioned in our last call we received a reasonable outcome in our Maryland distribution rate case.\n\nThe commission there approved a $29 million revenue increase that supports equity returns of nine 5% and an equity ratio of 53%.\n\nWe are pleased to serve and invest in Maryland to provide reliable.\n\nAnd affordable electricity to our customers.\n\nIn West, Virginia, We filed a settlement in our case.\n\nCase with staff have brought intervenor support for recovery of $255 million over three years with a carrying cost after year one.\n\nhas no disallowances.\n\nIn January of this year, we filed a settlement in our base rate case with staff and brought in a leader support.\n\n$105 million rate adjustment based on a nine 8% allowed Roe.\n\nAnd a 49, 6% equity ratio.\n\nThe settlement reflects the $700 million increase in rate base since our last.\n\nBase rate case in 2014.\n\nOf course, we did not get everything we ask for but the settlement is fair and constructive and it demonstrates west Virginia is an attractive place to invest for our customers.\n\nIn New Jersey, JC P&L filed a base rate case settlement last Friday with staffing broad intervenor support that reflects an $85 million rate adjustment based on an ROE of nine 6% and 52% equity ratio.\n\nThe settlement reflects the $400 million increase in rate base since our last base rate case in 2021.\n\nThe settlement will have a modest three 4% increase in the average residential bill and JC P&L rates will be 26% below our instate peers.\n\nIf approved the settlement would be a fair and reasonable outcome that will incentivize JC P&L to make investments to improve customer reliability.\n\nYeah.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, we received an order in December approving the consolidation of our Pennsylvania operating companies and approving the transfer of West Penn power transmission assets to capture.\n\nBoth transactions were executed on January 1st of this year.\n\nOur waiting commission approval of the filed settlement for the minority interest sale, which as anticipated soon we anticipate filing a base rate case in Pennsylvania by April.\n\nFor investors looking for milestones of Firstenergy is ability to receive reasonable and constructive regulatory outcomes. These recent examples provide convincing evidence.\n\nIn Ohio, we are actively working our way through our ESP filing grid Mod. Two cases, we are fully engaged in the regulatory process with staff and intervenors and expect constructive outcomes in both cases, we plan to file a base rate case in may.\n\nTurning to slide seven I want to briefly review of the new segment reporting that Firstenergy will adopt in 2024 to reflect how we are managing the company.\n\nIndividual companies will not be split among the segments, leading to simplicity and transparency and reporting as well as accountability and management.\n\nOur distribution segment, Weyerhaeuser, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.\n\nOr play distribution only companies are.\n\nOur Pennsylvania consolidation and the transfer of the West Penn power transmission assets to Cat .\n\nThis segment transparent and clean.\n\nThis segment will represent about $10 $9 billion in rate base served $4 2 million customers and account for about 45% of forecasted 2020 for operating earnings.\n\nSenior executive when we each of FTE, Pennsylvania and Ohio.\n\nOur integrated business segment will report on , Potomac Edison and Mon power are companies with combinations of distribution transmission and generation.\n\nThis segment will represent about $8 $7 billion in rate base serve 2 million customers and account for about 35% of forecasted 2020 for operating earnings.\n\nOur senior executive will lead JC, P&L and another would lead Mon power and Potomac Edison.\n\nOur last major business segment will be Standalone transmission and it will house, our pure play transmission only companies consistent of our ownership interest in .\n\nAs well as cat cover.\n\nThis segment will represent about seven 7 billion and consolidated rate base.\n\nCount for about 20% of forecasted 2020 for operating earnings.\n\nexecutives, who will be responsible for these businesses.\n\nFinally, corporate and other segment will be similar to the current segment with that name.\n\nIt will report holding company interest legacy investments, former subsidiaries and pension and OPEC.\n\nA recast of 2023 into the new segments is available in our fact book and we will provide quarterly and year to date reconciliations throughout 2024.\n\nSo let me provide some key updates on slide eight.\n\nIn regard to the Ohio organized crime Investigations Commission Theres nothing new to report we continue to cooperate with the commission and answer any questions. They ask that.\n\nFERC prosecution agreement with the Doj details Firstenergy his involvement and Theres nothing new with respect to the company.\n\nOkay.\n\nAnd the updated climate strategy published to our corporate responsibility website yesterday, we are providing an update to our greenhouse gas emissions goals.\n\nIn 2020, we set a goal of achieving net carbon neutrality by 2050 with an interim goal of reducing our scope on greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\nAchieving the 2030 interim goal was predicated on meaningful emissions reductions at our Fort Martin Harrison power plants in West, Virginia, which account for approximately 99% of our greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe've identified several challenges to our ability to meet that interim goal, including resource adequacy concerns in the PJM region and state energy policy initiatives.\n\nGiven these challenges we have decided to remove our 2030 interim goal.\n\nThrough regulatory filings in West, Virginia, We had forecast at the end of the useful life of Port Martin in 2035 and for Harrison in 2040.\n\nWe remain focused on achieving our aspirational goal of net carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of last year, we made two key additions to our leadership team.\n\nIn November we announced our hiring of Toby Thomas as Chief operating Officer.\n\nToby joined Us from American electric power.\n\nSent more than two decades in various leadership positions, including growing in managing one of the largest wires businesses in the country.\n\nIs responsible for system planning and protection transmission substation, and engineering project and construction management and system operations.\n\nWade Smith joined the company in December as the President of Firstenergy utilities. He was previously the chief operating officer of Puget Sound Energy.\n\nWade brings more than three decades of experience running large scale multistate transmission and distribution companies.\n\nThe presidents of our five operating businesses, who will report to him.\n\nOhio, Pennsylvania.\n\nP&L, our standalone transmission business, and Mon power and Potomac Edison.\n\nWe are actively reviewing internal and external candidates to run these businesses and expect to make hiring announcements in the coming months.\n\nWait until key additions to the leadership team that will grow and transform this company into a premier electric utility.\n\nIn 2023, and continuing into 2024, we have made transformational strides to improve the financial strength of Firstenergy.\n\nWe have organized our company with a singular focus on growing our five regulated mostly wires companies.\n\nWe are making the investments needed to improve reliability and the customer experience our strong.\n\nbalance sheet and organic investment opportunities differentiate firstenergy for many of our peers.\n\nWith that I will turn the call over to John.\n\nThank you, Brian and good morning, everyone.\n\nI'm also very proud of our performance in 2023, and I am excited to turn a new page in our company's history.\n\nToday I'll briefly review, our 2023 results, but more importantly discuss our enhanced five year plan in 2020 for guidance.\n\nOur results in 2023 speak to our employees dedication and tremendous performance.\n\nWhich included strategic and transformational initiatives, while doing the hard work to meet our financial commitments and a very challenging year and emerge as a stronger more nimble company.\n\nSince I've been at the company I can't recall, a more challenging year in terms of the financial headwinds, we faced including the most abnormal weather conditions that I can remember.\n\nStreamline volatile interest rate environment, and a significant impact on our pension plan from the interest rate and equity market performance in 2022.\n\nBut at the same time, our employees demonstrated their grit and resiliency to overcome these adversities, while making strategic advancements to improve our operational and financial performance.\n\nFourth quarter operating earnings were 62, a share which is above the midpoint of our guidance. This compares to 2022 fourth quarter operating earnings of 50. This year.\n\nFor the year operating earnings were $2 56, a share also above the midpoint of our guidance range.\n\nThis represents 7% growth off 2020, twos guidance midpoint and compares favorably to operating earnings of $2 41. This year in 2022.\n\nFourth quarter and full year results are detailed in the strategic and financial highlights document we posted to our IR website last night.\n\nAs we pointed to throughout the year, we largely offset the headwinds I mentioned earlier through a strong focus on reduced operating expenses across each of our business units.\n\nDeployment of proceeds from the low cost convertible debt offering in the spring.\n\nAnd certain tax benefits realized in the third quarter.\n\nOur focus on operating expenses across the company resulted in a 14% or over $200 million reduction year over year, representing a 32 per share year over year benefit.\n\nAs we've discussed about 50% of that represents unique items or work that was accelerated in 'twenty two from 'twenty three.\n\nThe other 50%, which largely includes productivity improvements across the company lower contractor usage and reduced corporate spending on areas such as branding and advertising are sustainable reductions to our cost structure.\n\nOur 2023 results benefited from our formula rate investment programs across our transmission and distribution businesses.\n\nWhich resulted in a 20 per share improvement year over year.\n\nAs Brian mentioned, we successfully deployed $3 $7 billion of capital in 2023 about $300 million or close to 10% above our original capital investment plan for the year.\n\nIn our transmission business earnings increased , , a share or close to 10% for the year, primarily from our investment programs, which resulted in rate base growth of 9% compared to 2022.\n\nFollowing the right investments in our transmission business were $1 8 billion, an increase of 28% compared to 2022 and $100 million or 6% above our original plan due to our margin projects.\n\nAnd our distribution business earnings declined year over year, primarily from the lower weather related distribution sales and a lower pension credit I spoke of earlier, but also reflect the impact of our formula rate investment programs new rates that went into effect in Maryland in mid October higher weather adjusted demand and lower operating costs that I spoke of.\n\nDistribution capex of $1 $9 billion represents an increase of 5% compared to 2022.\n\nAnd exceeded our original plan by $220 million or 13% as part of our plan increases we announced last year.\n\nFinally in our corporate segment 23 results benefited from lower O&M and a consolidated effective tax rate of about 16% versus nearly 21% in 2022, mostly as a result of planned use of state net operating loss carryforwards.\n\nAnd a final point on 'twenty three as Brian discussed, we executed a $700 million pension lift out in December representing.\n\nRepresenting about 8% of our total pension liability associated with our former generation subsidiaries.\n\nRemoving this obligation from our balance sheet at a 5% discount will reduce future earnings volatility related to fluctuations in pension assets and liabilities.\n\nAnd lowers overall pension plan costs.\n\nWe will continue pursuing opportunities to further de risk the pension plan through additional lift outs and pursuing pension tracking mechanisms through the regulatory process.\n\nNow, let's shift gears and talk about our outlook going forward.\n\nWe are very pleased to introduce our five year financial plan supporting our commitments to our investors, including 6% to 8% long term annual operating earnings growth with.\n\nWith significantly improved earnings quality investment grade credit metrics and dividend growth in line with earnings growth.\n\nThe cornerstone of this plan is a robust energized $3 65 grid evolution investment plan of $26 million with approximately 75% of planned investments in formula rate programs that provide real time returns.\n\nThe plan includes increasing annual investments in our transmission and distribution system, each year, resulting in 9% average annual rate base growth.\n\nEnergized 365, supersedes, our longstanding energizing the future transmission program, which we're sunsetting after a decade of strong performance.\n\nOur planned target investments that improve the customer experience and supports the energy transition or new load requirements, while ensuring a fair and reasonable regulated return for our investors.\n\nThe capital program is 45% weighted in FERC regulated transmission investments in our Standalone transmission and integrated businesses.\n\nIt includes investments to enhance and upgrade the transmission system and operational flexibility to support projects like New Jersey offshore wind and new data center load and regulatory required projects.\n\nOn the distribution system. The plan includes investments by our distribution and integrated segments to improve the customer experience through reliability enhancements grid modernization and clean energy investments such as smart meter deployment distribution automation and energy efficiency programs.\n\nThis comprehensive five year investment plan is very solid with flexibility.\n\nTo adjust this projects and programs emerge.\n\nOver the next couple of years, we anticipate an increase in earnings from our Formula rate investment programs and as we re rate base distribution rates for over $19 billion of state regulated rate base.\n\nOur plan builds off the approved or settled base rate cases in Maryland, West, Virginia, and New Jersey are integrated segment.\n\nRepresenting $7 billion in rate base that was earning 400 basis points below the allowed returns.\n\nAs well as scheduled base rate cases in Pennsylvania, and Ohio later this year.\n\nWe have $12 billion in projected rate base in our distribution segment and is also forecasting to be underwritten.\n\nThe true up of returns will allow us to earn closer to our allowed regulated returns and to significantly improve the earnings quality of the company with expected declines and the earnings contribution from signal peak.\n\nAnd longer term annual rate base growth with planned investments in formula rate programs more timely recover recovery of base capital investments and cost discipline with our operating expenses will result in less regulatory lag than we've seen historically with modest and reasonable customer bill impacts we expect.\n\nOur utilities to maintain their strong affordability position.\n\nKeep rates at or below our instate peers.\n\n365 will be funded with cash from operations, which we expect to average $4 billion plus annually building off our 2024 cash flow projections.\n\nAs well as regulated long term debt issuances and a portion of the $3 5 billion in proceeds from the transaction.\n\nAnd our plan does not include any incremental equity needs beyond our existing employee equity programs and it supports the to debt of 14% to 15% in.\n\nCorp debt at or below 20% of total debt.\n\nOur 2024 guidance range of $2 61 to $2 81 a share.\n\nrepresents a 7% increase off the midpoint of our 2023 guidance.\n\nWhich will largely be backend loaded given the timing of new rates in West, Virginia, and New Jersey, and O&M Mark plan for Q1 of this year.\n\nWith this in mind, our projections for the first quarter, our operating earnings of 48 this year to 58% this year.\n\nTo give you some color on the year over year increase our midpoint of $2 71, a share reflects 12% consolidated regulated growth offset by a decline in signal peak earnings contribution.\n\nThe increase reflects new rates and investments largely from approved or settle base rate cases in our integrated segment, where we anticipate new rates for our West, Virginia, and New Jersey settlements to be implemented late in the first quarter and ongoing formula rate investments in each of our businesses.\n\nA return to normal weather related customer demand.\n\nHigher operating expenses, reflecting the timing of O&M activities that I spoke of earlier and new depreciation rates on our fossil generating facilities as part of the settlement. We reached we reached in West Virginia.\n\nIt's important to note that our 2024 planned O&M is $140 million or 10% below 2022 levels.\n\nAnd when you adjust for timing such as planned generation outages, our O&M is $100 million or 6% below 2022, reflecting permanent cost reductions.\n\nOther drivers include improve earnings quality.\n\nThe lower earnings contribution from our signal peak mining asset and a higher effective tax rate.\n\nThe dilution from the transaction is largely offset by lower interest expense representing planned debt retirements and interest income from the vendor take back as part of the transaction.\n\nOur $4 3 billion capital investment plan for this year represents a 16% increase compared to 2023 and is largely funded with $4 billion in cash from operations, which has improved year over year from several unique items that occurred in 2023 such.\n\nSuch as the $750 million pension contribution.\n\nContract termination costs, and severance and employee separation costs.\n\nAs well as increases from growth.\n\nCost recovery in our regulated businesses and improved working capital.\n\nWith the improvement in cash flow closing on our minority interest sale in deployment of those proceeds were targeting 14% to 15% to debt by.\n\nBy year end.\n\n2023 was a challenging but remarkable year, a year of significant transition innovation and improvement with outstanding operational and financial execution from our 12000 employees today.\n\nToday, our company is in a much stronger position and we have a comprehensive plan for continued growth.\n\nThank you for your time today, but before we go to Q&A I'll turn the call back over to Brian.\n\nThank you all for joining us today I am excited about our company. We're building a strong track record of execution, we have a fantastic business model and a robust plan for the future.\n\nStarting with the initial Brookfield and Blackstone investments announced in late 2021, we have significantly improved the balance sheet via $7 billion and equity capital and it was raised in a very shareholder friendly manner.\n\nEquivalent of issuing common equity at $87 per share.\n\nIn the past year, we've achieved several important regular regulatory milestones representing constructive outcomes for firstenergy and our customers.\n\nThis includes $219 million of increased revenues through base rate cases that will fuel our investments and reliable and affordable service.\n\nEnergized $3 65, our five year $26 billion investment plan is an increase of more than 44% from our previous five year capital investment plan and its funded with organic internal cash flow and utility debt.\n\nNot incremental equity.\n\nWe have a long term, 6% to 8% annual operating earnings growth trajectory with significantly improved earnings quality.\n\nThis tremendous work together with the cultural changes and focused on continuous improvement has transformed our company.\n\nWe have accomplished a lot and we're committed to executing on our plan to deliver the full value of this company to shareholders.\n\nNow, let's open the call to your questions.\n\nThank you.\n\nAt this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you'd like to ask a question. Please press star one on your telephone keypad.\n\nA confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue.\n\nMay press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue.\n\nFor participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys, one moment, please while we poll for questions.\n\nOur first question comes from Shar with Guggenheim Partners. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, guys. Good morning, good morning sure.\n\nMorning morning, just Brian good to see the roll forward of the six to eight as I guess as we're thinking about some of the sort of the earnings headwinds like signal peak, becoming sort of immaterial next year and potential maybe future pension drag I guess any sense on how we should think about the linearity of that growth off the 24 base.\n\nWe see some maybe near term gyrations around six to eight or you have enough contingencies to maintain that linearity.\n\nSure, it's going to be really.\n\nLinear.\n\nWe're not going to see much volatility.\n\nWe're getting back to where our normal utility should look like where we're going to be investing in our regulated properties.\n\nObviously, a lot of that recovery is going to come through formula based rates. So that is tends to be linear.\n\n75% through Formula base rates, and then we're going to be regularly going in for rate cases, and it's just the normal cadence of how a utility operator.\n\nYou operate you recover in your finance and.\n\nThat's the cadence that we're going to be on.\n\nGot it and then the 9% rate base growth is obviously very solid.\n\nIs there still I guess, some incremental capex opportunities, we should be thinking about in the five year plan I know, obviously, John highlighted some flexibility there in the prepared.\n\nAny sort of rule of thumb, we should think about if there is incremental equity.\n\nIncremental capex could it come with incremental equity or you have enough cushion in the credit metrics and not have to tap the equity markets, even if there's incremental capex.\n\nI think we have enough cushion for sure and we're seeing things like the PJM.\n\nWindows three that we responded to where the team worked really hard to put together a solution in a short period of time, and we were able to garner over $800 million of incremental investment through that opportunity I see more of those coming they're not in our capital plan, yet and they won't be until we.\n\nWhen the projects, but there's significant amounts of.\n\nNew Capex, that's not in our plan that I anticipate will.\n\nC coming down and we will be able to fund that through a combination of cash flow from operations.\n\nThat equity issuances and things like the $3 5 billion of equity that's going to come into our system in 2024 from the transactions. So we're ready to fund these incremental capex.\n\ntraditional utility would without having to see much.\n\nAccess for.\n\nEquity from the equity capital markets.\n\nOkay.\n\n.\n\nAlright.\n\nNo no.\n\nJust reiterate kind of what you said I mean.\n\nHad we not done the transactions over the course of the last couple of years, raising $7 billion of equity capital.\n\nAt the equivalent of a 36 times PE multiple.\n\nWouldn't be in this position today.\n\nI think a lot of it depends on a formula rate Capex versus base capital I think if you look at some of our utility capital structures.\n\nEquity layers that are a little bit better than our targeted.\n\nEquity capital structure. So we have some flexibility in the plan.\n\nPerfect and just real quick lastly, on just Brian I think you've answered this but on the CIC process. It doesn't sound like there's any updates at .\n\nThat is close so is it fair to assume I haven't seen the K yet, but when it is released we shouldnt see anything surprising in that.\n\nYes, no surprises it offshore status quo, they ask questions, we answered them and nothing new.\n\nYes.\n\nWith regards to the company from what was disclosed in the deferred prosecution agreement Fannie.\n\nFantastic guys really Brian.\n\nAwesome awesome execution appreciate it.\n\nThanks sure.\n\nOur next question is from Gregg with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, thanks, congratulations on.\n\nRolling out the new plan.\n\nThank you Greg.\n\nSo just on the cash from operations guidance.\n\nIs the guidance that.\n\nThe new base for growth is $4 billion and you you grow off of that or it. That's the average over the plan and there is sort of.\n\nIt's down and then you are above that level towards the end of the plan.\n\nYeah.\n\nGreg This is John on all years, it'll be $4 billion.\n\nMore.\n\nCash from operations.\n\nSome of it will be just growth in our regulated programs offset by maybe some changes in working capital, but on average over the five year period, it'll be north of $4 billion.\n\nOkay.\n\nMaybe just a follow up for Brian.\n\n.\n\nHow do you sort of reconcile.\n\nThe idea of.\n\nComing forward with.\n\nThe new plan that ads.\n\nSuch a significant amount of new capital.\n\nTo the prior plan.\n\nWe're in a different place Greg.\n\nThe work that's been done on the balance sheet since 2021, as we laid out has been truly transformative.\n\nFor the first time I think in the company's history.\n\nNot distracted by M&A, we do.\n\nDon't have a competitive arm, we have a strong balance sheet with the opportunity to invest in our regulated mostly wires companies.\n\nBut to be honest with you.\n\nWe got behind on the capital investment in them and Thats why our rate base is lower it's why are rates are lower and it's why we have some significant opportunities with regards to .\n\nReliability and the customer experience. We are here for the first time ready willing and able to put the money into our regulated properties for the benefit of our customers.\n\nAnd it is a significant difference from what seen in the past.\n\nOkay. Thanks, a lot I appreciate it.\n\nThank you.\n\nYes.\n\nOur next question is from Nicholas Campanella with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, good morning, Happy Friday, Thanks for all the updates.\n\nI guess just to follow up on Greg's question, because the Capex range is pretty material across the board obviously, it's good to see just how.\n\nHow should we kind of think about customer growth to achieve this plan.\n\nAs it relates to just the upcoming filings and then just through the plan as well please.\n\nYes, so we think the increases will be in the single digit.\n\nFor most of the time for the five year period.\n\nIf you look Nicholas at page 23 in the fact book that we put out there.\n\nIn New Jersey through West, Virginia, and Maryland are rates are 22% to 30% below our instate peers and in Ohio.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the 3% to 7% below our instate peers.\n\nA lot of that in New Jersey, West, Virginia, Maryland represents opportunities.\n\nOpportunities to invest in the rate base or improve the customer experience.\n\nBut also more importantly, if you look at things like customer affordability between 97997 and 2022, our customers' electricity share of wallet has decreased to one 3% from one 6%. So when we talk to .\n\nPeople, who cover our industry and they say that you need to start getting concerned when you are at 4% to 5% share of your customers' wallet.\n\nWe're nowhere near that.\n\nIn electricity, whether it's for home heating, whether it's power your vehicles or whatever still represents a considerable value for the customers in the states we serve.\n\nHey, Nick this is John and I'll, just add onto that if you look at the cases, where we have approvals or settlements on file in our integrated business. If you just kind of compared to where we were since the last rate case, it's an average of 1% or 1% lower than the last time, if you do that on an.\n\nThe annual basis and in fact, if you step back a little bit more and just look at the increases in customer bills over the last couple of years most of that is generation related.\n\nAnd if we were to snap the line today with New generation service for instance, in Ohio, and Pennsylvania, you would see build decreases.\n\nSomewhere between 4% and 8%.\n\nGot it that's helpful.\n\nAnd then I guess just kind of similar question on what's embedded in the plan here.\n\nI'm just thinking about earned ROE is obviously, new Jersey's pretty low here that will improve with the settlement how do we think about kind of Ohio.\n\nIf you get an improvement versus your slides here or is that baked into the plan or just how should we kind of think about that.\n\nYes, as we talked about.\n\nThe next couple of years will be very important as we true up our.\n\nState regulated returns to more of their allowed return so I think about Ohio, and Pennsylvania, which will be next to file.\n\nOhio, right now is earning sub 6% some of that is weather driven.\n\nBut we.\n\nWe do see an opportunity to true up the return there.\n\nAnd in Pennsylvania, although it's above 9% a lot of the O&M, that's coming back in the system will be in our Pennsylvania company, which will reduce the row, there and we use a projected test year for our Pennsylvania company, So youll be adding about $1 billion of rate base between where it is today and the.\n\nThe filing that we'll make later this year.\n\nOkay, and then just one last one just on the load growth, 1% embedded in the plan places like PJM have just continued to see demand revisions higher and I'm just wondering if that's conservative at all.\n\nSo like capital projects and other things, we don't want to put.\n\nForecast growth in until we're seeing it and we're seeing it at about that 1% range as things develop and go forward like seen data centers in PJM and the like we think we're going to get that here youre seeing it to the south of us Youre seeing it to the east of Us and I think that migration will continue.\n\nOur service territory in fact.\n\nWe fully believe it will and then as you see other things like electrification of transportation and alike. I think there is some upside in the load growth. We just don't want to bake it into the plan until we're seeing it in our confidence that it's coming.\n\nAlright, Thanks, a lot have a great day.\n\nThank you Nicholas.\n\nOur next question is from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, everyone. Good morning, Yeah, Hey, guys. Thanks for all the new disclosures.\n\nJust in terms of you mentioned kind of milestones on the regulatory front, how should we think about grid.\n\nin the ESP playing out over the next couple of months and how if any that can inform.\n\nThe base rate filing coming in May and Ohio.\n\nSo we're working those regulatory processes and youre going to see that from us you're going to see certain things are in flight and certain things are coming and look for us to be making progress on what's in flight and that will foreshadow.\n\nWhat's coming down the road.\n\nESP five and grid Mod to we're working through those regulatory processes.\n\nReviewing last night, and we will file today, our post hearing briefing on ESP five and we expect a constructive outcome there as we do in grid mod to but.\n\nRegulatory tends not to move very fast these are months long processes, and we think that the processes in both.\n\nESP five and two are constructive and we anticipate it'll be the same but and actually longer process for our base rate case, which we will file in April of this year. So.\n\nWe're just .\n\nMoving along things are happening as they should.\n\nAnd we're getting these constructive outcomes.\n\nOkay great.\n\nAnd then just on .\n\nPension and limiting volatility there can you just give a sense on.\n\nWhere would you go.\n\nForward, how much more lift out it can potentially be done and then just how youre feeling about ability to implement mechanisms I know there were some some language around that and some of the cases, you already had but nothing.\n\nToo prescriptive I don't think so yes, just the path forward on limiting pension volatility.\n\nYeah, Michael So so we have another.\n\n$700 million.\n\nFormer generation pension liabilities that were looking at right now as to whether or not we should execute a lift out transaction something that we'll likely do this year, if the market conditions warrant that and then on the regulatory front as we've talked about before some of these things take a couple of bites at the.\n\nApple before we can get them in place.\n\nDid get authority to at least.\n\nMake a filing in West, Virginia, and New Jersey as part of the settlements.\n\nAnd we will be thoughtful once we go through that process and get a final order on the cases as to the next steps there.\n\nOkay, great. Thanks, and just last one maybe a little more philosophical, but just seeing kind of how the.\n\nReporting season has gone so far I think we've seen a lot of your peers kind of going.\n\nOther direction in terms of dividend payout.\n\nAnd growth.\n\nAnd I know you are coming from like a different starting point, but maybe just how you think about that in the context of the.\n\nSector not trading well.\n\nAnd just other levers that you have how you thought about.\n\nContinuing to grow the dividend with earnings and the payout where you have it.\n\nYes, so we are at a different place than our peers.\n\nAnnouncing the increase that we did in September the first in over three years, it's time to start rewarding our shareholders with dividend increases.\n\nAnd we felt that now is the time to do that so September and anticipated in 2024.\n\nIncreases there as well it's time for us to treat our shareholders. The way utility companies traditionally do and we are in a place where we're going to be growing.\n\nThe dividend with earnings over time, our balance sheet is healthy we don't have the equity needs that some of our peers do because of the transactions that we've done over the last three years or so so we're in a different place than where some of our peers are we.\n\nWe think it's a really good place.\n\nGreat. Thank you.\n\nThank you.\n\nOur next question is from Jeremy Tonet with J P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHi, good morning good.\n\nGood morning, Jeremy how are you today.\n\nGood good thank you.\n\nJust wanted to dive in a little bit more on the guide here talking about rate base shake up 9% relative to 6% to 8% EPS CAGR.\n\nWithout additional equity needs. So I was just looking to kind of marry those two data points.\n\nGiven the stronger pace of rate base growth there if theres anything else, we should be thinking about especially the signal peak and pension become a smaller part of the equation.\n\nIt's really the things that we mentioned in our remarks, it's going in for base rate cases and updating.\n\nRate base updating returns cost structure and those things that haven't been done in some time.\n\nThe three cases Marilyn.\n\nNew Jersey, and West Virginia that we've just been in Pennsylvania, and Ohio coming up this year.\n\nIt's a significant amount of updating the regulatory process in recovery and then increasing as we've announced today with energized 365, the capex that we're going to be investing in our regulated properties going forward. So.\n\nIt's it's the way utility operation should work.\n\nI repeat this over and over again internally you invest in your properties and your people you operate safely reliably affordably you go in for recovery and if you've done invest and operate well the recovery component goes better when youre in front of our regulators and then we come before investors.\n\nAnd we tell them the story that we put together on those first three components and financing the company's easier as well so we're in a place where.\n\nWe're at the beginning of what I call that virtuous cycle and the success that we've had in the rate cases that I discussed in my prepared remarks show that we're getting those fair and constructive outcomes and we anticipate that.\n\nGoing forward in the plan as well it all it all holds together as a as a credible.\n\nThe story, where we're having success.\n\nAt the beginning point of that.\n\nGot it maybe to rephrase. The question slightly just if the rate base CAGR is 9% are there any other drags besides lag to make EPS growth only 6% to 8% or is that a degree of conservatism.\n\nSo Jeremy I would say this year just as you saw in 'twenty four 'twenty four guide you saw the step down in signal peak from 24 to 12, Youll see another step down from 24% to 25, but.\n\nBut at the same time, that's when we're Truing up. These these rate basis that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the $7 billion. This year with $12 million that we will file in Pennsylvania, and Ohio for this year.\n\nAnd then after that its more traditional rate base growth a little bit of regulatory lag, but we're going to do everything we can to minimize any difference between our earned returns in our allowed returns I think it is important to note that.\n\nThe part that John mentioned about.\n\nPension in signal peak decreasing.\n\nAs they decrease and as the traditional regulatory component of our growth increases.\n\nOur earnings quality improves and that happens really really quickly in our plant. So that's also a benefit it's not just growing earnings it's a reduced risk profile as well.\n\nGot it. Thank you for that very helpful. And then just wanted to go back I guess to customer Bill impacts I think you quoted some helpful numbers, there as far as share of wallet.\n\nBill will represent.\n\nNew Jersey, but just wanted to see I guess in Pennsylvania, Ohio or is it kind of similar share of wallet expectations over the forecast period or any color you can provide there.\n\nIt is that was the numbers that I gave you of share of wallet was an average across our five states.\n\nAnd it's not significantly different in any one of those.\n\nBut it's it's very very low.\n\nGot it very helpful I'll leave it there thanks.\n\nThanks, Jeremy.\n\nDue to time constraints, we ask that you please limit to one question.\n\nOur next question comes from Michael with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHi, Good morning, Thanks for taking my question good morning.\n\nMichael.\n\nSo you've talked about.\n\nSo some sustainable O&M, you've taken out of your business and a larger increase this year and then after that are calling for less than 2% increases over time.\n\nGiven the significant ramp up in capex over over the years of your planning period.\n\nPresumably you would have to expand your your workforce or use of contractors.\n\nIt is my guess.\n\nWork on complete all those projects I was just wondering how are you planning on managing your O&M within that 2% increased level is there room to take out more existing costs out of the business.\n\nSo.\n\nI'll say this a lot of what we talked about is actually capex that we're increasing so it is not directly related to O&M. We recognize there is an O&M tail that's associated with any incremental capex, but we're going to be very very focused on continuous improvement and it's going to be part of our story that we're going to tell ever.\n\nAny time, we're getting together going forward about how what we've been able to do and how we've been able to.\n\nO&M through continuous improvement and it's just going to be part of our story going forward like it was in 2023.\n\nYou see well functioning premium utilities are always talking about what they're doing in that regard.\n\nAnd we've had success here in our recent past doing that and we anticipate that going forward.\n\nGreat. Thank you very much.\n\nThank you Michael.\n\nOur next question comes from Andrew with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.\n\nGood morning.\n\nAnd again, it's just a big uptick good morning, a bigger picture question. So investors can seem excited about.\n\nThe loan growth.\n\nAccelerating loan growth associated with data centers.\n\nThe.\n\nIll just way to play as this play this trend is for generation companies that also through vertically integrated utilities that actually own generation.\n\nEtc.\n\nWireless on the business and I'm just wondering if you do expect to have.\n\nThis is Sam.\n\nSecondary benefit associated with the lost gross I can't.\n\nTranslating into either higher T&D capex or.\n\nMaybe.\n\nAffordability because of higher volumes I mean, you name. It just wondering if you.\n\nC C that benefit the current team as well and thank you for the question Angie, we absolutely do and Youre right being mostly a wires company.\n\nCertainly in four of our five states, we don't have as much of the generation opportunity, but I mentioned in my remarks.\n\nIn answer to an earlier question the opportunity that we had.\n\nAssociated with the PJM open windows III for incremental transmission investment over $800 million.\n\nI had the pleasure of going out to our Maryland service territory.\n\nLate last year and got to go see what's going on at that Quanta loophole datacenter development. It is unbelievable whats going on out there.\n\nThey are re creating something thats on the scale of the data center footprint in Northern Virginia.\n\nKind of in the in the hills of Western Maryland, and its at a site of a former aluminum smelter out. There. So you have these high voltage transmission lines that go and just stop in the middle of space, where the smelter used to be and where they're investing they're turning dirt theyre moving ground right.\n\nNow to build one of the largest data center complex in the complex is in the world. So we're seeing it in Maryland, it's going to be coming to Pennsylvania.\n\nOhio for us as well.\n\nWe're hopeful for New Jersey, and West Virginia over time, so, it's coming and it's real and it does create incremental investment opportunities for us.\n\nAnd then just one one last follow up so you mentioned affordability.\n\nYou are right. There is so much lower than your peers you.\n\nAssets under invested when you look at rate base per customer, but I'm. Just wondering does it does all of these investments so acceleration of investments happens in a low power price environment.\n\nGiven the low growth low power price environment is not sustainable so I'm, just wondering what happens to that investment plan.\n\ngo up meaningfully.\n\nThe customer Bill.\n\nincreases because of that commodity components.\n\nSo that's a good question Angie I think we've already seen some of that.\n\nAssociated with things like the war in Ukraine, and the like and we saw that in some of the polar prices that we had when we went out for auctions during the period. When we thought prices were going to be really really high because of what's going on in Europe.\n\nSome of those price spikes went through to our customers really in Ohio, beginning like the day I started on June of last year.\n\nSo we saw some of those.\n\nPrice spikes go through the customer rates and now Theyre coming off as John mentioned.\n\nEarlier, we're having auctions that are printing lower prices in those lower prices or passing through to our customers. So.",
    "content2": "I don't see that as being a big concern there are some things that are moderating that impact in.\n\nAnd again, our prices are so low the share of wallet is so low for us.\n\nelectricity still represents a significant value to customers in all five of our states.\n\nOkay. Thank you.\n\nThank you Angie.\n\nOur next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glen Rock Associates. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, guys.\n\nCongratulations I just wanted to just wanted to sort of touch base again I apologize on this.\n\nThis single digit.\n\nIncrease is that rates or is it bills and can you be a little bit more specific.\n\nIn terms of what that means I mean, obviously, it's a big range there right.\n\nJust a little bit more elaboration as to what you see sort of the right trajectory range being associated with.\n\nWith the .\n\nWhat's your what's your planning long term.\n\nWell.\n\nSo this is John so I would tell you that as we think about the cases that we filed this year.\n\nThe increases since the last rate case are single digits by low low single digits. So on average New Jersey was three 4% yet but on an average basis since the last rate case, it's probably less than 1% a year.\n\nAnd Thats, what you see going forward is that correct.\n\nWhen you're at low single digits is what you guys paid.\n\nWell I think I think you got to think of it. This way we haven't been in for a rate case in Pennsylvania from quite some time, Ohio, we haven't been in.\n\nAnd almost a over a decade.\n\nSo I do think there'll be some some increases there, but when you average it out since the time of the last rate case, it's very manageable.\n\nOkay, and then finally on grid Mod do you see any settlement possibility I know you guys sort of thought about that before that was sort of a delay and staff testimony it.\n\nIt looks like you're now talking about hearings.\n\nDo you expect that to be fully litigated at this point.\n\nWe would look we're always open to the settlement option and think Thats always preferable. If we're going to go to hearing like we have an ESP five we're okay with that we think will get positive outcomes in any regard Paul the settlement discussions that we have start to frame people's position.\n\n, four where they'll be at the table at a hearing and so we viewed as being a constructive process. Even if we have to go to hearing.\n\nOkay.\n\nI'll leave it there. Thanks, so much guys have a good weekend. Thank you Paul Thanks, you too.\n\nOur next question comes from David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\n\nOh, Hey, good morning, Thanks for taking the question I was just wondering could you refresh us on any strategic options that might be available for the signal peak business sense as you're thinking about that now.\n\nIn this environment, there's not a lot of options. Obviously, we look at that quite frequently it's not a core business for us.\n\nWe've looked at that in the past several times its just.\n\nTheres not a lot of buyers out there.\n\nSo the options are fairly limited, but if you think about it in the Grand scheme of things, it's going to be such a de minimis part of our company moving forward.\n\nThat is not going to have the same impact that it has had the last couple of years.\n\nOf course, great Yeah that makes sense. Thanks.\n\nThanks, David.\n\nOur next question comes from Sophie Karp with Keybanc capital markets. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHi, Good morning, Thank you for squeezing me in here.\n\nGood morning.\n\nYes, most of my questions have been asked but maybe I can just.\n\nI'll ask you about the balance sheet.\n\nAre you completely happy with their balance sheet shape at this point and if not what are the incremental goal here in terms of that.\n\nI know credit, creating incremental balance sheet strength.\n\nBut to satisfy.\n\nOkay. Thank you for the question. So we are really pleased with the shape of the balance sheet at this point.\n\nWe're going to get the incremental $3 5 billion.\n\nIn the door in 2020 for most of that coming in March of this year anticipated with the Brookfield.\n\nTransaction.\n\nThat caps off what's a total of about a $7 billion raise.\n\nOver the last three years.\n\nThat work has been intentional and purposeful by the board and the management team even before I got here for sure.\n\nTo strengthen that balance sheet, so we'd be in a position position that we are today to be able to invest the way that we've laid out for you today and our regulated.\n\nProperty, we anticipate by the end of 'twenty four being at 2024 of being at a 14% to 15% to debt range and we're anticipating rating agency positive actions associated with the strength of our balance sheet. So we're really really pleased with where we are from a balance.\n\nSheet strength situations.\n\nSophie I would just add if you think about where the company has come from.\n\nWith holding company debt, probably in the 30% plus range today, it's 26% with a plan to get it to 20% or better by 2026.\n\nThat's a strong story and it really started back in late 2021, when we announced the.\n\nThe equity transactions with Blackstone and Brookfield, and then we followed it up with the second transaction with for another $3 5 billion and we all did that in a in a very shareholder friendly way. So we're excited about where the balance sheet is headed and we wouldn't have this capital plan without a strong balance sheet that we have.\n\nGot it. Thank you so much thank.\n\nThank you Sofia.\n\nOkay.\n\nOur next question is from Anthony with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\n\nHey, good morning, Thanks for squeezing me in I had had five questions short at the mall, though but just I guess quickly Brian.\n\nYou've had a busy eight months.\n\nI appreciate the Capex update it seems that you've accomplished a lot of what you were planning the year ahead.\n\nWhat should we expect.\n\nSo I think more of the same Anthony. Thank you for the question. So we've talked about how we're reorganizing the company about how we're changing the segment reporting to reflect that.\n\nI mentioned some of the key hires that we made at the end of 2023, we have six more key hires that we need to make the five people to run our major businesses and a shared services executive that we're looking for as well so.\n\nAs we make progress on that we will then have the team.\n\nReady to help move in the direction that we've laid out for you and execute against the plan that we described today. So it's really getting the right people in the right seats to manage the company the way that we've laid out for you and execute against a fantastic plan that we have.\n\nGreat again, congrats thanks again for taking the question.\n\nThank you Anthony.\n\nWe have reached the end of the question and answer session and this concludes today's conference for today you may disconnect. Your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation."

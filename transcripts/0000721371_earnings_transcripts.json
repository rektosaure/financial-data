Earnings Conference Call. My name is Serge and I will be your coordinator for today's event. Throughout today's recorded presentation [Operator Instructions]\nAnd now I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Sims, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's First Quarter Fiscal '26 Earnings Conference Call, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health's CEO, Jason Hollar; and our CFO, Aaron Alt. You can find this morning's earnings press release and investor presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nSince we will be making forward-looking statements today, let me remind you that the matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during our discussion today, the comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the supporting schedules attached to our press release. For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask that you limit questions to one per participant, so that we can try and give everyone an opportunity.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report a strong start to fiscal '26 with continued operating momentum and broad-based performance. With strong double-digit profit growth across each of our 5 operating segments, these results underscore our team's disciplined execution of our strategic priorities and the strength of our resilient business model. Our performance was again led by our Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, where we continue to benefit from a robust demand environment, along with our ongoing efforts to prioritize our core operations and deliver exceptional service for customers. We have made notable progress with our expansion in Specialty evidenced by meaningful contributions from our MSO platforms this quarter, and the expansion of our BioPharma Solutions business.\nThis progress will be further accelerated by the acquisition of Solaris Health, the country's largest urology MSO with over 750 providers, which we anticipate closing shortly. We're eager to add the Solaris team's capabilities to the Specialty Alliance, our industry-leading multi-specialty platform to deliver even greater value for providers and patients.\nWith GMPD, we continue to make steady progress against the improvement plan initiatives, and we're pleased to deliver a strong quarter. And our other growth businesses at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics also continued to accelerate. This performance reflects their alignment with key secular trends, leading market positions and our focused investments. We are seeing strength in demand across each business and are successfully executing our integration of ADS, which is creating a powerful business serving patients in their homes. Overall, the momentum across our business gives us confidence as we progress further into fiscal '26, and Aaron will walk you through the increases to our outlook.\nOur results are driven by the dedication and focus of the Cardinal Health team and is a testament to our unique breadth of capabilities. We are the crucial link across the entire health care spectrum from pharmacies to health systems, to physician offices and surgery centers, all the way to the home, delivering daily to tens of thousands of locations with products sourced from several thousand different organizations. We are constantly innovating to expand our suite of services, both downstream and upstream and are deeply committed to creating value for providers, manufacturer partners and patients while fulfilling our critical role of health care's most trusted partner.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Aaron to go through the financials.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. We are really pleased with our first quarter performance, which exceeded our expectations across the board. Overall, we grew operating earnings by 37% and EPS by 36% while continuing to make strategic progress by integrating last year's acquisitions and making additional organic investments for growth across the enterprise. As Jason signaled, we expect our acquisition of Solaris Health to close shortly. This is a significant step in accelerating our specialty growth strategy and will create long-term value for patients, providers and shareholders, as Solaris benefits from the broader strength of the Specialty Alliance leading multi-specialty platform. With strong results across the board and the anticipated closing of Solaris, I'm pleased to highlight that we are raising our full year EPS guidance to a range of $9.65 to $9.85.\nLet's review the results, starting with Slide 4. Total company revenue increased 22% to $64 billion, primarily driven by continued strong demand in pharma and reflecting growth from all 5 operating segments. Gross profit grew 22% to $2.3 billion while also outpacing SG&A growth, which increased 14% to $1.5 billion. Excluding the inclusion of the ION, GIA and [ ADS ] acquisitions and our results, SG&A growth was more modest. This reflects our constant focus on cost management, even as we annualize fiscal '25's customer wins and investments for growth. This led to operating earnings growth of 37% versus the prior year.\nMoving below the line, interest and other increased by $43 million to $70 million in the quarter due to financing costs related to our announced acquisitions. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21.9%, about 100 basis points better than a year ago due to the timing of discrete items. Q1 average diluted shares outstanding were 239 million shares, 2% lower than last year due to share repurchases. The net result for Q1 was EPS of $2.55, growth of 36%.\nNow turning to the segments, beginning with Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased by 23% to $59 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new customers. This included approximately 6 percentage points of revenue growth from GLP-1 sales. In Q1, we saw a continuation of strong pharmaceutical demand across the business within brand, specialty, generics and consumer health and from our largest customers.\nFirst quarter Pharma segment profit increased by 26% to $667 million, driven by contributions from brand and specialty products, our MSO platforms, and positive generic program performance. The distribution of COVID vaccines was a slight year-over-year headwind in Q1, and we expect a similar headwind in Q2. Notwithstanding that, the strength across the business in Pharmaceutical and Specialty distribution, our MSO platforms, and our upstream biopharma solutions business provides a solid foundation as we look ahead. The acquisitions of GIA and ION contributed approximately 8 points of the first quarter segment profit growth.\nWithin the core, the consistent market dynamics in our Red Oak enabled generics program continued, and we saw healthy same-store generic unit growth above our long-term expectations during the quarter. Our results also benefited from our continuous focus on efficiency initiatives across our distribution network.\nTurning to [ GNPD ] on Slide 6. Revenue increased 2% in Q1 to $3.2 billion driven by volume growth from existing customers. Notably, we continue to see positive trends with Cardinal Health brand with over 6% revenue growth in the U.S. [indiscernible] segment profit increased by $38 million to $46 million in the quarter, driven by growth from existing customers. The [indiscernible] team remains highly focused on mitigating the impact of tariffs and continues to take aggressive actions to control costs across the business, including various sourcing initiatives. Overall, tariffs produced a slight net headwind during Q1. As a reminder, we expect a step-up in tariff costs in the second quarter, which I'll discuss shortly.\nFinishing with the businesses reported in Other, as seen on Slide 7. First quarter revenue increased 38% to $1.6 billion, reflecting strong demand across all 3 businesses. Segment profit also increased by 60% to $166 million, driven by strong growth across all 3 of the businesses, including the acquisition of ADS. A few highlights. The integration of ADS into at-Home Solutions is progressing well with earlier realization of planned synergies. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we were pleased to see continued Theranostics revenue grew up over 30%. OptiFreight continues to see volume uplift and grew Q1 revenue over 20%.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. Our enterprise-wide focus on cash flow management continues to benefit us as we generated $1.3 billion in adjusted free cash flow during the first quarter. Consistent with our disciplined capital allocation approach during Q1, we invested approximately $110 million back into the business to fuel future growth. We retired our $500 million bond maturity in September, and we returned $500 million to shareholders in the form of approximately $125 million in dividends, and the launch of a $375 million accelerated share repurchase program. With this program, we've now completed half of our $750 million of baseline share repurchases for fiscal year '26. And after all of this, we ended the quarter with a cash position of $4.6 billion. This includes $1 billion raised from our August bond issuance to partially fund the Solaris Health transaction.\nNow let's talk about our improved outlook for fiscal year '26. With a strong Q1 behind us and line of sight to the closure of the acquisition of Solaris Health, we are incorporating the benefit of both items into our guidance. The net of all of this is a $0.35 increase to fiscal year '26 EPS and giving us a new range of $9.65 to $9.85. This equates to 17% to 20% EPS growth from the prior year, reflecting the resilient strength and growing momentum of Cardinal Health. We are also increasing our adjusted free cash flow guidance to a new range of $3 billion to $3.5 billion for the full year.\nDrilling into the details. On the top line, we are increasing our pharma revenue guidance to 15% to 70% growth, from 11% to 13% growth, reflecting the positive demand trends we have experienced. Our new Pharma segment profit guidance range is for 16% to [ 19% ] growth, an increase from our prior range of 11% to 13% growth. This primarily reflects our strong first quarter performance and approximately 3 percentage points of growth from Solaris Health. As is our practice in modeling transactions, our guidance does not include potential contributions from the distribution of the Solaris drug spend.\nIn terms of the expected phasing of our growth throughout the year, we continue to expect strong profit growth in the first half of this year versus the back half, with the $7 billion of new customer revenue primarily in the first half. In the second half of the year, we are annualizing the ION and GIA acquisitions, while benefiting from anticipated Solaris contributions. All in, we expect M&A to add approximately 8 percentage points to Pharma's profit growth in fiscal year '26. In [ GNPD ], we continue to expect 2% to 4% revenue growth, and at least $140 million in segment profit, while net tariff costs are anticipated near the high end of our $50 million to $75 million range, the business' core operational performance continues to improve, and we are holding to our annual guidance.\nLooking at [ GNPD's ] second quarter, while we project the business will continue its profitability, we do not expect to see year-over-year profit growth in the quarter, as we realized a larger portion of the tariff costs incurred in previous quarters. We continue to expect Q4 to be [ GMT's ] highest profit dollar quarter as in recent years.\nIn Other, our revenue guidance remains unchanged at 26% to 28% growth, while our segment profit guidance is up 4 percentage points to 29% to 31%, driven by the strong performance across all 3 growth businesses in the year-to-date. Below the line, interest and other is $50 million higher than originally guided at approximately $325 million, reflecting the financing cost for Solaris Health. Of course, this is more than offset by Solaris' profit contribution within the Pharma segment, which together produces EPS accretion of about $0.05 for the partial year. We are also increasing our expectations for CapEx from approximately $600 million, to a range of $600 million to $650 million for planned investments into the Specialty Alliance platform. Finally, we are lowering our diluted weighted average shares outlook to approximately 238 million shares from the prior range of 238 million to 240 million shares, reflecting our Q1 and anticipated baseline share repurchases.\nIn closing, we're kicking off fiscal '26 with continued momentum. We are highly focused on continuing to do what we said we would do, and I look forward to updating you on our progress in the coming months.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. In Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, our disciplined execution of our strategy has enabled us to deliver meaningful progress across the business and ensure we're well positioned to take advantage of future growth in what continues to be a robust demand environment. We continue to prioritize our core, making strategic investments to further expand and modernize our national pharmaceutical distribution network, driving greater operational execution and delivering even greater efficiency and service levels. We recently announced the opening of our state-of-the-art Consumer Health Logistics Center, which serves as a vital link in our supply chain efficiently distributing over-the-counter medications, treatments and diagnostic solutions to our network and serving customers nationwide. This investment creates an additional 20% in overall network capacity, which will support the strong double-digit growth we're seeing, and allow us to move products faster, more accurately and more reliably for our customers.\nWe also unveiled plans for a new 230,000 square foot flagship forward distribution center in Indianapolis, outfitted with advanced automation and the latest technological advancements, in addition to modernizing and optimizing several other DCs [ had ] capacity and storage for specialty drugs.\nGoing deeper into Specialty, our expansion across our MSL platforms, our Biopharma solutions business and specialty distribution, including with biosimilars has helped lay the groundwork for sustainable growth. With respect to our MSO platforms, we are well positioned to broaden our impact across our 3 high priority areas. Autoimmune, urology and oncology. The addition of Solaris Health further enhances our progress in building the Specialty Alliances multispecialty MSO platform, adding significant scale and reach to better meet the comprehensive needs of community urologists across an even wider network of communities. Upon closing, our MSO platforms will serve approximately 3,000 specialty providers across 32 states.\nOur teams have prioritized integration efforts with a clear and thorough plan to bring together these platforms and create meaningful synergies that will unlock opportunities to deliver greater value for the community physicians we're serving. This work is already underway with teams collaborating to develop how the Specialty Alliance can further partner on solutions that bring together the breadth of our enterprise capabilities, including areas like Nuclear and Precision Health solutions, where we have a leading role supporting urologists with prostate cancer treatments and deep knowledge of the fast emerging field of Theranostics.\nMoving upstream. We continue to see growing demand across our Biopharma Solutions business, reflecting both the depth of our manufacturer partnerships and our investments to enhance our capabilities. Earlier this month, we hosted our Annual Business Partners Conference which drew record attendance from our manufacturer partners. As the industry continues to evolve, we remain steadfast in our commitment to being a trusted partner to our suppliers.\nAs an example, our Sonexus access and patient support business has recently won substantial new business, underpinned by the implementation of our next-generation hub. These wins in our Sonexus business are a key component of the over 30% growth that we expect from our biopharma solutions business in fiscal year '26.\nTurning to GMPD. Our improvement plan initiatives are yielding results. We are encouraged by the positive trends within our Cardinal Health branded portfolio particularly with our more clinically differentiated products, which delivered another quarter of strong volume growth in the United States. Critical focus of the team continues to be ensuring our customers have the right products when and where they need them. Our success here was recently recognized by the Health Care Industry Reliance collaborative with an award for our supply chain resilience and transparency, which is consistent with our observed network improvements and service levels near an all-time high. And with respect to tariffs, we remain focused on mitigating this impact for our customers and delivering on our financial commitments for the business.\nNow turning to our other growth businesses where we delivered fantastic results, demonstrating the increasingly important role these higher-margin and faster-growing businesses play in our long-term strategy. We are seeing positive performance across all 3 businesses, supported by both strong demand and disciplined execution. Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions continues to decisively outpace the market, backed by our differentiated offerings and team's deep expertise. This performance is driven by strong demand for Theranostics, which again delivered over 30% revenue growth in the quarter. The growth of these transformative products is a game changer for patients, and particularly notable in the area of prostate cancer, which also creates future opportunity for our business.\nTo meet increasing demand for PET products, we are expanding production of key radio diagnostics for the detection of cancer, coronary artery disease and Alzheimer's. To continue this momentum and advance our leadership position, we are making progress on our $150 million of investments over the next 3 years to expand our PET network across 11 key markets and our Center for Theranostics advancement. Within at-Home Solutions, the demand environment is strong, and we see favorable long-term secular trends in home health care. Those factors, coupled with the synergies from our ADS integration position us for sustainable growth. We've already moved the majority of the ADS volume into our network with minimal utilization of our capacity. Our focus is now turning to integrating back-office operations and systems, which is critical to our goal of building the best customer experience in the industry.\nTo accelerate this momentum, we continue to invest in our distribution network to drive productivity and reach even more customers. We recently opened our newest distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas and we'll break ground this fiscal year on our next one in Sacramento, California, which is expected to be fully operational in summer 2027. Both facilities are equipped with the latest robotics and automation technology, a key component of our long-term investment strategy to drive efficiency and service levels.\nOptiFreight Logistics continues to demonstrate its leading value proposition. With ongoing investments in our proprietary technology-driven platform [ total view insights ], we continue to see long-term potential to deliver cost savings, transparency and operational efficiency for our customers as an extension of their teams. As we outlined during Investor Day, we are expanding OptiFreight's offerings in new areas such as supporting the needs of outbound shipping for hospital embedded pharmacies.\nWrapping up, I'll note that we continue to monitor the dynamic legislative and regulatory environment closely. Across the enterprise, we have confidence in the resilience of our business model as evidenced by our increased guidance and our unique position to safely and efficiently deliver the products and solutions that our customers and patients need. Our essential role in health care has never been more critical, and we will continue to deliver our unmatched breadth of capabilities to meet the evolving needs of our customers and patients.\nIn closing, this quarter's results are a clear demonstration of our strategy and action and the broad-based momentum of our business. We remain focused on executing with discipline, consistently advancing our priorities and delivering sustainable value creation. And with that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, I'll be the coordinator for today's event. Please note that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Matt Sims, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Cardinal Health's fourth quarter fiscal '25 earnings conference call, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health, CEO, Jason Hollar; and our CFO, Aaron Alt.\nYou can find this morning's earnings press release and investor presentation on the Investor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nSince we will be making forward-looking statements today, let me remind you that the matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during our discussion today, the comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the supporting schedules attached to our press release. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. We closed fiscal '25 with momentum, delivering excellent fourth quarter results in what was a transformative year for Cardinal Health. Our consistent performance with all 5 operating segments delivering double-digit profit growth, both the year and Q4, reflects the significant progress we've made against our strategic priorities. As we outlined at Investor Day, our strategy is clear, and we continue to deliver on our commitments, reflecting disciplined execution across each of our operating segments. Our relentless focus on driving simplification and operational efficiencies in our core, along with strategic investments for growth, are enabling us to evolve to meet the needs of our customers and drive long-term value creation.\nBefore I get into the specifics and Aaron takes us through the financials, I want to recognize the hard work and dedication of our teams around the world. Their commitment to our mission and our customers is essential to strengthening our position as health care's most trusted partner at a time when reliability, resiliency and access are more important than ever.\nWithin Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, our largest and most significant business, we continue to see robust pharmaceutical demand and strong underlying performance. Our path forward remains well defined and consistent: prioritize the growth and resiliency of this business by building upon our strong core foundation and further expanding in Specialty, as you saw in our press release this morning.\nWe're thrilled to announce the acquisition of Solaris Health, the country's leading urology managed services organization. This greatly accelerates our progress in building the Specialty Alliances multi-specialty MSO platform, significantly expanding the reach of our urology alliance physician network. We see substantial opportunity ahead with Cardinal Health positioned as the multi-specialty leader, and I'll elaborate on this shortly.\nIn GMPD, our improvement plan initiatives are driving results, delivering $70 million in profit for the fourth quarter. The team continues to navigate the current environment to optimize our global footprint and increase supply chain resiliency for our customers. We see further opportunities ahead to continue to drive the GMPD improvement plan.\nOur differentiated growth businesses within Other made substantial contributions this quarter, capping off a year of meaningful momentum. The performance was broad-based with strong growth across At-Home Solutions, now including the acquisition of ADS, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics.\nAs we close out fiscal '25 and look ahead, we have great optimism in what we will achieve in fiscal '26. We continue to make strategic investments to optimize the business and position us for success. I'll dive deeper into these and other updates shortly. I will now turn it over to Aaron to take us through the financials.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning. I am delighted to share more details on our Q4 financial results and the significant year that we have had at Cardinal Health. Here are some of the key financial headlines.\nAt the enterprise level, we grew operating earnings 19% in the quarter and 15% on the year. We grew EPS by 13% in the quarter and over 9% on the year. We delivered $2.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow in the year, $500 million ahead of our increased expectations from Investor Day. We invested nearly $550 million in CapEx, returned to shareholders nearly $500 million for our growing dividend, repurchased $750 million of shares at an average price of $117 per share and completed 4 strategic acquisitions, 3 in Specialty and 1 in At-Home Solutions to drive our future growth. And we got all of this done in parallel with the previously announced customer contract expiration, a significant focus on cost mitigation, the onboarding of new customers and managing through regulatory uncertainty and the implementation of tariffs.\nLet's go through the Q4 results. Total company revenue was relatively flat at $60.2 billion on a reported basis. Adjusting for the contract expiration, revenue at the enterprise level increased 21% versus the prior year, led by strong demand across Pharma and for growth businesses in Other. Gross profit grew 17% to $2.2 billion with rate improving by approximately 50 basis points, reflecting favorable product, customer and business mix.\nGross profit growth again outpaced consolidated SG&A growth, which increased 16% to $1.5 billion in the quarter, primarily driven by the inclusion of our acquisitions of ION, GIA and ADS in our results. On an organic basis, SG&A increased a more modest 4%, reflective of both our investing for the future and our continued focus on efficiency with GMPD and Pharma in particular successfully executing against significant cost improvement projects. Overall, our efforts resulted in total company operating earnings of $719 million, up 19% versus last year.\nBelow the line, interest and other increased by $34 million versus prior year to $44 million due to acquisition-related financing costs. Interest and other finished better than our expectations due to several factors, including the strong cash performance and the quarterly revaluation of our company's deferred compensation plan, which as a reminder is offset as an expense in corporate SG&A above the line.\nOur fourth quarter effective tax rate was 26.3% and 1.7 percentage points higher than the previous year and modestly higher than our expectations due to earnings mix at the state level and abroad.\nFourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were $240 million, 2% lower than a year ago due to our share repurchase efforts earlier in the year. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $2.08, growth of 13%.\nOne quick note on Q4 EPS. We acquired a majority position in GI Alliance and other physician support organizations in the back half of this year, culminating with our just announced acquisition of Solaris Health, which will not close until at least the second quarter of fiscal year '26. We have determined that the minority equity positions owned by physicians and management in GI Alliance, now part of the Specialty Alliance, represent a liability to Cardinal Health, whereas our Investor Day guidance assumed a noncontrolling interest reduction to EPS. As a result, we are showing a higher-than-expected EPS contribution from the Specialty Alliance in fiscal year '25 or approximately $0.05 more than anticipated.\nMoving on to our segment results, beginning with the Pharma segment on Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was relatively flat at $55.4 billion. Excluding the customer contract expiration, revenue increased a robust 22% driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new customers. This included approximately 6 percentage points of revenue growth from GLP-1 sales.\nDuring Q4, as we have in prior quarters this year, we saw strong pharmaceutical demand across the entire business, within brand, within specialty, within generics and within consumer health. This strength came from both our largest existing customers and our new customers.\nSegment profit increased 11% to $535 million in the fourth quarter driven by contributions from our MSO platforms and brand and specialty products in particular. This growth was partially offset by the customer contract expiration.\nAt this point, I will repeat the point that we saw strong demand and volumes across the business. However, Q4 Pharma segment profit was a touch lighter than we expected due to the impact of a few individually immaterial expenses, including bad debt adjustments and the resolution of some routine contractual open items with customers and vendors. If not for these items, our results would have been above the midpoint of our Pharma profit guidance. Finally, we are pleased that our generics program continues to see positive performance, including strong volume growth and consistent market dynamics.\nTurning to GMPD on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue grew 3% to $3.2 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. As we saw last quarter, Cardinal Health brand continues to trend positively with over 6% revenue growth in the U.S. GMPD delivered Q4 segment profit of $70 million, its highest profit quarter, driven by volume growth from existing customers and reflecting the team's notable progress against the GMPD improvement plan, particularly cost containment efforts. While we continue to invest in the business and are pleased with the continued quarter-by-quarter significant improvements to profitability and cash flow presented by the segment, we have more work to do. The team also continued to make progress on mitigating tariff impacts, which Jason will touch on shortly.\nFinishing with the growth businesses reported within Other as seen on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue increased 37% to $1.6 billion, and segment profit increased 44% to $160 million. As we highlighted at Investor Day, these businesses are becoming an increasingly important part of our overall growth, and this quarter was no exception. These growth businesses contributed over 40% of the growth in our enterprise operating earnings for the quarter.\nRevenue and segment profit were driven by strong growth across all 3 businesses: At-Home Solutions, including contributions from the ADS acquisition; Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics. We closed the ADS acquisition at the start of the fourth quarter and are very pleased with the integration and surgery capture efforts. The At-Home-Solutions management team has a synergy realization plan which is specific and achievable with opportunities for overperformance over time.\nAll 3 businesses saw strong organic growth. These businesses continue to benefit from their leading value propositions, efficient operations and alignment with favorable long-term secular trends.\nTurning briefly to our full year enterprise commentary. Fiscal '25 revenue decreased 2% to $223 billion driven by the customer contract expiration. Excluding the contract expiration, full year revenue increased 18%. Gross margin increased 10% to $8.2 billion, while SG&A increased 8% to $5.4 billion, reflecting the acquisitions and our continued focus on driving operating leverage. Together, this resulted in fiscal '25 total operating earnings growth of 15% to $2.8 billion.\nBelow the line, interest and other increased $174 million, primarily due to financing costs related to acquisitions related to acquisitions. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 23.3%. Average diluted shares outstanding were $242 million, 2% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. The net result was fiscal '25 non-GAAP EPS of $8.24, growth of over 9%, again despite the large customer contract expiration and our significant investments for future growth.\nNow before I turn to fiscal '26, let's cover the balance sheet. For fiscal '25, our ending cash balance was a robust $3.9 billion, reflecting $2.5 billion of adjusted free cash flow driven by the strong performance of our businesses and a continued focus on working capital management across our management team. This is an area of both further focus and further opportunity.\nNow let's look forward to our updated fiscal '26 guidance. Before I start, a reminder that our fiscal year '26 guidance does not yet include the benefit of Solaris Health. While we expect the acquisition to be slightly accretive to EPS within the first 12 months post-close as is our practice, we will update guidance following the close of that acquisition.\nToday we are increasing our fiscal year '26 EPS guidance to a new range of $9.30 to $9.50, which reflects growth of 13% to 15%. This is a $0.20 increase from the guidance provided at Investor Day, driven by the benefit to net earnings of the liability classification I referenced earlier as well as increased contributions from Pharma and increased contributions from our Other growth businesses.\nSlide 15 shows our updated fiscal '26 outlook for our segments. Beginning with Pharma. On revenue, we continue to expect an increase of 11% to 13% as we annualize the new customer wins we had in fiscal year '25 and the first half of fiscal '26, resulting in an approximate $7 billion revenue tailwind. Pro forma segment profit, we are raising our guidance and now expect between 11% and 13% growth. We are expecting 2% to 3% generics market volume growth and continued consistent market dynamics in our Red Oak enabled generics program.\nIn Specialty, we're expecting double-digit revenue growth, including in our higher-margin Biopharma Solutions business where we expect at least 20% revenue growth, fueled in part by the strong momentum in our Sonexus hub that Jason will touch on shortly. We anticipate strong growth in our MSO platforms and increasing contributions from biosimilars. With respect to the MSO platforms, we can now confirm that Cardinal Health will be picking up distribution for the Specialty Alliance gastroenterology portfolio starting in April 2026. We've also begun transitioning the oncology distribution tied to ION, with the majority of volume shifting over during Q2 of this year, consistent with the expiration of existing agreements.\nAdditionally, with respect to the evolving policy environment, we remain confident in our resilient business model that creates tremendous value for the U.S. health care system.\nIn terms of Pharma segment profit cadence, we anticipate first half growth to be a bit stronger than second half growth driven by the annualization of new customer wins from fiscal '25 and the acquisitions of GIA and ION. Nevertheless, Q3 will remain the highest dollar profit quarter as it has been in prior years.\nMoving on to GMPD. On the top line, we are updating our guidance to growth between 2% and 4%, aided by low single-digit utilization growth as well as accretive Cardinal brand growth. On the bottom line, we continue to expect segment profit of at least $140 million, which continues to assume a net $50 million to $75 million headwind to our results in fiscal '26 from tariffs. While the tariff environment continues to evolve, we are not communicating any changes to our exposure or actions today.\nIn addition to market growth and modest increases in Cardinal Health brand penetration, our results will continue to be aided by ongoing execution of simplification and cost optimization projects in our distribution operations, in our manufacturing operations and in our central functions.\nIn terms of cadence, we expect GMPD's segment profit to be weighted to the second half of the year as we've seen in both fiscal '25 and fiscal '24 driven by seasonality and the timing of tariff mitigation. We expect this profit split to be roughly 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half, and Q4 should again be the high point of the year. Q2 is the quarter in which the earlier rounds of fiscal year '25 tariff expenses will be realized. As a result, that quarter may have the lowest profit in absolute dollar terms.\nTurning to our Other growth businesses. We continue to expect robust revenue growth of 26% to 28% and profit growth of 25% to 27%, but on top of a higher jump-off point relative to our Investor Day expectations. This reflects contributions from ADS and continued strong demand overall. Altogether, we expect normalized profit growth of approximately 10% on an organic basis.\nIn At-Home Solutions, we will benefit from our ongoing distribution capacity expansions and automation efficiencies, double-digit revenue growth and the integration of ADS's distribution volumes. In Nuclear, we expect above-market core growth and approximately 20% growth from PET and Theranostics while investing in additional capacity to service the substantial pipeline in areas like oncology, urology and neurology.\nIn OptiFreight Logistics, the team will drive strong core volume growth as well as incremental growth driven by our expansion into the hospital pharmacy. With the ADS acquisition having closed at the start of our Q4, our growth rates will be strongest in the first 3 quarters until we begin lapping the acquisition in Q4. Stepping back, we feel well positioned to deliver another strong year of operating earnings growth.\nMoving below the line, we expect interest and other of about $275 million driven by a step-up in interest expense from the annualization of our acquisition debt financing. Our interest expense guidance does not yet take into account the anticipated financing costs for our proposed acquisition of Solaris Health. Cardinal will fund the cash component of the purchase price through a relatively even mix of new bond financing and use of cash on hand. We will provide more details upon closing, but recall that I commented that the deal should be slightly accretive in the first 12 months.\nWe continue to expect our fiscal year '26 effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 24%. As announced at Investor Day, our new baseline of annual share repurchases is $750 million, which we are confirming even with the assumed closure of the Solaris Health acquisition during the year. This leads to diluted weighted average shares outstanding between $238 million and $240 million for the year.\nFinally, we expect fiscal '26 adjusted free cash flow between $2.75 billion and $3.25 billion driven by our growing profit, improving working capital efficiency and lapping of the customer unwind last year. Our strong cash flow generation will enable us to delever back to our targeted leverage range of 2.75x to 3.25x adjusted gross debt to EBITDA by the end of fiscal year '26 even with the Solaris acquisition.\nTo close, fiscal year '25 was a terrific year showcasing the resilience and power of our enterprise. As we embark on building upon our growth, we are well positioned with strong cash flows and a robust balance sheet to support our strategic plans. We look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now let's take a closer look at our strategic progress across the businesses.\nOur Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions strategy centers on strengthening our core and expanding in Specialty, both of which are essential for unlocking long-term value. Our execution of this strategy was evident in our strong fiscal '25 performance.\nOur focus on customer experience continues to be a key differentiator. In fiscal '25, as we previously confirmed, we successfully onboarded new customers, contributing approximately $10 billion in new business and have made significant strides in streamlining and accelerating the onboarding process.\nOur sustained core distribution growth has allowed us to finalize our multiyear plan for expanding and modernizing our distribution footprint. We are making great progress on our multistate search for our new fully automated pharma distribution center as we announced at Investor Day. Our new Consumer Health Logistics Center, the first of its kind hub for consumer health and over-the-counter health care products, has successfully launched is now fully operational.\nThese strategic investments, along with the modernization of our core technology platforms, enhance the service and capabilities we can provide to customers and support our long-term growth trajectory. This includes our new ordering platform, Vantus HQ, where we continue to seamlessly migrate customers, offering them new capabilities to create value for their business.\nLast month, we hosted our 33rd Annual Retail Business Conference, the largest in the industry, signaling our continued strong role as a trusted partner to retail pharmacies through our commitment to providing solutions, consultative support and advocacy. As an example, during this year's conference, we announced the formation of our One Voice initiative to support state advocacy efforts for independent pharmacies, reinforcing our commitment to their success and the vital role they play with patient care in their communities.\nTurning to Specialty, which remains central to our long-term growth strategy and was again a meaningful contributor for the quarter. We continue to see outside opportunities to drive significant value with a long runway for future growth ahead. Today's announcement of the acquisition of Solaris Health and the recent momentum we've seen with the Specialty Alliance and Navista are clear indications that we are well positioned to grow the impact of our MSO platforms across 3 related high priority areas: autoimmune, urology and oncology. These therapeutic areas continue to benefit from robust product pipeline and ongoing innovation efforts. But importantly, in the areas of autoimmune and urology, also provide diverse revenue streams for our MSO platform due to the breadth of ancillary services such as pathology and laboratory testing, administering anesthesia and diagnostic imaging.\nThe addition of Solaris Health further bolsters the strength and resiliency of this business model by adding scale and expanding our reach to patients and providers in new communities. As the nation's leading urology MSO, Solaris Health adds over 750 providers across 14 states to the Specialty Alliance led by Dr. [ Jim Weber ], and solidifies our leadership in the urology therapeutic area.\nCoupled with the acquisitions of Urology America, Atomic Urology and, most recently, Academic Urology and Urogynecology, our Urology Alliance team will be better positioned to meet the comprehensive needs of community urologists and even more communities through the robust combined capabilities of the Specialty Alliance, Cardinal Health and Specialty networks.\nOur comprehensive suite of services empower physicians so that they can spend their time where it matters most: caring for patients with the absolute highest standards of care.\nIn addition to Solaris Health, we continue to attract providers to our MSO platforms, and we're pleased to add additional providers through Navista. Of note, the expansion of our MSO platforms, including the Specialty Alliance and Navista, positions us to support approximately 3,000 providers across 32 states following the completion of the Solaris Health transaction. Additionally, we have seen strong and growing demand across our upstream biopharma solutions businesses, expecting 20% revenue growth in fiscal '26 and beyond. This includes our Sonexus patient access business where the team's excellent patient and provider experience is leading to 40 expected launches in calendar year '25, growth of over 30%, driven by our investments in product innovation and technology.\nThis success is due to the implementation of our next-generation hub that is digitizing and automating the patient support process, which, combined with our team of experts, is getting more patients on therapy faster, helping them stay on therapy longer and driving great feedback from our manufacturer partners. We plan to share more on this in the coming quarters.\nWe've also seen momentum with Specialty Network's Data and Site platforms, PPS Analytics and Sonar. These platforms leverage advanced AI capabilities to abstract and curate patient information from unstructured data. This enables the creation of a comprehensive, 360-degree patient view, empowering health care professionals to make clinically appropriate decisions for optimal patient outcomes. Specialty Networks platforms were recently launched into oncology, and the strategy is resonating, evidenced by the first signed oncology customer agreement this quarter.\nTurning to GMPD, which delivered operational and profit improvements in Q4 and fiscal '25, reflecting the continued progress we're making against our improvement plan initiatives. In addition to our cost optimization efforts, we are also encouraged by the stronger growth of our Cardinal Health branded products with another quarter of strong volume growth in the United States. Our team continues to prioritize the execution of our plan focused on customer service, product availability and innovation of our product portfolio to meet the evolving needs of our customers.\nDuring the quarter, we launched the Kendall DL multisystem, a multiparameter single-patient use monitoring cable and lead wire system that enables the continuous monitoring of cardiac activity, blood oxygen level and temperature with 1 point of connection to simplify patient monitoring and drive efficiencies for providers.\nAs it relates to further details about the impacts of tariffs, our views remain largely unchanged since Investor Day, supported by our proactive and aggressive implementation of mitigation actions to reduce the burden on our customers as much as possible. This includes increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity, which is now our largest country of origin, proactively diversifying the supplier network and reducing our dependency on higher-risk jurisdictions.\nWe've also implemented pricing adjustments, as we previously communicated, and continue to work with our customers to identify win-win opportunities to help offset the impact of tariffs by growing Cardinal Health brand penetration.\nAnd now closing with our Other businesses. With strong performance and execution across each of these 3, momentum is accelerating, and we continue to view these businesses as a high potential engine of growth. Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions continues to outpace the market, driven by our highly differentiated offerings, leading positioning and early investments. We are strategically expanding our PET cyclotron capacity in 11 key markets and enhancing our Center for Theranostics Advancement to support a strong pipeline of products targeting oncology, urology and neurology. We continue to see strong demand for Theranostics products, which grew revenue over 30% in fiscal '25. Notably, the urology portfolio of products that we support, which includes both diagnostic and therapeutic PSMA drugs for prostate cancer, experienced even greater growth. Recently, we've seen momentum for certain radioligand therapies to move earlier in the regimen of treatment, in advance of even chemotherapy, which is exciting for patients and a long-term opportunity for our business.\nFurthermore, we are uniquely positioned to support our Specialty strategy benefiting from significant customer and product overlap in therapeutic areas like oncology as well as urology where we are establishing a leading position.\nIn At-Home Solutions, our investments in distribution capacity and automation are yielding tangible results. Q4 revenue grew nearly 50% and double digits on an organic basis, significantly outpacing the increase in our freight and warehousing costs. This includes strong growth in urology products, which grew revenue over 20% on the year.\nWe are continuing our investments with a new state-of-the-art distribution center on the West Coast planned to break ground in fiscal '26. This facility, like our new facilities in Texas, South Carolina and Ohio, will leverage the latest robotics and technology to further enhance supply chain efficiency, quality and employee safety beyond the record levels we've seen to close this fiscal year.\nWe anticipate continued growth fueled by the secular tailwinds in home health care and synergies from the full integration with ADS. This integration positions us well to build on this year's momentum and manage through potential changes in the reimbursement environment. ADS excels in multichannel patient acquisition and user experience, leading to exceptional patient retention and customer satisfaction. Our strong operational foundation will support ADS and enable us to achieve greater growth and operating leverage. We've already begun transitioning the ADS volume into our DC network, and we expect full conversion by the end of Q1.\nOptiFreight Logistics continues to demonstrate its value, providing strategic logistics support to our customers as an extension of their teams. Thanks to ongoing investments in our proprietary technology-driven platform, TotalVue Insights, we continue to see long-term potential to deliver cost savings, transparency and operational efficiency for customers. Our efforts continue to resonate with the market with the renewal of some notable key contracts in Q4 as a direct reflection of our leading value proposition.\nIn summary, I'm pleased with the progress and execution across all 5 of our operating segments. Our strong results speak to the strength of our foundation, the talent of our teams and the consistent demand for value we bring to the market. We've accelerated our momentum and are well positioned to carry it forward.\nWe'll wrap up in a moment and take your questions, which I know will include the current and anticipated regulatory environment. While this remains fluid, we continue to be confident in our resilient business model across the enterprise and continue to believe that policymakers and stakeholders are aligned with our goals of increasing access, affordability and innovation in health care. We are uniquely positioned to support these efforts with the products and services that are absolutely indispensable to our customers and patients. We work tirelessly to provide fantastic service and significant benefit for the margin we earn and are confident these capabilities will continue to be valued.\nAs we enter fiscal '26, we are operating from a position of strength. We remain focused on executing our strategy, serving our customers and patients and delivering value creation and look forward to the year ahead. And with that, we'll take your questions."

Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong third quarter results, which demonstrate the continued acceleration of the momentum we've established in recent years, the underlying strength of our business and the effectiveness of our strategy. In today's increasingly complex macro environment, our role of health care's crucial link is more important than ever. We bridge the clinical and operational aspects of health care, delivering end-to-end solutions that touch every part of the care continuum. Customers and manufacturer partners confidently rely on us to safely, securely and efficiently deliver essential products and services to the right place and time.\nOur team continuously navigates evolving market conditions and regulatory complexities within the health care industry, allowing us to act with urgency and flexibility to best serve customers and patients. We create tremendous value for our partners through the breadth and scale of our offerings. With our strong competitive positioning and the positive trends underpinning our results, our business has proven to be incredibly resilient.\nIt should also be noted that while our industry relies upon an efficient and effective global supply chain, Cardinal Health has a strong U.S. footprint with over 99% of our enterprise revenue generated here. Roughly 95% of our segment profit is generated from 4 of our 5 businesses, which are as yet largely unimpacted by tariffs or other regulatory actions. And we have invested approximately $7 billion in the last 2 years in the United States, including recent acquisitions, expanded domestic manufacturing, new distribution nodes, technology and automation, which has directly supported the delivery of our country's health care.\nAs always, we proactively monitor proposed legislation and regulation, and as I said before, we continue to support the overarching goals of increasing patient access, affordability and innovation in health care.\nMoving on to our results. Our performance this quarter was driven by strong utilization trends and execution across our most significant business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, and our 3 growth businesses reported another, which are becoming an increasingly important part of our overall mix. Most notably, the broad-based performance reflected profit growth from all 5 of our operating segments, an indication that our relentless focus on advancing our strategic priorities is delivering real measurable impact.\nIt's also worth mentioning when looking at the strong pharma results, we're seeing the first positive benefits from the acquisitions of GI Alliance and Integrated Oncology Network, both of which in early days are performing consistent with our expectations. And within our higher-margin other businesses, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and OptiFreight, we see continued potential to expand our capabilities and create additional value. We are pleased to complete the acquisition of Advanced Diabetes Supply Group at the beginning of April and would like to extend a warm welcome to the ADSG team.\nAs a result, we are pleased to again raise our fiscal '25 EPS guidance and have great confidence in our ability to generate sustainable long-term growth for the future. In summary, we are encouraged by the performance this quarter, which validates the strength of our strategy, the discipline of our teams and our conviction in our trajectory heading into the fourth quarter.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Aaron.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. Q3 was a strong financial quarter for us as we continue to do what we said we were going to do: invest in the business, drive growth in pharma and the 3 other growth businesses and continue the turnaround of GMPD. Overall, we grew operating earnings by 21% and EPS by 13%, even while comparing against the prior period to the customer contract expiration and while executing and integrating our recent acquisitions. The outstanding performance of pharma, up 14%, anchored our earnings results with further momentum provided by all 3 of the other growth businesses. together up 22%, and continued profit growth in GMPD. In total, our results led to earnings per share in the quarter of $2.35. As a result, we are raising and narrowing our full year EPS guidance to a range of $8.05 to $8.15.\nLet's review the results, starting with Slide 4. Total company revenue was flat at nearly $55 billion on a reported basis. Adjusting for the contract expiration, revenue increased 19% versus the prior year with strong demand across pharma and all 3 of the growth businesses and other. We drove strong operating leverage in the quarter. Total company gross profit dollars increased 10%, while SG&A increased a more modest 4% notwithstanding our investments across the business and recent acquisitions. Digging deeper, SG&A actually decreased slightly year-over-year when normalizing out the additions of GI Alliance and ION, reflecting the strong cost control efforts and efficiencies pursued by the team. This led to operating earnings growth of 21% versus the prior year.\nMoving below the line. Interest and other increased by $38 million to $65 million in the quarter, primarily due to previously anticipated acquisition-related financing costs. Our third quarter effective tax rate was 22.4%, a 2.5 point increase from prior year due to the nonrepetition of some positive discrete items in the prior year. Q3 average diluted shares outstanding were 240 million shares, 2% lower than a year ago, due to our share repurchase efforts. The net result for Q3 was EPS of $2.35, growth of 13%.\nNow turning to the segments, beginning with pharma on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue was relatively flat at $50.4 billion. Excluding the customer contract expiration, revenue increased 20% driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and new customers. This included approximately 7 percentage points of revenue growth from GLP-1 sales. In Q3, we saw a continuation of strong pharmaceutical demand across the business within brand, specialty, generics and consumer health and from our largest customers. We also saw growth from new customers, and we're especially pleased with the successful onboarding of Publix during the quarter, which was made possible by the collaborative effort between the Cardinal and Publix teams.\nQ3 delivered segment profit of $662 million, growth of 14%. This was driven by all of contributions from brand and specialty products, our MSO platforms including GI Alliance, BioPharma Solutions including Specialty Networks and by positive generics program performance, This growth was partially offset by the customer contract expiration. As a reminder, we closed our acquisition of ION in Q2 and of GIA on January 30. So the quarter included positive results from both businesses. We continue to be excited about these additional higher-margin revenue streams which, as we've said, are anticipated to contribute approximately 3 percentage points to our pharma segment profit growth this year. Finally, our generics program continued to see positive performance, including strong volume growth and consistent market dynamics.\nLet's turn now to our turnaround business, the GMPD segment. Revenue increased 2% in Q3 to $3.2 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. We were particularly pleased to see Cardinal Health brand growth of 3% during the quarter, which was actually a couple of percentage points higher when normalizing for billing day differences between periods and currency fluctuations. GMPD segment profit increased to $39 million in the quarter driven by the net benefit from our cost optimization initiatives. The team continues to be aggressive in executing its simplification strategy to deliver operational efficiencies and best serve our customers.\nFinishing with the businesses reported in other, as seen on Slide 7. Third quarter revenue increased 13% to $1.3 billion. Demand was strong for the products and services of these businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we saw a 12% revenue growth. OptiFreight Logistics had 17% revenue growth, and Nuclear had 14% revenue growth, which included 30%-plus revenue growth in Theranostics. Third quarter profit growth in other increased 22% to $134 million with profit growth across all 3 operating segments.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash position of $3.3 billion. We've delivered adjusted free cash flow of $1.2 billion year-to-date and have continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. We've invested $315 million back into the business so far this year. We have more than fulfilled our baseline commitment and repurchased $750 million in shares during the year as we completed $375 million of accelerated share repurchases in March. The average price of our year-to-date share repurchases has been $117 per share. And during Q3, we deployed $2.8 billion for the closing of our majority position in GI Alliance.\nNow let's talk about our full year guidance for fiscal year '25 with only 1 quarter left to go. Reflecting the strong Q3 results, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal '25 EPS guidance to a range of $8.05 to $8.15, an $0.18 increase at the midpoint of our prior guidance. Given the better than expected adjusted free cash flow year-to-date, we also are now expecting adjusted free cash flow at the high end of our prior guidance range, approximately $1.5 billion.\nWe are narrowing our interest and other guidance to the lower end of our previous guidance, now $200 million to $215 million, primarily reflecting the strong cash flows. As a result, we borrowed less than we anticipated to complete the ADSG transaction. This guidance implies roughly $75 million in INO next quarter now that we've completed our acquisitions of ION, GIA and ADSG. As a reminder, our interest in other line also includes the income that GIA recognizes from its minority equity positions in ambulatory surgery centers. For context, we expect about $10 million of other income from the ASC positions in Q4. We are also updating our effective tax rate guidance to a range of 23% to 23.5%.\nMoving on to our segments, starting on Slide 10. For pharma, we are raising our segment profit guidance for the full year to 11.5% to 12.5% growth, driven by the continued broad-based demand we've seen in core pharma and specialty. Of note, Q4 is expected to contain a higher-than-usual amount of investment-related costs as we near completion of our Consumer Health Logistics Center, continue to invest in technology and continue to add capabilities while scaling our MSO platforms. While individual customer time lines have varied, we are confirming that we have now completed customer onboarding that make up approximately $10 billion of new customer revenue in fiscal year '25, setting us up for further growth in fiscal year '26.\nFor GMPD, we are narrowing our guidance to the lower end of our prior fiscal year '25 guidance range, now $130 million to $140 million. Even with this narrowing of guidance for GMPD, the team is making good progress, and the fourth quarter should reflect a meaningful step-up in profitability as a result of the actions taken in the last several quarters. There are a few factors which support our guidance. First, Q3 showed a positive change in trajectory for Cardinal Health brand volume, including strengths we saw as we exited the quarter. Second, the team has continued to respond to environmental adversity by finding incremental cost saving actions, including a reduction in force, which occurred at the end of Q3. Third, our guidance has always signaled that fourth quarter would be our highest seasonal quarter in terms of segment profit, just like last year.\nI should note that while Q4 will be impacted by the earlier rounds of tariffs between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, most of that early impact will be offset in the quarter or will be recognized in future periods when the related product is sold. As a result, the onset of tariffs is not expected to have a direct material financial impact on the fourth fiscal quarter for any of our businesses.\nIn other, we now expect fiscal year '25 revenue growth of 17% to 19% and segment profit growth of 16% to 18%, driven by stronger organic growth across the businesses and anticipated contributions from ADSG during the fourth quarter. We expect ADSG to be slightly accretive to EPS immediately despite the onetime impact of an acquisition-related inventory fair value step-up, which will be unique to Q4.\nNow given the highly dynamic environment in which we are all operating, today, we will provide early context on next year. We are only 6 weeks away from our Investor Day on June 12, by which time we expect to have more visibility on macro events and to offer more concrete thoughts on fiscal '26 and beyond. In pharma, we expect to continue to benefit from positive utilization growth, our strong core foundation, which includes our leading Red Oak enabled generics program and our partnerships across a diverse and growing customer base. We expect strong growth in specialty, both in our upstream BioPharma Solutions and our downstream services, including our MSO platforms, which continue to expand.\nWe are confident in our ability to navigate changes to the U.S. health care ecosystem, whether that is the administration Section 232 review of the pharmaceutical industry or the recent drug pricing executive order. Based on what is known at this time, we do not currently expect meaningful changes to our economics from these actions because of our unique value proposition and ability to respond as needed.\nIn other, we expect continued strong demand and organic growth fueled by the secular tailwinds of the markets, our leading competitive positions and our investments. The addition of ADSG to at-Home Solutions will be accretive to our business as we work to quickly unlock synergies. In GMPD, Jason will shortly talk about the aggressive actions we're continuing to take to reduce the burden of the tariffs on our customers and on our business. We remain committed to the GMPD turnaround and are relentlessly focused on ensuring GMPD retains a viable and improved financial profile.\nWhile we need more clarity on the nature, geographic reach, intended duration and resulting financial impact to our business of the reciprocal and targeted tariffs, the operational improvements the team has made give us confidence that GMPD fiscal year '26 segment profit will be at least consistent with fiscal '25 levels.\nFinally, in fiscal '26, having lapped the negative working capital unwind of the customer contract expiration, we expect robust cash flow generation. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation framework, prioritizing internal investments such as our new Consumer Health Logistics Center, strengthening our balance sheet with incremental debt pay down, returning capital to shareholders and prioritizing tuck-in acquisitions in areas of strategic focus, as you saw in our earnings release this morning.\nBringing this all together, overall, the largest and highest growth parts of our business are resilient and well positioned to continue growth in fiscal year 2016, and we are confident in the enterprise achieving double-digit non-GAAP EPS growth next year. In closing, our team is steadfast on pursuing operational execution while investing for long-term growth. We have a plan. We are executing against it. And we look forward to sharing more at our upcoming Investor Day on June 12.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Stepping back, there is a lot to be excited about with our results this quarter. Not only did we see earnings growth in each of our 5 operating segments, but we also saw significant growth in our high priority growth areas, specialty, Nuclear, at-Home solutions and OptiFreight. We have more work to do with GMPD, but I am pleased with the operational improvements we have achieved even in a more uncertain macroeconomic environment.\nSo let's go a little deeper. In Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, the positive third quarter performance reflects sustained momentum across the segment, highlighting our disciplined approach to operational execution and prioritization of the core. It is our customer-focused execution that led to the successful onboarding of Publix during this quarter. We consistently aim to provide all of our customers with industry-leading support, and the team has continued to drive above target, on-time delivery metrics with historically high service levels. Another critical component of our success in the core is our partnership with Red Oak, which continues to fulfill its dual mandate of securing product access and controlling costs.\nSpecialty remains central to our long-term growth strategy with compelling opportunities to drive meaningful and differentiated value and accelerate our growth. We were delighted to share the news about GI Alliance's recent acquisitions, furthering our mission to deliver integrated high-quality and patient-centered specialty care across the United States. Notably, Urology America and [ Photonic Urology ] marked GIA's expansion into urology, reinforcing its commitment to building a comprehensive multi-specialty model. We are encouraged by the latest additions to our portfolio and see clear evidence that our strategic approach of providing community-based physician practices, a comprehensive MSO platform is working.\nTurning to GMPD, where the team's rigorous focus on executing the GMPD improvement plan led to solid growth for the quarter. Along with the efforts to further streamline our cost structure, we were pleased to see stronger growth of our Cardinal Health branded products. We're also pleased with the recent commercial progress, including a new long-term distribution agreement with a notable health system.\nNow I know that you're all interested in some further color on tariffs. We understand the importance of the United States competing in a fair global market, and we are engaging with the administration to try to mitigate impact to patient care. Our focus has been on GMPD, given the other 4 operating segments representing 95% of our segment profit are largely unaffected by the announcements to date, and we anticipate their robust business models will continue to minimize ongoing impacts.\nWithin GMPD, we have been proactive and aggressive in implementing mitigation actions to reduce the burden on our customers as much as possible. This includes increasing U.S. manufacturing capacity in key categories such as syringes and incontinence, diversifying our supplier network away from higher risk jurisdictions, identifying and onboarding alternate sources of supply including, in some cases, prestocking inventory, deploying AI in support of our tariff planning and compliance and further reducing our internal cost structure. Only after aggressive mitigation actions like these are accomplished do we consider price adjustments.\nSo far, these actions and others have helped us already mitigate several hundred million dollars of exposure. However, based on today's tariffs, we would still anticipate roughly $200 million to $300 million of remaining gross tariff costs in fiscal '26 before further mitigation. We anticipate mitigating the majority of these costs through continued operational actions and price adjustments, which we are already working on with our customers.\nAs Aaron said, we are working to ensure that GMPD retains a viable financial profile. We are all too aware of the burden that GMPD and Cardinal Health shouldered during COVID, resulting in significant financial losses, and we are highly focused on ensuring that costs are minimized but also shared more equitably in this case. In proactively working with our customers, we are seeking a scenario which does not result in market scarcity of key products or disruptions to supply.\nAnd now finishing with our other businesses. With strong performance across the 3 operating segments, this continues to be an area where we see substantial runway for growth, thanks to our differentiated offerings, support of secular trends, strong competitive positioning and investments for the future. Within Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we continue to see above-market growth in our core business and saw over 30% growth in Theranostics this quarter, reflecting meaningful growth in the demand for products within our oncology and urology portfolio, such as Illucix and Pluvicto.\nWe're also excited about the potential of new therapeutics to enhance the treatment of Alzheimer's and other conditions. Our positioning as the go-to partner for radiopharmaceutical innovators is evident when we consider recent activity, including our announcement that we've entered into an agreement with GE Healthcare to manufacture and distribute Flyrcado, a first-of-its-kind pet AGENT for enhanced diagnosis of coronary artery disease.\nIn at-Home Solutions, we are delivering on our clear strategy to win in this rapidly growing part of the industry. We continue to invest in automation to bolster the productivity, quality and safety of our supply chain, which has been a driver in our all-time high operational metrics. The business is on an extremely solid foundation as we have begun the integration of ADSG, which in its early weeks is tracking as planned. We continue to expect the synergistic combination of ADSG and at-Home Solutions to create value for patients and enable us to grow profitably as the overall diabetes care market expands well into the future.\nAnd in OptiFreight Logistics, we're driving consistently strong performance. With the team's ability to deliver action-driving insights, more customers are expanding on our platform.\nIn closing, this quarter's strong results driven by solid contributions across all 5 operating segments demonstrate the clarity of our strategic direction and underlying strength of our business. The broad-based momentum we're seeing across enterprise reinforces our confidence in the path ahead and our ability to accelerate through the remainder of fiscal year '25. While we continue to monitor the broader landscape, we are confident in the resiliency of our business and this team's ability to deliver. Our focus remains on the disciplined execution of our strategy to best serve our customers and drive long-term value creation.\nThank you to our team for consistently going above and beyond to fulfill our role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, and I'll be a coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Matt Sims, Vice President, Investor Relations at this conference. Please go ahead.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nHello, and welcome to this morning's Cardinal Health Second Quarter Fiscal '25 Earnings Conference Call, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Cardinal Health's CEO, Jason Hollar, and our CFO, Aaron Alt. You can find this morning's earnings press release and investor presentation on the Inverstor Relations section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nSince we will be making forward-looking statements today, let me remind you that the matters addressed in these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our investor presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during our discussion today, the comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the supporting schedules attached to our press release. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported strong second quarter results, accelerating the momentum that we've built over the last couple of years. Overall, the performance was led by robust demand across our largest and most significant business Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions and our relentless focus on the execution of our simplification strategy to best serve our customers, we're seeing strength in brand, specialty, generics and consumer health as we're well positioned within a growing market.\nAs a result of the significant strategic and operational actions we've taken, we remain bullish on our position in the health care industry and confident in our strategic direction for the future. And with this confidence, we are pleased to again raise our fiscal '25 enterprise guidance, which Aaron will cover in more detail shortly. We see opportunities to continue building upon the resiliency of the pharma business and drive consistent growth, particularly within specialty.\nToday's closing of the acquisition of a majority stake in GI Alliance, which in conjunction with our recently completed integrated oncology network transaction will allow us to continue to expand across key therapeutic areas and generate additional value for our customers, patients and shareholders. Later on, I'll talk more about how these investments accelerate our strategy, but for now I'd like to welcome both the Ion and GI Alliance teams to Cardinal Health and thank them for their focus and indication as we work together to unlock new opportunities.\nIn Jimmie D, while Q2 was below our expectations, the team remains focused on executing the GMPD improvement plan with positive progress on our cost optimization initiatives during the quarter. And across our other businesses, nuclear, at-home and OptiFreight, we see robust demand across these 3 faster-growing and higher-margin businesses, a long-term potential for growth is evident and we intend to continue to invest across these businesses to add scale and capabilities.\nIn summary, we are pleased with this quarter's results, which reflect our efforts to accelerate our strategy, execute with precision and drive sustainable long-term growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. From a financial perspective, we continued our momentum in Q2 with outstanding results from the segment, strong performance from the businesses included in other and continued operational progress in GMPD. We grew operating earnings by 9% while overcoming the headwinds of the prior customer contract expiration and the as anticipated COVID-19 seasonal timing.\nIn summary, we had a lot going on, and we are pleased to report that the profit growth across the business resulted in a much better-than-expected EPS of $1.93. We are raising our EPS guidance to a range of $7.85 to $8. Let's review the results, starting with Slide 4. Total company revenue decreased 4% to $55 billion on a reported basis. Adjusting for the contract expiration, revenue increased 16% versus the prior year, primarily on strong demand across pharma and all 3 of the businesses included in other.\nTotal company gross margin increased 5% with contributions from all of our operating segments. As you can see financials, our team continued to control our costs across the enterprise with SG&A increasing a modest 3%, covering the impact of rising health care costs, the Ion acquisition and investments against the businesses. This led to operating earnings growth of 9% versus the prior year.\nMoving below the line, interest and other increased $45 million to $38 million, primarily driven by financing impacts related to the recent acquisitions, including the Q2 proactive debt issuance. Our second quarter effective tax rate finished at 21.4%, flat to our rate a year ago. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were 243 million shares on lower than a year ago due to our previous share repurchases.\nThe net result for Q2 was EPS of $1.93, growth of 2%. Now turning to the segments, beginning -- across our business in brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. The team delivered segment profit of $531 million in the second quarter, an increase of 7%, driven by growth from biopharma solutions, including contributions from specialty networks, and a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, only partially offset by the customer contract expiration.\nIn Specialty, we saw strong performance across specialty distribution. We also continue to be pleased with the progress of integrating specialty networks, which is benefiting our overall specialty strategy and tracking consistent with our original expectations. As expected, the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines was a headwind in the quarter as we compare to last year's peak during Q2.\nWe do not expect a meaningful contribution from COVID-19 vaccines for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our generics program continued to see positive performance, including strong volume growth and consistent market dynamics. Operationally, our large customer onboardings and expansions are in progress. While each customer's needs are unique and time lines vary, we are pleased with the performance of our pharma business and how that business has prepared for the future.\nLet's turn now to our turnaround business, the G&P segment, which continues to advance the GMP improvement plan. Revenue increased 1% in Q2 to $3.2 billion, driven by volume growth from existing customers. As previewed earlier this month, volume growth was less than we expected, in part driven by softness with respiratory products in our lab business. GMPD segment profit increased to $18 million, slightly below our initial expectations for the quarter, reflecting the softer volumes I just referenced and an unanticipated $15 million impact in our WaveMark business, largely from the write-off of uncollectible receivables.\nWhile we were disappointed with the way Mark adjustments this quarter, the business model is resonating with customers as they continue to realize substantial benefit from the products and value-creating services we buy. On the positive side, it should be noted that the GMPD team managed to mostly offset the shortfall to expectations in the quarter with aggressive SG&A management and a better-than-expected impact from our cost optimization initiatives, finishing with the businesses reported in other, as seen on Slide 7.\nSecond quarter revenue increased 13% to $1.3 billion due to the growth across all 3 businesses, at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics. The businesses collectively grew segment profit in the quarter by 11%, driven by OptiFreight and Nuclear.\nI'm especially pleased with our nuclear business managed through the Moly 99 shortage lead and posted better-than-expected results. We are looking forward to talking about at-Home's progress against its automation and efficiency efforts in future quarters.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with a cash position of $3.8 billion, which included $2.8 million, which was used today to close the acquisition of 73% of GI Alliance. Adjusted free cash flow was a use of approximately $250 million for the quarter, primarily reflecting unfavorable quarter and day-of-the-week timing.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to deploy capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. We invested nearly $100 million in CapEx back into the businesses to drive organic growth. We returned approximately $125 million to shareholders through dividends, and we closed on the ION acquisition and obtained the financing that we're using to complete the GIA acquisition today.\nNow let's turn our gears forward, some context notes before we begin. We have reached the midyear point and are now focused on the back half on significant customer onboarding and expansions. A third element of our large customer nonrenewal mitigation plans. We've closed our acquisitions of ION and GI Alliance and early positive views of those businesses are incorporated into today's updated guidance.\nWe do not yet have visibility to a closing date on ADS G, given customary closing conditions, so we'll wait to incorporate ADSG into our guidance until after closing. Together, Ion and GIA, while positive profit generators are not meaningful to our fiscal '25 EPS given the partial remaining year, the increased interest expense to fund the transactions and the timing of our investments and synergy achievement plans.\nWe will provide more details beyond this fiscal year when providing fiscal year 2016 guidance on future calls. With that out of the way, let's talk about our updated fiscal '25 guidance. After another strong quarter, we are raising our fiscal '25 EPS guidance to a range of $7.85 to $8, a $0.10 increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance of $7.75 to $7.90. This is primarily driven by strong growth in the Pharma segment offset GMPD and higher interest costs.\nReflecting our acquisitions, interest and other is increased to a range of $200 million to $230 million driven by the new debt financing and foregone interest income. Moving on to our segments, starting on Slide 10. For Pharma, we are improving our revenue outlook to a decline of 1% to 3% reflecting the addition of GI Alliance and Ion into our guidance and the strong year-to-date utilization we've seen.\nNormalizing for the customer transition and our acquisitions, fiscal '25 revenue growth at the midpoint would now be approximately 20%. For segment profit, we are raising our Pharma segment profit guidance for the full year to 10% to 12% growth. Excluding the contributions of GIA and Ion, this would equate to high single-digit underlying segment growth. You should note that GIA holds meaningful minority equity positions in many of the ambulatory Serdil centers in which their procedures are inducted.\nThe ASC tied profit streams in GIA will not show up in our Pharma segment, but will rather show up at a positive item in IMO's other income. For reference, we expect about $15 million of other income coming from GIA's equity method investments in fiscal '25. Regarding Pharma's cadence, we continue to expect significant incremental volume over the back half of the year from new customer wins and expansions.\nAnd we also continue to expect Q3 to be the highest profit dollar quarter of the year, driven by the timing of manufacturer price increases which have traded generally consistent with our expectations. For GMPD, our revenue outlook remains unchanged at 2% to 4% growth, which is also what we now expect for Cardinal brand revenue growth.\nAs we think about the GMP improvement plan and the efforts I referenced earlier, while we are pleased with the progress the team is making, the efforts do take time. For the rest of this year, we recognized the impact of the health care costs, the WaveMark hide-off, and the Q2 soft volume headwinds that we have experienced. As a result, we are adjusting our GMP guidance on segment profit to be in the $130 million to $150 million range, still a significant improvement from last year.\nAs I have commented before, we continue to expect improvements in profit in the back half of the year with Q4 being the high point of the fiscal year, so to last year. We are not providing an update to our fiscal '26 our long-term profit guide on GNPD today. While our financial objectives are clear, we are scrutinizing volume trends and the current highly fluid tariff environment in Next [indiscernible] and the United States, and we are awaiting clarity on whether there will be industry-wide dislocations or exceptions which may present both risks and opportunities for us.\nThis is a highly fluid situation. The one certainty is that our GMPD team continues to aggressively work to improve our business. In other, we are reiterating our expectations for 10% to 12% revenue growth and a probably 10% segment profit, one note on other's cadence. We expect stronger year-over-year profit growth in Q4 than in Q3, due to the timing of our growth-oriented technology investments and associated benefits.\nBefore I wrap up, a couple of comments on capital deployment. We remain committed to creating continued shareholder value over the long term. Nothing is changing regarding our disciplined capital allocation strategy, invest in the business, protect our investment-grade rating, return a baseline of capital and assess additional M&A and return of capital opportunities. Following the closures of our deals, we will take a disciplined approach to paying down debt. We anticipate retaining our BBB, Baa2 investment-grade rating by quickly getting back within Moody's post yield updated targeted leverage range for us, of 2.75x to 3.25x adjusted debt to EBITDA. We will also execute on our previously committed fiscal year '25 additional share repurchases of $375 million.\nAs for M&A, we are focused on executing against the integration and improvement plans that surround the acquisitions we have announced in the last year. We will continue to evaluate high-quality assets in strategic areas of importance, but we'll focus on integration and tuck-in acquisitions to the multi-specialty and oncology platforms that we have just acquired.\nTo close, Cardinal Health continues to benefit from our disciplined focus on our core while also making important investments, securing our growth for the long term. Our shareholder value creation efforts expand our enterprise in both the progress to date and the road map of what we have in front of us gives Jason and I confidence to raise our guidance again for the remainder of this year. We look forward to updating you on this in coming months. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. In Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions, the positive second quarter performance is a direct result of our rigorous focus on prioritizing core operational execution and simplification. The team's efforts have resulted in commercial gains, including new distribution business and renewals with key customers.\nWe successfully onboarded a couple of notable acute health systems this quarter and consistently aim to provide them and all of our customers with entry leading service. In fact, our service levels have continued increase off of last quarter's multiyear high and are now up over 10% over the last 2 years. Of note, our team has navigated severe storm activity this winter, while maintaining above-target on-time delivery metrics.\nOur efforts to build a strong foundation and increase our exposure to higher growth and higher-margin areas are working to drive growth and continued momentum across the business. As I've consistently indicated, specialty is our most important growth area where we've been investing both organically and inorganically in areas where there's not only the greatest opportunity for future business growth but also where we can create value for our customers and patients.\nOur specialty strategy, as seen on Slide 12, is centered upon the community provider and is our ambition to deliver clinical and economic value for specialty physicians across key therapeutic areas enabling them to focus on providing high-quality and cost-effective patient care. We are excited about the suite of services and capabilities we are building beyond our heritage and distribution and contracting, including today's closing of GI Alliance.\nThis acquisition is a key component of our strategy to continue driving meaningful growth over the long term in the larger 60% of the specialty market consisting of non-oncology therapeutic areas. GI Alliance, the largest gastroenterology managed services platform in the country with over 900 physicians across 345 practice sites in 20 states will serve as the foundation of our multi-specialty platform, enabling further national expansion in GI in areas like urology, rheumatology and neurology.\nThis team brings best-in-class support capabilities such as revenue cycle management, and a physician-led leadership team headed by Founder and CEO, Dr. Jim Weber, that is highly regarded in the industry and will continue to operate the business as a stand-alone platform within Cardinal Health. The work to integrate the IM team and providers into our Navista platform is progressing [indiscernible] The combined leadership team is in place and has visited key sites where it's easy to see how joining Navista's clinical expertise with high and operational strengths will be a big win for independent community oncologists.\nThe team has created its consolidated leadership structure, defined the Avista go-to-market strategy and is engaging with a growing pipeline of opportunities as a result of our expanded offerings. A multitude of data is created while treating patients and thanks to the capabilities of specialty networks, PPS analytics, providers can generate actionable insight to improve patients' clinical outcomes while manufacturers can leverage its sonar capabilities for research purposes to improve future therapies.\nWe've completed the integration of the legacy Specialty Networks and Cardinal Health processes and established the go-forward execution road map, including extending specialty networks capabilities to Nevista, so providers on both our oncology and multi-specialty platforms can enhance their ability to provide exceptional patient care and grow doses. Aaron highlighted our strong performance from biopharma solutions which in addition to specialty Networks includes our leading specialty 3PL and Synexis patient access among its offerings.\nWe continue to see strong 3PL performance during the second quarter with revenue growth of over 20%. And Sonexus, which has seen steady growth, is executing a number of key product implementations with a strong pipeline of opportunities ahead. We've previously highlighted our Advanced Therapy Solutions offering, which supports 15 cell and gene therapy manufacturers across 450 sites of care and has already processed over 18,000 cell and gene therapy orders.\nIn the quarter, we launched Advanced Therapy Connect, a first-in-class cell and gene therapy ordering solution, which allows our customers to efficiently consolidate their ordering processes onto our singular platform. Our business is partnering with biopharma innovators and many of the top academic medical centers to bring cell and gene therapy products more efficiently to patients.\nTurning to GNPD, where the team is focused on executing our DMPD improvement plan initiatives. Stepping back, while we had some additional nonrecurring impacts with WaveMark in the quarter, we are pleased with the continued improvement in the GMPD business. Combined with last year's significant growth, this year's guidance reflects a nearly $300 million profit improvement from fiscal '23 driven by progress on inflation mitigation, cost reductions and return to growth with our Cardinal-branded products. But we recognize work remains in this transformation. We have an aggressive set of service, profit and cash flow improvement efforts in flight across the business that will continue to power the turnaround.\nFor example, we are modernizing our distribution network and bringing innovative solutions to the market, including the opening of a new distribution center in Massachusetts that will increase U.S. warehouse capacity and expand specialized handling capabilities. At the same time, we reached an agreement to sell the legacy distribution facility in the area, which will contribute to our stated value creation initiatives, along with some recent inventory improvements we've driven.\nOur business is committed to getting our customers the right product at the right place and time and remain focused on doing so as we navigate the existing trade environment, monitoring the potential impact of new trade policies and their effect on pricing. Our geographically diverse manufacturing network supports our ability to balance supply resiliency, service and cost for our customers.\nAs an example, with our recent investments to expand domestic syringe production, 90% of our syringe product category is now manufactured in the United States. And now finishing with our other businesses, which are becoming a greater growth driver for us in an area where we intend to continue to invest in the future. In Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we see continued strength in both our core business and Theranostics along with an expanding pipeline.\nWe are now the first company to offer Actinium 225 at commercial scale, spearheaded from our collaboration with TerraPower, offering a significant milestone and increasing access to potential new cancer treatments for patients. New therapies containing the isotope actinium-225 have the potential to become the next generation of cancer treatment due to their less invasive impact to the patient. This is an example of innovation and action and reaffirms our commitment to making meaningful investments to help address some of the most pressing health issues facing patients today.\nWe've also grown production of GE Healthcare's Visma and Alzheimer's pet diagnostic by nearly 70% since last quarter. Investments are underway to nearly double our Visma manufacturing sites by the end of fiscal year '25. Net Home Solutions, we have begun construction on our new distribution center in Fort Worth, Texas to continue benefiting from the growth of home health care.\nThe facility will be equipped with leading robotics and automation technologies and should be fully operational by this summer. Our investments in advanced distribution centers will enable synergies related to our acquisition of advanced Diabetes Supply group. Bringing together the scale and efficiency of our at-home business with the patient acquisition and retention capabilities of ADSG will be highly complementary, create further diversification within our diabetes business and allow us to drive significant value for customer patients.\nCMS continues to make policy decisions supporting CGM access, and we are well positioned to take advantage of future market growth as CGM utilization continues to increase. And in OptiFreight Logistics, we continue to deliver action-driven insights to support our customers, many of the leading health systems in the United States, enabling them to better manage their shipping needs. The team remains laser-focused on innovative and technology-driven solutions that drive incremental value and capabilities for our customers.\nRecently, the team made enhancements to our total view Insights portfolio with total view reporting making it easier for customers to answer critical program performance questions and unlock decision-driving insights. At least 3 product launches planned over fiscal '25 and '26, our team is constantly expanding its capabilities and exploring opportunities for new product penetration and clinical departments within hospitals where customers are looking for support, efficiency and value.\nIn closing, we are pleased with what we accomplished this quarter and are excited about the future. Thank you to our team for their unwavering dedication to fulfilling our role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, I'll be your coordinator for today's event. Please note that this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr. Matt Sims, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWelcome to this morning's Cardinal Health Fourth Quarter and Fiscal '24 Earnings Conference Call, and thank you for joining us.

[Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal year '24 marked a year of strong operational execution and record financial results for Cardinal Health, delivered in tandem with significant strategic progress across the portfolio. On that note, we have three key headlines today. First, we finished the year with momentum, growing EPS 29% in both Q4 and fiscal year '24. The results exceeded guidance, and full year EPS of $7.53 was $0.96 above the midpoint of our original outlook from Investor Day. We also delivered nearly $4 billion of adjusted free cash flow for the year, positioning us with approximately $5 billion of cash at year-end, even after $1.2 billion of capital returned to shareholders this year and funding our growth investments.\nSecond, we have managed through the transition of a significant customer and are raising our guidance for fiscal year '25 while also reconfirming our long-term finance targets. And finally, we continue to advance our strategy to build upon the growth and resiliency of pharma and specialty, execute our GMPD improvement plan and accelerate our growth in key areas while optimizing our portfolio to maximize shareholder value creation. More on that momentarily, but first, some brief reflections.\nThis year, we continue to take decisive actions to simplify our business and drive performance, highlighted by the reorganization of our operating and segment reporting structure to enhance management focus while enabling efficiencies, accountability and transparency. We grew our largest and most significant business, Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions above our targeted long-term growth rate. We saw ongoing stability in Pharmaceutical demand, strong performance from our generics program and our Specialty business grew revenue 14% for the year. As of fiscal year '24, our Specialty business is now over $36 billion, and we anticipate continued growth next year despite the large contract expiration. We prioritized key growth areas in Specialty with organic investments across therapeutic areas and the acquisition of Specialty Networks.\nIn GMPD, we executed our improvement plan initiatives, returning the business to profitability and delivering approximately $240 million in year-over-year segment profit improvement -- We achieved our year-end inflation mitigation target, a critical milestone for the business.\nAcross our Other operating businesses, we collectively grew revenue 12% and segment profit 7% in fiscal year '24. We've seen strong demand across Nuclear, at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight, and our purposeful investments and focus on performance excites us about how these businesses are positioned for the future. Overall, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to execute against a focused set of priorities to create value for our shareholders, our customers and ultimately for millions of patients.\nAs we turn the page to fiscal year '25, our confidence is reinforced by our strong and resilient business with positive industry trends supporting our growth. And we continue to take actions to optimize not only the performance of our businesses, but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise.\nBefore I hand the call over to Aaron, let me provide an update on our business and portfolio review, which, as a reminder, kicked off in September of 2022. Last June, we concluded our review of the former Pharma segment highlighted at Investor Day with our enhanced organizational focus on Specialty and decision to retain and further invest in our Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions business. Then in January, we finalized our review of the growth businesses within the former Medical segment determining the best course of action for shareholder value creation was to invest in and further develop at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight for long-term growth while also completing our resegmentation.\nAll along, management, in collaboration with the Business Review Committee and Board, has been reviewing GMPD from every angle as the team executes our turnaround plan. We deeply understand the business' opportunities and complexities and today have some preliminary conclusions to share through the lens of our portfolio review framework as seen on Slide 20.\nIn short, we remain committed to executing the GMPD impairment plan and our fiscal year '26 target of $300 million in segment profit. We are pleased and unsurprised to see significant interest in GMPD during our review. The business is core to the operations of so many health care providers and features not only our formidable distribution expertise, but a broad set of Cardinal Health brand products that are critical to patient care.\nFollowing our extensive review, we have gained confidence that we are best positioned to continue capitalizing on the meaningful growth and operational opportunities on the horizon for this business. Ultimately, we see more value creation potential ahead for our shareholders by continuing to drive the GMPD turnaround plan.\nEven more, analysis uncovered additional opportunities to unlock near-term value through further simplification actions and working capital improvements while continuing to drive the plan. From these initiatives, we plan to generate at least $500 million in cash over the next 2 years to be deployed according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. In recognition, we're raising our share repurchase expectations for fiscal year '25 to a total of $750 million, which is beyond our $500 million baseline.\nIn terms of mechanics of future reviews as the business continues to improve, the Business Review Committee of our Board sunset in July as planned and the ongoing value creation efforts are now being overseen by the Board as a whole. As always, we take a thorough, objective and open-minded approach focused on maximizing long-term -- while continuing to invest in the business to ensure that our customers receive the products and service they expect.\nI'll go deeper into our strategic plans for our segments later in my remarks. But first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and guidance.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning. Before discussing our Q4 success and our raised guidance, I want to highlight that today, we are providing revised prior period financials for fiscal year '22 through Q3 fiscal year '24, reflecting slight net increases to non-GAAP EPS. During the preparation of our annual financial statements, management identified a long-standing accounting error in -- of our at-Home Solutions business related to revenue recognition from third-party payers. As a result, we have corrected this item in prior periods and also updated the timing of other previously recognized immaterial out-of-period items across the full enterprise. The net impact of these changes increases non-GAAP EPS by $0.07 in fiscal year '24, $0.06 in fiscal year '23 and $0.01 in fiscal year '22. To be helpful, we've included supplemental schedules in our press release along with further detail in our fiscal year '24 10-K.\nMoving to our results. I am pleased to reinforce that Q4 produced a strong finish to a year in which the Cardinal team made tremendous progress against our financial and strategic priorities. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points with operating profit growth across pharma, GMPD and Other, also supported by improvements below the line in the form of lower interest costs, better tax rates and lower share count. We delivered strong gross margin growth and matched it with well-controlled SG&A even in an inflationary environment.\nIn Q4, revenue increased 12% to $59.9 billion, reflecting revenue growth in the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the GMPD segment and in all of the businesses making up Other. Gross margin grew 5% to $1.9 billion outpacing consolidated SG&A, which increased only 2% to $1.3 billion in the quarter, reflecting our disciplined cost management. This translated to total company operating earnings of $605 million, up 14% versus last year.\nBelow the line, interest and Other improved $6 million versus prior year to $10 million, benefiting from the quarter's strong -- of performance. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 24.6%, 4.5 percentage points lower than the prior year. Fourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 245 million, 4% lower than a year ago due to our previously announced share repurchases. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.84, growth of 29%.\nMoving into our segment results, beginning with the pharma segment on Slide 11. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $55.6 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories: Brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Excluding GLP-1 sales, the segment's Q4 revenue growth would be 9%. As we've commented previously, GLP-1 sales do not meaningfully contribute to the bottom line. Segment profit increased 8% to $482 million in the fourth quarter, driven by positive generics program performance.\nWithin our generics program, we continue to see volume growth and consistent market dynamics including strong performance from Red Oak. Pharma segment profit growth in the quarter was 8% despite an approximate $15 million margin headwind related to the unwind of the previously announced large customer transition. This unanticipated impact in the quarter was the primary difference between pharma's Q4 results and the midpoint of our prior guidance.\nRecall that we previously observed that the impact of the contract loss would be offset by new customers, Specialty Networks and cost controls as part of our contingency planning. Consistent with these mitigation plans, the team began implementing cost control measures and started to see offsetting savings. We also saw strong growth from biopharma solutions in the quarter, including contributions from Specialty Networks.\nTurning to the GMPD segment on Slide 12. We are quite pleased by the Q4 GMPD results, which confirmed our continued progress against the GMPD improvement plan. Fourth quarter revenue grew 2% to $3.1 billion driven by volume growth from existing customers. We again saw growth in Cardinal brand volumes during the quarter. GMPD delivered Q4 segment profit of $47 million generally consistent with our expectations and our prior guidance of approximately $65 million for the year before the prior period revisions. The $40 million year-over-year increase in Q4 was driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives as we achieved our target of offsetting the gross impact of inflation by the end of fiscal year '24. We continue to be encouraged by the tenacity of the team in driving improved execution and customer satisfaction and service levels while identifying additional opportunities to optimize the business.\nFinishing with the businesses that aggregate into Other as seen on Slide 13. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $1.2 billion driven by growth across all three businesses: at-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions and OptiFreight Logistics. Segment profit grew 11% to $111 million, primarily driven by the performance of OptiFreight Logistics. The OptiFreight business continues to hit on all cylinders as increasing customer demand for our logistics management services is met with strong execution. In Nuclear and at-Home Solutions, we continue to invest strategically to supercharge growth. All three businesses, as key parts of our growth story, have received and will receive going forward, access to capital for expansion of their business models in support of our customers.\nI will be brief on the full year commentary. Fiscal '24 [ revenue ] increased 11% to $227 billion with growth from all five operating segments. Gross margin increased 8% to $7.4 billion while SG&A increased a more modest 4% to $5 billion reflecting our year-long efforts to control costs. Together, this resulted in fiscal '24 total operating earnings growth of 16% to $2.4 billion. All in, it was an excellent year across the business.\nBelow the line, interest and other decreased 52% to $42 million, driven by increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 21.7%. Average diluted shares outstanding were $247 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. The net result was fiscal '24 non-GAAP EPS of $7.53, growth of 29%, well above our long-term target of 12% to 14% growth.\nNow before I turn to fiscal '25, let's cover the balance sheet. For fiscal '24, our ending cash balance was $5.1 billion. The cash position includes $200 million earmarked for the November 2024 debt maturity with an additional $200 million to be paid for the time deposits held in prepaid assets and Other on the balance sheet. To get there, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow, nearly $4 billion in fiscal year '24. Recall that at our Investor Day last June, I commented that cash flow remains an area of opportunity for us. Our excellent adjusted free cash flow results in 2024 was almost entirely a result of the team's year-long effort to optimize each element of our working capital while remaining focused on our service levels.\nTo a much lesser degree, the results reflect balanced preparation for the Q1 contract expiration, which has now occurred in July, largely as we expected. We attribute only a couple of hundred million dollars of our fiscal '24 cash flow to beneficial timing related to the large contract unwind. I'll talk about the impact of the contract to unwind on cash flow shortly as part of our guidance.\nAlso this year, we strengthened our balance sheet and achieved our targeted leverage ratio, which resulted in three positive outlook updates from the credit rating agencies. We also continue to deploy capital in a shareholder-friendly manner, returning more than our baseline commitment of capital returned to shareholders through $750 million of share repurchases and $500 million in dividend payments. And we increased our dividend for the 35th year in a row.\nNow let's look forward and discuss our updated fiscal '25 guidance on Slide 15. Today, we are increasing our fiscal '25 EPS guidance to a new range of $7.55 to $7.70. This is an increase from the preliminary guidance during our Q3 call of at least $7.50.\nSlide 16 shows our fiscal '25 outlook for pharma. On revenue, we expect to decline between 4% and 6%, reflecting the nearly $40 billion revenue headwind from the large customer contract expiration. Normalizing for the large customer, fiscal '25 revenue growth would be between 15% and 18%. This reflects underlying growth generally consistent with our long-term targeted rate of 10% due to strong overall pharmaceutical demand as well as significant growth from the onboarding of new customers and existing customer expansions, primarily in the second half of the year. We are on track to address the segment profit impact of the large contract expiration with this incremental volume, contributions from Specialty Networks and additional operational efficiencies. Note that all three of these assets will have some level of a ramp to them throughout our fiscal '25.\nWe expect consistent market dynamics for our generics program to continue. We also expect increased contributions from brand and specialty products including biosimilars. We are assuming a modest year-over-year headwind related to the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. On brand manufacturer price increases, we expect an environment generally consistent with the past several years.\nSumming it all up, we anticipate pharma segment profit growth in the range of 1% to 3%, a testament to the strength and resiliency of this business. It is the case that segment profit growth will be more back half weighted than usual. We expect first half segment profit to be slightly lower to flat versus the prior year with profit growth in the back half. Q3 should again be the highest absolute dollar profit quarter for the business.\nTurning to GMPD on Slide 17. On the top line, we expect growth between 3% and 5%, aided by low single-digit utilization growth as well as incremental volume from the onboarding of net new distribution customer wins. On the bottom line, we are reiterating our expectation of approximately $175 million in segment profit for fiscal year '25 on our path to approximately $300 million in segment profit by fiscal year '26 by executing the GMPD improvement plan. The plan is unchanged from what we shared a quarter ago. After successfully offsetting inflation at the end of this year, the annualization of these benefits will be a fiscal year '25 tailwind.\nThe team remains focused on continuing to drive Cardinal brand growth through our Five-Point plan. In fiscal year '25, we expect Cardinal brand sales growth between 3% and 5%. Simplification and cost optimization also continue with further opportunity in the pipeline to drive efficiencies and streamline our operations.\nRecognizing that while GMPD's plan may be simple, that does not make it easy. We once again expect a back half-weighted profit year in fiscal '25, just like fiscal '24. The quarterly cadence will be driven by seasonality and the ongoing commercial and operational improvements in the business. Additionally, we expect unfavorable manufacturing cost timing in the first half of the year, which, unlike last year, includes some start-up costs and timing associated with expanding production at Cardinal Health owns domestic manufacturing plants to enhance our supply chain resiliency. Q1 should be the low point of the year due to these factors. Last year's updated Q1 shows $12 million of profit, and this year, we expect Q1 to increase to up to $20 million with sequential improvement thereafter.\nTurning to Other on Slide 18. For each of Nuclear, at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight, we expect profit to be aided by the continued strength in demand, execution of our growth strategies and benefits from our increased prioritization of these businesses with investments. Collectively, we expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth of approximately 10% with all three businesses contributing to these targets. Stepping back, we are pleased to see anticipated profit growth across all of our operating segments in fiscal '25.\nMoving below the line, we expect interest and Other in the range of $140 million to $170 million. The large year-over-year increase continues to be driven by lower average cash balances, lower short-term investment rates on our cash and higher rates on our debt resulting from the refinancing of our calendar 2024 maturities. We continue to expect our fiscal year '25 effective tax rate to be in the range of 23% to 24%.\nWith our near-term GMPD value creation initiatives, we have increased our fiscal year '25 share repurchase expectations beyond our baseline to $750 million in the year, leading to a share count guidance of approximately [ 245 million ] shares. Finally, we expect fiscal year '25 adjusted free cash flow of approximately $1 billion, reflecting the Q1 negative impacts from the large contract unwind as well as quarter end day of the week timing. While these dynamics will significantly affect our cash from Q1, our strong investment-grade balance sheet positions us well to manage through these fluctuations and continue making strategic investments in the business consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework.\nTo close, fiscal year '24 was a standout year filled with notable milestones with adjusted EPS growth of 29% and adjusted free cash flow of nearly $4 billion, the Cardinal team delivered. With 6 weeks of fiscal '25 behind us, I'm pleased to say that the team is managing adeptly. Between the leaders we have throughout the organization, our dedicated team working tirelessly to serve our customers and our clear strategy, we are confident that we will deliver once again.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now I'll go deeper into our strategic priorities, beginning with Pharma and Specialty Solutions, where we remain focused on building upon our strong core foundation and expanding in specialty.\nEverything we do starts with the customer. Recently, we hosted our 32nd Annual Retail Business Conference, the largest in the industry, bringing together 5,000 attendees from across the country. As the trusted partner to retail pharmacy, we understand the critical role retail independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities, to continue to expand their services as community health care destinations and demonstrate the remarkable value and resiliency.\nWe continue to invest in our full suite of clinical, business and reimbursement solutions to support our customers and provide industry advocacy to empower retail pharmacy now and into the future.\nOur Consumer Health logistics center slated to open in 2025 will offer a comprehensive selection of over-the-counter medications, treatments and diagnostic solutions. Additionally, our new vaccine alliance program offers cost savings and other benefits from participating manufacturers to help pharmacies engage more patients and expand their immunization programs.\nWe're constantly evaluating ways to bring innovative solutions to our pharmacy and manufacture parts through the breadth of our offerings and capabilities. As part of that commitment, and in collaboration with CVS Health, we have formed Averon, a joint venture to source biosimilars. Averon builds upon our company's successful partnerships like Red Oak Sourcing with similar overall objectives for biosimilars. Simply put, we are increasing access to additional therapy options that will provide more choice for patients at a lower cost. Averon began by contracting a couple of products, including HUMIRA biosimilars, and we see opportunities for the program to expand over time.\nContinuing in specialty. We're pleased with how quickly Specialty Networks has integrated with our business, and we continue to be impressed with the PPS analytics platforms insight generation capabilities and the team's clinical, technology and operational expertise. As expected, we are leveraging Specialty Networks' demonstrated capabilities in urology, the largest area of its fully integrated model, to enhance our offering in oncology. The fully integrated Specialty Networks' market offering is directly aligned with our strategy for Nevista, our oncology practice alliance providing advanced technology and services. Over the course of the last year, we've built a world-class Nevista team consisting of industry experts to find our offerings and go-to-market strategy and completed our foundational technology build. The Nevista team is engaging with an active pipeline of customers across the oncology marketplace, demonstrating to community oncologists how Nevista can help them remain independent for good.\nUpstream with manufacturers, our leading specialty 3PL, has continued its track record of growing faster than market with nearly 20% growth during the year. We're leveraging these services as a part of our comprehensive offering that further facilitates the commercialization and delivery of critical cell and gene therapies to providers and patients. Our new Advanced Therapy solutions innovation center features a specialized deep frozen storage suite to handle the logistical challenges associated with cell and gene therapies. Additionally, the dedicated space provides opportunities for collaboration and improved process design supporting the ordering, invoicing and accounts receivable process for pharmaceutical products.\nAcross classes of trade, our commitment to service and solutions-oriented commercial approach has resonated with customers, a new health system customer onboarding that we recently completed and a few in the earlier phases of ramp-up are going smoothly, and we expect over $10 billion in total incremental revenue in fiscal year '25 from committed customer wins and expansions.\nTurning to GMPD. When we originally introduced the former Medical improvement plan, we consistently highlighted that the first key to turn around the performance of the business was addressing the significant impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints on our business. Our team got to work with urgency, executing various mitigation actions to cover the significant operating losses we incurred. Fast forward to today, after 2 years of hard work, the GMPD business -- solid ground. We delivered an approximate $240 million year-over-year improvement in segment profit fiscal year '24. We exited the year successfully offsetting the gross impact of inflation. We've seen 3 consecutive quarters of year-over-year segment revenue growth and 4 consecutive quarters of Cardinal Health brand volume growth.\nWe grew Cardinal Health brand revenue 3% overall for the year and 4% in the U.S. Our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution remains up over 20 points from its pandemic low. And we're successfully retaining key distribution customers along with some recent wins.\nContinue to dive into the business through our portfolio review, it's clear there are still significant opportunities to capture. I'll highlight a few. First, as Aaron mentioned, our profit inflation mitigation in fiscal year '24 will annualize and be a significant year-over-year tailwind to our results next year, even with a slight headwind expected from the recent cost increases in international freight. Between the actions we've taken to improve our resiliency, the diversity of our global supply chain and some offsets across our broader portfolio of commodities, we're confident in our ability to continue to effectively mitigate supply chain inflation.\nSecond, Cardinal Health brand leading indicators remain positive and continue to predict an acceleration in growth. We've seen a healthy overall utilization environment for a number of quarters now, and our five-point plan continues to produce encouraging results.\nThird, the disciplined execution of our simplification strategy has driven improved operational performance. With the business stabilized and only recently turned free cash flow positive, we see opportunities to drive targeted working capital improvements over the next 2 years. Additionally, we can broaden our simplification efforts, such as further optimizing our real estate and geographic footprints while always prioritizing the needs of our customers as our North Star.\nOur team is energized to execute on the next phase of the improvement journey, focused on commercial excellence and continued simplification to create additional value for our customers and shareholders.\nIn Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, our leading positioning with 130 nuclear pharmacies and 30 PET sites across the country, these are differentiated ability to partner with manufacturers in order to bring cutting-edge therapies to patients exactly when they need them. Our excitement continues to build around the opportunities to improve patient lives through the use of precision medicine, which we have been investing into heavily with our center for Theranostics advancement. We're seeing the results with our Theranostics business growing over 20% in fiscal year '24, driven by strong demand for prostate cancer theranostics products such as [ Telix Lucix ].\nIn fiscal year '25, we expect similar Theranostics growth, and we'll continue to invest to meet the growing pipeline of opportunities which includes cardiology and neurology, but overall is largely dominated by oncology. As an example, we will be expanding our support of novel prostate radioligand therapies with Novartis' [ Plavicto ] in fiscal year '25. We are also investing in increasing our cyclotron capacity and PET manufacturing [ geograph ] print to meet increasing demand for diagnostics with the majority of emerging radiotherapeutics requiring a companion PET scan.\nFiscal year '24 was a foundational year for our $2.9 billion at-Home Solutions business as we laid the groundwork for future growth and efficiency. This business continues to grow revenue faster than market not only aided by care moving into the home, but also our team's commercial execution.\nTo drive operating leverage, we've been investing in our technology capabilities, such as new warehouses with state-of-the-art automation. Just last month, we opened a brand-new 350,000 square foot warehouse in South Carolina, featuring the fastest order fulfillment system in the market. This system is also operational in our Central Ohio facility and plan for the new Texas distribution center we previously announced and expect to open in 2025. We're seeing fruits from our investments with our -- currently the highest they've been in over 3 years, and our patient Net Promoter Score up over 16% year-over-year.\nThe OptiFreight Logistics team delivered this year with exceptional performance. Our total view Insights platform continues to help customers uncover shipping inefficiencies and optimize delivery through data-driven insights. As a result, our customer loyalty index is at an all-time high.\nIn fiscal year '25, to put it simply, we expect to continue our track record of great execution, helping our customers expand and bringing on new customers to benefit from our program and value. Across enterprise, we are confident in the Cardinal team to continue our momentum and deliver our targeted growth in fiscal year '25 and beyond.\nBefore I wrap up, the former CFO and me can't help but acknowledge our team's tremendous progress on cash flow this year. With the record results in fiscal year '24, we're positioned to exceed the adjusted free cash flow expectations we outlined at Investor Day with at least $7 billion over fiscal '24 to '26 period even despite the large contract expiration. We possess the financial flexibility to continue investing in our business, returning capital to shareholders and maximizing long-term shareholder value creation.\nIn summary, fiscal year '24 was another great year, and we are excited to continue driving our company and health care forward. I want to thank our dedicated employees who serve our customers and continue our work to be health care's most trusted partner.\nWith that, we will take your questions."

This meeting is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Sims Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nWelcome to this morning's Cardinal Health Second Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Conference Call, and thank you for joining us.

With that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nGood morning, everyone. In the last few weeks, we made several notable announcements regarding our company's continued progress, including yesterday's news on our agreement to acquire specialty networks, which will further our specialty growth strategy and create value for specialty providers, manufacturers and patients in exciting new ways. And as we highlighted at a recent industry conference, we're continuing to take actions to become a simplified and more focused company with further progress achieved on our ongoing business and portfolio review and our updated enterprise operating and segment reporting structure, which will be reflected in our financial reporting beginning next quarter. We plan to go further into our recent updates with you today.\nBut first, let me begin with a few brief comments on our results. In Q2, we delivered strong profit growth in both segments demonstrating continued operating momentum and execution against our strategic priorities. Pharma again delivered strong performance. Overall, the business is performing consistent with our expectations, and we're pleased to reiterate our outlook for 7% to 9% segment profit growth in fiscal '24. We've seen ongoing stability in macro trends, including in our generics program and continued broad-based strength in overall pharmaceutical demand. Our specialty distribution business also continued to see strong demand, including with COVID-19 vaccines in the first part of the quarter.\nTurning to Medical. Q2 segment profit was consistent with Q1 despite some nonrecurring adjustments in the second quarter, which we reflected in our updated fiscal '24 outlook for the former Medical segment. We're encouraged by the underlying improvements in operating performance, reflecting further progress with our medical improvement plan efforts focused on our global medical products and distribution business. Notably, we saw a change in trend in revenue growth for the Medical segment in the second quarter. Along with continued growth from At-home Solutions, we're seeing the effects of our Five-Point Plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume yield positive results. And as we continue to optimize not only the performance of our businesses, but also the financial strength of the broader enterprise, we're generating robust cash flow and seeing meaningful benefits below the operating line.\nAs a result of our first half performance and increased confidence as we look ahead, we're pleased to raise our fiscal '24 EPS guidance and our outlook for adjusted free cash flow. Of course, our customers remain at the center of everything we do, and our team continues to prioritize core operational execution to best serve them and their patients with essential products and services as we drive our company forward. Now let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated guidance in more detail.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. Before we begin, let me remind you that our Q2 segment commentary will be according to our former segment structure, pharma and medical. Let's start with total company results for the second quarter. Q2 delivered another strong quarter across the enterprise with EPS of $1.82 growth of 38%, which included operating earnings growth of 20%. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash, even following incremental share repurchase activity in the quarter.\nAs seen on Slide 4, a Total company revenue increased 12% to $57.4 billion, reflecting growth in both the pharma and Medical segments. We drove operating leverage for the enterprise despite incremental investments in the business and higher costs to support sales growth. Gross margin increased 11% to $1.8 billion, driven by both segments and consolidated SG&A increased 8% to [ $4.3 ] billion. With the strong profit growth in both segments, we delivered operating earnings of $562 million, 20% higher than a year ago. Moving below the line, interest and other decreased by $26 million to $8 million in income due to increased interest income on cash and equivalents from higher cash balances and higher rates.\nAs we've noted, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near term. Additionally, Q2 interest and other benefited from nearly $10 million in income from the quarterly revaluation of our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which as a reminder, has a matching offset above the line. Our second quarter effective tax rate of 21.3% was 1.7 percentage points lower than a year ago and better than we anticipated due to positive discrete items in the period. Q2 average diluted shares outstanding were $246 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases in each of the last 4 quarters. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result for Q2 was EPS of $1.82, reflecting growth of 38%.\nLet's turn to the Pharma segment on Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 12% to $53.5 billion driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong pharmaceutical demand across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics, and from our largest customers. We also continue to see robust demand for GLP-1 medications, which provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $518 million in the second quarter, driven by positive generics program performance and the higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Our positive generics program performance continued to reflect volume growth and consistent market dynamics. With respect to COVID-19 vaccines, we saw the strength in demand from September for the fall immunization season carry into October before peaking mid-month and trending to a much lower run rate as we exited the second quarter.\nThe Q2 increase in segment profit includes a partial offset from higher costs to support sales growth driven by increased pharmaceutical volumes. Turning to the Medical segment on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue increased 3% to $3.9 [ million, ] which, as Jason alluded to, reflects quarterly revenue growth for the Medical segment for the first time in over 2 years. This increase was driven by growth in both at Home Solutions and Global Medical Products and Distribution with the GNPD growth primarily related to higher Cardinal Health brand volumes. Medical delivered segment profit of $71 million, a $54 million year-over-year increase, driven by an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. Consistent with the expectations communicated a few weeks ago, segment profit was generally consistent with Q1 despite some nonrecurring adjustments in the quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the underlying performance of the business which through the first 2 quarters of the year has tracked consistent with our original plans. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion in Q2 and bringing our year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $2 billion.\nAnd as I noted earlier, ended the quarter with $4.6 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would, deploying capital according to our disciplined capital allocation framework. Thus far, through the first half of fiscal '24, we've continued to invest against our highest priorities including investing back into the businesses to drive organic growth with over $200 million in year-to-date CapEx. In the first half, we have returned $1 billion total to shareholders, which includes our quarterly dividend payments and $750 million in year-to-date share repurchases. These share repurchases are in excess of our committed baseline repurchases of $500 million. And in January, we made certain opioid settlement prepayments of $238 million at a prenegotiated discount, which is expected to result in a GAAP-only gain of approximately $100 million in the third quarter.\nNow for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 8, beginning with the enterprise. With our strong first half performance and positive outlook, we are again raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance. Our new range of $7.20 to $7.35 reflects a $0.45 increase at the bottom end and a $0.35 increase at the top end from our Q1 guidance range and a midpoint, which is 26% above our fiscal '23 EPS results. We are encouraged by the operating performance of our businesses and our strong cash flow generation, which is certainly contributing to the improvements below the line. Interest and other is reduced to a range of $50 million to $65 million, which primarily reflects increased interest income from higher-than-anticipated cash balances. We expect lower average cash balances in the second half of the year due in part to the seasonal timing of anticipated cash flows. We are evaluating opportunities to refinance our upcoming 2024 debt maturities in the back half of the year.\nWe are lowering the top end of our effective tax rate guidance to a new range of 23% to 24% to reflect the positive discrete items we've seen in the first half of the year. We also are lowering our shares outlook to approximately $247 million, which reflects the $250 million accelerated share repurchase program we completed in Q2. No additional share repurchases are assumed in our updated guidance for fiscal year '24. Now turning to the fiscal '24 outlook for our segments. While we will be transitioning to our new segment structure reporting beginning in Q3, let me start with our former segments as a comparison point for the updated structure. No changes to the outlook for the former Pharma segment. We are reiterating the 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit growth.\nFor the former Medical segment, the fiscal '24 outlook is updated to approximately $380 million of segment profit to reflect the net impact of Q2 nonrecurring adjustments. Outside of these, our overall operational expectations are consistent with delivering the prior $400 million in segment profit for the year as well as the corresponding prior expectation of $650 million in segment profit for fiscal year '26. We have consistently highlighted the back half weighting of the medical guidance driven by progress within GMPD and Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation and some business-specific seasonality. Our expectations there continue. For example, with inflation mitigation, we have strong visibility to overall cost improvements in the second half of the year, driven by reductions we've observed in international freight which as a reminder, reflect in our income statement on a 2- to 3-quarter delay. And as we exit January, the mitigation initiatives necessary to achieve our year-end target are now largely in place.\nNow we see on Slide 10, let me comment on how this fiscal year '24 guidance translates to our updated segment structure. To go along with the preliminary recast fiscal '23 actuals, and long-term targets we provided a few weeks back. Our new structure went into effect on January 1. So beginning in Q3, we will report results and provide drivers according to the new segment structure. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions and GMPD and separate from these 2 segments, nuclear, at home and OptiFreight aggregated in other. At that time, we also plan to provide a recast to the results for fiscal '22 to '24 on the new segmentation. Beginning with the Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment, the guidance ranges are consistent with the former Pharma segment, even excluding our higher-growth nuclear business. We expect 10% to 12% revenue growth and 7% to 9% segment profit outlook for fiscal '24 a 4% to 6% segment profit growth CAGR over the long term.\nTurning to GMPD, where we remain encouraged by the improvements in this business. Through the execution of the medical improvement plan initiatives, we expect to drive GMPD from an operating loss of approximately $165 million in fiscal '23 to operating income of approximately $65 million in fiscal '24. From the fiscal '23 low point, this $230 million year-over-year improvement would position us roughly halfway towards our fiscal '26 target of approximately $300 million of segment profit. Finally, we expect the businesses included in other at-home solutions, nuclear precision health solutions and OptiFreight Logistics to collectively deliver 6% to 8% segment profit growth in fiscal year '24. The difference between this fiscal '24 growth rate and the long-term CAGR of 8% to 10% for fiscal '24 to '26 reflects the portion of the Q2 nonrecurring adjustments within -- at Home Solutions with the remainder residing in GMPD.\nBefore I close, a couple of comments on our recently announced acquisition. We've noted that the specialty category has been our highest priority for potential M&A and a primary consideration for our opportunistic capital deployment as part of our disciplined capital allocation framework. Given our financial flexibility and strong presence in the other 60% of the specialty market in therapeutic areas outside of oncology, we have evaluated a range of potential acquisition candidates to further accelerate our specialty strategy. We are thrilled to reach an agreement for specialty networks to become a part of the Cardinal Health family.\nJason will elaborate on the strategic aspects of the deal, but we plan to include the expected financial impacts of the transaction and our guidance upon closing which, of course, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals. For general modeling purposes, we expect the deal to be accretive 12 months following close. So to wrap up, tremendous progress in the first half of the year with exciting value creation opportunities still in front of us. We are confident in our plans and grateful for the efforts of our team who continue to drive our ongoing initiatives and prioritize the needs of our customers. With that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now for some additional perspective on our strategic priorities, beginning with priority #1 and building upon the growth of Pharma and Specialty Solutions, our largest and most significant business. Though this segment structure has slightly changed, our focus on executing in the core remains. We're building upon our strong foundation while investing to accelerate growth in specialty, both downstream and upstream.\nWe believe that this new segment structure further enables those efforts by enhancing management focus, leveraging the connectivity between pharmaceutical distribution and specialty and positioning the business for long-term growth and investment. More on that front shortly. A key component of our strong core foundation is our generics program anchored by [ Red Oak, ] which continues to do an excellent job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply. Red Oak leverages proprietary analytical tools and their deep industry expertise to help maximize service delivery for customers. We're continuing to invest in our business to provide customer-focused solutions and evolve our commercial engagement strategies to prioritize addressing the complex challenges our customers face every day.\nFor example, at Investor Day, we highlighted our first-to-market clinically integrated supply chain, the Cardinal Health into [ Logix ] platform. This innovative solution leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning through the [ Palantir ] foundry platform to help providers reduce costs, optimize drug inventories and generate actionable insights to simplify and streamline medication supply. We've continued to develop our offerings such as the contract optimizer tool, which drives savings and value through contract compliance, cost controls and product alternatives like brand generics, blood plasma and more. Key health system customers are already benefiting from these capabilities, and we see opportunities for further future expansion.\nShifting to specialty, where we have also been investing to expand our offering into complementary areas. The acquisition of Specialty Networks is exciting to us on a number of fronts. This is a business with which we were already very familiar given the long-standing partnership to service their members through our specialty distribution. Specialty Networks is a technology-enabled multi-specialty group purchasing and practice enhancement organization, serving 11,500 total providers today, including more than 7,000 physicians across 1,200 independent urology, gastroenterology and rheumatology practices. We see their service capabilities as accelerating our efforts in critical ways. First, further extending our reach, expertise and offerings in key therapeutic areas to provide increased clinical and economic value for specialty providers. Specialty Networks is a leader in specialty practice management, research and technologies that support physicians and lowering costs, operating more efficiently and delivering best-in-class care to their patients.\nFor example, the company provides solutions that improve clinical and economic outcomes to over 3,000 urologists through its leading euro GPO. Second, creating a platform for our expansion across specialty therapeutic areas. The company's PPS analytics solution is a subscription-based advanced technology platform that utilizes artificial intelligence such as continuous learning algorithms and natural language processing to analyze data from electronic medical records, practice management, imaging and dispensing systems and transform it into actionable insights for providers and other stakeholders. We see this complementing our suite of clinical practice management and distribution solutions to specialty practices nationwide. Specialty Networks experience and capabilities and clinical engagement are robust, which also accelerates our upstream data and research opportunities with biopharma manufacturers. Third, enhancing the capabilities of our Specialty business, including supporting the ongoing build of the [ Navista ] network. Specialty Networks has a deep understanding of independent physician practices, and we see capabilities and expertise that will accelerate our ongoing development of the Navista network, which is focused on supporting the clinical and operational needs of independent community oncologists.\nIn summary, this transaction enhances our specialty strategy by providing new capabilities that strengthen the link between our downstream and upstream services, enabling us to create further value for customers, manufacturer partners and patients. Turning to priority #2 in the GMPB business, where we're executing the medical improvement plan. While the business and portfolio review of GMPD continues, the team continues to prioritize and make significant progress in turning around the operational performance of this business. As Aaron indicated, with our expectation that the business returns to profitability in fiscal '24. The #1 priority remains mitigating supply chain inflation, where we remain on track to address the impact by the time we exit fiscal '24. As of Q2, we're approximately 75% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated, and we have strong line of sight to continued improvement in the second half of the fiscal year.\nWe've continued to make progress with our mitigation initiatives and commercial contracting efforts, and are continually taking additional actions to offset elevated inflation such as through sourcing initiatives. As Aaron indicated, the work we've accomplished to date provides increased confidence in achieving our fiscal year-end target as overall cost improvements continue to reflect in our second half results. We're continuing to invest in the resiliency of our supply chain and our manufacturing and distribution capacity. We have opened 3 new distribution centers in the past year, adding capacity for growth while featuring state-of-the-art automation technology to streamline operations. For example, our new Greater Toronto area DC expands capacity to serve Cardinal Health Canada customers while leveraging autonomous mobile rollouts to increase picking and packing accuracy and drive efficiencies.\nWe're also continuing to invest in new product innovation and portfolio expansion in key categories in alignment with our disciplined portfolio management approach. As a result of our team's collective efforts, we're seeing our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health Brand volume result in improvements in our leading indicators and most importantly, strong customer retention and product volume growth. Finally, we continue to drive simplification and optimize our cost structure by exiting noncore product lines, rationalizing our network and streamlining our international footprint. We believe our new structure will further enable our medical improvement plan efforts as we continue to execute the plan and deliver value for customers. Now priority #3, accelerating growth in key areas. We are excited about the strong demand we are seeing in our at-home solutions and [ OptiFreight ] businesses and our recent determination to further invest in and develop these businesses for long-term value creation as part of our portfolio. At Home Solutions, we continue to focus on enabling and supporting comfortable home-based care for patients with acute and chronic conditions.\nTo support the growing demand for home health care, we're investing to expand the capacity of our network the breadth of our offering and the new technology to drive operating efficiencies. We recently announced plans for a new distribution center to be built in Texas with increased capacity, advanced automation technology and robotics within the facility and our previously announced 350,000 square foot facility being built in South Carolina is on track to open this calendar year. In OptiFreight Logistics, we're continuing to invest in digital tools to enable health care supply chain leaders to better manage their shipping spend and support the core volume growth in our business. We've launched new offerings to give our customers more supply chain visibility, and we are receiving great feedback. For example, we now have more than 1,000 health care providers leveraging our Total View, Insights platform to gain valuable insights on their operations.\nIn Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, we're continuing to see above-market growth in both our core business and theranostics. -- as we're a premier partner of choice due to our strong core foundation and differentiation with pharmaceutical manufacturers looking for commercialization success of their future radiopharmaceutical portfolios. For example, in Theranostics, prostate cancer radio diagnostics are important tools for health care providers to assess and properly treat the disease. We saw meaningful year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of fiscal '24 from the ramp-up in demand of these diagnostics. From a pipeline perspective, we're investing to expand our center for Theranostics advancement with demand from pharmaceutical manufacturer partners currently oversubscribed, and we're investing to expand the capabilities and resiliency of our pet manufacturing network to enable portfolio diversification and accommodate growth from the increasing demand for pet agents.\nThis is driven by trends such as an aging population, cancer prevalence emerging Alzheimer's therapy availability and reimbursement and increasing clinical trial needs. Finally, priority #4, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're continuing to maximize shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron noted, our robust cash flow generation is not only driving benefits below the operating line, it is enabling our opportunistic capital deployment with additional share repurchases in the quarter beyond our baseline plan and our ability to pursue value-creating M&A in specialty. We remain well positioned with the financial flexibility to continue opportunistically evaluating disciplined M&A, not only in specialty, but in our other growth areas and potential additional share repurchases.\nWith our recent conclusions on our business and portfolio review, we do not have further updates this share today, but plan to keep you apprised of our progress. To close, we had a strong first half of the year and are excited about the many initiatives underway to build upon our momentum. I would like to thank our highly engaged and talented team for driving our progress and prioritizing our customers as we fulfill our critical role as health care's most trusted partner. With that, we will take your questions."

This meeting is being recorded.\nAt this time, I'd like to hand the call over to Matt Sims, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMatt Sims\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and thank you for joining us for Cardinal Health First Quarter Fiscal '24 Earnings Conference Call.\nOn the call with me today are Jason Hollar, Chief Executive Officer; and Aaron Alt, Chief Financial Officer. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nAs a reminder, during the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Matt, and good morning, everyone.\nOverall, it was a great start to our fiscal year. With strong first quarter results and an improved outlook for the year, we are continuing our operating momentum into fiscal '24.\nIn the first quarter, we delivered significant profit growth in both segments. In Pharma, the results were driven by the strength across our business, including continued positive performance from our generics program. We also benefited from our role distributing the recently commercialized COVID-19 vaccines, which I'll elaborate on later in my remarks.\nMacro trends in the core distribution business remains stable, and we continue to see strong pharmaceutical demand, including the GLP-1 medications. And both our higher-growth specialty nuclear businesses tracked ahead of plan in the quarter.\nIn Medical, the first quarter was another proof point of the inflection we began to see last Q2 in this business. Recall, the segment was unprofitable only a year ago. Overall, results tracked slightly ahead of our expectations, and we continue to execute our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives to drive better and more predictable financial performance.\nIn particular, we made notable progress on inflation mitigation in the quarter. At an enterprise level, we realized notable operating leverage from our efforts to manage costs across the segments. And below the operating line, our favorable capital structure and responsible capital deployment provided tailwinds, enabled by our strong cash flow generation. In short, the broad-based performance to date gives us confidence to raise fiscal '24 EPS guidance only a quarter into the year.\nOur team continues to prioritize focused execution to best serve our customers and create value for shareholders. I'll update you on our progress in advancing our three key strategic imperatives shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results, updated guidance in more detail.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. Q1 delivered a strong financial start to the year, with EPS of $1.73, surpassing our expectations in Pharma and Medical. The strength of our pharma business, the progress on our medical turnaround efforts and our disciplined approach to capital allocation contributed to new first quarter highs for the enterprise on both revenue and EPS. We also delivered strong cash flow and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash.\nLet's start with the consolidated enterprise results, as seen on Slide 4. Total revenue increased 10% to $54.8 billion, driven by the Pharma segment. Gross margin also increased 10% to $1.8 billion, driven by both the Medical and Pharma segments. Consolidated SG&A was generally in line with the prior year at $1.2 billion, reflecting our disciplined cost management across the enterprise.\nWith the significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $571 million, growth of 35%. Moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased by $15 million to $12 million, due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near term.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.5%, an increase of approximately 5.5 percentage points. We saw positive discrete items in both the current and prior year periods, which were more beneficial a year ago. First quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 250 million, 8% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. And as I mentioned earlier, the net result was first quarter EPS of $1.73, an all-time first quarter high point, reflecting growth of 44%.\nLet's turn to the Pharma segment on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 11% to $51 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers. Similar to trends last year, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter.\nSegment profit increased 18% to $507 million in the first quarter, driven by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, including distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, which provided a modest contribution as customers stocked up in preparation for the fall vaccination season. We also saw positive generics program performance with continued volume growth and consistent market dynamics.\nTurning to Medical on Slide 6. First quarter revenue at $3.8 billion was largely flat to prior year and prior quarter. In the first quarter, we saw lower PP&E volume and pricing, including the impact from the prior year exit of our non-health care gloves portfolio, offset by growth in at-Home Solutions and inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives.\nMedical slightly exceeded our expectations in Q1 and delivered segment profit of $71 million, which represents an approximate $80 million in the prior year's first quarter loss. Consistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day and last quarter, we continue to be encouraged by the indicators of improvement in trends with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales.\nIn Q1, we saw a slight year-over-year volume growth. As expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. We also continue to see normalized PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. In the quarter, we also recorded a $581 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This Q1 accounting charge is due to an increase in the discount rate used in goodwill impairment analysis.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. As I alluded to earlier, in the first quarter, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1 billion and ended the quarter with $3.9 billion of cash on hand. We remain focused on doing what we said we would and deploying capital in balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner.\nIn the first quarter, we continued to invest against our highest priorities, including investing $92 million of CapEx back into the business to drive organic growth. We made our third annual payment on our national opioid settlement obligation. We did not draw on our credit facilities and received a positive change to the outlook on our investment-grade rating from Fitch as well as from S&P in Q2.\nWe returned over $630 million to shareholders through payment of our quarterly dividend and the launch of a new $500 million accelerated share repurchase program, which completed in October.\nNow for our updated fiscal '24 guidance, on Slide 8. Today, we are raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance to a range of $6.75 to $7, the midpoint of which is 19% above our fiscal '23 EPS result. This $0.25 increase to our EPS range primarily reflects an improvement to our Pharma outlook as well as some improvement below the line.\nWe are raising our Pharma segment profit guide to 7% to 9% growth for the year and are pleased with the momentum in the business. Our updated guidance reflects the strong first quarter performance; higher than originally assumed contributions from COVID-19 vaccine distribution, which continued into October; the ongoing strength of our business, consistent with a 4% to 6% growth trajectory for the segment on a normalized basis. Finally, as a reminder, on the Pharma quarterly cadence, we continue to assume Q3 branded inflation will not repeat at fiscal '23 levels.\nIn Medical, we are reiterating our outlook of $400 million of segment profit for the year. Recall, that we previously guided that Medical segment profit would be significantly back-half weighted. That assumption remains unchanged. The first half-second half cadence continues to be driven by progress on Cardinal Health brand volume growth, the cumulative impact of inflation mitigation and some business-specific seasonality.\nWhile we are encouraged that the business slightly overperformed relative to our expectation in Q1, due to execution against our plans and our cost management efforts, our expectation for Q2 segment profit is unchanged from our original guidance, which reflected some seasonality in Q2-specific expenses like health and wellness. Altogether, Q2 segment profit should be slightly higher than Q1, which benefited from overdelivery. We expect continued progress from our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives over the course of the year.\nBelow the line, interest and other is reduced to a range of $100 million to $120 million, while we are maintaining an effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We do expect the tax favorability we saw in the first quarter to be offset in Q2.\nWe are also lowering our shares outlook to approximately $249 million, which reflects the already completed $500 million of our baseline share repurchase. I want to reiterate that, as we shared at Investor Day, neither our fiscal '24 guidance nor our long-term targets reflect M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude, or additional opportunistic deployments of capital to share repurchases beyond our baseline repurchase. We will continue to evaluate both opportunistically to drive long-term value.\nSo an overall successful first quarter. The Cardinal team is a lot to be proud of with respect to our accomplishments. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of us.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now for a few updates regarding our recent progress on our three key strategic priorities, beginning with priority #1 and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment.\nThe key enabler to the pharma business is outstanding performance over a number of quarters now, has been the team's consistent prioritization of what matters most, operational execution in the core. We're leveraging our scale, efficiency and breadth of essential products and service capabilities to deliver for our customers and their patients.\nWithin the core, our generics program remains a critical component. Our performance is anchored by Red Oak Sourcing, which continues to do a fantastic job fulfilling its dual mandate, managing both cost and supply to help maximize service delivery for customers.\nI recently saw our customer-focused mindset on display when I visited our specialty pharmaceutical distribution facility in Luverne, Tennessee, where team worked extensively to prepare for commercial distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, while maintaining their terrific service for our other specialty products.\nOur team successfully navigated complex cold chain requirements for the vaccines, enabling us to quickly meet demand and begin making shipments immediately following FDA approval in time for the fall immunization season. We're pleased to support our customers in this manner, which patients rely upon for care, convenience and accessibility.\nWe're committed to supporting customers and manufacturers, and our strategic sourcing and manufacturer services team recently hosted hundreds of our supplier partners for our annual business partners conference. It was energizing to hear the excitement around various industry opportunities, such as biosimilars and emerging areas like cell and gene.\nWe are confident about our ability to continue to be a strategic partner for manufacturers, investing in the important drugs being developed and commercialized in this space. We've continued to see strong momentum across our specialty business, both downstream and upstream, and have reiterated our focus on this space. We are very sizable today in specialty with over $30 billion in fiscal '23 revenue, which we noted at Investor Day has grown at a 14% CAGR over the last 3 years.\nWe are making progress building out our Navista network offerings, with investments in the platform that will scale over time. Our differentiated model in community oncology is focused on driving practice growth and sharing value, while maintaining practice independence. Our approach is being refined through engagement with clinicians and our customer advisory board.\nOverall, we are developing solutions strategically aligned supporting the clinical and operational needs of community oncologists that drive long-term practice independence and allow physicians to focus on patient care.\nIn nuclear, the business continues its double-digit growth trajectory, with strong performance across our core categories and Theranostics. We continue to experience increasing demand for our Center for Theranostics Advancement, with more than 60 projects at various stages in our pipeline with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners.\nWe're progressing on our Phase II investment that we announced at Investor Day. Our innovation center and pre-commercial manufacturing center are already highly utilized. We're underway in progressing according to plan with the expansions of our central pharmacy capability and our commercial manufacturing center. With our strong foundation and continued investment, the nuclear business is well on track to deliver its long-term target of doubling profits by fiscal '26 relative to our fiscal '21 baseline.\nNow turning to medical and priority number two. The medical business has now delivered back-to-back quarters of meaningfully improved profitability, and we expect more to come. As part of our medical improvement plan, we've been taking action to address the challenges in the core products and distribution business, with the #1 priority being mitigating supply chain inflation.\nWe remain on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24, and we're pleased to note we are now over 70% to target. On the cost side, while overall still elevated, we've seen lower international freight costs reflected in our results as anticipated. We continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation, are making progress with our commercial contracting efforts and are seeing benefits from our additional actions, such as our sourcing initiatives.\nAdditionally, we've been taking action through our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume, which has yielded improvements. We are utilizing a balanced portfolio approach and have made important line extensions within our core products to fill portfolio gaps critical to our distribution offering. We've also highlighted investments we're making in new product development and commercialization for our clinically differentiated specialty medical products, which culminated in two notable product launches during the quarter.\nWe launched our anticipated Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding Pump in the U.S., designed to help provide enteral feeding patients with more options to meet their nutritional needs throughout their enteral feeding journey, from hospital to home. We also announced the launch of our next-generation end trainer system 2.0, a medical device designed to help premature and newborn infants develop with the oral coordination skills to make the transition to independent feeding faster and help reduce their NICU length of stay.\nI'm excited about what our products can do for patients and the progress we're making as we now turn to playing more offense to grow our Cardinal Health brand portfolio. We're continuing to see the results of our actions benefiting our leading indicators, such as our customer experience metrics and portfolio health for key categories, which gives us confidence that we'll be able to better participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment moving forward.\nFor example, we've seen further improvement in our customer loyalty index score for U.S. distribution beyond the 13-point increase in the last 2 years that we noted at Investor Day. And we've seen a continued reduction in our product back orders, which are now at a multiyear low and consistent with pre-pandemic levels.\nOutside of product and distribution, we're continuing to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care increasingly shifts to the home. Our team's focus on operational efficiency is producing better operating leverage in this business, resulting in increased contributions to the bottom line.\nTo wrap up the Medical, we're continuing to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives across the segment, which contributed to the strong SG&A management in the quarter.\nFinally, priority #3, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through our improved operational performance, robust cash flow and responsible allocation of capital. As Aaron detailed, our confidence in our cash flow generation enabled execution of our fiscal '24 baseline share repurchases, continued evidence of our willingness to return excess capital to shareholders and our value creation through capital deployment.\nWith our financial flexibility, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. We continue to agilely evaluate a range of potential partners or acquisition candidates for both the downstream and upstream elements for our specialty strategy, but clear that our long-term growth targets are not predicated on inorganic investment.\nWe are making progress with our ongoing business and portfolio review focused on the Medical segment. While across the company, our team has made significant progress over the past year realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to work collaboratively with our business review committee to evaluate additional value creation initiatives and expect to provide further updates in the coming quarters.\nTo close, we had a great first quarter and are excited to build upon last year's momentum. This was driven by our highly engaged and talented team, and I would like to thank them for all their efforts fulfilling our critical role as health care's most trusted partner.\nWith that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. Please note this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter and fiscal year-end 2023 results along with our outlook for fiscal year 2024. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Jason Hollar, our Chief Executive Officer; and Aaron Alt, our Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during the discussion today, all our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release. [Operator Instructions]\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal '23 was an inflection point for Cardinal Health with improved performance, strong execution and notable progress against both our short- and long-term plans. We delivered record financial performance, including our highest non-GAAP EPS ever, reflecting 14% growth in the prior year.\nWe grew Pharma segment profit an impressive 13% and generated $2.8 billion of adjusted free cash flow. And in Medical, we drove significant sequential improvement in operating performance from a segment loss in the first quarter to over $80 million of segment profit in Q4.\nThis year, we took decisive action to advance our 3 strategic imperatives: building upon the resiliency of our Pharma segment, executing our Medical Improvement Plan and maximizing shareholder value creation. Consistent with what you heard at our June Investor Day, these results were achieved through our team's commitment to ruthlessly prioritize the core of our business and to better serve our customers so they, in turn, can focus on caring for patients.\nWe simplified how we operate by streamlining our organizational structure, exiting noncore product lines and rationalizing our geographic and manufacturing footprint. We made key leadership changes and governance enhancements, adding talent and key positions across the enterprise and to our Board. We formed and extended the business review committee tasked with evaluating our strategy, portfolio, operations and capital deployment.\nOn that note, we completed our review of the Pharma segment, including announcements at Investor Day to further invest in our Nuclear & Precision Health Solutions business and launched our new Navista Network supporting community oncologists, which I will discuss more later in my remarks.\nWe recently closed our Outcomes merger with BlackRock's Transaction Data Systems, which we see as a big win for pharmacies and an important opportunity to accelerate the business' future growth. We also deployed capital responsibly with a continued eye on maximizing value, and we are positioned with the financial flexibility to continue driving value for shareholders.\nAt Investor Day, we provided preliminary guidance for fiscal '24. With a strong finish to the year and increased confidence as we look ahead, I am pleased that we can raise our fiscal '24 outlook.\nLater in my remarks, I will share further details on our 3 strategic priorities. But first, let me hand it over to Aaron to walk you through our financial results and guidance.\n\nAaron E. Alt\n\nSenior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & President-Sally Beauty Supply, Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning. I won't [indiscernible] the [ lead ]. Q4 was a strong finish to a year in which with Jason's guidance, the Cardinal team made significant progress against our strategic initiatives.\nWe delivered fourth quarter EPS of $1.55 and $5.79 for the full year at the high end of guidance from Investor Day. For both Q4 and the year, our EPS results reached historical high points. We also delivered stronger-than-expected cash flow, something I will touch on more later.\nStart with the Pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 15% to $49.7 billion driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We continue to see broad-based strength in Pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories, brand, specialty, consumer health and generics and from our largest customers.\nSimilar to Q3, GLP-1 medications provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter. Segment profit increased 12% to $504 million in the fourth quarter primarily driven by positive generics program performance. Within our generics program, we saw volume growth and consistent market dynamics, including strong performance from Red Oak.\nIncreased contributions from brand and specialty products along with Nuclear were also a positive factor, partially offset by higher investment and operating expenses, including higher costs to support sales growth.\nTurning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue was flat at $3.8 billion, an improvement in trend. We saw a decrease in products and distribution sales related to lower PP&E volumes and pricing, partially offset by inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives. This decrease within products and distribution was offset by growth in at-Home Solutions.\nIn the fourth quarter, we delivered Medical segment profit of $82 million, a nearly $100 million increase from the prior year loss. The results for the quarter were consistent with our Investor Day commentary, composed of approximately $60 million or more core performance driven in connection with the Medical Improvement Plan and approximately $20 million of both seasonality and net favorable onetime items.\nAs expected, we saw an improvement in net inflationary impacts, including our mitigation initiatives and the normalization of PP&E margins, which were impacted by unfavorable price/cost timing in the prior year. Of note, we achieved our target of exiting fiscal '23 with at least 50% inflation mitigation.\nConsistent with the expectations communicated at Investor Day, we were encouraged to see early indicators of an improvement in trend with respect to our Cardinal Health brand product sales. We also saw a positive overall contribution from our growth businesses, including at-Home Solutions and OptiFreight and from our ongoing cost optimization measures. Though with significant profit growth in both segments, we delivered total operating earnings of $560 million, growth of 24%.\nMoving below the line. Interest and other decreased by $48 million to $16 million due to increased interest income from cash and equivalents and increased income from our company's deferred compensation plan investments, which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 27% to approximately 2 percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items.\nFourth quarter average diluted shares outstanding were 256 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases, including a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program initiated in the quarter as we announced at Investor Day. The net result of all of this was fourth quarter EPS of $1.55, growth of 48%.\nNow transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. We surpassed the $200 billion revenue mark for the first time. Fiscal '23 revenue increased 13% to $205 billion, and gross margin increased 5% to $6.9 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment.\nTotal company SG&A increased 6% to $4.8 billion primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and higher investments in operating expenses such as higher costs to support sales growth, which were partially offset by our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost savings measures. Operating earnings increased 3% to $2.1 billion.\nInterest and other decreased 46% to $89 million primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates in the near term. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 23%. Net result was for fiscal '23 EPS, $5.79, growth of 14%.\nAs for the segment's full year results, beginning with Pharma on Slide 10. Pharma segment profit increased 13% to $2 billion driven by positive generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand and specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. Fiscal '23 year-over-year growth also included a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases, which we are assuming will not repeat in fiscal '24 as well as a favorable prior year comparison related to higher opioid-related legal costs and costs for technology enhancements in fiscal '22.\nMoving to Medical on Slide 11. Segment profit decreased 49% to $111 million primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix and net inflationary impacts, including mitigation initiatives. This decline was partially offset by normalization of PP&E margins.\nNow before I turn to fiscal '24, let's cover the balance sheet. In fiscal '23, we generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion with particularly strong cash flow towards the end of the year. We ended the year with $4 billion of cash on hand.\nAt our Investor Day, we highlighted that cash flow optimization was an area of go-forward focus for our teams, and the Cardinal team delivered across our businesses. This effort will continue in fiscal '24, notwithstanding that it is a tougher calendar from an inflow, outflow days-of-week perspective. We remain focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner.\nIn fiscal '23, we invested approximately $480 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down $550 million in debt to reduce leverage and maintain our strong investment-grade ratings, returned over $2.5 billion to shareholders, including through the dividend that our Board increased in May for the 34th year in a row and $2 billion of share repurchases.\nNow for our updated fiscal '24 guidance on Slide 13. Today, we are raising our fiscal '24 EPS guidance to a range of $6.50 to $6.75. This increase reflects the strong finish to fiscal '23, particularly within Pharma where we are now entering the year at a higher jump-off point.\nWe also are tightening our shares range to 250 million to 253 million, which reflects the recent share repurchases as well as our continued expectation of $500 million in base share repurchases over the course of fiscal '24. As you will calculate, the midpoint of our newly raised fiscal '24 EPS guidance is 15% above our fiscal '23 EPS results.\nThere are no changes to the other corporate guidance assumptions provided at Investor Day. Interest and other between $110 million to $130 million, and effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25% and adjusted free cash flow of approximately $2 billion in fiscal '24. Our segment outlooks for fiscal '24 are also unchanged with one exception, a high revenue range for Pharma driven by the continued acceleration of GLP-1s, which, as a branded product category, do not meaningfully contribute to segment profit.\nSlide 14 shows our fiscal '24 outlook for Pharma, our build and grow business. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 12% and segment profit growth in the range of 4% to 6%, which is now on a larger fiscal '23 reference point due to our strong finish to the year.\nWe are reiterating our key assumptions provided at Investor Day. We expect growth from our generics program with volume growth and consistent market dynamics and positive operational execution against our organic specialty efforts. We are not assuming outsized benefits from branded inflation in contrast to some of the benefits that we did see in fiscal '23.\nOn the Pharma fiscal '24 cadence, we expect the year to follow typical seasonality patterns. As usual, we see our fiscal Q3 being the largest segment profit dollar quarter due to the usual timing of branded manufacturer price increases.\nTurning to Medical. I want to recognize the progress that the Medical team made during fiscal '23, particularly in Q4, and also acknowledge that we still have blocking and tackling to do against the turnaround to both drive demand and improve our cost.\nFor the full year, we are reiterating our assumptions of revenue growth of approximately 3% and segment profit of approximately $400 million for the year while providing some additional color. Like fiscal '23, we anticipate segment profit to be significantly back-half weighted. We expect Q1 to be generally consistent with the core performance from Q4 with quarterly sequential improvements thereafter driven by our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives.\nThere are a couple of factors for why Q1 is the low point in the year. First, keep in mind that Q1 is the seasonal low point for our global Medical products and distribution business due to the timing of volume and cost recognition.\nSecond, while we continue to expect to exit fiscal '24 offsetting the impact of gross inflation, those improvements are expected to grow over time, making the impact greater over the course of the year. And finally, we continue to plan for slight Cardinal Health brand volume growth that will largely hit in the second half of the fiscal year.\nSo in summary for Medical for fiscal year '24, continued work in front of us with each quarter improving from our Q1 launching point to get us to the approximately $400 million guidance for the year.\nStepping back, we are pleased to see growth across our businesses continuing in fiscal '24. Consistent with our messaging from Investor Day, we are targeting a 12% to 14% EPS growth CAGR for fiscal '24 to '26, now from the higher fiscal '23 baseline of $5.79.\nNow regarding our intended deployment of cash, which is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation framework as seen on Slide 18. After investing approximately $500 million back into the business to drive organic growth, making approximately $500 million of litigation payments, including our third payment under the national opioid settlement back in July and our $1 billion baseline return on capital, we expect to have strong flexibility as we assess further investments in the business, M&A and the possibility of incremental return of capital to shareholders.\nI want to reiterate that as we shared at Investor Day, [ neither ] our fiscal '24 guidance or our long-term targets reflect potential opportunistic deployment of capital, including M&A, which is difficult to predict in timing or magnitude or additional share repurchases beyond our $500 million of baseline repurchases each year. We will continue to evaluate both of these levers opportunistically to drive long-term value.\nTo close, the Cardinal team has a lot to be proud of with respect to their accomplishments in fiscal '23. Jason and I are pleased with the progress our teams have made. We are confident in the plans we have in place, and we are excited for our team to realize the significant value creation opportunities still in front of Cardinal Health.\nWith that, I will turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Let's now dive deeper into the actions we are taking to execute our 3 strategic priorities, beginning with priority number one and building upon the resiliency of the Pharma segment.\nIn our largest most significant business, the Pharma segment has been performing well by prioritizing what matters most, focusing on the core and delivering for our customers and their patients. The business is positioned at the forefront of favorable secular industry trends and has also benefited from our specific actions and performance.\nWe are pleased to recently raise our long-term segment profit target to 4% to 6% growth, solidly in the mid-single digits and consistent with the segment profit growth we expect in fiscal '24. Our growth is enabled by a scaled, stable and resilient core Pharmaceutical distribution business growing in the low single digits and double-digit growth from our higher-margin specialty and Nuclear businesses.\nWithin the core, our generics program remains a critical component of our overall offering and performance enabled by Red Oak Sourcing. In addition to its leading scale, Red Oak's proprietary analytical tools and deep industry expertise puts us in the best position possible whenever product [indiscernible] occur to continue servicing customers. We're committed to providing customer-focused solutions across our many classes of trade as we noted at Investor Day.\nMore recently, we hosted our 31st Annual Retail Business Conference, where we brought together nearly 4,500 attendees from across the country to celebrate the critical role independent pharmacies play in caring for their communities and showcase our commitment to our customers through our newest innovations. For example, we are offering modern payment solutions through our collaboration with Square to help independent pharmacies seamlessly manage business operations, integrate flexible payment options and reduce payment processing costs.\nWe've conveyed that specialty is our priority area of focus and a key enabler to our long-term growth. We're continuing to invest to expand downstream across key therapeutic areas such as oncology, rheumatology and other emerging areas.\nWe're excited to build upon our existing capabilities with the recent launch of our Navista Network, a specific suite of offerings for community oncologists, supporting their growth and desire to remain independent. To ensure the Navista Network's success in development, we've recently appointed new leadership with deep industry and clinical experience and continue to build out the organization with internal and external talent.\nWe continue to seek input from customers and have created an advisory board. While still early innings, I'm pleased with the engagement from current and potential customers.\nUpstream in specialty, we're expecting continued double-digit growth from manufacturer services. In our leading 3PL, we're expanding our ambient and cold chain space to keep up with our business' strong growth.\nAt [indiscernible] access and patient support, we delivered on a record number of new client implementations and continue to launch new innovative products to streamline the patient journey. We're also supporting the growth of Pharmaceutical manufacturers in the cell and gene therapy space through our advanced therapy solutions offerings.\nFor example, we're partnering with TrakCel to bring visibility and tracking capabilities to biopharma companies by helping them navigate cell therapies through multiple stages of development and commercialization. Overall in specialty, we're confident that the connection between our downstream and upstream strategies, what we call our specialty growth cycle, will drive double-digit growth well into the future.\nOur Nuclear business, which is on track to double profits by fiscal '26 as of our fiscal '21 baseline, is strategically positioned for growth at the center of precision medicine. We're further investing in the space with a Phase 2 investment of $30 million over the next several years to expand our center for Theranostics advancement and support our manufacturer partners' projects as they advance through the commercial development pipeline.\nWe're encouraged to see Pharmaceutical innovation expanding the breadth of conditions that are being addressed with emerging therapies such as cell and gene and precision medicine. As the future of health care continues to evolve, our breadth of capabilities from Pharmaceutical and specialty distribution, radiopharmaceuticals and Theranostics to biopharma and manufacturer services enables us to offer multiple touch points for manufacturers, providers and patients to realize value from these promising new treatment options.\nNow turning to Medical and priority number two. When we introduced the Medical Improvement Plan last August, our immediate focus was turning around the performance in the core product and distribution, where we've achieved tremendous progress over the past 12 months.\nWe are on track to address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints by the time we exit fiscal '24. This is the #1 key to returning to a more normalized level of profitability, and we are now over halfway to our target.\nWe continue to execute our mitigation initiatives to offset elevated inflation and make progress with our commercial contracting efforts. And we are exploring other offsets with urgency such as our manufacturing excellence and sourcing initiatives.\nWhile overall costs remain elevated, international freight has generally returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we expect this improvement to be reflected in our fiscal '24 results. We're driving significant progress through our 5-point plan to grow Cardinal Health brand volume and seeing improvements in our leading indicators.\nThis includes better portfolio health for key product categories and higher service levels, customer loyalty index scores and retention rates for distribution. We're driving enhanced customer experience through investments in product availability and automation while optimizing costs.\nAt Investor Day, we highlighted our 2-pronged approach to portfolio life cycle management, which has enabled us to completely exit our nonhealth care portfolio. And we are in the process of reducing over 2,000 SKUs across our Cardinal Health Branded product categories to simplify the business.\nWe're focusing our investments in new product development and capacity expansion in key growth areas such as compression, enteral feeding and incontinence. Within our products that are core to distribution, we've seen continued stabilization with PPE, a smaller part of our portfolio but a source of volatility during the pandemic and growth in our presourced surgical [ kitting ] category.\nIn our specialty products portfolio comprised of clinically differentiated products and leading brands like Kangaroo, Kendall and Protexis, we're investing in innovation to meet customers' needs and drive sustainable growth. For example, the launch of our new Kangaroo OMNI Enteral Feeding system this month.\nAs a result of our combined efforts, commercial momentum is accelerating. During Q4, we renewed several key distribution customers and saw positive net new wins during the quarter. These leading indicators give us confidence that moving forward, we'll participate in the growth from an overall improving medical utilization environment.\nOutside the core, we're on track to accelerate our growth businesses. In at-Home Solutions, we're investing in DC network expansion to keep pace with increased demand as care continues to shift into the home.\nFor example, we've recently began construction for a new 350,000 square foot Greenville, South Carolina, DC. This facility, the 11th in our national network, will be fully operational in 18 to 24 months and equipped with advanced automation technology and robotics to drive operational efficiencies.\nIn OptiFreight, we provide premier logistics management powered by our technology capabilities and expertise. We're continuing to invest in digital tools to support core volume growth and sustain our strong performance.\nFinally, we continue to execute our simplification and cost savings initiatives such as optimizing our global manufacturing and supply chain and our international footprint. For example, we exited 4 additional countries and 2 additional manufacturing sites this year. In short, we are making progress with our Medical Improvement Plan. While there is still [indiscernible] in front of us, I'm excited for the business to return to more significant profitability in fiscal '24.\nFinally, priority number three, maximizing shareholder value creation. We're maximizing shareholder value creation through operational performance, robust cash flow generation and the responsible allocation of capital.\nAt Investor Day, Aaron detailed our new long-term capital allocation framework, which builds upon our long-standing priorities with some notable enhancements. We're pleased that with our strong cash flow profile and the significant progress we've made on our balance sheet, we have the flexibility for share repurchases each and every year.\nAnd with the residual cash flow that we anticipate, we'll continue to opportunistically evaluate disciplined M&A in specialty and potential additional share repurchases. While our team has made significant progress over the past year, particularly in realigning our operations for focus and simplicity, there is still work and opportunity in front of us. We continue to evaluate additional value creation initiatives, including the progress we are making with our ongoing business and portfolio review.\nTo wrap up, I want to acknowledge our dedicated Cardinal Health employees who are fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. Thank you for your determination and advancing our key priorities and moving health care forward. I'm excited for the opportunities still to come.\nWith that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. My name is George, I'll be a coordinator for today's event. Please note, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI'd now like to turn the call over to your host today, Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations to begin today's conference. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nGood morning.

For the Q&A portion of today's call, we kindly ask to limit yourself to 1 question so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity.\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we're pleased to deliver another quarter demonstrating progress against our plans with our Q3 results led by continued momentum and growth in the Pharma segment. .\nWith the strong overall performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the rest of the year, we are raising and narrowing our fiscal '23 EPS and adjusted free cash flow guidance. Our Pharma business is a resilient and growing business, where we're well positioned given our critical role in the pharmaceutical supply chain and strong and diverse customer base.\nWe see an ongoing stability in the underlying fundamentals of the business, including consistent market dynamics in our generics program. We've also seen continued broad-based strength in Pharmaceutical demand spanning across product categories and classes of trade. Pharma team is executing our plans to build upon this growth, both in our core distribution operations and in specialty, where we're focused on capturing the increasing demand for specialty products and services.\nIn short, we're pleased with the resiliency and strength of the business and to be able to raise our Pharma outlook for fiscal '23. In Medical, we remain confident in our Medical improvement plan target of at least $650 million of segment profit by fiscal '25 driven by our inflation mitigation and growth initiatives.\nWhile we are making progress with the second consecutive quarter of positive segment profit, we remain focused on taking actions to drive more predictable financial performance in line with this business underlying potential. For several quarters now, we've seen demand for our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products remain generally stagnant, which we reflected in our updated fiscal '23 outlook.\nWe continue to achieve progress with inflation mitigation, the #1 key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. Across Enterprise, we are operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward. We're collectively focused on our 3 key strategic priorities of executing on the Medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value.\nI'll provide some further updates on our continued progress shortly, but first, let me turn it over to Aaron to review our results and updated outlook.\n\nGeorge Robert Hill\n\nMD & Equity Research Analyst, Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division\n\nThank you, Jason. I am pleased to join you this morning on my first call since assuming the CFO role with nearly 90 days now under my belt. What I could see from the outside has proven to be true on the inside. Cardinal Health is a business with a strong leadership team, an engaged Board, a defined strategy, a strong balance sheet and plenty of operational opportunities to promote value creation for our stakeholders.\nI'll begin today with the enterprise strong results for the third quarter. Total revenue increased 13% to $50.5 billion, and gross margin increased 6% to $1.8 billion, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4% to $1.2 billion, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, which were offset in part by our comprehensive enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives.\nOperating earnings of $606 million were 11% higher than the third quarter of last year, driven by significant Pharma segment profit growth with opportunities remaining for us to achieve Medical segment profit increases in future quarters. Moving below the line. Interest and other decreased 32% to $28 million, driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents.\nAs a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates. Our third quarter effective tax rate finished at 22.4%, slightly lower than we had expected, reflecting some positive discrete items in the quarter. Diluted weighted average shares were 258 million, 7% lower than a year ago due to continued share repurchase actions.\nThe net result of the progress against our strategy was adjusted earnings per share of $1.74 in the third quarter, growth of 20% versus the prior year. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with strong liquidity with $4 billion of cash on hand. The business generated robust adjusted free cash flow of $1.3 billion in the third quarter. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow is $2.1 billion.\nGiven our cash balances, we ended the period with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities. And in further support of our strong investment-grade rating, during the quarter, we paid down $550 million of maturing March 2023 notes with cash on hand, consistent with our plans. We also extended our $2 billion revolver of backup liquidity until February of 2028.\nEarlier in my remarks, I referenced return of capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we returned $378 million to shareholders through a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program and payment of our long-standing dividend. Year-to-date, we've returned $1.5 billion through share repurchase and made nearly $400 million in dividend payments.\nNow I will cover our segment performance, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 14% to $47 billion, driven by brand and specialty pharmaceutical sales growth from existing customers. We saw strong broad-based Pharmaceutical demand particularly from our largest customers. GLP-1 medications also provided a revenue tailwind in the quarter.\nPharma segment profit increased 23% to $600 million. We were pleased to see that this progress was driven by both positive generic program results, including volume and mix and by a higher contribution from brand and specialty products. Within our generics program, we continue to see consistent market dynamics and strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing.\nWith regards to branded and specialty products, the higher realization reflects a modest benefit from manufacturer price increases. As a reminder, while over 95% of our overall branded margin is derived from fixed fee-for-service agreements, the contingent portion is highly concentrated in our fiscal third quarter.\nMoving to the key growth area of specialty. We've seen strong double-digit growth across specialty distribution, along with our upstream manufacturer services. Our nuclear business, which is tracking ahead of plan, continued its double-digit growth, including benefiting from recent launches of novel Theranostics.\nWithin our Pharmaceutical supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the incremental inflationary cost pressures seen industry-wide. And in the third quarter, these net impacts were not material on a year-over-year basis.\nFinally, in the quarter, we lapped more significant opioid-related legal costs and higher costs related to the now completed ERP technology enhancements. Now turning to Medical on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue decreased 5% to $3.7 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to expected PPE volume and price declines.\nMedical segment profit decreased 66% versus prior year to $20 million, primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and unfavorable sales mix. Additionally, these results reflect both net unfavorable nonrecurring adjustments, including simplification actions and some modest year-over-year improvements in PPE margins.\nSimilar to Q2, we observed normalized PPE margins in the third quarter. Regarding the demand environment, we've previously discussed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution list, including Cardinal Health brand, in the quarter, volumes for our Cardinal Health brand products were roughly flat sequentially.\nWe achieved inflation mitigation of over 40% driven by our continued efforts. We also saw benefits from our ongoing cost savings initiatives such as in our manufacturing and supply chain. Now for our updated fiscal '23 outlook, beginning on Slide 8. Our team is working hard, and we are seeing positive results in key parts of our portfolio.\nAs we move into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance range from $5.20 to $5.50 and two, a new range of $5.60 to $5.80. At the midpoint, this represents a $0.35 increase and 13% year-over-year growth.\nThis update primarily reflects an improved outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment for the year as well as a more modest short-term outlook for Medical. While we will save commentary or updates on long-term segment guidance for our upcoming Investor Day on June 8, we are showing today that we are reaffirming the long-term financial guidance in the medical improvement plan for the Medical segment.\nWe are also updating some key enterprise-wide assumptions as seen on Slide 8. Based on year-to-date performance, we now expect interest and other in the range of $95 million to $105 million, a non-GAAP ETR of approximately 22% to 23% for the year and adjusted free cash flow generation of $2 billion to $2.3 billion for the year. We expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding in the range of 262 million to 263 million, reflecting our year-to-date repurchase activity and continued expectation of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '23.\nFinally, we now expect capital expenditures of approximately $450 million, reflecting the timing of our continued investment to drive organic growth. Turning to the segments on Slide 9. In Pharma, with the strong Pharmaceutical demand and performance that we've seen to date, we now expect full year revenue growth in the range of 14% to 15% and segment profit growth between 10.5% to 12% growth.\nWe are extremely pleased with the ongoing resiliency and strength of the business and our plans to drive double-digit profit growth in fiscal year '23. Yet when looking at the more normalized performance of the Pharma business, it's important to note our fiscal '23 outlook includes 2 nonrecurring year-over-year tailwinds.\nFirst, as noted, we experienced a modest benefit from branded manufacturer price increases in fiscal year '23 that we assume is unlikely to repeat in future years. Additionally, relative to the prior year comparisons, our previous fiscal year '23 guidance assumed offsetting year-over-year impacts in total between several nonrecurring drivers, higher-than-usual inflationary supply chain costs, lower opioid-related legal costs and lower cost for technology enhancements compared to fiscal year '22.\nHowever, we now expect the in-year comparison to fiscal year '22 for these items to produce a modest year-over-year tailwind unique to fiscal year '23. We will provide insights into our long-term targets for Pharma during our Investor Day, including some early guidance for fiscal year '24.\nTurning to Medical. We now expect a revenue decline of approximately 6% and a segment profit decline of approximately 50% for the year. This updated outlook reflects 3 key changes. First, third quarter actual results, as I've already discussed; second, updated assumptions around Cardinal Health brand volumes, namely that we will see relatively consistent demand patterns for the remainder of the fiscal year. Third, delayed realization of lower costs, which we have previously incurred primarily related to international freight.\nBased on our updated volume expectations, we now expect some of the previously anticipated fourth quarter improvements in the P&L to shift into fiscal '24. As a reminder, on the cost side, we've seen significant improvement in incurred international freight costs, which are capitalized into inventory on our balance sheet. These costs are then recognized in our P&L results on a delay as we sell through products. We continue to have strong line of sight into this eventual benefit. However, due to timing the impact to our fourth quarter results will be more modest than previously assumed.\nImportantly, we continue to expect to exit the year offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, the approximate $60 million sequential improvement in Medical segment profit embedded in our guidance primarily reflects the combination of 3 items. First, the normalization from the nonrecurring adjustments from Q3; second, continued improvements and progress on our mitigation initiatives, including the benefit from the previously incurred international freight costs; third, and to a lesser extent, normal seasonality improvements in the fourth quarter.\nSo in financial summary, an excellent financial quarter overall are raised the guidance with opportunities still in front of us. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Tenneco, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now a few key updates on our 3 strategic priorities for fiscal '23: first, executing our medical improvement plan initiatives. We remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints and I'm pleased with our continued incremental progress on this critical front. We've now mitigated over 40% of the gross impact to our business through our mitigation initiatives. .\nThis includes widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories. Supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and our focus on other offset opportunities such as additional sourcing efficiencies. We continue to work collaboratively with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions on our path to fully mitigating this headwind and by the time we exit fiscal '24 through these collective actions.\nBy taking a transparent approach, we are also advancing our recontracting efforts, successfully adjusting long-term product contracts as they renew and including language that allows for greater future flexibility. While costs generally remain significantly elevated relative to pre-pandemic levels, we've seen a stabilization across most areas, along with improvement in international freight.\nWe believe we are now past peak overall cost levels as the improved international freight costs will begin to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. We remain committed to our mitigation efforts as highlighted earlier. To drive growth outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio, accelerating our growth businesses and driving simplification and continued cost optimization.\nAs Aaron indicated, Demand for our Cardinal Health brand products has remained generally stagnant over the first 3 quarters of fiscal '23. We believe market demand will improve in fiscal '24 and '25, coinciding with our ongoing initiatives to increase product availability drive new product innovation and implement other commercial improvements. As an example of product innovation, we recently unveiled the new Kangaroo omni Entralfeeding platform at the Aspen Congress.\nOmni is the only enteral pump player to accurately deliver feed formula and is designed to meet enteral feeding needs from the hospital to home and to seat end of life. Omni has received very positive feedback from both clinicians and patients generating excitement for the launch in early fiscal '24.\nOutside of U.S. product and distribution, we're driving growth in other key areas of the segment. At Home Solutions, Medical Services, including OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark and international products and distribution. For example, in at-Home Solutions, we are expanding our footprint to match the sustained growth of home health care we are seeing in the industry and our business.\nOur new Central Ohio distribution center is now operational. This new location is the next step in supporting our growth strategy and will be equipped with systems and automation capabilities to improve safety, service and operational efficiencies.\nA new audited storage and retrieval system will increase throughput and capacity and ideal technology for At-home solutions facilities that are primarily focused on direct-to-patient fulfillment. In OptiFreight Logistics, we are tolerating our growth as a leader in tech-enabled logistics management by driving best-in-class customer experience and continually diversifying our product offerings.\nAnd we continue to take action to drive simplification across our Medical business by optimizing our distribution and global supply chain network and through our active approach to product life cycle management. Next, in Pharma, we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of the business. We are privileged to serve and partner with a broad customer base, providing essential health care services in their respective communities, including leaders in retail pharmacy, mail order grocery and health systems among the many classes of trade.\nWe support our customers by bringing significant scale and leading offerings to market, including our comprehensive generics program anchored by the capabilities of Rail outsourcing. The key pace, the strong and resilient demand we are seeing from our customers, we continue to focus on strengthening our core operations by continually developing customer-focused solutions and investing in new technologies across our supply chain.\nOur goal is to continue providing innovative tools that address the unique challenges of our customers while unlocking value and further efficiencies across our distribution supply chain. We're also prioritizing the area of specialty through our actions and investments. Our new organizational design is driving efficiencies and further effectiveness, enabling us to move quicker and better prioritize the needs of our customers and manufacturer partners.\nDownstream, we've seen continued double-digit growth across specialty distribution, including in health systems and alternative care. And in the physician office channel, our acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their MSO continues to drive a differentiated engagement model for rheumatologists through our expanded capabilities.\nUpstream with biopharma manufacturers, we again saw double-digit growth for manufacturer services in the third quarter. Our leading specialty 3PL continues to win new business, including in the area of cell and gene therapy. Through Q3, we supported 27 product launches with double-digit launches anticipated in the fourth quarter. And in our nuclear business, we're seeing a growing demand pipeline for our center for Theranostics advancement in Indianapolis.\nWe've seen strong volumes from recent Theranostics launches, such as radiopharmaceutical supporting prostate-specific PET imaging. With the continued success of the business, combined with the innovation that's occurring in the space, we continue to be excited about this very promising area.\nAnd lastly, a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. We have placed a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders. This is evident through our plans to return over $2 billion to shareholders in fiscal '23 through dividends and share repurchases.\nWe will continue to pursue opportunities for additional shareholder value creation. Our management team has made significant progress in realigning our operations to drive focus and simplicity. Our work is ongoing, and we continue to work through a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations with the support of our Board and the business review committee. Given the importance of this work today, we announced that the Board has extended the term of the committee for an additional year through July 15, 2024, and we have also extended the term of the cooperation agreement with Elliot.\nWe are very much looking forward to our upcoming Investor Day on June 8 in New York City and the opportunity to further articulate why we believe Cardinal Health is well positioned for long-term success and our plans to maximize shareholder value. Among other topics, we plan to detail our growth strategies and provide updates on our long-term outlook, capital allocation framework and the ongoing business and portfolio review.\nBefore I conclude, I want to thank our Cardinal Health employees who are advancing our key strategic priorities and fulfilling our essential role in health care, serving customers and their patients. While there's still work to do, I am encouraged by our team's continued progress and excited about our future opportunities. With that, we will take your questions."

Please note, this call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI will now hand over to your host, Mr. Kevin Moran, VP of Investor Relations, to begin today's conference.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVP of IR, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2023 results, along with updates to our full-year outlook. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nJoining me today are Jason Hollar, our Chief Executive Officer; Trish English, our Interim Chief Financial Officer; and Aaron Alt, who will take over as our Chief Financial Officer beginning February 10.\nDuring the call, we'll be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties. Please note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis unless they are specifically called out GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedules attached to our press release.\nDuring the Q&A portion of today's call, we please ask to limit yourself to one question so that we can try and give everyone in the queue an opportunity. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Before we dive in, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Aaron Alt to Cardinal Health as our incoming Chief Financial Officer. We're excited to have Aaron on board. He brings a breadth of financial and operational experience to our organization, including a background in distribution and he's already hit the ground running in his first few weeks.\nI'm confident he will be a valuable addition as the leader of our finance organization, contributor to our executive committee and a seamless fit with our company culture.\n\nAaron Alt\n\nThank you, Jason. Good morning. I am excited to be part of the team here at Cardinal, particularly at such an important time not only for our company but for the entire health care industry. What attracted me to Cardinal Health was the broad portfolio, the overall culture and the leadership team that is motivated to win. While still early days for me, I can already tell that while there's work to do, Jason and the team have a plan and there are significant opportunities for value creation in front of us.\nI look forward to interacting with all of you further in the weeks and months to come as I continue to ramp up.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Aaron. Now let's begin with some high-level perspectives on the second quarter. Overall, our Q2 results demonstrated continued momentum against our plans. In Pharma, we've seen ongoing stability in the macro trends and underlying fundamentals of the business. In the quarter, we saw particular strength in overall pharmaceutical demand, and strong performance from our Generics program. We've seen an increase in contributions from Specialty products, which is a key strategic area of focus. And we continue to effectively manage through the inflationary headwinds affecting industry supply chains.\nIn short, Q2 was another data point that Pharma is a resilient and growing business. In Medical, we remain highly focused on our medical improvement plan initiatives. Overall, despite some puts and takes, Medical's Q2 results were consistent with our prior commentary, and we were pleased to see a return to profitability in the quarter. We continue to take actions to drive more predictable financial performance, in line with this business' underlying potential. At an enterprise level, we continue to see benefits below the operating line from our capital deployment actions and favorable capital structure. With the first half of fiscal '23 behind us, we are pleased to raise our full year EPS guidance and outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment.\nOur team remains focused on executing our 3 key strategic priorities of executing on the medical improvement plan, building on the growth and resiliency of the Pharmaceutical segment and maintaining a relentless focus on maximizing shareholder value. I will update you on these priorities in a few moments. Before I turn it over to Trish to review our results from the quarter and revised outlook, I'd like to thank her for stepping in as interim CFO over the past 6 months. Trish has brought leadership and continuity to the organization and will be instrumental in ensuring a seamless transition with Aaron. Thanks, Trish.\n\nPatricia M. English\n\nSenior VP & Interim CFO, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jason, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin today with our consolidated second quarter results. Total company revenue increased 13% and gross margin increased 3%, both driven by the Pharma segment. Consolidated SG&A increased 4%, primarily reflecting inflationary supply chain costs. Benefits from our enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives offset some of this increase. Operating earnings of $467 million were in line with the second quarter of last year. This reflects growth in Pharma segment profit, offset by the decline in Medical segment profit, which was anticipated. Moving below the line, Interest and Others decreased nearly 30% to $18 million, driven primarily by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates.\nOur second quarter effective tax rate finished at 23%, approximately 3.5 percentage points higher than prior year, primarily due to net positive discrete items in the prior year period. Diluted weighted average shares were $263 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. In the second quarter, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program and initiated a new $250 million program, resulting in a total of $1.25 billion deployed year-to-date. We continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases in fiscal '23, which reflects our continued focus on maximizing shareholder value.\nThe net result for the quarter was earnings per share growth of 4% to $1.32. Now turning to the balance sheet. We generated second quarter adjusted free cash flow of $439 million, bringing year-to-date adjusted free cash flow to $781 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.7 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility. As a reminder, we continue to expect to pay down the $550 million of March 2023 notes at maturity with cash on hand. Now I will cover our segment performance, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5.\nSecond quarter revenue increased 15% to $48 billion, driven by brand and Specialty Pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new customers. Pharma segment profit increased 9% to $464 million. This was driven by a higher contribution from Branded Specialty Products and Generics program performance, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs. During the quarter, we saw strong overall pharmaceutical demand, including from our largest customers, reflecting their strength in the market. To a lesser extent, we also saw year-over-year contributions from the net new customers that we've previously mentioned and a more robust seasonality with cough, cold and flu products as others have noted.\nRegarding our Generics program, we are pleased with the solid execution and consistent market dynamics we continue to see. This includes strong performance from Red Oak Sourcing, not only controlling costs, but also in maximizing service delivery for our customers. Within our supply chain, we continue to effectively manage through the industry-wide inflationary costs being in the areas of transportation and labor. In the second quarter, these inflationary impacts were generally consistent with our expectations. Similar to last quarter, this headwind was offset by year-over-year tailwinds from our complete ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs.\nOkay. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter decreased 7% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, including PPE pricing and volumes. Continued strong growth in our at-Home Solutions business partially offset this decline. Medical segment profit finished in line with our prior commentary, decreasing 66% to $17 million. This was primarily due to lower products and distribution volumes and net inflationary impact, partially offset by an improvement in PPE margin. During the quarter, the net impact from inflation was in line with our expectations, and we achieved inflation mitigation of over 30%.\nThis sequential improvement from the first quarter was driven by the continued acceleration of our mitigant efforts, including the implementation of additional product pricing actions in the quarter. On our last 2 earnings calls, we have discussed overall volume softness in our products and distribution business. In the second quarter, we saw generally consistent overall volume on a sequential basis, including our Cardinal Health brand products. With respect to PPE, we did see some slight improvement in volumes on a sequential basis. Additionally, we made significant progress in selling through our higher cost inventory on our balance sheet, leading to normalized PPE margins in the quarter.\nNow for our updated fiscal '23 outlook beginning on Slide 8. We are raising our EPS guidance by $0.15 at the lower end and $0.10 at the higher end to a new range of $5.20 to $5.50, which represents 6% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This update reflects improved outlook for the Pharmaceutical segment and for Interest and Other. We now expect Interest and Other in the range of $115 million to $130 million, with the improvement primarily driven by the increased interest income on cash and equivalents. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on Slide 8 remain unchanged. Turning to Slide 9 in the Pharmaceutical segment. We are raising our outlook for revenue to a new range of 13% to 15% growth and for segment profit to a new range of 4% to 6.5% growth, both of which primarily reflect our strong first half performance.\nAs we look to the second half in Pharma, we anticipate the year-over-year profit growth to be fairly balanced between the third and fourth quarter. Turning to Medical, we continue to expect a revenue decline of 3% to 6% and segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%. With respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, we continue to expect a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal '23 or minimal year-over-year impact. On the cost side, while still at elevated levels, we've seen a general stabilization across most areas, along with improvement in international freight. As a reminder, the product costs are capitalized into inventory and in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate 2-quarter delay. Importantly, we continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation.\nAnd finally, no changes to the expected cadence of Medical segment profit. We continue to expect segment profit to improve sequentially and be particularly weighted towards the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around the net impact of inflation and to a lesser extent, a gradual improvement in overall volumes and the continued implementation of our cost savings measures.\nFor the enterprise, a key factor continues to be the overall utilization and demand environment. In Pharma, we expect continued strength in overall pharmaceutical demand in the second half, albeit at a more moderate rate than we've seen to date. In medical, we expect a gradual improvement in overall volumes, including with Cardinal Health brand. Therefore, if the trends from the first half of the year continue, we would anticipate segment profit more towards the upper end of our range in the Pharma segment and more towards the lower end of our range in the Medical segment.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Trish. Let me now provide a few updates on our 3 key strategic priorities for fiscal '23. First, executing our medical improvement plan Initiatives. Importantly, we remain on track with our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints, the #1 key to returning the business to a more normalized level of profitability. I am pleased with the incremental progress achieved in the second quarter, as we mitigated over 30% of the growth impact to our business in Q2.\nTaking a step back, over the past 9 months, we have made a series of widespread temporary price increases across nearly all of our Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also executed supplier distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and continue to explore other opportunities for further offset with urgency. We will continue to monitor cost trends and work with our industry partners to make pricing adjustments that are reflective of current market conditions. As we have taken a transparent approach working collaboratively with our partners, we continue to make progress on this front by successfully adjusting product contracts as they renew.\nWe are also including language that allows for greater flexibility to respond to future macroeconomic dynamics. We continue to expect to exit the year with a run rate of at least 50% inflation mitigation and to fully mitigate inflation by the end of fiscal '24. Outside our mitigation actions, we are focused on optimizing and growing our Cardinal Health brand portfolio. As Trish indicated, the market demand environment in Medical has been relatively stagnant over the last couple of quarters. Additionally, some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand categories remain underpenetrated, which we are addressing through targeted investments to increase product availability, new product innovation and a continual focus on commercial excellence.\nFor example, we recently expanded our sustainable technologies manufacturing facility in Riverview, Florida, doubling the size to roughly 100,000 square feet. This facility will enable us to better meet increasing demand for single-use device collections, reprocessing and recycling services, supporting future growth while also delivering supply resiliency, sustainable solutions and cost savings for customers. We are also investing to accelerate our growth businesses, primarily at-Home Solutions, where we've seen strong growth fueled by the secular trend of care shifting into the home.\nOur new Central Ohio distribution center equipped with robotics and automation technology will be fully operational soon as we continue to expand our footprint to match the sustained growth of home health care we are seeing in the industry and our business. And in our higher-margin medical services business, OptiFreight Logistics, recently expanded its offerings with total view tracking, a new capability offering health care providers real-time shipment tracking to enhance supply chain visibility and resiliency.\nSecond, moving to the Pharma segment, where we're building upon the growth and the resiliency of business, we're focused on executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily specialty. In the first couple of months, we've already seen efficiency and effectiveness gains from our recently combined pharmaceutical and specialty distribution organization. We've seen strong growth across specialty distribution, including within acute health systems and alternate care. Additionally, our recent acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their managed services organization has been positively received by customers. Part of the recent segment organizational changes, we also created a new sourcing and manufacturer services organization, enabling a more holistic approach to enhance our strong pharmaceutical manufacturer partnerships.\nThis includes strategic sourcing along with the high demand area of manufacturer services. In Q2, we saw double-digit growth from manufacturer services, where we continue to invest to build upon our capabilities, such as our leading specialty 3PL and Sonexus, our access and patient support portal. And in the area of cell and gene therapy, we are excited about the work we are doing in this emerging space across all of our service offerings expanding our capabilities and the opportunities we see in the future. We are investing in automation and enhancing technology across our supply chain today in order to drive operational productivity for the future.\nWe're striving to deliver a flawless end-to-end customer experience, supporting our strong and diverse customer base. For example, our recently announced collaboration with Palantir will offer customers a solution that connects diagnostic and clinical data with real-time purchasing and consumption data. By leveraging AI and machine learning, our customers will be empowered to make better purchasing and inventory management decisions for their businesses and patients. We are privileged to serve and partner with leaders across the various classes of trade, such as retail pharmacy chains, mail order and grocery as well as retail independence, long-term care and health systems, all of whom provide essential health care access for their respective communities.\nAnd lastly, a brief update regarding our relentless focus on shareholder value creation. In addition to the shareholder value creation initiatives, we've already announced, such as our governance enhancements and simplification actions, we continue to place a strong emphasis on responsible capital deployment, including the return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases. Our business review committee continues to work through a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. We plan to hold an Investor Day on June 8 in New York City, where among other topics, we will provide an update on our company's long-term financial outlook, detail our growth strategies and share any relevant conclusions from the ongoing review.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to touch on our new ESG report, which was released just last week. This expanded report outlines the steps we are taking to operate in a more sustainable and equitable world through our established ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. We continue to make progress against our long-term targets and are committed to regularly updating our stakeholders. We believe that we can simultaneously drive ESG improvements in support of our ongoing business transformation.\nIn closing, while there remains work to do, I'm encouraged by our team's progress to date and excited about the opportunities ahead. I want to thank our dedicated Cardinal Health employees who are driving the execution of these critical priorities and who keep our customers and their patients at the center of everything they do. With that, we will take your questions."

Today's call is being recorded.\nI will now hand the call over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVP of IR, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome.

Hollar\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Now that I've had a couple of months to settle into the CEO role, I'm feeling even more energized and excited about the opportunities in front of us. By recent conversations with customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders have reinforced my perceptions that our company's role in health care and our mission to improve the lives of people every day remain as critical as ever. Our customers and their patients rely on us to deliver the right products to the right places at the right time. And yet, there's also a collective recognition of the need for simplification, focused execution and clarification of our company's strategic direction.\nOur goal today, along with reviewing our recent results is to summarize the key near-term priorities and progress to date on our plans, which I will discuss later in my remarks. However, before I turn it over to Trish, let me share some initial perspective on the first quarter.\nOverall, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued stable fundamentals in our largest business and tangible progress in medical.\nIn Pharma, we tracked slightly ahead of our expectations as we delivered growth while managing industry-wide inflationary headwinds. We are encouraged by the ongoing stability in prescription volumes and strong performance of our Generics program. In Medical, the quarter's results were also a little better than expectations we announced in September.\nWhile I'm pleased with our team's efforts in the quarter to achieve these results, there is more work to be done to drive better, more predictable financial performance in line with the underlying potential of this business. We are highly focused on executing our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives, which I'll cover in greater detail later in my remarks.\nAcross the company, our team is operating with urgency to drive our businesses forward and committed to creating value for our shareholders.\nNow I'll turn it over to Trish to dive deeper into our results and outlook.\n\nPatricia M. English\n\nSenior VP, CAO & Interim CFO, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. It's great to speak with you all. Today, I'll share details on 3 areas of focus. Our consolidated first quarter results, the key drivers underlying our segment's performance and our updated fiscal '23 outlook before turning it back to Jason for final remarks.\nFirst quarter total company revenue increased 13%, driven by Pharma segment sales growth. Gross margin decreased 2% to $1.6 billion due to net inflationary impact in medical and one month impact of the Cordis divestiture, partially offset by our Pharma Generics program performance. Consolidated SG&A increased 7%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs and other operating expenses such as higher costs to support Pharma sales growth. This increase was partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives. Operating earnings decreased 20% to $423 million reflecting the decline in Medical segment profit, primarily due to net inflationary impact and partially offset by growth in Pharma segment profit.\nNow moving below the line. Interest and Other decreased 25% to $27 million, primarily driven by increased interest income from cash and equivalents. As a reminder, our debt is largely fixed rate, resulting in a net benefit from rising interest rates.\nOur first quarter effective tax rate finished at 16.9%, approximately 7 percentage points lower than prior year due to certain favorable discrete items. Diluted weighted average shares were $273 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. We are focused on balanced disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital deployment and in mid-September, we initiated a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we expect to complete in the second quarter. The net result for the quarter was earnings per share of $1.20.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. We generated first quarter operating cash flow of approximately $25 million. This includes total litigation payments of approximately $390 million, primarily consisting of the second payment under the national opioid settlement. Adjusted free cash flow in our first quarter was $342 million. We ended the period with a cash position of $3.5 billion with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility.\nNow turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. First quarter revenue increased 15% to $46 billion driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Pharma segment profit increased 6% to $431 million, driven by Generic program performance and a higher contribution from Brand and Specialty products, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs.\nDuring the quarter, we were pleased to see strong execution and continued consistent market dynamics in our Generics program, including Red Oak. As we've previously noted, inflation continues to impact supply chain costs across the industry, particularly within transportation and labor. We saw an approximate $20 million year-over-year headwind from these areas, which was consistent with our expectations. This headwind was effectively offset by year-over-year tailwind on from our completed ERP technology enhancements and lower opioid-related legal costs.\nOkay. Turning to Medical on Slide 6. First quarter revenue decreased 9% to $3.8 billion, driven by lower products and distribution sales, primarily due to PPE pricing and volumes, and to a lesser extent, the Cordis divestiture. Continued strong growth in our at-Home Solutions business offset some of this revenue decline. Medical segment loss of $8 million was due to net inflationary impact in products and distribution as well as a lower contribution from PPE, both of which I will discuss in more detail. Importantly, these results reflect approximately $20 million in total inventory charges related to our previously announced simplification actions. This includes the sale of our gloves portfolio that is primarily utilized in non-health care industries.\nAs a reminder, this noncore product line has been a source of volatility and distraction in recent years. These actions, despite the onetime costs are an example of our ongoing commitment to strengthening the medical product and distribution business through simplification.\nDuring the quarter, the growth impact incremental inflation in our products and distribution business was in line with our expectations of approximately $150 million, and we successfully achieved our inflation mitigation target of 25%. Our mitigation efforts have continued to accelerate, most notably with the implementation of the second wave of product pricing actions in July. Jason will elaborate on our plans for further mitigation shortly.\nNow a quick update on the overall utilization environment. We've previously noticed some overall volume softness in our products and distribution business including a lower demand for PPE, which we believe primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels. In the first quarter, we saw generally consistent overall products and distribution volumes sequentially, including with PPE. While we do anticipate gradual improvement in volumes relative to these recent lows, we continue to expect choppiness in demand levels going forward.\nNow for our fiscal '23 outlook, beginning on Slide 8. We are reiterating our EPS guidance of $5.05 to $5.40. This includes our updated medical segment outlook, which has been adjusted for the impact of simplification actions in the first quarter and a few below-the-line improvement. Based on the first quarter performance, we are confident in lowering the top end of the ranges for interest and other, our effective tax rate and diluted weighted average shares for the fiscal year. We now expect I&O in the range of $140 million to $160 million, an ETR between 23% and 24% and diluted shares between $262 million to $264 million. Our expectations for the remaining items listed on Slide 8 remain unchanged.\nWe are also reiterating our fiscal '23 outlook for the Pharma segment seen on Slide 9. We continue to expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14% and segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5%. Before transitioning to medical, 2 key call-outs on the Pharma cadence. First, with stronger start to the year, we now expect more balanced year-over-year profit growth between the first and second half of fiscal '23. And specifically, for the second quarter, we expect segment profit dollars to be similar to the first quarter.\nNow turning to Medical. We expect segment profit ranging from flat to a decline of 20%, which, as I indicated, reflects the impact of the simplification actions in the first quarter.\nWith respect to inflation and our mitigation actions, there is no change to our expectation of a net impact of approximately $300 million in fiscal '23 or a minimal year-over-year impact. The macroeconomic environment remains dynamic. And while we've seen some decreases in spot rates of certain cost drivers such as international freight, other areas such as commodity costs remain significantly elevated. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized into inventory. And in the current environment of elongated supply chain reflected in our P&L results on an approximate 2-quarter delay.\nWhile we now expect growth inflation in the second quarter to be similar to what was seen in Q1, we are implementing additional actions and working proactively to mitigate these pressures. It's important to note that we continue to expect that as we exit the year, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the growth impact from inflation.\nOn Medical's quarterly cadence, in Q2, we expect similar segment profit dollars since the first quarter, excluding the impact of the first quarter simplification actions.\nAs we have noted before, we continue to expect a substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal '23 and particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, inflation mitigation and PPE.\nWith that, I'll now turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Trish. I concluded our August earnings call with 3 key takeaways that I'd like to provide updates on: number one, improving the underlying performance of the Medical segment through our Medical Improvement Plan initiatives. The key driver to achieving our segment profit target of at least $650 million by fiscal '25 is our mitigation actions for inflation and global supply chain constraints. Though elevated inflation has persisted in the macro environment for longer than expected, we are on track to exit fiscal '23 offsetting at least 50% of the gross impact on our business.\nAs I previously mentioned, we plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal '24. Our third wave of price increases went into effect on October 1 and we are planning additional actions for the third quarter.\nTo date, we have adjusted product categories representing nearly 90% of U.S. Cardinal Health brand sales, excluding PPE. Additionally, we successfully adjusted language in product contracts as they've renewed to allow for greater pricing flexibility to respond to macroeconomic dynamics. We've also executed distribution fee increases to offset higher transportation, labor and fuel costs and continue to explore other opportunities for further offsets with urgency.\nOutside of our mitigation actions, we expect the largest contributor to our growth to be our ability to optimize and grow our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio. This will be achieved through new product innovation and increased product availability as a result of targeted investments.\nAdditionally, I'm confident in our ability to optimize our cost structure and our sourcing and manufacturing footprints as we focus on driving simplification across the medical organization. The team is energized by the goals we have laid out in the medical improvement plan and has already hit the ground running on execution.\nMoving to item #2, for the Pharma business, continuing to build upon the growth and the resiliency that we've seen by executing in the core and accelerating our growth areas, primarily Specialty. Similarly, continuing on talent and leadership, we are excited by the appointment of Debbie Weitzman to CEO of the Pharma segment. Debbie has a deep understanding of our industry landscape, long-standing and strong relationships with our customers and a proven track record as a commercial and operations leader across her 17 years at Cardinal Health. Debbie's deployment was part of our recently announced segment restructuring designed to reduce complexity, drive productivity and efficiency gains, and simplify how our customers and our manufacturing partners to do business with us.\nThese changes are intended to maximize the strength of our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty businesses bringing together similar services under one team, enabling us to respond faster and more effectively to changes in the health care landscape while keeping the customer at the center of everything we do. Simply, it is allowing us to reposition with both the right talent and organizational design.\nIn Specialty, we have a robust service offering both downstream with providers and upstream with biopharma manufacturers and we continue to build upon our capabilities. In the area of oncology, we've expanded our best-in-class offering for value-based care, the Navista TS, which will continue to serve as a vital resource for oncologists transitioning to the new CMS enhancing oncology model.\nIn rheumatology, we've closed on our recent tuck-in acquisition of the Bank Care GPO and our investment in our managed services organization has expanded our capabilities in the space and contributed to new customer growth. In just 30 days, this cross-functional leadership team worked diligently to onboard over 250 health care providers onto our distribution and logistics platforms.\nWith biosimilars, we remain well positioned to distribute and provide the surrounding services as they come to market, particularly in the new therapeutic areas and sites of care. We continue to expect increased contributions from biosimilars in fiscal '23 and beyond.\nUpstream and Specialty, our third-party logistics business continues its strong growth with more than double the launches in the first quarter compared to a year ago as well as double-digit new contract wins. And our continued investment towards the digital transformation of our Sonexus access and patient support business has enabled us to realize benefits from new business wins and expansion of existing clients.\nAnd finally, number three, a relentless focus on shareholder value creation. This includes maximizing sustainable, profitable growth and cash flow generation as well as a return of capital to shareholders. We continue to expect strong and resilient cash flow generation supporting our capital allocation priorities. We are prioritizing organic growth, deploying CapEx to the highest value projects. We've made tremendous progress in reducing our long-term debt, which has created additional flexibility for shareholder returns.\nWe were pleased to initiate the $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter and continue to expect $1.5 billion to $2 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '23, in addition to our ongoing dividend of over $500 million annually.\nBeyond these actions, we also announced enhancements to our governance structure, including 4 new independent Board members and a new business review committee, task was supporting a comprehensive review of our company's strategy, portfolio, capital allocation framework and operations. Our business review committee, which I chair, has already held multiple meetings and is working through the detailed review covering every business. We expect to share conclusions publicly at an Investor Day in the first half of calendar 2023.\nIn closing, I recognize there is still a lot to accomplish, yet I remain excited about these opportunities to drive growth. I believe that our resilient business model, robust operating cash flow generation, favorable capital structure and capital allocation flexibility differentiates us in this time of macroeconomic uncertainty, and I am confident in our future. Before we open up to Q&A, I do want to spend a moment thanking our dedicated team around the globe.\nWe've had a number of opportunities to connect with them across the last couple of months and is truly a privilege to lead every day. They are driving the execution of the initiatives that we've discussed to date to deliver for our shareholders, for our customers and for their patients, and we are very much looking forward to the opportunities that remain ahead.\nWith that, we will take your questions."

Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVP of IR, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's fourth quarter and year-end fiscal 2022 results, along with our outlook for fiscal year 2023. You can find today's press release and earnings presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nJoining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer; and Trish English, Chief Accounting Officer.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a full description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during our discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in schedule attached to our press release. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Kaufmann\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As I am sure many of you have seen, a short time ago, we issued a press release, announcing that I am stepping down as CEO and as a board member of Cardinal Health, but will continue to serve through August 31. Effective September 1, Jason will become Cardinal's new CEO. He has also been appointed as a board member effective today.\nThey say timing is everything, and I believe as we start a new fiscal year, the time is right for me to step away as CEO and open the door for a new leader to take Cardinal Health forward over the coming years. I have been blessed to be part of the Cardinal Health family for 32 years. In that time, I've seen our company grow and evolve in many ways. We are truly essential to care, and I'm honored to have been part of it. Jason has been a tremendous partner over the past 2-plus years and has been instrumental in many of our strategic initiatives. He deeply understands our business, priorities and industry landscape, and the Board and I are confident that he is the right person for the job.\nWith that, I would like to turn the call over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCFO, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike. I really appreciate the kind words and the opportunity to work closely with you these past few years. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be taking on this new responsibility. I am grateful for the trust and the confidence the Board of Directors is placing in me.\nI would also like to thank you, Mike, for the leadership and the many contributions to the company over the years. I hope to preserve the culture that you've helped ingrain into the fabric of our organization, and I look forward to what I know will be a smooth transition. I also want to welcome Trish English, who will be serving as our Interim Chief Financial Officer. Trish most recently served as our Chief Accounting Officer and has been a valuable member of the Cardinal Health family for over 16 years. I look forward to continuing to work with her in this new capacity while we conduct an external search for a permanent CFO.\nBefore stepping into the details of our financial performance for the quarter, let me step back and summarize the key points this past year. Within our pharma segment, while we experienced the effects of industry-wide inflation and incurred incremental technology investments, we grew the business 5%, consistent with both our original guidance for the year as well as our long-term growth targets.\nThe Medical business was more significantly impacted by these inflationary dynamics, which drove a significant impact on our results. However, we have strong mitigation actions in place, including pricing and will present a plan to you today that mitigates all of the inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts, plus an additional 8% of compounded annual growth by fiscal '25.\nUnderlying these operating results this past year was a significant focus on cash flow, which results in increased financial flexibility. We are absolutely focused on shareholder value and intend to deploy these incremental funds to additional share repurchases for fiscal '23. While we remain in a dynamic environment, I'm excited to share further details of our plans with you today and commit to continue to provide increased clarity to the drivers and the key metrics underlying our performance.\nSo let's now turn to some of the details driving our results in the fourth quarter, beginning with the pharma segment on Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue increased 13% to $43 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new PD and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 26% to $451 million, driven by generics program performance and a higher contribution from brand sales mix, partially offset by inflationary supply chain costs.\nAs we've previously noted, this also reflects a favorable comparison due to the prior year inventory adjustments. During the quarter, our generics program, including Red Oak, saw strong performance and continued to experience consistent market dynamics. Regarding the inflationary supply chain costs, we saw impacts in areas such as transportation and labor, which we expect to continue into next year. We also incurred higher cost supporting sales growth. And with ongoing progress in opioid litigation matters, we saw a decrease of approximately $15 million in opioid-related legal costs.\nTurning to Medical on Slide 7. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 11% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes. Medical segment loss of $16 million in the fourth quarter was due to net inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints and products and distribution. On a year-over-year basis, the favorable comparison to the prior year of $197 million PPE inventory reserve was mostly offset by the net inflationary and global supply chain constraint impacts, a lower contribution from PPE and the Cordis divestiture.\nDuring the quarter, our products and distribution business saw an approximate $100 million impact from net incremental inflation and supply chain constraints. This reflects a gross impact of approximately $125 million and approximate $25 million offset from our mitigation actions, which includes our initial wave of price increases on 5 Cardinal Health brand categories that went into effect back in March. I'll elaborate on our plans for further mitigation in fiscal '23 and beyond shortly.\nAs mentioned, it continues to be a highly dynamic medical environment, and our Q4 results came in lower than we had previously expected. This primarily reflects overall volume softness in our products and distribution business, including a lower contribution from PPE.\nStepping back, demand for PPE has fluctuated significantly over the past couple of years. We saw lower volumes as we exited Q3, and the fourth quarter experienced further declines. We believe this primarily reflects customers' higher inventory levels and, to a lesser extent, some PPE category-specific customer losses driven by supply constraints during the pandemic. We continue to have strong conviction in our overall value proposition, which includes leading brands and clinically differentiated products. For context, PPE represents approximately 15% of sales in our overall Cardinal Health brand portfolio, as you'll see on Slide 20.\nMoving below line. Interest and other increased by $36 million to $64 million due to a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan investments compared to gains in the prior year. As a reminder, deferred compensation gains or losses reported in interest and other are fully offsetting corporate SG&A and net neutral to our bottom line. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, a onetime write-down of an equity investment impacted EPS by $0.06 per share. The increase in other expense was partially offset by lower interest due to debt reduction actions. As indicated, we repaid the $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity. Our fourth quarter effective tax rate finished at 25.4%, approximately 3 percentage points higher than the prior year. The net result was fourth quarter EPS of $1.05, an increase of 36%, primarily reflecting the growth in pharma segment profit.\nNow transitioning to our consolidated results for the year. Fiscal '22 revenues increased 12% to $181 billion, driven by the pharma segment. Gross margin decreased 3% to $6.5 billion due to the Cordis divestiture. Total company SG&A increased 1%, reflecting inflationary supply chain costs, our previously mentioned IT investments and higher costs to support sales growth, mostly offset by the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives.\nOperating earnings decreased 12%, which primarily reflects a year-over-year headwind of approximately $300 million related to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in Medical, partially offset by pharma segment profit growth. Interest and other increased 24% to $165 million, largely due to the items affecting the fourth quarter. Of note, this came in higher than our guidance primarily due to equity investment write-down in the quarter. Our annual effective tax rate finished at 22.1%. The net result was fiscal '22 EPS of $5.06.\nNow turning to the balance sheet. In fiscal '22, we generated robust operating cash flow of $3.1 billion. This includes the previously defined tax refund of nearly $1 billion and favorable timing of working capital. Additionally, in fiscal '22, we made approximately $500 million in litigation payments, primarily related to opioid settlements. In July, we made our second annual payment under the national opioid settlement agreement of approximately $375 million, which will be reflected in Q1 fiscal '23 operating cash flow. We are focused on deploying capital in a balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner. This year, we invested approximately $385 million of CapEx back into the business to drive future growth, paid down approximately $850 million in debt to reduce leverage and returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We ended the year with a cash position of $4.7 billion, which does reflect some timing favorability with no outstanding borrowings on our credit facilities.\nAs for the segment's full year results, beginning with pharma on Slide 10. Pharma revenue increased 14% to $165 billion, reflecting consistent drivers with the fourth quarter. Pharma segment profit increased 5% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by generics program performance and an improvement in volumes compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by investments in technology enhancements and inflationary supply chain costs. To be helpful, the tailwind from improved volumes and the headwind from incremental IT investments effectively offset in fiscal '22, each approximately $80 million on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, we saw an approximate $50 million headwind from inflationary supply chain costs, primarily in the second half of the year.\nMoving to Medical on Slide 11. Fiscal '22 Medical revenue decreased 5% to $15.9 billion, primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. To a lesser extent, lower products and distribution volumes were partially offset by growth in at-Home Solutions. Segment profit decreased 63% to $216 million, primarily due to the net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. Additionally, the favorable comparison to the prior year PPE inventory reserve was offset by a lower contribution from PPE and the divestiture of the Cordis business.\nNow for our fiscal '23 guidance on Slide 13. We expect earnings per share in the range of $5.05 to $5.40, which reflects the following assumptions. First, for the enterprise, we expect interest and other between $140 million to $170 million, which assumes approximately $550 million in debt paydown for the March 2023 notes at/or before maturity. We are assuming a non-GAAP effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 25%. We anticipate diluted weighted average shares outstanding between 262 million and 266 million, reflecting our plan to complete between $1.5 billion to $2 billion in share repurchases over the course of the year. And supporting our capital allocation priorities, we expect adjusted free cash flow in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion, which excludes litigation payments and any other significant and unusual or nonrecurring items.\nAs for the segments, beginning with pharma on Slide 14. We expect revenue growth in the range of 10% to 14%, driven by growth in existing and net new PD and specialty customers. We expect segment profit growth in the range of 2% to 5% based on the following key assumptions. We expect continued stability in overall pharmaceutical volumes along with consistent market dynamics within our generics program. Continuation of the inflationary supply chain costs we've seen in the last 2 quarters should result in approximate $50 million headwind primarily in the first half of the year. The completion of ERP technology enhancements should be an approximate $30 million tailwind. We expect opioid-related legal costs, including initial costs for implementation of the settlement injunctive relief terms of approximately $80 million in fiscal '23, a $20 million tailwind. And we see increased contributions from our growth areas, primarily specialty, including biosimilars.\nBefore moving to Medical, a couple of points from the pharma fiscal '23 themes. Similar to last year, we expect the year-over-year segment profit growth to be significantly back-half weighted, which primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of inflationary supply chain costs in the first half. Specifically, in the first quarter of next year, we expect segment profit between $400 million and $420 million. While we do not typically provide quarterly guidance, we thought additional color may be helpful given the puts and takes over the last several quarters.\nNow turning to Medical on Slide 15. We expect revenue to decline in the range of 3% to 6% due to lower PPE sales and lab testing volumes. We expect segment profit ranging from a decline of 10% to growth of 10%, reflecting the following assumptions. We expect a similar net impact of approximately $300 million from inflation, global supply chain constraints and mitigation actions in fiscal '23 or a minimal impact on a year-over-year basis. This assumes an approximate $475 million gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints, partially offset by $175 million of mitigation actions, including pricing and evolving our commercial contracting.\nWhile still significantly elevated relative to historical levels, we're encouraged by the recent improvements in spot rates of certain cost drivers such as international freight and some commodities. As a reminder, these product costs are capitalized and have historically been reflected in our P&L results on a 1 to 2 quarter delay. However, in the current period of elongated supply chains, it is closer to 2 quarters. Our current assumption is that the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints will peak in the first quarter of fiscal '23 and gradually decrease over the next couple of years.\nAdditionally, along with the pricing actions that went into effect at the start of the year, we are implementing additional ways of increases over the course of fiscal '23. We continue to expect that as we exit fiscal '23, the run rate of our mitigation actions will offset at least 50% of the gross impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints.\nIn terms of other key assumptions for Medical in fiscal '23. As the operating environment continues to normalize, we expect an approximate $50 million tailwind from an improvement in PPE margins. We plan to sell-through the majority of higher-cost PPE in the first half of the year and for PPE margins to normalize as we exit the year. We expect the PPE tailwind to be offset by a similar headwind from lower lab testing volumes. We also anticipate a headwind of approximately $50 million from re-baseline incentive compensation following fiscal '22 underperformance. And finally, we expect increased contributions from our strategic growth areas, primarily at-Home Solutions.\nOn Medical's quarterly cadence, while we are assuming a similar segment profit total in fiscal '23 versus fiscal '22, we do expect the cadence to be the reverse of the prior year. Specifically, in the first quarter, we expect segment profit ranging from a loss of $20 million to profit of $20 million. We expect the gross impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints in the first quarter to be approximately $150 million, with approximately 25% of this offset through our mitigation actions.\nAs for the rest of the year, we expect a substantial majority of segment profit to come in the second half of fiscal '23, particularly in the fourth quarter. This sequencing primarily reflects our assumptions around inflation, global supply chain constraints, inflation mitigation and PPE. While there are many moving parts in fiscal '23, we are confident in our long-term outlook and are reiterating our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield over longer normalized periods. Additionally, we are introducing a new target for at least $650 million in Medical segment profit by fiscal '25, driven by the Medical Improvement Plan that we are introducing today.\nSlide 17 highlights our 4 areas of focus to improve Medical performance. Number one, mitigate inflation and global supply chain constraints. We plan to fully address the impact of inflation and global supply chain constraints through mitigation initiatives by the time we exit fiscal '24 and are targeting to exit fiscal '23 offsetting at least half of the gross impact on our business. Our second wave of price increases went into effect on July 1 on 4 more categories, and we plan on the next wave commencing on October 1. In addition, we've executed distribution fee increases for certain suppliers, and we are actively working with customers and GPOs to adjust language in our product and distribution contracts as they renew, allowing for greater price flexibility to respond to current and future macroeconomic dynamics.\nTwo, optimize and grow the Cardinal Health brand portfolio. Our $4.6 billion Cardinal Health brand portfolio, which includes nearly $4 billion of non-PPE categories, offers leading brands and clinically differentiated products. We plan to grow Cardinal Health brand sales by a compounded annual growth rate of at least 3%, which will generate $75 million or more of incremental segment profit over the next 3 years.\nThis growth will be achieved through 2 key areas of focus. First, R&D and new product innovation. We see opportunities in key categories such as nutritional delivery, where we will be launching the next-generation Kangaroo enteral feeding platform. Second is increased product availability as a result of investments within targeted categories such as surgical gloves and electrodes. For example, in our surgical glove portfolio, we are investing $125 million for construction of a new manufacturing facility dedicated to increase supply for a leading Protexis brand gloves. Third area of focus is to accelerate our growth businesses, primarily at-Home Solutions. These businesses have growth rates in excess of our core, along with a higher margin opportunity, and we've been making investments to drive at least $60 million of total segment profit by fiscal '25.\nAt-Home Solutions, for example, is now a $2.4 billion business that has consistently grown top line at around 10% as patient care continues to shift into the home. And finally, our fourth area of focus is to continue our simplification and cost optimization efforts. We expect actions that increase productivity in our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, supply chain and back office to yield at least $50 million of net cost savings by fiscal '25.\nGoing forward, we are focused on driving simplification through value improvement projects, transportation management and further optimizing our sourcing and manufacturing footprint where possible. We expect these initiatives to contribute towards exceeding our existing enterprise $750 million cost savings goal by fiscal '23. While on the topic of our supply chain, let me take a moment to share some additional color where we have received a number of investor questions. We operate a highly diverse global supply chain with approximately 2/3 of our Cardinal Health brand revenue coming from self-manufactured products.\nWe have invested in additional self-manufacturing capabilities, many in our own North American facilities. And today, approximately half of our Cardinal Health brand revenue comes from North America in total. To best serve our customers, we continue to believe in the importance of a diverse global supply chain, and we are focused on responding to any global supply chain disruptions with resilience and agility. In summary, we believe the introduction of measurable proof points in each of these 4 areas of focus provides visibility to measure progress against our plans going forward.\nNow let's turn to the Pharmaceutical segment where we continue to focus on strengthening our core PV business and investing in our growth businesses, primarily specialty. In pharma distribution, with our significant technology enhancements that we've been working on over the past several years substantially completed, we now focus our attention on increasing productivity, maximizing working capital efficiency and prioritizing the customer experience. With our generics program anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak, we continue to further enhance our capabilities as we focus on share of wallet and maximizing margins. We recently held our Retail Business Conference where over 4,000 customers attended live for the first time in 3 years and had an opportunity to see and experience our latest innovations. We also had the chance to register for services that would help them create an online shopping portal, advisory support to optimize reimbursement and central fill compliance packaging services.\nIn specialty, we are continuing to see downstream momentum in oncology and emerging therapeutic areas driven by our offerings, including Navista TS. We recently announced a tuck-in acquisition of the Bendcare GPO and investment in their managed services organization. These will further strengthen Specialty Solutions' Cornerstone Rheumatology GPO, which offers innovative office management solutions and robust specialty drug access to over 1,300 rheumatology providers nationwide.\nUpstream with biopharma manufacturers, we are investing for future growth in our 3PL business as evidenced through our cold chain storage expansion, which increases our current capacity by 200%. We also continue to see strong growth in Sonexus, our patient hub where our technology solutions help biopharma customers remove barriers to patient care.\nAnd with biosimilars, we are proactively addressing common barriers to adoption by investing in education campaigns to build awareness, clinical comfort and ensure accessibility. We continue to be excited about the future growth in the space and remain well positioned as new biosimilars come to market.\nIn closing, while there's a lot of work to be done, I'm excited to work with our 44,000 teammates in executing our plans to grow in fiscal '23 and beyond. With that, I will now take your questions."

Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVP of IR, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nGood morning. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's third quarter fiscal 2022 results, along with date to our FY '22 outlook. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com.\nJoining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements.

(Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Kaufmann\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. As we continue to manage through the current macroeconomic environment, we remain focused on both near-term priority and long-term strategies to drive growth and momentum across our businesses. At an enterprise level, we're maintaining our focus on our 3 strategic priorities: optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth in innovation and deploying capital efficiently.\nIn Pharma, despite the quarter being a little lower due to higher operations costs, we remain encouraged by the trajectory of the business. We saw resiliency in overall pharmaceutical demand, strong performance in our generics program and continue to expect Pharma to realize mid-single-digit profit growth in FY '22.\nIn Medical, our core U.S. medical products and distribution business continued to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints. We continue to take action to mitigate the effects of these global challenges on our business, including taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies and investing in additional supply chain capacity.\nWhile we remain confident these actions will deliver value and are encouraged by the other areas of our Medical business and our opportunities for long-term growth, the current environment remains highly dynamic. Our updated outlook for FY '22 reflects our most current expectation. I'll elaborate on the actions we're taking to drive performance, particularly in Medical, after Jason reviews our third quarter results and updated outlook.\nBefore turning the discussion over to Jason, it's important to note that the opioid settlement agreement was finalized during the quarter and became effective on April 2. This is an important and significant step forward for our company. We feel this settlement is the best way to deliver relief to communities across the United States and allow our company to move forward by putting thousands of lawsuits behind us. 46 of 49 eligible states, all 6 eligible territories and over 98% of litigating political subdivisions are part of the national agreement.\nThis comprehensive agreement will settle the vast majority of the opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities. Additionally, we recently reached an agreement with the state of Washington and its participating subdivisions to resolve opioid-related claims on similar terms to the broader settlement, bringing the total number of states, with which we have settled, to 47 out of 49.\nWhile these settlements do not cover all opioid-related claims, these comprehensive agreements are a significant milestone toward achieving broad resolution of governmental opioid claims and included injunctive release terms designed in part to increase transparency to the supply chain for these products and demonstrate our commitment to the safety of the pharmaceutical supply chain.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Jason.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCFO, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.\nBeginning with total company results, third quarter revenue increased 14% to $45 billion, driven by sales growth from existing and net new Pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.7 billion, a decrease of 7% due to the elevated supply chain costs in Medical and the Cordis divestiture, partially offset by generics program performance.\nConsolidated SG&A increased 2% to $1.1 billion, reflecting higher operations expenses and previously anticipated IT investments, partially offset by the Cordis divestiture and cost savings initiatives. Third quarter operating earnings decreased 21% to $545 million, primarily reflecting the elevated supply chain costs in Medical.\nMoving below the line, interest and other increased by $8 billion, which reflects onetime gains in other income in the prior year, partially offset by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. Our third quarter effective tax rate finished at 20.1%, 11 percentage points lower than the prior year due to certain discrete items affecting both periods.\nAverage diluted shares outstanding were 277 million, 6% lower than a year ago due to share repurchases. During the quarter, we initiated a $200 million share repurchase program, which was completed in April and brings our year-to-date repurchases to $1 billion. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.45, a decline of 5%.\nIn the quarter, we also recorded a $474 million noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge reflects an increase in the discount rate used in our goodwill impairment analysis. Third quarter operating cash flow was a use of $419 million, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $2.4 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities.\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, in addition to expecting strong operating cash flow generation, we received a previously defined tax receivable of approximately $1 billion in April. Timing, including the day of the week in which any period ends, affects point-in-time cash flows, and fiscal '22 is unfavorably affected by this dynamic. Additionally, we expect approximately $550 million in total litigation payments this year, primarily related to opioid settlement, which includes the initial payment for the National Settlement already made.\nNow turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 17% to $41 billion, driven by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from existing and net new Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty customers. Segment profit decreased 5% to $487 million, driven by higher operations expenses and previously anticipated investments in technology enhancements, partially offset by generics program performance.\nDuring the quarter, we incurred higher costs supporting sales growth, including some initial customer onboarding costs and inflationary impacts in areas like transportation and labor. Importantly, we also completed the launch of our planned technology enhancements. As Mike mentioned, we continue to see resiliency in pharmaceutical demand. And our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics, including a strong performance from Red Oak.\nTurning to Medical on Slide 6. Third quarter revenue decreased 7% to $3.9 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business and lower products and distribution volumes, which includes the impact of global supply chain constraints. Segment profit decreased 66% to $59 million, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution.\nDuring the quarter, our U.S. Medical products and distribution business continued to experience significant inflationary impacts across the global supply chain, particularly in the areas of international and domestic transportation and commodities. Additionally, increased pressures from global supply chain constraints affected the volume of some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products.\nTo a lesser extent, the third quarter decline in segment profit also reflected a lower contribution from PPE as well as the Cordis divestiture. On PPE, we saw unfavorable price/cost timing in the quarter as well as lower volumes as we exited the quarter. We were encouraged, however, by the resiliency in surgical product demand related to elective procedures, which was generally consistent with recent quarters and improved from a year ago.\nAnd we continue to see strong performance from our lab business. We continue to take action to address the inflationary cost challenges and manage through the temporary supply disruptions, including pricing adjustments, cutting costs throughout the organization and investing in our supply chain network, which Mike will elaborate on momentarily.\nNow transitioning to our updated fiscal '22 outlook on Slide 8. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.25 per share, reflecting updated expectations for Medical and a few of our corporate assumptions. With the favorability seen to date from discrete items, we now expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%.\nWe expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding of approximately 281 million, which reflects the $1 billion in share repurchases completed to date. And with 1 quarter to go, we expect CapEx of approximately $400 million. We continue to expect interest and other in the range of $140 million to $160 million.\nAs for the segments on Slide 9, for Pharma, no changes to our outlook. We continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth, mid-single-digit segment profit growth and, as previously indicated, strong fourth quarter segment profit growth.\nWith the culmination of our planned technology enhancements, we will now be lapping elevated expense levels from the initial deployment a year ago, which has been a year-over-year headwind the last several quarters. We are also lapping a few onetime items that we called out last year, which will create a favorable fourth quarter comparison. And we expect strong underlying performance in the quarter.\nFor Medical, we now expect revenue at the low end of our previous range, down mid-single digits, and segment profit to be down 45% to 55% in fiscal '22, which includes a net incremental headwind of nearly $300 million due to inflationary and global supply chain constraints. Additionally, based on volume trends, the update from our previous Medical outlook primarily reflects a lower contribution from PPE.\nNow let me spend some time sharing a few high-level thoughts on fiscal '23 from our vantage point today, ahead of providing our usual guidance in early August. In Pharma, the business is tracking consistent with our long-term target of low to mid-single-digit segment profit growth. With respect to a couple of other notable Pharma puts and takes for next year, we do anticipate higher operations expenses based on increasing inflationary trends, particularly in the first half of the fiscal year.\nAdditionally, with the finalization of the global opioid settlement, we anticipate lower opioid-related legal costs, partially offset by higher costs for implementation of the settlement's injunctive relief terms. Together, we expect these litigation items to be a modest net tailwind in fiscal '23. For reference, we are currently estimating opioid-related legal costs of approximately [$150] million in fiscal '22. We expect a further reduction in opioid-related legal costs in subsequent years.\nIn Medical, we are highly focused on the inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints affecting our U.S. Medical products and distribution business. At this time, we expect a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 as in fiscal '22.\nEmbedded in this are 2 key assumptions. First, with visibility generally limited to the first half of the year, we are assuming key cost drivers, such as international freight and commodities, have flattened and will begin to decrease slowly over the course of the next fiscal year, affecting our results on a 1 to 2 quarter delay. This would result in a greater absolute impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints in fiscal '23 due to the annualization of higher costs into the second half of fiscal '22.\nSecond, we also expect a greater impact from mitigation initiatives with various ways of price increases going into effect throughout the year. In total, these 2 assumptions result in a similar to modestly higher net impact from inflation and global supply chain constraints as in the current year.\nAs we exit fiscal '23, we anticipate a run rate where our pricing actions will offset approximately half of the gross impact. Though these inflationary impacts are persisting for much longer than originally anticipated, we remain committed to mitigating the effects in our medical business over time. We continue to believe the majority of these impacts will prove temporary once global supply chain pressures eventually abate or pricing will adjust accordingly.\nBelow the line, we anticipate a year-over-year headwind in our fiscal '23 effective tax rate, with the discrete favorability seen in fiscal '22 not expected to repeat. And with our strong balance sheet, we see the potential for accretive capital deployment through a similar level of share repurchases over the course of the year, supported by the $2.7 billion of authorization remaining on our existing share repurchase program expiring at the end of 2024.\nIn summary, while there's obviously moving parts for fiscal '23 or any particular year, we continue to believe our previously announced long-term targets for our businesses and for double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield are achievable over normalized longer periods.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Kaufmann\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. Let me elaborate on the actions we are taking to drive medical performance and maximize our differentiated strengths.\nFirst, we're taking pricing actions, evolving our commercial contracting strategies and focusing on driving mix across our global business. We have implemented a series of initial customer price increases on 9 Cardinal Health brand product categories. We've also implemented fee increases for certain medical national brand suppliers to offset some of the elevated supply chain costs.\nWe provide the most efficient and effective way for manufacturers to reach our customers and believe these increases help compensate us for the increased cost of providing this value. We have and will continue to be transparent and fair with customers and suppliers and focused on delivering on our service. As it relates to our products and distribution contracts, we are focusing on future pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control.\nTo drive changes in mix, we're investing in new and innovative products to increase the breadth of our Cardinal Health brand product portfolio. One example of increased breadth is our recent launch of the first surgical incise drape using Avery Dennison's patented BeneHold CHG adhesive, which reduces risk of surgical site contamination, yet still removes easily after surgery without harming a patient's skin.\nAnother example is our recently announced collaboration with Innara Health, the industry leader in feeding development for newborns and premature infants, to design Innara's next-generation NTrainer System, making it smaller, more intuitive and easier to integrate into NICU feeding protocols.\nWe are also investing to increase supply capacity, particularly within our Protexis surgical glove line, where we have increased our existing capacity by over 30%, with a focus on long-term growth. We expect to invest over $125 million to expand our manufacturing footprint with the construction of a new facility dedicated to increase supply of our Protexis brand gloves and drive innovation in this important product portfolio.\nSecond, we are simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. A year ago, we announced our intention to exit 36 markets, and those exits are now complete. We have also decided to exit another 10 markets, where we see limited opportunity for long-term growth. Once complete, these actions will reduce our international commercial footprint by 50%, allowing us to focus on approximately 45 remaining markets where we are best positioned to serve.\nWe are also optimizing our distribution network by consolidating less-efficient facilities into larger, modern, more efficient distribution centers to deliver improved service to our customers. For example, we recently announced plans to build a new approximately 600,000-square foot medical distribution center in Central Ohio, replacing a smaller facility nearby. This new facility, along with others we have planned, will improve service and quality, deliver operational efficiencies and better support fluctuations in volume and labor.\nAdditionally, our lab business is consolidating manufacturing and warehouse space into a new larger 100,000-square foot facility. This move centralizes our high-growth Lab Kitting Services and support significant expansion of our direct-to-consumer kitting capabilities.\nThird, in addition to investing in our core medical business, we continue to invest in our growth businesses, at-Home Solutions and Medical Services, which are aligned with industry trends. In at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continues to shift into the home.\nWe recently partnered with Kinaxis to optimize digital supply chain planning, increase medical product visibility and supply chain agility. We're focusing initial implementation of Kinaxis' Rapid Response platform with at-Home Solutions, with an expected completion date this summer.\nFurthermore, we've invested in a new warehouse management system across our at-Home Solutions network, which we expect to roll out next week. This new infrastructure will improve labor planning based on demand, increase operating efficiencies to deliver on our commitments and streamline and standardize processes across our at-Home network.\nWe're initiating a multiyear strategy to grow our warehouse footprint for at-Home Solutions and target markets, and we'll announce details for a new warehouse opening later this calendar year. And in our higher-margin, technology-enabled Medical Services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we've invested in additional technology capabilities to expand our offerings in both businesses.\nTurning to Pharma. We continue to make progress on our 2 primary objectives: first, strengthening our core Pharma distribution business. We have completed all deployments of our multiyear investment to modernize our Pharmaceutical IT infrastructure in order to standardize operations, drive efficiencies and enhance the customer experience.\nThese investments, including the automation of business procedures and real-time line of sight transparency for our employees and customers, will result in operational efficiencies and a more connected Pharmaceutical distribution supply chain. We expect to benefit from the conversion in FY '23 and beyond.\nSecond, we're fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. In Specialty, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business, driven in part by Navista TS, our technology platform for value-based care. In March, we further expanded our Navista TS offering with the launch of Decision Path, a digital solution to help oncology practices lower cost, improve patient care and drive success in transitioning to value-based care.\nCreated by Fuse, our internal innovation engine, Decision Path is built into electronic health record workflow allowing oncologists to easily compare cancer treatment options, both by clinical indication and cost at the point of care. And with biosimilars, we are well positioned to support the next phase of growth over the next several years as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas and sites of care.\nWe believe the next phase of growth in the biosimilars market will predominantly come from products with a greater retail or specialty pharmacy presence. As more retail products with interchangeability come to market, our significant scale and capabilities designed to support retail pharmacies uniquely positions us to support and empower those pharmacies as they navigate the important operational complexities of managing multiple biosimilar launches against major reference products.\nOur Sonexus digital services portal offers tailored solutions to help patients get on and stay on therapy. Patients who interact with our Sonexus portal experience shorter time to therapy for new patients and no gaps in therapy for existing patients. Digital re-enrollment via the patient portal increased approvals within the first 30 days by 10% and delivered a retention rate greater than 90%.\nIn our third-party logistics business, we have won 66 manufactured contracts this fiscal year. So far, we have successfully launched 27 manufacturers, and we expect 5 to 8 additional launches by the end of the fiscal year. And specific to cell and gene therapy, we continue to win opportunities and have plans to launch 5 manufacturers in the coming years based on FDA approval and manufacturer readiness.\nIn Nuclear, we continue to see the benefits of our investments in Theranostics. Our Center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis continues to be in high demand, with a number of new innovators and products we are collaborating with doubling in FY '22 versus the prior year.\nOur Outcomes business continues to add new payers, PBMs, pharmaceutical manufacturers and expand clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chain. We have combined our Reimbursement Consulting Solutions and Outcomes Connect platforms into a single unified platform that offers reimbursement assistance, physician support and scheduling to identify and complete clinical opportunities.\nAcross the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing these cost reduction efforts with balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital allocation according to our priorities. Looking ahead, we're confident in our ability to achieve our long-term targets.\nNow let me give a little color on injunctive relief as part of the national opioid settlement. Injunctive relief relates to controlled substance anti-diversion efforts and includes enhancements to governance, independence and training of personnel, due diligence for new and existing customers, ordering limits for certain products and suspicious order monitoring.\nIn addition, we and the 2 other settling distributors will engage a third-party vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting, which the distributors will fund for 10 years. These relief measures are intended to create additional transparency. And while there is additional cost, these initiatives demonstrate our commitment to being part of the solution to the U.S. opioid epidemic.\nIn closing, what we do matters. We aspire to be health care's most trusted partner by delivering the products and solutions our customers need, advancing health care and improving lives.\nAnd now, Jason and I will take your questions."

Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nAt this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Kevin Moran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nKevin Moran\n\nVP of IR, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nGood morning, and welcome. Today, we will discuss Cardinal Health's second quarter fiscal 2022 results along with an update to our FY '22 outlook. You can find today's press release and presentation on the IR section of our website at ir.cardinalhealth.com. Joining me today are Mike Kaufmann, Chief Executive Officer; and Jason Hollar, Chief Financial Officer.\nDuring the call, we will be making forward-looking statements. The matters addressed in the statements are subject to the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied. Please refer to our SEC filings and the forward-looking statement slide at the beginning of our presentation for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nPlease note that during the discussion today, our comments will be on a non-GAAP basis, unless they are specifically called out as GAAP. GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations for all relevant periods can be found in the schedule attached to our press release. (Operator Instructions)\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Kaufmann\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. Today, Jason's and my comments will be consistent with the update we provided a few weeks ago.\nLet me start with a few high-level thoughts. At an enterprise level, we continue to focus our efforts on 3 strategic priorities: optimizing our core businesses, investing for growth and innovation and deploying capital efficiently. We continue to believe the long-term targets we announced in November are appropriate, and we remain on track to meet our $750 million enterprise cost savings target by FY '23.\nOur pharma business is performing as planned. We've seen volumes continue to improve sequentially, and we are encouraged by the growth we saw again in Q2. Looking ahead, we continue to expect pharma to realize mid-single-digit growth in FY '22.\nIn our Medical segment, we continue to experience unprecedented inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in our core U.S. medical and products distribution business. These impacts, combined with lower-than-expected offsets from pricing actions, will significantly impact Medical segment profit consistent with our update a few weeks ago. While we believe these impacts are temporary, the timing of when they will abate remains difficult to predict.\nConsequently, we are urgently working to mitigate the effect of these external macroeconomic challenges on our business. We are seeing progress in other areas of the Medical segment including our lab business and growth areas, and we recently extended several key acute care distribution customers.\nLooking ahead, I'll elaborate on the actions we are taking to drive performance, particularly for Medical, after Jason reviews our Q2 results and updated outlook.\n\nJason M. Hollar\n\nCFO, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Beginning with total company results, second quarter revenue increased 9% to $45 billion, driven by sales growth from existing pharma customers. Total gross margin was $1.6 billion, a decrease of 9%, primarily due to the Cordis divestiture and elevated supply chain costs in Medical. Consolidated SG&A was flat to the prior year at $1.2 billion, as the Cordis divestiture and benefits from cost savings initiatives offset IT investments and higher operations expenses. Second quarter operating earnings were $467 million. Outside of the incremental inflationary impacts in Medical, these results were generally in line with our expectations.\nMoving below line, Interest and Other decreased by 30% to $24 million driven primarily by lower interest expense from debt reduction actions. Our second quarter effective tax rate finished at 19.4%, 6 percentage points higher than the prior year due to certain discrete items, which primarily benefited the prior year period. Additionally, our second quarter rate this year included some timing favorability.\nAverage diluted shares outstanding were 281 million, 5% lower than the prior year due to share repurchases. Of note, we initiated a $300 million share repurchase program in the quarter, which was recently completed and brings our total year-to-date repurchases to $800 million. The net result for the quarter was EPS of $1.27.\nSecond quarter operating cash flow was strong at $1.2 billion. As a reminder, the day of the week in which the quarter ends affects point-in-time cash flows. We ended the quarter with a cash about $3.2 billion and no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities. In the quarter, we also recorded a $1.3 billion noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge related to the Medical segment, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. This accounting charge primarily resulted from additional inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints I will discuss shortly.\nNow turning to the segments, beginning with Pharma on Slide 5. Revenue increased 11% to $41 billion, driven primarily by branded pharmaceutical sales growth from large pharmaceutical distribution and specialty customers. Segment profit increased 3% to $426 million, driven by generic program performance. This was partially offset by our previously discussed investments in technology enhancements and higher operations expenses, including costs supporting sales growth, such as transportation and labor.\nDuring the quarter, we were encouraged to see continued broad-based improvements in pharmaceutical demand consistent with our expectations, including a return of generics volumes to approximately prepandemic levels. Our generics program continued to experience generally consistent market dynamics, including continued strong performance from Red Oak. Outside of generics, we've seen brand inflation trending in line with our expectations.\nTurning to Medical on Slide 6. Second quarter revenue decreased 5% to $4.1 billion, primarily due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. Segment profit decreased 79% to $50 million, primarily due to inflationary impacts and global supply chain constraints in products and distribution. This also reflects the timing of selling higher-cost PPE, including the net positive impact from this dynamic in the prior year and to a lesser extent, the divestiture of the Cordis business.\nDuring the quarter, our products and distribution business continued to be impacted by significant inflationary pressures in the global supply chain, primarily in the areas of polypropylene and international freight. Additionally, in the quarter, we saw broader inflationary impacts across the business, such as domestic freight and other commodities as well as global supply chain constraints affecting the volume of some of our higher-margin Cardinal Health brand products. I'll discuss these impacts with respect to our full year medical outlook momentarily, and Mike will elaborate on the actions we are taking to address these macro challenges and drive performance in our core medical business.\nWith respect to COVID-19 and the Omicron variant, we continue to see strong performance from our lab business, including significant testing demand generally consistent with levels seen a year ago. And despite some impacts from Omicron in various geographies, demand for surgical products related to elective procedures was comparable to both the first quarter and prior year.\nNow transitioning to our updated fiscal '22 outlook on Slide 8. We now expect EPS in the range of $5.15 to $5.50 per share, primarily reflecting our updated expectations for Medical. We also now expect an annual effective tax rate in the range of 23% to 24.5% and Interest and Other in the range of $140 million to $160 million, with the improvement in I&O, including deferred compensation arise, which, as a reminder, is fully offset above the line in corporate SG&A.\nAs for the segments on Slide 9, for pharma, no changes to our outlook. We continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit segment profit growth. For Medical, we now expect revenue to be down low single to mid-single digits and segment profit to be down 30% to 45%.\nConsistent with the financial update provided a few weeks ago, we expect increased inflationary impacts on global supply chain constraints as well as lower-than-expected pricing offsets to result in an estimated incremental $150 million to $175 million headwind to Medical segment profit for the full year. This, in addition to our November 9 update regarding the pressures in international freight and polypropylene, now reflects a total net incremental headwind of approximately $250 million to $300 million to Medical in fiscal '22.\nWhile these impacts have persisted for longer than previously anticipated, we continue to believe the majority will be temporary as global supply chain pressures eventually abate. While it will take time, we are committed to mitigating the impacts of inflationary pressures, and we'll continue to work through these dynamics with our customers.\nNow a few other things to keep in mind in terms of the fiscal '22 cadence. For Pharma, we expect the year-over-year growth in the back half to be heavily weighted to the fourth quarter due to lapping of some prior year items, including higher cost for the deployment of IT investments and the general sequencing of our growth initiatives.\nIn Medical, we continue to expect an unfavorable year-over-year impact due to timing of selling higher-cost PPE in the second half of fiscal '22, though not to the same magnitude as in the second quarter. We also will be lapping the large prior year PPE inventory reserve in the fourth quarter.\nFinally, to close, a few reminders on capital deployment. We continue to expect to pay down the approximate $280 million of remaining June 2022 notes at maturity and continue to expect approximately $1 billion in total share repurchases in fiscal '22. As we said, we see our increasing balance sheet flexibility supporting more opportunistic return of capital to shareholders as our debt paydown begins to moderate, enabled by a recent $3 billion share repurchase authorization. We continue to believe that capital deployment, along with the future growth that we expect in both our segments, will drive the long-term, double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield that we are targeting.\nWith that, I'll turn it back over to Mike.\n\nMichael C. Kaufmann\n\nCEO & Director, Cardinal Health, Inc.\n\nThanks, Jason. In Medical, we're continuing to take action to drive performance and maximize the differentiated strengths we have in this business. We are vertically integrated with distribution through our comprehensive medical products portfolio, which is generally oriented around the operating room and the Intensive Care Unit. We also have an advantaged lab products portfolio and higher-margin growth businesses. With our diverse customer base, we cross-sell products and services spanning our portfolio.\nTo address the challenges in our medical business, we're focused on 3 things: first, evolving our commercial contracting strategies and driving mix. Historically, costs have been relatively stable and industry participants have committed to longer-term multiyear contracts. However, the rapid escalation of today's inflationary pressures demonstrate that our contracting strategy needs to change. We are in the process of working with our customers to adjust certain contracts to ensure we have more pricing flexibility for factors beyond our control.\nWith regards to mix, as I noted in the prior quarter, we have made important changes to align our commercial organization structure and incentives. We are underpenetrated in Cardinal Health brand mix relative to our potential, which remains a significant mid- to long-term profit opportunity as we move past the pandemic and associated supply chain challenges.\nWithin our medical products portfolio, we are actively improving our key category product offerings. For example, in our incontinence product line, we have launched a new Cardinal Health brand stretch free and a comprehensive breathable platform. These enhancements directly support and meet our customers' needs.\nSecond, we are simplifying our operating model and optimizing our international footprint. We remain on track regarding the timing of the previously announced exits in certain commercial markets, with 35 of the 36 completed to date. We are also focused on the modernization of our distribution facilities, including breaking ground on a new distribution center in the Midwest with nearly triple the space of the existing facility, enabling future growth.\nWe believe that a diverse global sourcing network is important to remain competitive on cost and are investing in additional self-manufacturing capabilities, including increases in annual production of safety needles and syringes, isolation gowns and surgical and procedure masks in our own North American facilities. Specifically for surgical gowns, we have efforts underway that will double our North American finished goods production and enhance our supply chain resiliency.\nThird, we continue to invest across the Medical segment, including in our growth businesses, at-Home Solutions and medical services, which are aligned with industry trends and positioned to grow double digits in FY '22 and beyond.\nIn at-Home Solutions, we continue to see strong demand as care continues to shift into the home. We recently announced an additional strategic investment in Medically Home, a technology company that enables health systems and other partners, like Cardinal Health, to safely bring the hospital home where patients increasingly prefer to receive their care. Not only does this hospital at-Home model benefit patients, it also provides needed capacity for hospitals and delivers care in a lower-cost setting.\nAnd in our higher-margin medical services businesses, OptiFreight Logistics and WaveMark, we continue to enable clinically integrated and digitally automated supply chain and are seeing growth driven by an expanded customer base and diversified solutions. We've invested in additional technology capabilities to increase our offerings in both businesses.\nIn OptiFreight, we've invested in additional technology capabilities focused on building automated, technology-driven solutions that innovate the way health care supply chain leaders manage shipping spend and take control over their transportation logistics. These efforts are connecting suppliers and customers at over 22,000 shipping locations.\nIn WaveMark, we've launched a cutting-edge supply automation solution for clinical labs, which automates previously manual inventory management tasks. This enables clinical lab staff to focus on patient care and better manage increased testing demand due to COVID-19.\nOur pharma business remains on track to deliver mid-single-digit growth in FY '22. We continue to make progress on our 2 primary objectives: first, strengthening our core pharma distribution, or PD business. This quarter segment profit was driven by the performance in our generics program. Our generics program is anchored by the scale and expertise of Red Oak Sourcing, a partnership, we also recently extended through FY '29 and which positions us well to meet customers' needs.\nIn addition, our multiyear technology investment to modernize our systems is on track. We plan to complete the rollout by the beginning of our Q4 and look to benefit from the conversion in FY '23 and beyond.\nSecond, we're fueling our growth businesses, specialty, nuclear and outcomes. In Specialty, we continue to experience momentum in our oncology physician office business driven in part by NavistaTS, our technology platform for value-based care.\nJust this week, we announced a partnership with Ember Technologies to offer the world's first self-refrigerated cloud-based shipping box for temperature-sensitive medicines. As biopharma continues to bringing cold chain biologic products to market, including cell and gene therapies, this partnership will help ensure product integrity throughout the supply chain. This is a differentiated offering and one that will reduce landfill waste by millions of pounds annually. And with biosimilars, we are well positioned to suppoprt the next phase of growth as biosimilars expand into new therapeutic areas and sites of care.\nIn Nuclear, we expect continued double-digit profit growth, which would result in a doubling of our profits in this business by FY '26. We continue to build out our multimillion dollar Center for Theranostics Advancement in Indianapolis, where we partner with several pharma companies to develop and commercialize novel theranostics, and we're investing in our PET capabilities to support robust PET diagnostics.\nFor example, with the FDA approval of Telix's radiopharmaceutical in Q2, we are positioned to drive nationwide accessibility and broad adoption of prostate-specific PET imaging for physicians and eligible patients across the United States.\nAnd in Outcomes, we are adding new payers and PBMs and expanding clinical solutions for both independent pharmacies and retail chains. Outcomes recently activated its 20 millionth user on its digital patient engagement platform, which enables 2-way communication between pharmacies and patients to increase medication adherence.\nWith respect to the enterprise, we continue to aggressively review our cost structure as we work to streamline, simplify and strengthen our operations and execute our digital transformation. We're pairing cost reduction efforts with balanced, disciplined and shareholder-friendly capital allocation, with a focus on investing in the business, maintaining a strong balance sheet and returning cash to shareholders.\nLong term, we're targeting a double-digit combined EPS growth and dividend yield. These expectations are driven by our growth targets for our segments, our commitment to our dividend and our $3 billion share repurchase authorization.\nNow let me provide an update on the proposed (inaudible) settlement agreement and settlement process. As of today, 46 out of 49 states have indicated their intent to join the global settlement. The sign-up period for political subdivisions within participating states concluded on January 26.\nNow each of the participating states are in the process of determining whether there is sufficient subdivision participation to proceed. After we received notice from the states regarding their decision, each of the distributors will make final determinations by February 25.

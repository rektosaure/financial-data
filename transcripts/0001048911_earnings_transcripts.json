Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Jenny. We delivered a solid quarter in line with the Q1 outlook we shared in June, despite significant volatility and uncertainty around the global trade environment. Our results demonstrate the resilience we have built into our network. They also reflect the dedication of our world-class team, who have adapted quickly to serve customers with excellence through an evolving demand environment. I'm very appreciative of Team FedEx. We continue to reduce structural costs while deploying Tricolor, advancing Network 2.0, and improving our European operations. These strategies are enabling us to flex the network faster than ever before and lowering our cost to serve, all while providing our customers with high-quality service.\nImportantly, we are continuing to win new business in high-value verticals, driven in part by our differentiated digital tools that are enhancing the FedEx value proposition and customer experience. We also continue to make meaningful progress, preparing for the spinoff of FedEx Freight, which remains on track. Following the spinoff, Freight will be a separate public company with the best customer value proposition in the LTL market and a proven track record of strong operational execution. Turning to our consolidated Q1 results, revenue is up 3% year-over-year, driven by strength across our US domestic package services.\nWe achieved our targeted $200 million in transformation-related savings and grew adjusted operating income by 7%. Similar to last quarter, the results at Federal Express Corporation, or FEC, demonstrate the operating leverage that we built into our business. On a 4% year-over-year increase in FEC revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 17% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 70 basis points. Notably, we achieved this result despite continued headwinds from the trade environment and the US Postal Service contract expiration.\nConsistent with the industry trends that we have seen in recent quarters, revenue at Freight remained pressured. That said, despite the prolonged weakness in the industrial economy, the LTL market remains rational, and we are well-positioned with our disciplined approach to strategic growth. I'm proud of the results our team is delivering across the enterprise, despite industrial economic weakness. While an industrial recovery is not required for long-term value creation at FedEx, I'm confident that we'll unlock significant upside across the enterprise when the demand environment improves. Last quarter, I spoke about the degree to which we flexed our networks to better match the demand environment amid global trade shifts. As policies and demand evolved throughout the Q1, we further adjusted capacity thanks to our Tricolor strategy.\nFor example, we reduced our Purple Tail trans-Pacific Asia outbound capacity by 25% year-over-year and nearly 10% versus the prior quarter. We also decreased our third-party, or White Tail, capacity by similar percentages. At the same time, we shifted capacity to capture profitable revenue on the Asia to Europe lane. With the full removal of the de minimis exemption in the United States late last month, we have been working closely with our customers, helping them maintain effective and efficient access to the vital US market. Given a significant portion of our de minimis volume exposure previously came from China, we were able to use learnings from our experiences in May to help shippers elsewhere navigate the more recent exemption elimination.\nThis level of connectivity extends to how we're advancing the elements of our transformation that are unique to FedEx. The Network 2.0 rollout is progressing well, and customer feedback, especially when it comes to the consolidated pickup experience, remains very positive. In the Q1, as planned, we optimized approximately 70 additional US stations. Our total optimized station count across the US and Canada is now approximately 360, enabling us to exit September with nearly 3 million in average daily volume flowing through Network 2.0 optimized operations.\nLooking beyond Network 2.0, improving profitability in Europe remains a top priority, and I am especially pleased with the team's year-over-year improvements in labor and on-road productivity metrics. Q1 also marked our best new business quarter in Europe in the last two years, driven by express parcel growth on both the intra-European and transatlantic lanes. Importantly, this business was well-balanced between B2B and B2C customers, demonstrating our focus on growing in premium B2B and longer-haul export B2C segments.\nThis commercial strategy, combined with our rigorous focus on cost management, led to a meaningful contribution to our year-over-year FEC profit improvement. I talked earlier about how our Tricolor strategy enabled us to flex the network to adapt to changing demand patterns. Tricolor is also driving greater densification and reduced unit costs across our purple, orange, and white networks. The strategy is simultaneously focused on enhancing service quality and mitigating congestion at major sort locations. Our execution on this important initiative is bolstering end-to-end solutions for global customers as we grow profitably in the global air freight market. This strategy supported an impressive 14% year-over-year Q1 revenue growth in International Priority and Economy Freight with high flow-through. Data and technology remain foundational to our business, but we are entering a new chapter in how we leverage them.\nOur founders' vision, more than 45 years ago, that information about the package is as important as the package itself, has proven prescient. Today, FedEx operates an advanced Digital Twin that goes beyond tracking. It is becoming an intelligent system that anticipates disruptions, provides optimized route information in real time, and creates predictive customer experiences. We move 17 million packages through our network daily, generating 2 petabytes of data and 100 billion transactions across software applications. The real value isn't in the volume. It is in the unique nature of this data. Our position at the intersection of global commerce gives us an unmatched view of physical supply chain patterns, seasonal demand shifts, and emerging trade corridors. This real-world operational data platform cannot be replicated by any competitor or a tech solution.\nSimply put, FedEx owns one of the richest logistics intelligence assets in the world. I'm excited to welcome Vishal Talwar, our new Chief Digital and Information Officer and President of FedEx DataWorks, who joined us last month. As the former Chief Growth Officer at Accenture Technology, Vishal brings deep expertise in enterprise AI and understands how to leverage our unique physical digital assets into next-generation AI-led capabilities.\nUnder Vishal's leadership, we will continue accelerating two key priorities: scaling AI across the enterprise, from enterprise function to how we operate and serve our customers, and exploring new revenue models that leverage our unique assets. We're also strengthening our cybersecurity posture to protect our strategic advantages. Before I turn the call over to Brie, I'd like to update you on our expectations for the remainder of the fiscal year. Based on our current assumptions, we expect full-year adjusted earnings to be $17.20 to 19 per diluted share.\nThis reflects a range of scenarios in what remains a dynamic global operating environment. As it continues to evolve, we will remain focused on executing on our commercial priorities, dynamically matching capacity with demand, and delivering on the $1 billion in transformation-related savings we shared previously. Brie and John will provide more details on the key variables and underlying assumptions for this outlook shortly. We have made tremendous progress on our transformation, and there is much more to come. To that end, we are excited to announce that our next FedEx Corp Investor Day will be held in Memphis on 11 February and 12 February 2026. I look forward to seeing many of you there, where we will provide more detailed updates on our strategic initiatives and our longer-term financial targets. Now, over to you, Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. I'm very proud of our entire global team for how they are supporting our customers in the current trade environment. Our strong value proposition, including superior weekend coverage, supported 3% year-over-year revenue growth across the enterprise. This is the highest quarterly rate we have seen since the pandemic. At FEC, revenue was up 4%, driven by US domestic package revenue strength. This was a direct result of profitable share growth in the US domestic market. This strength was partially offset by continued weakness at FedEx Freight due to the continued pressure from the industrial economy. Our value proposition is helping us deepen our customer relationships and win business. For example, in Q1, Best Buy named FedEx as their primary national parcel carrier.\nLeveraging our advanced visibility tools, Best Buy will provide real-time tracking data and customer order communication, improving their customers' experiences. By providing customers with more timely and accurate updates, the company also expects to reduce support calls, cancellations, and reship costs. We are excited to partner with Best Buy to create a smarter, more reliable supply chain that further strengthens their customer trust. We were pleased to deliver a 5% increase in US domestic ADV year-over-year, with growth across the majority of our services. In line with our expectations and consistent with the trends we saw in May, international export volumes declined, particularly on the China to US lane. Knowing our strongest international lane would be under pressure, we pivoted the commercial team, and they have done a tremendous job capturing demand out of Southeast Asia and Europe.\nThis provided a partial offset against the headwinds to demand on the China to US export lane. The team has also done a great job maximizing US outbound capacity. We are seeing improving trends in both outbound weight and volume, supported by strong growth in our healthcare vertical. At FedEx Freight, along with broader industry trends, average daily shipments declined. Weakness in the industrial economy and excess capacity in the truckload market continue to pressure our results. That said, Freight made excellent progress in the quarter, continuing to stand up its dedicated sales team.\nThis team is focused on improving the customer experience and maintaining strong yields. As the industrial economy improves, Freight is poised for growth and margin expansion. The parcel pricing environment continues to improve. We have achieved strong capture from our pricing changes in the quarter, which included an increase in our fuel surcharge index. At FEC, US domestic package yield was up 3%, driven by strength across all services. International export package yield grew 4%, driven by higher fuel surcharges, favorable exchange rate impacts, and the reduction in lightweight e-commerce volume due to the change in the de minimis exemption.\nOur Tricolor strategy continued to drive growth in international priority and economy freight, where we delivered a 9% increase in revenue per pound. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment declined 1%, driven by lower revenue per hundredweight and lower fuel surcharges. While weight per shipment was flat year-over-year, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement in weight per shipment over the past few quarters, and FedEx Freight revenue per hundredweight remains among the highest in the industry. We announced our demand surcharges in July, which are needed to offset the incremental cost at peak to deliver outstanding service while protecting profitability. Earlier this month, we announced a 5.9% general rate increase effective in January.\nWe expect strong capture from both. In Q1, we prepared for the ramping of our new Amazon business, which was minimal in Q1, as we expected. We believe the onboarding will be complete by Q3, which will support continued US domestic revenue growth in the quarters ahead. This profitable business will skew towards larger, heavier weight packages. We are cautiously optimistic about peak season growth, based on what we are hearing from our customers currently. As a reminder, this year's peak season will last one day longer than last year's. With that in mind, we are expecting a modest increase in peak ADV versus fiscal year 2025 and a mid- to high-single-digit increase in year-over-year total peak volume, with growth driven by our larger B2C customers.\nRegarding the full-year outlook, we are currently planning for revenue growth of 4% to 6%. The top of this range assumes that current favorable trends in the US domestic segment continue, and the lower end assumes incremental pressure on US demand, particularly in the second half of the fiscal year. On the international side, the top of the revenue range assumes the current level of international export revenue pressures continue through the rest of the fiscal year, while the lower end assumes an acceleration in these pressures. At FedEx Freight, we expect revenue to be flat to up modestly year-over-year, depending largely on the market conditions in the second half of the year.\nWe continue to advance our commercial priorities, sharply focused on B2B, small and medium-sized businesses, Europe, and of course, global air freight. Within B2B, we continue to onboard new healthcare business in Q1, building on our momentum from prior quarters. This includes strong healthcare-related growth within our global air freight business. Later this month, we are launching a new flight linking Dublin and Indianapolis. This new flight will move goods one day faster, supporting healthcare and other high-value verticals with shipments between Ireland and the US. We grew our US domestic small business revenue by more than 10% year-over-year in the Q1.\nThis was fueled by focused and targeted sales execution and a close alignment between our sales and our operations teams. This collaboration is accelerating onboarding, shortening deal cycles, and driving meaningful new acquisitions. We are also scaling high-impact support to deliver exceptional customer experiences during this complex environment. FedEx Rewards, our loyalty program, which is unique in the industry, continues to see significant growth while deepening our S&B customer relationships. In closing, I'm very proud of our team's strong execution in this dynamic environment. We are helping our customers manage through evolving policies and changing demand patterns.We remain disciplined in our approach to revenue quality. We are ready to continue providing outstanding service to our customers before, during, and after peak. And with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Brie. Our Q1 results reflect the tenacity and agility of the FedEx team in providing outstanding service while delivering on our strategic initiatives and increasing stockholder returns. We executed very well in Q1, with results above the midpoint of our adjusted EPS outlook range. We also maintained our disciplined approach to capital expenditure, continued to repurchase stock, and grew our quarterly dividend. Turning to our financial results, on a consolidated basis, in the Q1, we delivered $3.83 in adjusted earnings per share, up 6% year-over-year. We delivered these positive results despite significant headwinds from reduced international export demand and the expiration of the US Postal Service contract. Overall, we delivered revenue growth of 3%, which supported 20 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 7% adjusted operating income growth.\nAs Brie mentioned, our yield management and strong commercial execution resulted in higher revenue growth from US domestic package services, which contributed to our year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement. We grew adjusted operating income by approximately $90 million despite the $150 million headwinds from the global trade environment, $130 million of headwind from the US Postal Service contract expiration, and continued softness at FedEx Freight. As a reminder, we'll lap the expiration of the Postal Service contract at the end of this month. Additionally, our Q1 results reflect a higher-than-expected Q1 GAAP tax rate of 27.3%, which was unfavorably impacted by a non-recurring income tax expense related to the examination of prior year tax return filings.\nTurning to performance by segment, at FEC, adjusted operating income increased by $168 million, up 17%, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted margin expansion for FEC. This was driven by higher yields, continued cost reduction efforts, and increased US domestic package volume. These drivers were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates, and the headwinds I mentioned earlier. As expected, due to the evolving trade environment in the quarter, we experienced a material headwind on our Asia to US lane, largely from China outbound, driving most of the $150 million international export headwind to adjusted operating income.\nAt FedEx Freight, adjusted operating income declined by just over $70 million, and adjusted operating margin contracted 250 basis points. Though the current operating environment is challenging for the entire LTL sector, FedEx Freight is uniquely positioned to see strong incremental margins in the eventual market upswing.Moving on to capital allocation, during the quarter, we opportunistically purchased $500 million worth of stock, which, alongside our increased dividend payout, demonstrates our unwavering commitment to increasing stockholder value. We have $1.6 billion remaining under our 2024 stock repurchase authorization, and subject to business and market conditions, we expect to continue repurchasing shares during the remainder of FY26.\nFedEx maintains a healthy balance sheet with $6.2 billion of cash on hand exiting Q1 and with investment-grade credit ratings from the major agencies. I'm also very pleased that our recent euro-denominated bond offering was significantly oversubscribed, a testament to the strength of our business, balance sheet, and capital allocation strategy. Q1 CapEx was $623 million, driven by Network 2.0-related facility enhancements, hub modernization, and continued investments to maintain our fleet of aircraft and vehicles. We continue to target $4.5 billion in annual CapEx for FedEx Corp in FY26.\nWith regard to pension contributions, given the well-funded status of our pension plan, we are reducing our expected pension cash contribution. We now anticipate making up to $400 million in voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans in fiscal 2026, compared to our prior forecast of up to $600 million. Moving to our FY26 adjusted EPS outlook, which is based on the information that is known to us today. Though the global operating environment remains fluid, with dynamic economic conditions across geographies, our value proposition remains strong, and we continue to execute effectively. As a result, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $17.20 to 19, which reflects a range of potential scenarios for the year.\nFactors that will determine where we ultimately fall in the outlook range include the evolution of global trade, the health of the industrial economy, the US domestic demand environment, traction in our higher-margin B2B verticals, and inflation. Adjusted EPS of $18.10, which is the midpoint of our range, assumes consolidated revenue growth of 5% and $1 billion in transformation-related savings from our structural cost reductions, Network 2.0, and associated One FedEx savings in FY26. We expect Adjusted Operating Income offsets to include a $1 billion headwind due to the global trade environment, recognizing this number could flex in either direction as the environment evolves, and a $160 million headwind to Adjusted Operating Income from the expiration of the Postal Contract.\nWe expect our FY26 effective tax rate to be approximately 25% and EPS to be supported by our share repurchase program, as I mentioned earlier. At the midpoint of our range, we anticipate a 6% increase in Federal Express revenue, with adjusted operating margin down slightly. Also, at the midpoint, we expect low single-digit improvement in FedEx Freight revenue, with margin down year-over-year. Now turning to our FY26 adjusted operating income bridge, we're introducing a new view of this bridge to provide deeper insights into the expected drivers of profitability this year.\nThe bridge shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our outlook in one of the scenarios at the midpoint, resulting in adjusted operating income of $6 billion. Of course, the assumptions behind the variables at the midpoint may flex as the environment changes. In this scenario, for FEC volume-related revenue net of variable costs associated with this volume, we expect a $400 million tailwind driven largely by US domestic package services, offset by a material headwind from reduced international export demand. With respect to FEC yield, we expect a $2.3 billion tailwind, demonstrating our commitment to revenue quality and continued pricing discipline.\nOffsets to these tailwinds include a $2.1 billion base expense increase across the business, excluding FedEx Freight, a $300 million headwind from direct trade-related expenses, including higher customs clearance costs, a $160 million US Postal Service contract expiration headwind I mentioned earlier, a $100 million decline in adjusted operating profit at Freight, and a $100 million headwind from the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations. Embedded in our assumptions are the previously mentioned $1 billion in headwind to adjusted operating profit from the global trade environment, and $1 billion in transformation-related savings from Drive and Network 2.0. And while Drive began as a cost reduction program, it is now fundamental to how we run our business. With regard to Q2, we anticipate a sequential improvement in adjusted EPS.\nAt FEC, we expect to maintain or improve operating margin sequentially, and at FedEx Freight, we expect the year-over-year decline in adjusted operating margin to begin moderating sequentially in Q2. Before turning to Q&A, I want to provide an update on our spinoff of FedEx Freight, which is progressing well and on track for the June 2026 separation. In August, we submitted our confidential Form 10 to the SEC, and in September, we submitted a request for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the transaction to the IRS. These are important milestones as we move toward the tax-efficient spinoff. Freight now has about 200 frontline LTL sales and sales support personnel on board and is well on its way toward our goal of 400 sales specialists prior to the spinoff.\nI'm confident that both the expanded dedicated sales force and our ramping technology investments will continue to improve the customer experience. Once separated, FedEx Freight will be a separately traded public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FDXF, and we plan to host our FedEx Freight Investor Day in New York City in spring of 2026 prior to the separation. Overall, I remain confident that the FedEx Freight separation and the continued execution of our strategic priorities will unlock significant stockholder value in the years ahead. And with that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star, then 1 on your touchtone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star, then 2. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. The first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVice President and Equity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nHi, afternoon. Thanks for the color on the midpoint. I'm curious on the low and the high end of your EPS range. Is it simply a function of where it comes out in that revenue range, or is there other things that could help impact where it winds up sitting? Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Jordan. It's John. I'll start by saying it's really important to note that we're basing this outlook on the information available today. We did center on the midpoint of our range, and I think it's fair to say that where we ultimately land will be determined by a variety of variables. I touched on them in some of my prepared remarks, including the evolution of global trade and its impact on demand, the health of the industrial economy, US domestic demand, and so forth. So it's not any one factor.\nIt's a variety of factors, and we're going to be monitoring those closely. It's going to be a very dynamic environment that we intend to capitalize on.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for the details on the cost there. I just want to dig into that a little bit to understand, because if I look at the incremental margin growth of 4% to 6%, yet the incremental operating gains are not keeping pace. So is that because of the headwinds that you ran through? Maybe, John, maybe you can refine that a little bit on the billion-dollar cost, the $300 million headwind on the trade expenses. I just want to maybe parse that out a little bit further.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Yeah, there will be pressure. I mean, what we're talking about here is a billion dollars of headwind as a result of some of the environmental impacts. So our full-year assumption does include the removal of the de minimis exemption for the rest of the world that went into effect in the end of August. But I think it's fair to say that that billion dollars will be something that we'll be focused on, but something that will be a challenge for us as we go forward.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nIf I can add to that, Ken, I think that is a big headwind for fiscal year 2026. We're doing everything in our power to make sure that we can improve our customer experience and mitigate the costs as we move forward. The underlying business is very strong as we move into 2027 and beyond.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nYeah, thanks for taking our questions here. Raj, you leaned a little further into the data side of the business post the hire, Michelle. I know we just started a month ago. I don't know if he's on the call or could talk a little bit high level about strategy, particularly where you're talking about finding new revenue models to monetize that part of the FedEx story. Or if not him, just a little more thought on where you're heading in that and how big a business that might be for FedEx going forward. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Bascom, for raising that question. One of the things that we are clear about is the value of the data that we have. We move 17 million packages a day, two petabytes of data. As I said earlier, it's not just the volume of the data, it's the value of the data, especially in the dynamic world that we live today. The important thing is that we started this work back in 2020, and we started organizing and engineering this data on a platform basis for some time now. That's what gives us the edge, especially as AI has now evolved and is moving quickly. The fuel for AI is data, and to have engineered data and the high-value data of what we have is now super critical as we move forward. It's already bearing fruit.\nIt's bearing fruit in our operations as deep learning models are enhancing our predictability. We couldn't have done Network 2.0 without the data platform that we have and the technology we have. It's already bearing fruit from a differentiation perspective. We have premium monitoring and intervention tools for our customers, and the healthcare business that Brie's team is winning; 40% of them are on the Surround platform, which is essentially based on the data platform and AI tools that we have. We also launched the commerce platform FDX, and that essentially is now becoming a workflow tool for our customers for orchestrating their supply chains.\nEspecially in this complex trade environment, those kind of is the added value as we improve our value proposition for moving things across borders and being predictive using GenAI to create value from HS classifications and so on. That area is quite nascent, and we have a long road as well as a runway ahead of us. Our mission and vision has evolved to make supply chains smarter for everyone. It begins with our data platform and the insights that we have on supply chain and the role of AI and the tools that we have.\nSo I think as we look ahead, we'll talk more about this in February as it becomes an enabler for our operations, a differentiator from our customer's point of view, and new revenue models that we can create based on this. So thank you again for that question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So any color on the magnitude of sequential earnings growth that you'd expect? And then just that was for Q2. Then just bigger picture, if I think about the last couple of years, we've heard we're reducing costs and growing earnings despite lower revenue. Whenever we get the revenue growth, the operating leverage is going to be really strong. Now we've got 5% revenue growth and $1 billion of cost reduction and buyback, but earnings are flat. I guess why aren't we seeing the better operating leverage? I get the global headwind, but you're growing revenue 5% even with that $1 billion-dollar global headwind.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSo, Scott, thanks for that. Let me start with the Q2. We have focused our commentary on the full-year guidance and are not giving Q2 guidance. But that said, as Brie mentioned, we're cautiously optimistic about peak season demand. We do expect, consistent with last year, sequential earnings improvement in Q2 versus Q1 383, but we're not guiding to Q2 being up or down on a year-over-year basis. We expect continued benefits from our transformation-related savings and large trade-related OI headwind than in Q1 of the $150 million. But just pivoting to your second question on kind of the flow-through, I'll repeat what I said before. We're facing a $1 billion headwind due to the trade environment.\nIn Q1, we experienced $150 million of that to adjusted op income, primarily driven by reduced demand out of China on the US lane. And so for the full year, and just to give a little bit more detail, we're assuming a material revenue headwind from the global trade environment. Operating income at the midpoint of the range will require us to execute, but there's going to be pressure. So the flow-through is not as great given some of the pressures. The $1 billion is embedded in lost opportunity in our FEC volume net of cost line, the direct trade-related expenses for things like customers' clearance and staffing, and base expense increases. So there's a fair amount of pressure there from which we intend to deliver on and will be focused on staying in the range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. John, I guess it's maybe a little more on that same topic that I think Scott was just asking about. The global trade headwind, I still feel like I don't really understand what it is. If I look at your international export revenue, I think was up a little bit in Q1. I think on one of your slides, you were pointing to some nice reduction in flight hours on Asia-US in both Purple Tail and White Tail. So I guess it's not clear to me what that $150 million in Q1 is. It doesn't seem to be revenue. It doesn't seem to be clear where the cost impact is.\nSo I really just wanted to see if you could just help us understand that a little bit better, and also why that gets meaningfully worse on a full-year basis to like $1 billion instead of versus the $150 million in Q1. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey, Tom, it's Brie. I'll take the top line question and then certainly let John kind of add in the color on the expense increase. So what we saw in the Q1 is the vast majority of that $150 million was impact from reduction in top-line revenue. Specifically, the majority of that is de minimis impacted and coming out of the China lane. We anticipate that that will continue to flow through the year. In addition to the $150 million per quarter, as we are planning for incremental pressure because of the global de minimis change that took place at the end of August, we've got $100 million of bottom-line pressure throughout the year, and then we have $300 million of incremental expense.\nSo to be really clear, that $1 billion of headwind is predominantly an impact of top-line revenue reduction because China to the US is a very profitable lane for us. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, no, Brie, just to add what I mentioned before. I mean, you touched on it.The direct trade-related expenses are $300 million for additional customs clearance and related capabilities, and also running through the base expense increases that, coupled with the top line that you mentioned.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. I think we're all trying to get to the same place here, so I'll just layer on top of Tom and Scott. If this is all a top-line impact from the global trade, $150 million in the Q1, $850 million, yeah, $850 million for the rest of the year, which is close to $300 million. So it's almost doubling the impact in fiscal Q2, Q3, Q4. You have to get to the midpoint or even the low end of the full-year revenue guide. The rate of change will have to accelerate from the 3% in the Q1, and your year-over-year comps and even two-year stack comps are more difficult. So can you just help us bridge where the revenue acceleration comes from if this anomalous headwind is intensifying, potentially doubling?\nIs it all from price and yield? Are you expecting some significant volume pickup at some point absent the global tariff headwinds and de minimis?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey, Jonathan, it's Brie. So great question. So yes, we were very pleased with the 3% revenue growth in the Q1. To get to the midpoint of 5%, first of all, we do expect the majority of trends will continue. So right now, what we're seeing in September looks a lot like August. So it's a continuation of trend with a couple of really important notes. Number one, in the Q1, we had a $280 million top-line headwind because of USPS. That goes away in Q2 and beyond. Two, we are still onboarding some of the wins from Q4 of last year and early Q1. As I mentioned, as an example, Amazon is still onboarding, and it had very little impact in Q1.\nThere are several other examples of onboarding. And then in the back half of the year, we do expect FedEx Freight to have modest yield improvement and better than the Q1 or the Q1 and the Q2 from an expectation perspective. So we do think the midpoint is very realistic, and we're clear-eyed about how to get from Q1 to the rest of the year's range.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening, and thanks for taking my question.Brie, I appreciate all those details. I was wondering if maybe you could walk through the outlook for domestic volumes on the package side again. And it's no secret that your largest competitor is shrinking here. So can you talk about maybe the competitive landscape, what's presenting for market share opportunities, and pricing? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYep, great question. So from a domestic perspective, we're not, and I'm speaking specifically to parcel, we're not expecting a massive trend change. We are expecting, as I mentioned, the onboarding. I think you'll see the mix look very similar from a different package profile. A couple of things. The team has done a really good job from an execution perspective. We've had the best momentum in S&B in the last quarter that I've seen for a while, so that's helping our yield growth.\nThe other thing to note is, of course, fuel was very helpful in the Q1, and that will continue through the year. In addition to that, we executed some price changes that came in in the middle of the quarter, and those will be helpful Q2 and beyond. So net takeaway, I don't see a massive trend change. This is self-help, if you will. This is market share, strategic, profitable market share acquisition, and we expect it to continue. To your point on price, we're really focused on winning with value proposition. We're winning in healthcare. We're winning in small business. We're winning because of our seven-day. I think you all heard the Best Buy example. Pricing is improving in the market, and we think very rational. Competitive, but rational.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Weatherby with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Weatherby\n\nAnalyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hey, thanks. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess maybe just wanted to ask about the range. So 4% to 6% on the top line and $17.20 to 19 on the bottom line. Midpoint is 5% of revenue for the midpoint of the EPS. Should we assume that 4% revenue growth lines up with $17.20 and 6%? Is that the $19 side? And then maybe just a quick clarification point. What exactly is the $300 million of direct-related expenses on the trade side? Just want to get a sense of what that is.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. Hey, Chris, it's John. I would not make that direct connection between the factor you described on the 4% leading to on the low end. As I said before, this is a dynamic environment. There's going to be a lot of puts and takes as we go forward here, and we're going to be aggressively monitoring and managing it. That was just. We just gave one scenario, as we mentioned when we talked about how we get to the midpoint. There could be a number of others as well. With regard to your second question, I'm just trying to recall if you could.\n$300 million. Yeah, I'm sorry. That was customs clearance and related staffing, and related administrative expenses as a result of adapting to the current trade environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nDirector of Lead Surface Transportation and Airfreight Equity Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thanks. So regarding the top end of your guidance, you said it's predicated on the continuation of strength in domestic. I guess this question is for Brie. You saw some of the best conditions, you said, since COVID period. Your pricing was certainly the best, we believe, since 2022. Volume growth, third consecutive quarter of mid-single digit plus growth in domestic volumes. Brie, you said SMB, best momentum you've seen in a while. So maybe you can help us understand what's really driving the share gain. What do we need to see to make it sustainable? And then regarding the onboarded, the business you're onboarding, what does it look like? What's the profitability profile, etc.? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question, Richa. Honestly, from an execution perspective, we're really focused on strategic segments. SMB, we are selling direct. Our primary competitor sells through more platforms and third parties, and we've really seen some just outstanding execution momentum. We have a loyalty program that is highly effective, and we've been very focused on making sure customers are aware and engaged in the loyalty program, and that is working. From a healthcare, that's why you're seeing the premium volume momentum that we have seen over the last two quarters, essentially.\nSo we're pleased with that. Healthcare is very sticky revenue. It is high service expectations, very, very custom SOP, and so it is profitable, but it's also very sticky. And then, of course, from an e-commerce perspective, you have seen that FedEx Ground Economy bundle working. We are growing there. We are faster than our primary competitor. We have rural coverage that they don't have. And of course, we now cover about 65% of GDP on Sunday. So really pleased with the team's focus, equally pleased with their revenue quality. We've been pulling pricing levers as appropriate, and that definitely benefited us in the Q1, and we anticipate that we'll get a high capture throughout the year. Of course, we're also planning very rigorously for peak.\nPeak surcharges are in place. They are working. The team's got a very, very focused plan for peak that I'm excited about.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nFreight Transportation and Airlines Analyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nGreat. Thanks, guys. Two questions, if I may. On the De Minimis, kind of what has been the customer reaction to the expiration of the rule, and do you think that is a new normal going forward? And also, does it feel like there's been much pull forward in international volumes that may have benefited you in fiscal Q1? And kind of what does that kind of normal run rate look like for the next kind of several quarters as well?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question. I'm certainly not going to speculate on the future trade environment, but I will tell you, obviously, from a customer perspective, it has been a very stressful period. I'm really proud of our clearance operations team and our commercial team because they are lockstep with customers. It has been particularly challenging for small exporters because they do not have the expertise and the staffing, and that's where our teams have come in and really partnered with them to help, as Raj talked about, automate some of their clearance inputs from a digital perspective. So we're very, very focused from a partnership perspective, but it has been really tough on small customers and exporters.\nAs far as the pull forward, I will remain optimistic. The American consumer from our numbers has been resilient. We do not see any indication in either air freight or domestic parcel business that this is pull forward. I will absolutely acknowledge July was quite strong for us, especially the prime week. We saw a lot of US retailers put sales in market, and they were affected. We saw strong volumes in July, but I don't necessarily see that as a pull forward. And like I said, right now, from our forecasting for both peak and the back half, we're confident in the range we put out from a top-line perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brian Osenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, JPMorgan\n\nGood afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. So maybe, Brie, just to start off by elaborating a bit more on the peak. It sounds like some of it's visibility to maybe some of these new contracts that are onboarding. Some of it's more of a macro. So maybe you can separate just how much of the peak strength is FedEx-related versus what you see in the underlying market. I think that'd be helpful. And also maybe a little bit of context on freight. We didn't get too much color on that, but certainly a tough market and tough quarter, but it sounds like you expect things to stabilize and improve pretty significantly from here. So wanted to get some additional thoughts on what's embedded in that outlook. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay. I think I got it all, Brian, but stop me if I don't hit all of it. From a peak perspective, yes, when we look at kind of the number of operating days in the season of peak, we are expecting kind of from an ADV perspective, sort of a low to moderate growth from an ADV, but total volume will be up because we have that extra day. I do think a relatively significant portion of this volume growth is our acquisition that we took in the back half of last year. You're going to have that lasting benefit for us from a peak perspective. I anticipate that our numbers will be slightly elevated versus market. I also, from a performance perspective, we do see this driven by large B2C retailers and brands.\nThat's definitely heavy from a peak perspective. Rest assured, we have the revenue quality strategy and the peak surcharges in place. The team has done a really good job. We're lock-step with Scott Ray and the surface team to manage capacity and service. So we feel very good from a peak perspective. But to your point, I don't necessarily think that it's an indicator of overall market performance. From a FedEx Freight perspective, you've all tracked the pressures on the industrial economy. We are the FedEx; well, FedEx is the market share leader in the LTL industry. And so, of course, we are feeling that pressure.\nThe team's number one priority at FedEx Freight, and we take this responsibility very seriously, is revenue quality. We will have the benefit of the lifting in the back half. So we do anticipate that yields will increase in the back half, but we remain very disciplined and very focused.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector of Transportation Miami, Stifel\n\nYeah. Good afternoon, and thanks for the question. Maybe just one on the broader air freight market. We've been hearing about some potential supply constraints as the global freight fleet sort of ages here. I guess first, are you seeing signs of that? And then if so, how do you think about the flow-through with Tricolor? I imagine you've got some good flexibility to shift volumes sort of between the purple tails and third-party capacity.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah.From an air freight perspective, again, we're a relatively small market share participant from a global air freight perspective. We are being selective and really focused on premium freight. I am particularly proud of the airline team this quarter. They shifted capacity, and I'm equally proud of the commercial team. We knew because of the trade environment that our China to US lane, and we are the market share leader there, would be pressured. So we pivoted. We are growing between Asia and Europe, which is a large lane. We're being selective there. And then, equally important, on the Purple Tail that we balance capacity, and the team did a really good job from a US perspective. I'll give the healthcare team a shout-out.\nAlmost 50% of the weight growth from a US export perspective came from healthcare air freight, so our healthcare strategy is working there too.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Bruce, if I can jump in on the Tricolor, or if you remember the conversations that we have had before, the idea was to decongest the hubs and to have a fly truck network so that it links all our networks together optimally and densification of our network. All those are being tracked at KPI level very carefully, and I'm happy to report that the team has done a tremendous job, and it's working. That's what enables us to provide the value proposition to our customers to strategically and profitably grow in these segments. So again, we are in early innings on Tricolor, but the implementation has been stellar.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jason Seidel with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nElliot Alper\n\nVP and Equity Research, TD Cowen\n\nThank you. This is Elliot Alper for Jason Seidel. So in terms of Network 2.0 and heading into peak season, are you planning for any changes in the process, like putting some stations on hold in busier markets as you work through peak? Could that affect any timing in terms of the cadence of the one billion in cost savings or anything to think about there?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question. We are very encouraged by the progress on Network 2.0. The Canada transition is complete, and the service levels there are very strong. We are obviously moving forward in the US market, underway as we planned. There is no change to the plans that we have set in place. We are exiting Q1 with 18% of our US ADV running through the Network 2.0 model. We have close to about 140 facilities and integrated 360 stations in the process.\nAt the end of the day, that's pretty much as planned, and that's what we will continue to execute going forward. You had a rumor that Network 2.0 is an efficiency story, but also a growth story as we improve our customer value and customer experience, that this becomes both an efficiency part of the equation and also an ability for us to grow in the segment. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nI think it's important to note we never plan for a new optimization in the middle of peak. Our rollout schedule, it's a given that that just doesn't happen in peak because services are top priority for our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. So John, I wanted to kind of come back to this question on operating leverage and try to help better understand the bridge that you laid out here. When we think about Q1, is there anything in the comp on a year-over-year basis that may be added to the leverage, whether it's incentives or anything like that? And then as we think about the remainder of the year, right, obviously there's a lot of things happening on trade and things happening top line, bottom line. Is the answer here of why we're not getting more leverage just that the mix is shifting to less profitable traffic? I'm just trying to kind of really understand this thing at a high level.\nIf we've got $1 billion worth of cost taking out that would offset the headwind, and then we got 5% of revenue growth, why isn't there more falling to the bottom line?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. As I mentioned before, there's a variety of factors in play here, including kind of the opportunity cost of the hit to revenue as a result of the change in the trade environment. Mix shift is a factor to lower yielding mix, but I should say it's profitable. It's profitable mix. I want to be clear on that. But that is certainly a consideration. But there's a whole dynamic environment of factors that are putting pressure on us that run the range that are factored into that $1 billion.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ari Rosa with Citi. Please go ahead. Hi, good afternoon.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst and Equity Research, Citi\n\nSo just on the revenue growth target, maybe you could help us understand how much of that is coming from new business wins because I don't think that's been totally clear. So is there a way to segment how much of the 4% to 6% is organic versus kind of new business wins? Anything you can give us on kind of the margin contribution of that. And then if I can squeeze one other one in, the $600 million of Freight spin costs, maybe you could just give a little bit of color on what that is. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nWell, I'll start with the Freight spin costs and then turn it over to that. Like with any large transaction, there's a significant amount of cost that's incurred. It's largely driven by the IT, the systems, and enhancing the systems at Freight to improve the customer experience. There are some staffing costs, but I would say those are small in the scheme of things. We talked about the salesforce and so forth, but largely IT-related and systems-related.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah. As far as the revenue range, it's a combination of factors, as I talked about. We've got execution from a share gain perspective. We've got execution on getting the right business in and then yield. The one thing that I can emphasize, that as we look at the difference between the Q1 and Q2 through Q4, the domestic momentum, one of the larger factors there will be continued onboarding, but we'll also be pushing on yield.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Operator. In closing, our Q1 results demonstrate our ability to support customers through this dynamic environment. I'm incredibly proud of the FedEx team for their outstanding commitment to our customers and for driving such strong performance in this quarter. I'm confident that the momentum we have established positions us well for the peak season ahead. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

I would now like to turn the conference over to FedEx President and CEO, Raj Subramaniam. Please go ahead.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, operator. Before we begin, I want to take a few minutes to honor someone who meant a great deal to this company, the business community, his beloved family and to me personally. It feels strange to be here with you also soon after his sudden passing. And it is difficult to put into words the tremendous loss felt by all who knew Fredrick W. Smith. But Fred was a man grounded by a mission, and he would tell us to say, \"focus on the business and keep marching forward.\" And so we will do just that. But first, I wanted to share a few thoughts.\nFred was more than a business leader, he was a visionary who revolutionized the delivery industry. He was a man who led with integrity and inspired others. His belief in people, his relentless pursuit of excellence and his commitment to connect people and possibilities, built one of the world's most successful companies over the last 5 decades and his legacy will be felt for decades to come. On a personal note, I will miss his strategic counsel, impeccable character and sharp [indiscernible]. He taught me that leadership is about service and not titles. He challenged me to think bigger, act bolder and always, always put our people and our customers at the center of everything we do.\nI feel tremendously fortunate to have spent 34 years learning from 1 of the most brilliant mines in our country's history. Please join me in extending heartfelt condolences to the entire Smith family during this difficult time. As we move forward, we will honor his legacy by continuing to build the company he loves with the same passion and purpose inspired in us all.\nNow consistent with our succession plan. Yesterday, the Board elected Brad Martin as the Chairman of the Board of FedEx Corp. Brad is a highly regarded business leader and strategic thinker, who is intimately familiar with the business, having previously served as our Vice Chairman. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeni.\n\nJenifer Hollander\n\nVice President of Investor Relations\n\nThanks, Raj. Good afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The fourth quarter earnings release and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to 1 question to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nCertain statements in this conference call may be considered forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nFor additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC. Today's presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. And now I will turn the call back over to Raj.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director\n\nThank you, Jeni. I want to start by commending our team for their strong efforts and execution. We delivered a solid finish to FY '25 with another quarter of adjusted operating income growth and adjusted operating margin expansion despite a challenging demand environment. This performance reflects the progress we have made on our strategic transformation, which continues to position FedEx for long-term value creation. In FY '25, we delivered on our $2.2 billion drive structural cost reduction commitment. This enabled us to achieve our 2-year $4 billion drive target compared to the FY '23 baseline. We advanced Network 2.0 in FY '25 as we began optimizing larger, more densely populated markets.\nWe continued to lower our capital intensive, and we returned $4.3 billion in cash to stockholders. We achieved all of this in the face of major headwinds, including the expiration of our U.S. postal service contract, 2 fewer operating days and volatility and uncertainty related to global trade policy. Against this dynamic backdrop, I'm very proud of our ability to deliver on our targets, adapt our network to changing trade flows and provide excellent service for our customers.\nNow turning to our consolidated Q4 results. Revenue was up 1% year-over-year. We grew our drive savings sequentially, achieved our drive cost reduction target in this quarter. This enabled us to grow adjusted operating income by 8% and expand adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points. At Federal Express Corporation, our results demonstrate the operational leverage that we have built into our business through DRIVE. On a 1% increase in revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 9%. We achieved this result in a weak demand environment with growth largely drawn by our deferred services. Our performance demonstrates the flexibility of our network, and I'm confident in the operating results we can deliver when the industrial economy recovers.\nConsistent with the trends over the last several quarters, our higher-margin B2B volumes remain pressured, which affected both FAC and freight results. That said, we are encouraged by the sequential improvement of FedEx Freight and our ability to protect profitability with an operating margin of 20.8% in Q4. The trade-related events of the fourth quarter showcased our ability to leverage both the scale and the flexibility of our unrivaled global network supported by insights from the vast amount of data we collect.\nWe are at the center of a global trade ecosystem. We connect 99% of the world's commerce. We moved $2 trillion worth of goods every year. We connect 3 million shippers to more than 225 million consumers. And as the world changes and supply chains evolve, we benefit from our presence in over 220 countries and territories. This uniquely positions us to be a valuable partner to our customers as they navigate shifting demand trends evaluate the impact of tariffs on their businesses and adjust their supply chains accordingly.\nAnd importantly, our Tricolor strategy enables us to adapt our own network faster than ever before as circumstances and the needs of our customers change, driving greater efficiency and a better customer experience. For example, in the fourth quarter, we flexed our network to match the demand environment as trade flows shifted. We reduced capacity on our Asia to Americas lane by more than 35% in the first week of May compared to April. This included reducing our third-party or white tail capacity by 50%. We then continue to adjust the capacity as needed as demand trends evolve throughout the month.\nWe exceeded May with a net capacity reduction of about 20% versus April. We have been introducing other network changes in Asia, allowing us to consolidate from multiple points into a centralized gateway. We recently added a direct flight from Singapore to the U.S., enabling us to be more efficiently capture increased demand out of Southeast Asia. We continue to evaluate trade patterns and are prepared to alter our roots and capacity commitments should demand shift with a focus on Asia to Europe and Asia to Latin America.\nIn addition to rapidly adjusting our physical network, our team has done a remarkable job working closely with our customers and helping them navigate increasing operational complexities. We continue to apply our digital platform-based solutions to effectively address key pain points amid changing global trade policies. These solutions support a wide range of stakeholders, importers, exporters, brokers and regulators, and they are tightly integrated with our customers' existing workflows ensuring that critical trade and tariff-related work can occur seamlessly and efficiently.\nAs you are all aware, there's a lot happening outside of FedEx. Trade policies are evolving and trade patterns are changing. What's truly remarkable is a significant way we have leveraged our technological capabilities and processes to navigate these complexities and operate more efficiently for our customers.\nNetwork 2.0 is the next leg of our structural transformation, and it is well underway. In April, we completed the full optimization of Canada, our largest market yet. As planned, we optimized 45 U.S. stations in Q4, and we are now picking up the base. On June 1, we implemented Network 2.0 on nearly 30 stations across 11 markets, and we will optimize another 33 stations across 9 markets by the end of this month. That means we exit June with roughly 2.5 million average daily volume flowing through Network 2.0 optimized stations.\nLooking beyond North America, we have made progress in Europe, including our DRIVE target. That said, Europe remains a significant opportunity for long-term financial improvement. We have been implementing the workforce reduction plan we announced in June of 2024. This was a very difficult, but necessary decision for us, leading to about $150 million of savings on an annualized basis in FY '27. We have achieved better on-road productivity with sustained improvement in net service levels. We have now seen 2 consecutive years of cost per package reduction in our European business.\nIn FY '26, we'll focus on further improving on-road and in-station productivity, bringing new digital experience to our customers and growing market share profitably in the region. A quick update on the freight spinoff. Last month, we named Brad Martin as Chairman of the Board of FedEx Freight. We also named John Smith as President and CEO of the stand-alone company. As many of you know, John has deep freight expertise and a strong track record of improving margins and profitability at both FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. We are moving quickly to announce the rest of our Freight leadership team.\nWe recently hired Michael Rogers as Chief Technology Officer for FedEx Freight. Mike brings vast external technology experience, having most recently spent time in the fuel supply and the retail sectors. Additionally, Eddie Klang will serve as the FedEx Freight's Chief Human Resources and Legal Officer. Eddie brings deep expertise from his nearly 30-year career at FedEx, most recently as Corporate Vice President for Corporate Governance securities and tax law.\nMike Lyons has worked at FedEx Freight since 2007, will serve us sa Chief specialized services and Commercial Officer; and Clint McCoy who has worked at FedEx freight for nearly 30 years will be the Chief Operating Officer. I'm confident that this mix of strong external FedEx Corporation and fixed freight talent will set up FedEx Freight for success.\nBefore I wrap up, I want to provide early perspective on how we are thinking about the current quarter and the year ahead. The global demand environment remains volatile. We're staying close to our customers to help them plan and adapt as they navigate trade policy changes, and we are actively matching our capacity with demand as the environment evolves. John will walk through our expectations for the first quarter of this fiscal year. We remain focused on what we can control. For FY '26, we expect to achieve $1 billion of transformation-related savings which includes DRIVE and Network 2.0. I again want to thank the team for the innovative and mission-critical work they're doing to make supply chains smarter for everyone. This work has resulted in a solid finish to the fiscal year. And importantly, it's translating to better outcomes for our customers in a very complex operating environment.\nNow let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer\n\nThank you, Raj. I am proud of how we are helping our customers navigate this challenging period, and I think it's fitting to share that so too is our founder. Just this past Friday, Fred told me how fun it was to watch the team work. And then he saw and felt the momentum building in the business. He was excited about our e-commerce value proposition, the power of our clearance capabilities and of course, the growth in global air freight and health care. I want to commend the entire organization for our focus on creating vast differentiation and showing up for our customers.\nDelivering the Purple Promise has served us well for the last 50 years, the last quarter and undoubtedly, it will serve us well in fiscal year '26. Taking a closer look at our Q4 revenue performance. Consolidated revenue was up 1% with a 1% increase at Federal Express and a continued weakness as expected at FedEx Freight. For both segments, a better-than-expected may more than offset a softer than expected April. Looking at our volume trends by service. U.S. domestic volumes held up well throughout the quarter, with growth accelerating in late April and May. Our nationwide coverage and our speed advantage are helping us win new profitable business. We saw 6% volume growth across our U.S. domestic peripheral services. From an international perspective, our volume trends closely tracked global trade headlines. March performance was solid and in line with our expectations. Following the April 2 tariff announcement, customer concerns increased and as a result, volumes softened. In early May, upon tariff implementation, China to U.S. volumes deteriorated sharply and remained weak throughout the rest of the quarter.\nOur international export revenue was flat, reflecting the tariff-related impact on our Trans-Pacific trade lane. I do want to take a moment to commend our clearance team at the Memphis hub for their success in navigating this environment and maintaining excellent service. This was an impressive feat given customs entries in May were double the January to April average. Within our Freight segment, shipments remained pressured, but the year-over-year declines moderated sequentially, with average daily shipments down 1% year-over-year in Q4 compared to down 5% in Q3 and down 8% in Q2.\nIn fact, average daily shipments up 8.3% sequentially was our greatest Q4 over Q3 increase since fiscal year '21. As we prepare for the freight spin-off, we are continuing to execute on our commercial strategy with an emphasis on improved service and pricing discipline, and we continue to build out our dedicated sales force. The pricing environment continues to improve. At Federal Express, total U.S. domestic package yield was up slightly with strength in our priority services offset by mix shift in softer yields in deferred and ground economy. Maintaining pricing discipline remains a top priority. International export package yield declined 1%, driven by lower international economy yields, partially offset by an 11% yield increase for international priority. Within global air freight, we are pleased to see higher revenue per pound. This is a direct result of our Tricolor strategy, which is designed to increase network flexibility, reduce costs, and importantly, support profitable growth in the international export freight market.\nThanks to Tricolor, we delivered 5% growth in international air freight revenue in Q4 with a high profit flow-through. At FedEx Freight, I remain encouraged by the continued increase in revenue per hundredweight, up 1%, signaling a continued commitment to revenue quality. Total revenue per shipment declined 1% due to lower fuel surcharge and lower weight per shipment. Looking ahead, as global trade policies continue to evolve and companies adjust their shipping patterns, we are well positioned to support our customers and adapt as needed. Our current expectation is for flat to 2% revenue growth in the first quarter. This range includes approximately $570 million of idiosyntratics revenue headwinds from the expiration of the U.S. postal service contract and recent trade disruption.\nWhere we land in the range largely depends on how the U.S. domestic revenue at FECs evolves. The top end of the range assumes current favorable U.S. domestic trends at FEC continue through Q1. The lower end of our range assumes incremental pressure to U.S. domestic demand. Internationally, we expect revenue from the China to U.S. lane to remain pressured, consistent with what we saw exiting Q4. At Freight, we forecast revenue to decline slightly year-over-year in the first quarter.\nNow a quick update on our commercial strategy. Our focus is paying off, translating to better customer experiences and financial outcomes. Our emphasis on B2B, small and medium-sized businesses, Europe and airfreight is a deliberate approach to capitalize on high-margin market opportunities while diversifying our revenue streams globally. Within B2B, health care and automotive remain important verticals for us. We exited FY '25 with $9 billion in health care-related revenue, which drove growth in our U.S. priority volumes. In Q4, we became the first global integrator to achieve an important pharma-related certification, known as [indiscernible]. This is for ground handling across our express hubs and ramps. This marks a significant milestone in our commitment to quality, compliance and leadership in pharmaceutical logistics. It validates the strength of FedEx's quality management system and our ability to deliver end-to-end logistics services in compliance with an increasingly complex and highly regulated pharmaceutical industry.\nAs we look to further penetrate the high-margin health care segment, I am confident this achievement will unlock even more opportunity for us. Within automotive, we recently created a distinct vertical with its own dedicated leadership team, and we are off to a strong start. We were recently awarded GM Supplier of the Year Award for the 21st year in a row. Our focus for fiscal year '26 will be growing within the $18 billion high-margin segment of the North American automotive market, a subsector focused on premium services that supports automotive supply chain.\nAdditionally, small and medium customers remain central to our commercial strategy. FedEx Rewards, our loyalty program is unique in the industry and has become an important gateway for small and medium-sized businesses. I am especially pleased with our revenue growth in the U.S. as the rewards program enrollment increased 8% year-over-year. The rewards program creates a more seamless, personalized customer experience that drives customer loyalty.\nI want to again thank our team for continuing to execute on our commercial strategies. Their efforts are improving the customer experience, helping our customers navigate this period of volatility and and positioning us well for sustainable growth that flows through to the bottom line.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn W. Dietrich\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\n\nThank you, Brie, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to share that the culture and extraordinary business that Fred Smith created unconditionally drew me to FedEx. I always greatly respected Fred from my earliest encounters with him in the industry. and I'm grateful and beyond privileged to have worked directly with him these past 2 years.\nNow turning to the quarter. I'm very pleased with what we achieved in Q4. This includes the actions we've taken to increase stockholder value, our discipline on CapEx and the transformation we advanced all while navigating a very complex environment. Our Q4 results reflect our ability to flex our network, onboard new revenue and manage costs. On a consolidated basis, we delivered $18.19 in adjusted earnings per share for FY '25, achieving 2 consecutive years of earnings growth despite the prolonged freight industry softness, 2 fewer operating days, the expiration of the U.S. Postal Service contract and extraordinary weather events.\nFederal Express also posted higher FY '25 results year-over-year despite significant headwinds with adjusted operating income of $151 million on $641 million in revenue growth. This strong flow-through to the bottom line demonstrates the powerful leverage inherent in our business, a reality that will become even more apparent when we see a recovery in the industrial economy. While consolidated adjusted operating income declined to $121 million, this was due to FedEx Freight results, which continue to be challenged due to the prolonged weakness in the industrial economy. Taking a closer look at consolidated Q4 performance on a year-over-year basis, we delivered an 8% increase in adjusted operating income on a 1% increase in revenue.\nThese results reflect our ability to grow revenue profitably as well as our ongoing commitment to managing our cost structure. Our revenue performance includes recent health care wins, which are part of our strategy to profitably grow in B2B.\nAdjusted operating income increased by $147 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 60 basis points. We achieved this result despite a $165 million headwind and from 1 fewer operating day, a $120 million headwind from the U.S. Postal Service contract expiration and pressures from the global trade policy changes. At FEC, adjusted operating income increased by $136 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded 70 basis points. This was driven by continued drive savings, increased U.S. and international export volume and base yield growth. These drivers were partially offset by operating expense inflation and the headwinds I mentioned earlier. Regarding our Asia international export exposure, the bilateral China to U.S. lane represents around 2.5% of consolidated revenue and is our most profitable intercontinental lane. Due to escalating trade barriers in the quarter, we experienced a material headwind on our Asia to U.S. lane, largely driven by China.\nNotably, this was not fully factored into our prior March outlook as certain tariffs were not yet announced and implemented until after our last earnings release. at freight operating income fell by $30 million and operating margin declined 40 basis points. Freight's operating income also reflects a $33 million gain on sale of a legacy facility. As anticipated, our freight performance improved sequentially, and our team maintained pricing discipline as base yields continue to be a tailwind to the quarter and the fiscal year.\nIn addition to our segment results, our fourth quarter results include a noncash impairment charge of $21 million related to our decision to permanently retire an additional 12 aircraft including 7 A300s, 3 MD-11s and 2 757s as well as 8 related engines. Over the last 3 years, we've removed a net 31 jet aircraft from our fleet which is a 7% reduction versus FY '22. These actions are aligned with the company's fleet reduction and modernization strategy as we continue to improve global network efficiency and better align air network capacity with anticipated demand.\nNow moving on to capital allocation. I'm extremely pleased that we both significantly reduced our capital intensity and returned $4.3 billion to stockholders in FY '25. This was well above our previous $3.8 billion commitment. During the fourth quarter, we opportunistically purchased an additional $500 million in shares, bringing our total to $3 billion in share repurchases for the year, and we remain committed to returning capital to stockholders. We increased our dividend by 5% in FY '26, making this the fifth consecutive year with a dividend increase. We will also continue to repurchase shares and expect the combination of our fiscal 2026 share repurchases and dividend payments to approximate adjusted free cash flow. We also significantly reduced our CapEx spending in FY '25 by approximately $1.1 billion for a total of $4.1 billion compared to $5.2 billion in FY '24. This marks our lowest capital spending in over 10 years.\nAdditionally, our CapEx as a percentage of revenue was 4.6%, the lowest level since FedEx Corp was established in fiscal year '98. We're currently planning for FY '26 CapEx to be approximately $4.5 billion, of which $700 million relates to Network 2.0 investment. And we plan to further reduce aircraft CapEx to approximately $1 billion this fiscal year, a level we plan to maintain for the next several years. I'm also very proud that our adjusted free cash flow conversion from net income was extremely strong at nearly 90%, representing a step change versus prior years, driven by our lower capital intensity.\nOn this point, approximately 85% of our FY '25 CapEx was related to modernization of our aircraft and vehicle fleets as well as optimization and automation of our network. We continue to prioritize investments that support increasing efficiency and reducing our cost to serve as opposed to capacity expansion. This capital spending approach signals an inflection in the life of our business as we can now further reap the benefits of our global network and seek to increase stockholder returns and improve ROIC in the years ahead. And we're translating our adjusted free cash flow at parity into stockholder returns.\nWith respect to pension contributions, in FY '26, we're planning for up to $600 million of voluntary pension contributions to our U.S. qualified plans, which are 103% funded as of the end of FY '25. And finally, we have $1.3 billion of debt maturing in FY '26, which we expect to pay off or refinance.\nNow I'd like to walk you through our expectations for Q1. As we've talked about, the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain. Our outlook is, therefore, based on current tariff rates, recent trends we're seeing as well as that which we're hearing from our customers. As Brie shared, we're currently planning for consolidated Q1 revenue to be in the range of flat to up 2% including $170 million adjusted operating income headwind from international export due to global trade policy impacts.\nThis translates to a Q1 adjusted EPS range of $3.40 to $4 which includes approximately $200 million in transformation benefits. We also anticipate our quarterly effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. At $3.70 of adjusted EPS, the midpoint of our range, we anticipate a 1% increase in Federal Express revenue with adjusted operating margin up modestly. Also at the midpoint, we anticipate FedEx Freight revenue to be down slightly with a modest decline in operating margin.\nNow turning to our FY '26 Q1 operating income bridge, which shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our outlook. This bridge reflects adjusted operating income of $1.25 billion, which is equivalent to $3.70 of adjusted EPS. For revenue, net of costs, we expect $130 million tailwind, reflecting our assumptions of operating expense inflation and revenue growth mostly U.S. domestic.\nWe're forecasting $170 million in headwinds from international export, as I mentioned, driven by the global trade policy impacts primarily on our transpacific lane, Lastly, we anticipate $120 million in headwinds from the expiration of the U.S. post-service contract. Partially offsetting these headwinds is $200 million of benefit from our transformation initiatives.\nNow turning to some important considerations for FY '26. We expect around $1 billion in incremental year-over-year benefit from our transformation-related efforts, which includes structural cost reduction benefits from DRIVE and Network 2.0, we anticipate a moderate ramp of these savings throughout the fiscal year. In addition, U.S. Postal Service contract expiration will be a near-term headwind. For modeling purposes, I want to note that the significant revenue and operating income headwind is limited to the first 4 months of FY '26 and likely to skew typical seasonality. As a reminder, small upticks in B2B revenues can result in significant incremental flow-through. So if we see a recovery in the industrial economy, we're well positioned to see strong leverage to operating income.\nIn addition to our Q1 outlook, we remain committed to being transparent and resuming our full year outlook for adjusted EPS, effective tax rate and capital returns as visibility improves. Now that we're into a new fiscal year, we're very excited about the significant value creation opportunities ahead for both FedEx Corporation and the future stand-alone FedEx Freight company. In that regard, we plan to host a FedEx Corporation Investor Day in Memphis in early calendar 2026, where we'll share more details on our long-term strategy.\nThis will include a detailed update on our strategic initiatives, such as Network 2.0, which represents a $2 billion savings opportunity from our physical network integration and associated One FedEx savings by the end of fiscal 2017. Additionally, we'll continue to progress our freight separation plans and expect to spin off freight in June of 2026. We also look forward to hosting a FedEx Freight Investor Day next spring prior to the spin-off.\nIn closing, while FY '26 presents unique challenges and uncertainties, what remains unchanged is our commitment to driving stockholder returns and building a more profitable FedEx. Our transformation initiatives, capacity reductions and successful commercial strategies are helping us navigate the current environment and position us extremely well for when demand recovers. I'm confident in the value creation opportunity that remains in front of us. And with that, operator, let's please open it up for questions.",

Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Jeni, and welcome to your first earnings call at FedEx. We are happy to have you on board leading the investor relations team. Before we discuss the quarter, I would like to congratulate Rob Carter on his upcoming retirement, which we announced last week. He has served as CIO for the last 24 years, leading FedEx in modernizing our IT infrastructure. I'm immensely grateful to Rob for his numerous contributions in establishing FedEx as an innovative, data-driven, and a people-focused company. We thank him for his dedication and service to FedEx over the years and wish him well in his upcoming retirement. Thank you also to the FedEx team for their exceptional work in Q3 by providing superior service for customers and delivering strong results, all while advancing our transformation initiatives.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion in a declining revenue environment. This is a very positive dynamic and a unique one in our industry. It demonstrates clear progress on our transformation and ability to manage what's within our control through Drive. We're strengthening our value proposition, improving the customer experience, and increasing profitability. This progress supports our long-term goals for sustainable margin expansion, improvements in ROIC, and value creation for our stockholders. Now turning to the details. Our transformation is driving continued improvements in adjusted operating income, margins, and earnings per share. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 16% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin expansion of 90 basis points compared to the prior year, even as revenue declined 2%. Adjusted operating income growth was driven by continued strength at Ground and improvement at Express.\nAt the segment level, I'm particularly pleased with the results at Ground, where adjusted operating income increased 14% on 1% revenue growth, and adjusted operating margin improved to over 11% in the quarter. This reflects continued progress, controlling expenses, and effective yield management, including the ramping benefits from Drive. At Freight, the team's continued focus on profitable growth and cost management delivered strong margins and mitigated year-over-year volume challenges. Service levels remain exceptionally high, demonstrating our differentiated execution capabilities. We're also making progress at Express, where adjusted operating income increased, enabled by our ability to remove structural costs. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our fiscal 2024 adjusted EPS range while narrowing the range to $17.25 to $18.25.\nIn fact, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings above the midpoint of the range we shared last June, despite full-year revenue expectations that have deteriorated significantly over the past nine months. This is clear evidence of our ability to execute. Turning to the express business, it is my top priority to continue to make the changes necessary to align our air network with an evolving demand environment and unlock the full profit opportunity. While we have made progress at express this quarter, there are several areas we're aggressively working to address in order to accelerate profit improvement: service mix, network utilization, continued inflation, and other cost headwinds. First, with respect to service mix, we're seeing a clear international market shift towards deferred services.\nThis is tied in part to the rapid growth of many of our e-commerce customers, where we are a critical enabler of global trade, offering unique solutions for our customers. More on how we're addressing this mix shift shortly. Second, weakness in global trade continues to constrain demand in our international business, which has remained challenged for longer than expected. As such, we're continuing to proactively realign our air network to match capacity to demand. And third, this quarter, Express experienced over $200 million of inflationary pressure on a year-over-year basis. We offset this with benefits from Drive as well as responsible headcount management. The dynamics I just outlined create significant opportunities for us to improve our network utilization. Last quarter, we introduced our Tricolor strategy.\nUltimately, this network design will enable us to improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system, put the right product in the right network, taking advantage of our continental surface networks in Europe and our market-leading FedEx Freight LTL network in the United States, and profitably penetrate new market segments at the right cost structure, including the premium air freight market. As we move forward, we are managing the execution of Tricolor with the rigor and discipline of Drive, and this will be a key element to our success. Moving to another area of opportunity. In Europe, we continue to improve our service levels and focus on commercial execution. However, the B2B environment remains challenged. In this context, we are making progress on Drive, on track to generate $600 million of savings in fiscal year 2025 and seeking further profit optimization opportunities.\nAs we have mentioned in previous calls, we are also experiencing a continued headwind for the United States Postal Service, which has reduced volume. Despite this volume and revenue drawdown, our service obligations to the USPS remain fixed. At Express and across the business, Drive remains a key enabler of improved profitability both in the near and the long term as we change the way we work and identify areas for structural cost reduction. In Q3, we delivered $550 million of benefits from Drive, offsetting the impact of revenue declines and cost pressures. I'm encouraged by the progress across all three categories. This includes $290 million in our surface network, $110 million of savings in air network, and international operations, and $150 million of G&A.\nGiven the progress we have made year to date, we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in permanent cost reduction benefits from Drive this fiscal year and are highly confident in the additional $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2025. The work we are doing with Drive is also helping advance planning for Network 2.0. This quarter, we rolled out our new surface operations leadership structure. Under this new structure, leaders and their teams will be responsible for all express and ground package operations and facilities in their respective divisions, regions, and districts. This will enhance operational execution and offer greater insights into the package business overall with accountability at all levels. More broadly, we have now implemented Network 2.0 in over 50 locations, with dozens more to follow in calendar 2024, all while maintaining outstanding service.\nAs a reminder, we will begin the rollout of Canada in April and expect to complete this transition by October of 2024. As part of our transformation, we are on track to complete the consolidation of FedEx operating companies into one streamlined and simplified organization, creating efficiencies as we build a stronger, more profitable enterprise. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services will consolidate into Federal Express Corporation. The work we're doing to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network is translating into direct improvements in our customer offering and profitability. When severe weather hits, it can cause a domino effect of delays and reduce service levels across our network.\nWhile we have always used data analytics to assess the effect of weather events, our new weather contingency playbook developed by our planning, engineering, and Dataworks teams enhances the process by leveraging predictive capabilities to proactively divert storm-bound volumes across our networks. By combining the power of digital insights and predictive analytics with our physical network, we effectively mitigated the impact of the January winter storms that hit our Express hub in Memphis by shifting Memphis-bound Express volume to Ground, our Freight, at the origin location. Despite this year's event having a longer impact on Memphis operations when compared to the weather event in February 2023, our network recovery was twice as fast. This quarter, we also announced a significant initiative, FDX, the fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey from demand to returns.\nIt'll provide real-time visibility to help our customers optimize and grow their business, leveraging our analytical capabilities and data from the 15 million packages we deliver every day. I'm excited to have Sriram Krishnaswamy serving as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective 1 July 2024. His proven track record of driving optimization and innovation for our business through data and insights, combined with his deep knowledge of the network, will be critical to moving FedEx forward as we become a data-driven digital-first company. As I look across the business and these financial results, there are clear signs of progress on our transformation. Our strategy is generating results, and we are well placed to maintain our leadership position while delivering improving financial outcomes. Together, we remain focused and committed to our long-term goals, supporting the creation of significant long-term value for our stockholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank our FedEx team for strong performance during the peak season. As a result of their hard work and commitment, we once again delivered the best service offering in the industry. We continued to execute on our commercial priorities with a focus on revenue quality while maintaining our industry-leading service. As a result, we took profitable share in the quarter at market rates, and we continued to retain the vast majority of the volume we gained from UPS in the second half of 2023. Our unmatched value proposition has enabled recent high-value wins in the semiconductor, healthcare, and aerospace industries. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to compete and grow further in the high-margin areas of the market.\nLooking now by geography, in the United States, conditions have been weaker than we anticipated, and internationally, we continue to see softness. We, however, remain very focused on strong commercial execution. Taking a look at Q3 revenue performance by segment, at FedEx Ground, revenue was up about 1% year over year on a modest yield improvement and flat volumes. Our team remains disciplined on growing with the right customers and mix while offering the best value proposition in the industry. At FedEx Freight, revenue declined 3%. While volume decreased compared to last year, the year-over-year decline moderated on a sequential basis. Revenue was also negatively affected by lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in weight per shipment, although the decline was partially offset by higher base yields.\nAnd at FedEx Express, revenue was down 2% year over year, driven by continued volume softness, lower fuel and demand surcharges, and a mixed shift towards deferred and e-commerce products. The actions Raj outlined will allow us to profitably grow this business while continuing to deliver excellent service for our customers. Turning to our monthly volume trends during the quarter, broadly speaking, volumes are stabilizing as we lap weaker demand from a year ago. International export increased 4% in the quarter, driven by a 29% growth in international economy, which, of course, is a market reset we expected. Freight shipments declined, but they continued to moderate sequentially. As Raj mentioned, postal volumes were a headwind in the quarter. Our current contract with the United States Postal Service expires on 29 September 2024.\nWe have made significant progress in negotiations for a new contract that aligns with our ongoing network transformation plan while providing the USPS with the operational reliability and outstanding service we have delivered for them for more than two decades. A new multi-year agreement would provide a more efficient network with service to fewer markets. It would allow us to better adjust our overall network to demand. We, of course, will let you know when we have an update. We continue to operate in a competitive but rational market environment. During the quarter, yield trends were similar to what we saw last quarter, with dynamics remaining mixed across the segments. At FedEx Express, yields remained pressured due to a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of lower-yielding e-commerce and deferred products. Yield was also pressured by increased capacity in the market.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery, partially offset by ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 1%, driven by lower fuel surcharges and lower weights. In January, we rolled out a 5.9% GRI, and importantly, we've been able to capture a high percentage of that rate increase. During peak, our holiday peak residential surcharges enabled us to effectively offset higher costs, delivering $120 million in profit. We are very confident we have the right strategy in place, balancing both volume and yield growth. We are building our network of the future with digital and data-driven solutions that simplify the customer experience and further strengthen our best-in-class customer offerings.\nFor example, earlier this month, we enhanced our healthcare offering with more powerful capabilities to prioritize critical life-saving healthcare shipments above other volume within the network. Healthcare customers now have the ability to select monitoring and intervention service options. They cover categories such as temperature requirements and vaccines, and they do this at the package level. Each express shipment now includes specific healthcare identifiers so that if we need to intervene, we are able to do it with more speed and more precision. And of course, in January, we announced the FDX Commerce platform. FDX connects the entire customer journey by offering end-to-end e-commerce solutions, making it easier for companies to grow demand, increase conversion, optimize fulfillment, and streamline their returns. The FDX platform will enable us to enhance our long-standing relationships with merchants of all sizes to help them optimize and grow their business.\nWe have opened a private preview for select brands and retailers, and based on their feedback, I am incredibly excited about the official launch later this year. In closing, I'm very proud of our entire global team and how they continue to deliver outstanding service as we navigate a very dynamic market. With that, I'll turn it over to John to cover our financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. Our third-quarter results reflect ongoing progress on our Drive initiatives, as well as our continued focus on service and revenue quality. As a result of these efforts, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion for the third quarter in a row, despite declining revenue in a challenging market environment.\nTaking a closer look at our performance in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income increased by $192 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points. At Express, adjusted operating income increased by $134 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. The benefits of Drive initiatives and an additional operating date more than offset lower revenue. At Ground, the team delivered another quarter of strong results. Adjusted operating income increased by $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points due to cost reductions and yield improvement. Despite slightly lower volumes and in an inflationary environment, ground cost per package was flat year over year, with lower linehaul expenses and improved dock productivity offsetting higher first and last-mile costs.\nAt Freight, while operating margin remained strong, operating income declined by $46 million and operating margin declined by 170 basis points, driven by lower fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment, and lower shipments. These results also reflect the lapping of a $30 million facility gain last year, partially offset by the benefit of an additional operating day during the quarter. Looking at the quarter overall, weather had an immaterial year-over-year effect on profitability. Before turning to the outlook, I'd like to spend a few moments updating you on our cost reduction initiatives, including Drive and more specifically G&A. As an initial matter and as part of responsible headcount management, we have reduced our workforce by nearly 22,000 over the last year and expect additional opportunities in the future as we move forward with our transformation.\nWithin G&A, we continue to make significant changes to how we approach areas like procurement and technology so that we are a more efficient digitally-led organization. In addition, global functional alignment provides savings opportunities. I'm pleased that we have achieved $350 million of G&A savings year-to-date, including $150 million in the third quarter. Taking a closer look at sourcing and procurement, we've continued to evolve the sourcing and procurement function from a segregated and regional structure to a centralized global organization that will manage most third-party spend across the entire enterprise. With new leaders in place, we're developing new category strategies and have already identified about 20 discrete categories that will manage centrally in cooperation with functional leaders. By implementing these new strategies at the enterprise level, we'll have tighter spend oversight, we'll better leverage our scale and buying power, and generate significant cost savings.\nOverall, I'm very pleased with our enterprise-wide Drive progress this quarter, and we will deliver $1.8 billion in savings for the full fiscal year. Now, turning to our fiscal year outlook, and as Raj shared earlier, based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range while narrowing our outlook from the prior range of $17.50 to $18.50 to $17.25 to $18.25. At the midpoint of the narrowed range, we continue to assume a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue for the full year. As always, we'll closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory restocking, global trade, inflation, and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected revenue.\nWith regard to our fourth-quarter expectations, as implied by our outlook range, we expect year-over-year profit improvement despite lapping the onset of certain structural benefits executed in last year's fourth quarter at Express and Ground. Looking on a sequential basis, the leap day in the third quarter affects our typical seasonality. At the segment level, we're maintaining our full-year expectations for a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express, adjusted margin improvement at Ground, and strong but lower year-over-year margin at Freight. At Express, we're looking at every aspect of the business, including taking a fresh look at additional opportunities to improve our European business, and we're confident in our ability to unlock more value at Express and across all our businesses as we continue to seek optimization opportunities. Our bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full-year outlook.\nFor illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, the equivalent to $17.75 of adjusted EPS, as the midpoint of our narrowed outlook range. To walk the bridge to $6.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming that revenue net of cost increases is up $200 million, that we experience $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges diminish and product mix continues shifting toward deferred, variable compensation increases by $300 million, and that these pressures are more than offset by $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from Drive. At the midpoint, we would expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to increase approximately 17% despite revenue declining by a low single-digit percentage.\nAs I've discussed on prior calls, we remain focused on reducing our capital intensity and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns, as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation, and improving return on invested capital. Our capital investment priorities will be on improving efficiency, modernizing facilities, and optimizing our network. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.4 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $4 billion, and we now anticipate capital spend of $5.4 billion for the full year, which is down over $700 million from last year and down $300 million from our prior forecast of $5.7 billion.\nWe also continue to expect aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2026, and we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue will keep declining in the future as we reduce our facilities footprint through Network 2.0 and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx beyond fiscal year 2026. We currently have 37 jet aircraft parked, which is up from 20 last quarter, and as previously communicated, we will retire nine more MD-11s in Q4. Consistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction in the third quarter, bringing our total share repurchases for the first nine months of the fiscal year to $2 billion.\nWe expect to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock in the fourth quarter, bringing total fiscal year 2024 repurchases to $2.5 billion, while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan. I'm also pleased to announce that our board of directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which augments the $600 million that remains available for repurchase under the $5 billion 2021 authorization. This reinforces our commitment to support long-term stockholder returns. Overall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in continuing to improve profitability in a challenging revenue environment. We have more work to do, but I'm encouraged by the commitment and focus I've seen from our teams to advance our transformation and provide our customers and stockholders with even greater value. With that, let's open it up for questions. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your telephone keypad. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to just one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Today's first question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nAnlayst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks for the update on Drive. If I did the math right, I think there's about $385 million or so left for the final quarter of this fiscal year. Maybe talk to where you think this money or the savings, which buckets are going to go to: surface, air, and G&A.\nI'm also just sort of curious on the surface side, how much of that is actually tied to Express surface stuff? Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo thank you, Jordan, for the question. It's John. I'm not going to speak specifically to the number you raised with regard to the remainder of the year on Drive, except to say that we are committed to the $1.8 billion for the fiscal year. I think it's safe to assume that's spread across all of our operating companies. With regard to your question on surface, it's predominantly ground. But as we continue to migrate towards Network 2.0 and through our Drive initiatives, there's a lot of complementary work that's being done together by the teams. So those savings are being realized both at Express and ground.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nAnalyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a bit about the trajectory of the margin on Express. Excuse me, the February quarter was quite a bit better than expected. I'm just wondering, how do we think about that as you go into fiscal 2025? I think two specific items you did mention. One, the $600 million improvement in Europe that I think would go to Express and just kind of visibility on that. Also how we should think about postal, where you had some comments, and I think that's been characterized as a $400 million headwind. Is it reasonable to say that that's $400 million you kind of add back to the number? Anyway, just some broader comments on Express and some of the bigger items. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nGreat. Thanks, Tom. It's John again. Yeah, we're quite pleased with the progress we've made at Express and the margin expansion. As Raj mentioned, this is all of our primary focus to continue that expansion, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for us in drive. With regard to Europe, that will be a key focus area of ours, and we are committed to the $600 million that you mentioned. The postal service, certainly, as we're negotiating towards a deal, if that deal were to materialize, you would expect that it's mutually beneficial for both sides. We're looking forward to bringing that to closure as soon as possible. All of that will contribute to our ability to continue to expand our margins at our largest sector at Express.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nAnalyst, Evercore\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie had mentioned a competitive but rational market environment as it relates to pricing and yield. We are several quarters into the demand downturn here, and of course, there's been some competitive issues directly in your business. As we look forward, if we continue to kind of bounce along this bottom on demand internationally, but I think more specifically to the United States, does the pricing environment start to waver at all a bit? Do we really need a macro tailwind before we can see maybe a stabilization or re-acceleration of yield?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nHi, Jonathan. Thanks for the question. I think from a competitive environment perspective, yes, it is competitive, but I don't think that's particularly different in our industry. We're very used to a competitive environment, and the market does feel quite rational to me.\nWhen we look at the yield focus for the team, I'm actually pleased with the discipline of both the sales and the pricing organization. If you remove the fuel headwind across each one of our segments, Express, Ground, and FedEx Freight, we have kind of low single-digit yield improvement at the base. So I think the team is continuing to execute on our revenue quality strategy. And from a momentum perspective, we do have some headwinds this year that will diminish next year, especially in the international market. If you think about calendar year 2023, from an air freight perspective, the overall air freight market yields decreased between 30% and 40%. That is not going to repeat next year. And then, of course, from an international demand surcharge, it will continue to be a headwind in FY 2025, but less of a headwind than this fiscal year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nAnalyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my question. So in June, you'll complete the legal consolidation of Express, ground, and services as part of the One FedEx effort. Can you give us a look at how that will change, how you manage the business starting in July, how it will change, how you report your financials and operating stats? And can you give us some assurance that we'll get a deep history of comparable financial and operating data to help track your progress as you get further into the operational side of the integration in 2025, 2026, and 2027? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Bascome. And let me start, and then John can add on to this. First of all, we are well on track to complete our consolidation of FedEx operating companies.\nThis has been a lot of great work that's already been done and into one streamlined and simplified organization. I think two words kind of describe this move. One is efficiency, and the other one is effectiveness. I think we are looking forward to the structure that actually moves us forward on both fronts. And I think at the end of the day, these transformation efforts will set us up to drive improved performance and profitability over the long term. I'll give it to John to talk about the rest of it.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. And from a reporting standpoint, we'll be providing more details regarding the new reporting structure as we go forward. But I think it's fair to say that we'll continue to break out both ground and Express yield and volume by service as we currently do, and frankly, continue to provide sufficient data for you all to monitor the performance in those business segments.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nAnalyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. So Raj, in your prepared remarks, you talked about the Tricolor strategy and going after the premium air freight market. Could you talk a little bit more about what that is? I guess I'd always been under the assumption that you guys were the premium part of the air freight market. And how does this realignment actually open up some revenue that maybe you don't have access to today? Thank you, David.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I think I'm going to take a minute here to talk about Tricolor because I think it's a good opportunity. So bear with me for the time I'm going to take here. Firstly, Tricolor is a fundamental redesign of our network to improve the utilization of assets, our ROIC, profitability, and our operating margin. First and foremost, our overall capacity will be determined by the demand environment, and Tricolor will allow us to better flex our capacity to match demand. Now, within that capacity is when we'll break it into three networks: Purple, Orange, and White, we call it, and that cater to the different cohorts of traffic. The idea is to move the right product in the right network while reducing the cost to serve.\nThe Purple network will be a highly optimized and a leaner network designed to move international priority parcel volume that protects our value proposition in different geographies. Now, this network now becomes much more parcel-centric, will have significantly better service, but also density. That density will improve the revenue per position and revenue per flight. Now, turning to the Orange network, that will cater to the premium freight traffic. These are FedEx planes that will operate off-cycle from the Purple system, which allows a few things. Firstly, it allows us the ability, once again, to maximize density and asset utilization. It also decongests hubs and improves service. But most importantly, it allows a truck-fly truck model that reduces the cost to serve. In this context, it should be noted that we are fully leveraging the existing capacity in our trucking networks in the US and Europe.\nPrior to fiscal 2024, we haven't really moved any international freight shipments in our market-leading LTL network with FXF. Now it's already beginning to change, but in Tricolor, it'll take full hold here. So by doing so, we reduce the cost to serve, and we're able to target more of the premium air freight segment. Now, I'm going to coin a new term. Think of it as the \"global LTL segment.\" That's what this is about. Now, as you rightly asked, are we adding capacity to go up and lower yield in traffic? The answer is no. We are going to gate the overall capacity by the premium demand. It should also be noted that 20% of the global air freight shipments approximately drive about 80% of the weight, which is a primary target for freight forwarders.\nWe're going to focus on the other 80% that will readily work with the model I described. So the White network then is primarily used for passenger belly capacity to move lower yielding e-commerce and deferred traffic. So these three networks working in concert with high technological orchestration is what we call Tricolor. Let me just reinforce again that it helps the baseline productivity. It improves our existing asset utilization and makes the entire system more efficient. And we're going to manage the execution of Tricolor with the rigor of Drive to ensure success. So again, thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nAnalyst, J.P. Morgan\n\nHey, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to come back and maybe better understand the moving pieces for Express during the quarter.\nObviously, quite a strong result, but there's oftentimes some impact from fuel incentive compensation, I think, was a bit of a tailwind here as that changed a little bit as well. So maybe, and then weather, that was a pretty significant surprise considering it was as difficult as you mentioned, Raj, but it seems like it really didn't affect the network. So maybe, John, if you can unpack some of the moving pieces, and then Raj, if you can comment on the durability of the network, if weather just isn't going to be as big of an impact going forward. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. I'll start with that last point because I think it's worth repeating on the weather piece, which ties into some of our digital strategies and our ability to adapt, to allow for what was substantially poor weather here in Memphis to be rerouted in a manner that had an immaterial impact on us. So as you'd expect, there was a lot of moving parts at Express, both positive and negative. And the levers of Drive, the focus on flight reductions, for example, we had 5% fewer flight hours in the quarter. And there are some additional benefits that flow from that on your cost side because when you're not flying airplanes, you're able to avoid certain maintenance costs.\nThe Air Ops team is doing an exceptional job of managing its cost for aircraft that are grounded, whether you're using what's called green time on engines that are available, limiting your inventory purchases, and so forth. So it's really across the gamut where we're seeing improvement there, all in the midst of some revenue headwinds that Raj and Brie talked about. So we're going to continue to keep our head down and focused on our costs. One of the things I like to say, this is a journey, not a destination, and we still have a long way to go at Express, and it is our primary focus, and look forward to keeping you posted on further improvements.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd Brian, I don't think I have much to add to what John has talked about. I think the idea that we use our latest and greatest in digital tools and the notion that we are now able to look at FedEx as an overarching network and able to move things helps us. Of course, we got to see as the weather patterns; those are very impossible to predict, but I'm just pleased with the work that we did this time around, and we'll continue to get better in this regard.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nAnalyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much, and thank you for the detail on Drive. Jeni, welcome. Look forward to working with you. Real quick, the puck doesn't stay in one place. It's always moving around, and I think you're alluding to this with what you're doing with Drive and Tricolor, but I'm just kind of curious from your perspective.\nWe announced this plan about, what, a year and a half ago back at the analyst meeting almost two years ago. How has the network design and some of the Drive goals when you're completed with this changed since you began this process?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I think we introduced Tricolor in the last conference call, and I think this design is just being put in place as we are speaking here. And so in terms of the Drive commitments, we had originally talked about $4 billion by FY 2025 and less than 50% in FY 2024. We will hit those numbers, right, for FY 2024 and on track for FY 2025. And again, the other part of it, of course, is Network 2.0, which we said $2 billion by FY 2027, and that's underway.\nSo with the focus on making sure that we have structural cost reductions, we have network redesigns with the whole FedEx portfolio in play, and the idea that we are moving forward on our digital tools, all three are working. And I think we got work to do, but we made some good progress. John's going to add more to what I just said. Yeah. I think what I would add to that as well is to your comment about a kind of changing environment. The teams meet weekly on this, and there are some programs that are delivering more than we expected, and there are some programs that are delivering less than we expected. But we're always looking to fill the pipeline as well on additional opportunities. And that's an ongoing project, and that speaks to Drive being part of our culture going forward.\nThat's not going to stop, and we're going to adapt to a changing environment, and I think that will help us as we move forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nAnalyst, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Good evening. So Raj and team, I guess I love the results in terms of the speed here at Express, but I'm confused a bit by the messaging. Last quarter, you talked about seasonal declines at Express and what occurred from Express going down to what should be maybe near breakeven given the seasonal moves, yet it was up so significantly, 130 basis points year over year. Was there a massive shift in the Drive or other programs or your speed of execution?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBecause it sounds like from what you're saying on the targets, nothing's really changed, but I'm just wondering what shifted intra-quarter so much that we're now seeing this quick of an improvement. And then just, I'm sorry, just a side clarification. Did you say Canada was about to be rolled out? Because I thought you had already said that with Hawaii and Alaska, Canada was done. So I just maybe I want to clarify that. Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo hey, Ken, it's John. I'll start with the last one. It's about to be rolled out. It has not been completed, and Brie can talk more about that in a minute. But Q3, as I mentioned earlier, was a combination of things. We saw, while the revenue was soft, we were focused on quality revenue. The cost controls were solid and strong. And there were some other levers that were alluded to earlier. As you can see, volume comp, for example, was down. So that was a contributor. But all these things taken together resulted in us and our focus on improving our results for Q3.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYep. And Ken, I'm just happy to clarify from a Network 2.0 perspective, the Canada plan has not changed. Alaska and Hawaii are done, and we are beginning the rollout of the integration in Canada that will begin this April, and we will be done before peak. And it's on track.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe if we can follow up there on Network 2.0. Raj, I think you mentioned you'd made some management changes on both ground and express service operations in the US. Can you talk maybe a little bit more about that and how that plays into long-term integration?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. Thank you, Brandon. I think first of all, Network 2.0 is on track. Let me just take a step back here. You'll recall that we said we plan to deliver $2 billion in savings by the end of fiscal 2027, and we are taking that measured and deliberate approach. We just rolled out our new leadership structure in the United States, and it's obviously a much more streamlined structure and a much more effective structure, and essentially with the goal of putting one truck and one neighborhood design into action. We are encouraged by the early results we're seeing in the initial rollout as well. So far, Network 2.0 model on the whole achieved approximately 10% reduction in P&D costs and maintained very strong service levels. As we become more tech-enabled in this regard, we'll deliver even greater improvements.\nAs we have already talked about, we are focused on implementation of Canada before peak. I'm also happy to say that I'm very excited about Network 2.0 from a service perspective because it'll drive a better customer pickup experience. So we are on our way, on track, and again, some ways to go.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\n\nScott Group\n\nAnalyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So John, this year is the billionth year of Drive savings, and you've talked about 900 million of offsets, so about 900 million of actual profit. As we think about fiscal 2025, do you think the actual profit improvement should be closer to the 2.2 billion of Drive savings, or do you think there's another year of material offsets to that Drive in fiscal 2025? And then just separately, just no one's asked about Ground yet, and it's by far the biggest part of the business. So if I can just ask one, the margin's 12% this year. Do you think there's further margin improvement to go with Ground? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Scott. And let me start by saying on that 2.2, that's certainly our goal to have that all flow through, but we have to be realistic and understand that a lot of the pressures that we're seeing today are expected to continue for a while. And while we're going to continue to focus on those things within our control, there are certain things outside of our control. And so our goal is to have as much pass-through to the bottom line as possible, and we look forward to keeping you up to speed on that, including when we next talk in June.\nWith regard to ground, exceptional story, exceptional performance from the team. I believe those margins are sustainable, and there's still a number of projects in the pipeline that allow us to continue to grow and expand that business and those margins. So again, that's going to be our focus as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Helane Becker with TD Cowen.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nAnalyst, TD Cowen\n\nOh, thanks very much, operator. And hi, team. I have, I guess, two questions. One is, as part of the whole redesign of the network and the business and collapsing everything into one, have you thought about shifting to a calendar year rather than staying on a May fiscal year? And my second question is maybe for Raj. A lot of investors push back to me about the business, the way you're structuring the business, and I noticed the stock aftermarket was up quite a lot after the earnings release. Why do you think investors are so skeptical of your business plan and aren't willing to give you the credit that maybe you deserve for the changes you've made as speedily as you've made them?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Helane. I'll start on the first part on the calendar year. As you'd expect, with everything going on, there's legal and accounting exercises that need to take place to get us through this next period, including 1 June 2024 date of one FedEx. But I can share it's certainly on my radar to migrate towards that, and we'll keep you posted on developments towards that.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nHelane, as far as your second question, all I can say is that we, as a team, are very much convinced that we have a unique story at FedEx here. The opportunities that we have, one in the industry is one thing, but within the industry, we have a unique opportunity because of the strategies that we have deployed. We started moving early than anybody else. We are performing better than our competition, both on the top and the bottom line. We have a longer runway because of the opportunities we have identified. So we will try to educate as many people as we possibly can on our strategy and where we are, but we are just seeing the early stages of what's possible at FedEx. Any one particular corner sometimes kind of throws you off, but the long-term strategy is sound, and we all believe in it, and it's going to be a good run in the next three, four years.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nAnalyst, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for coming, everyone. Apologies if I missed this, but regarding the USPS contract, kind of when do you expect that to reach provision? Is that something that happens in FY 2024 or 2025? And also can you share how much of the volume has come off already and kind of how much would you dimension kind of that net with the new contract ends up being? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nHi, Ravi. Thanks for the question. It's Brie from a USPS contract. I really can't say more than I already said earlier. In short, we are feeling very positive about the negotiations.\nBoth parties are working eagerly. We're at the table. I think we are days or weeks away from knowing if we will have a contract, not months. And as we have shared previously, their current contract ends on 29 September. So we will know very, very soon, and I'm certainly not at liberty to talk about the details of a future contract.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for the question. I appreciate the incremental color on Network 2.0, and I was hoping you could maybe provide a little bit of color in terms of some of the investments that have to be made in order to execute on the integration, particularly as you enter or you begin the execution in a much larger market like Canada. Any color in terms of maybe lessons learned from your Alaska and Hawaii integration, and then what investments we should expect to see as you implement it in Canada? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation",
    "content2": "Yeah. Thanks, Stephanie. It's John. Yeah, certainly there's going to be some investment required when you're consolidating facilities, particularly sort facilities. But there's also upside in that you're able to reduce your facility's footprint along the way. So that will involve certainly some planning and processes, analysis, and all that. But we're excited actually about the end game here, and that is our overall footprint will benefit. The benefits of that will far exceed the investment and contribute to a really efficient network.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd honestly, from lessons learned, I think the team feels really good about their execution to date. To Raj's point, we have seen kind of the P&D benefits that we anticipated, as well as we've seen the team be able to execute from a service perspective. I will say we are being very disciplined. We're being very methodical, and we are giving customers the advance notice as we go into market. That was one piece of feedback for customers. Even though we anticipate being able to deliver the same level of service with the combined organization as we are as the individual, they do want that notification. And so we, of course, are giving customers that advance notification. And to Raj's point on the positive, I cannot underemphasize how important that single pickup is to our small customer segment. This has been the only feature gap we had to UPS in that segment, and we are about to close it. So I'm pretty excited about that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nAnalyst, Stifel\n\nHey, Raj. Brie, John, and Jeni, welcome to the mix here. I don't know if you've really talked about it, but we've been hearing that you've had some pretty material service improvements, especially at Ground over the last, call it, year or so, and that's despite the cost-savings push. Can you maybe just talk about that a little bit? Where are the service levels today? What are the levers that you're pulling? And then what kind of opportunity do you have to drive corporate growth as a result of that?Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nI love this question. John Smith and Scott Ray are crushing it. When we went back and looked at our Q4, the toughest quarter to deliver, I should say Q4 calendar year, the toughest quarter to deliver awesome service, not only are we faster, I am quite confident we, on those higher standards from a delivery service perspective, we also had better reliability. How are they doing this? It's discipline. It's day in and day out execution. We look at our service metrics every single morning. We talk about net promoter score every week at our revenue management committee. And to Raj's coverage on the integrated leadership team, now the service organization, we absolutely expect to extend that across the entire network, and I just could not be more appreciative of our operators and how well they're doing.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I wanted Brie to answer that question because she holds their feet to the fire every single day. So I'm glad that you heard that answer directly from Brie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nAnalyst, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. Thanks for getting me in. I was hoping you could talk about the opportunity you see just with the e-commerce return business. You've obviously been a big player there, but there's been a lot of changes to the network. Is that now a larger focus? The reason why I asked, obviously, there's been a press report about you re-engaging with Amazon. So just any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. Happy to. I think we've got the best returns portfolio in the market. When you look at our retail coverage as well as our transportation solution, it is best in class. And when we looked at our January numbers, the FedEx Ground returns portfolio did see some healthy growth.\nYou layer that on with the new announcement of our FDX platform. We are going to be the only provider that has not only the physical capabilities but a very comprehensive digital capability. And what do I mean by that? We are going to be able to help all retailers, brands, and merchants process their returns on their websites, manage their exchanges, manage the inventory, integrate their branded tracking and communications to customers. It's a really powerful offering. As I mentioned earlier, we've started to preview this with some customers. We've got some pretty big names and what we're calling our private preview, and I look forward to sharing more results once we do the full launch later in the fall. I think I'll stop there. I'm enthusiastic about this.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nNo, I'll just say this much. When you integrate with those customers, even I can program, and it's a no-code environment. I can set up the returns policy. So if I can do that, anyone can do it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.\n\nScott Schneeberger\n\nAnalyst, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much, everyone. It's basically two questions. One's a follow-up to Bruce's. Brie, I was hoping if you could kind of give an overview of peak season, kind of takeaways, learnings, and then I think we have five less calendar days for the 2024 calendar peak. So just things that you're going to learn and manage ahead of time as it's a much more condensed season. And then the second question for any of you, but just in ground cost per package, it was down 2% in the fiscal second quarter, and you cited improved first and last-mile productivity. Flat here in this quarter, and offset was higher first- and last-mile cost. Just curious if there's anything we should read into there. Thanks for taking them both.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I think from a peak perspective, we're really pleased with how we're managing peak from a service, from a customer, and from a profitability perspective. First and foremost, the team starts literally now for this coming peak. And what do I mean by that? We are already talking to customers about what their peak requirements are for next year, and so that John and Scott have advanced planning. And then, of course, as we get closer to peak, we take the top 100 customers, and we are managing forecasts on a weekly basis. I think some of the integrated planning that we are doing with Dataworks is also incredibly helpful so that we have real-time information.\nWe're not waiting for spreadsheets to be passed over, but we've actually got real-time visibility into some of our largest customers, which has been incredibly helpful. So I don't anticipate us doing much different this year, but more of the same. Again, I also was really pleased with the peak surcharge capture. We are ensuring that the customers that really drive the investment we need in December, we're getting recouped for that cost. So we feel good.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah. I'll speak to the Ground piece. I think one of the drivers of the margin expansion and cost control at Ground was lower linehaul expense that I alluded to. We moved a lot of high-cost and ad hoc external linehaul spend into our scheduled network, and as a result, achieved lower rates on the planned linehaul purchase transportation.\nThis is all part of a broader optimization and ongoing optimization that's taking place in the network through Drive and through Network 2.0. So every aspect, and even those on first and last mile, will be part of that. We're also leveraging the capacity that we have. We do have some additional capacity in the ground network that can absorb additional volumes at no incremental cost. So that should help improve margins as well.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. In closing, we saw continued operating income growth, margin expansion, despite lower revenue for the third consecutive quarter. This is clear evidence that Drive is working.\nWhile these results are encouraging, it is our top priority to maintain momentum and continue to transform our network and the way we work. Once again, let me thank our FedEx team members for their hard work and dedication to delivering outstanding customer service. I'm really proud of the work that we have accomplished as we continue to build the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Thank you for your time and attention today.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."

Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Jeni. We are on the home stretch of Peak, and I want to begin by thanking our team members for their hard work and dedication as we deliver an outstanding holiday season for our customers.\nToday marks an important step in our transformation. Following our assessment of FedEx Freight, which we announced and commenced back in June, we have decided to pursue a full separation of this business, which will result in two industry-leading public companies. Through the separation, we believe we will unlock significant value for stockholders while allowing for continued commercial, operational, and technological cooperation between both businesses.\nThe separation will also enable both companies to benefit from enhanced focus and competitiveness for FedEx. This will ensure strong execution of our near- and longer-term strategic priorities while preserving the benefits Freight and FedEx enjoy from their long-standing connectivity.\nEach independent company will be well capitalized with flexibility to invest in profitable growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders.\nI would like to provide a brief overview on the compelling value proposition of both businesses, starting with FedEx Freight. We're excited to create a leading LTL pure-play, the largest carrier by revenue with the broadest network and the fastest transit times. FedEx Freight has deep relationships with customers who turn to us for our reliability, simplicity, and choice of services. Freight has maintained its leading market share position for a long time and increased operating profit with nearly 25% on average per year over the last five years, expanding operating margin by approximately 1,100 basis points.\nThe team's focus on safety, facility utilization, revenue quality, and operational efficiency has driven this performance and these factors will continue to guide Freight's go forward strategy supported by a strong balance sheet.\nAs a separate company, Freight will be better positioned to unlock its full value potential. Areas where we see the greatest opportunity include first, an expanded dedicated LTL sales force led by Tom Conley, our new VP of LTL Sales. With nearly 30 years of experience, we've already begun to build out this team and we expect to add more than 300 LTL specialists by the time of separation.\nSecond, an enhanced LTL-specific pricing and invoicing system that drives faster speed to market, more intuitive contracts, and is more tailored to this particular market, third, improved freight and FedEx network efficiencies focused on accelerating speed, improving coverage, optimizing touches, and lowering our cost to serve, and four, an LTL-focused automation which will drive efficiency and reduce outside vendor spend. FedEx Freight's portfolio of solutions, which includes both priority and economy services, is also well positioned to benefit from the long-term market dynamics shaping the LTL industry.\nAs we pursue this separation, we will remain focused on customer experience by sustaining or improving service to our customers to ensure the focus and seamless transition. Lance Moll will continue to serve as President of FedEx Freight as we execute on our separation.\nThe long-standing cooperation between FedEx and FedEx Freight will continue through commercial, operational, and data and technology agreements to enable seamless continuity of service and capture existing benefits from the relationship. We have an unmatched customer value proposition with two separate companies. We will ensure commercial collaboration that creates a seamless transition for our customers, especially those that turn to FedEx for all three services.\nFrom an operational perspective, in addition to the network efficiencies I mentioned earlier, Freight will continue to provide line haul for FedEx strategically, including Tricolor, Peak season, and Drayage Support. This requires minimal change as Freight already receives a direct financial benefit from supporting Federal Express via intercompany agreements.\nAdditionally, we will implement shared technology and service agreements to facilitate the transition and beyond. Through these agreements, FedEx will provide Freight with tech platforms that effectively connect the two businesses as needed and ensure business continuity. Given the strong reputation and familiarity of our brand, we plan for the new company to continue to operate under the FedEx Freight name.\nPutting all of this together, customers will continue to enjoy the superior service, speed, and coverage they have come to expect from FedEx Freight while also maintaining access to the unparalleled global ecosystem of FedEx services.\nNow turning to FedEx, we pioneered the express transportation industry over 50 years ago and remain the industry leader today. Customers choose us for our advantaged value proposition enabled by our service, speed, and breadth of coverage. We deliver nearly 17 million packages each business day to over 220 countries and territories. We link more than 99% of the world's GDP. We transport approximately $2 trillion worth of goods every year by connecting three million shippers to 225 million consumers in the US. Our weekend and rural coverage also serve as competitive advantages.\nWe generate over one petabyte of data every single day, which provides insights that drive how we run our company more efficiently, how we serve our customers, and how our customers manage their own supply chains. The ongoing progress at FedEx gives me confidence that this standalone business will continue to thrive into the future.\nDuring and post separation, we will continue to focus on delivering significant value to stockholders through our strategic initiatives, which are cementing our leadership position as the world's best transportation and supply chain technology company. This includes DRIVE, which continues to change the way we work.\nWe are on track to deliver $4 billion in savings by the end of FY 2025 versus the FY 2023 baseline. Network 2.0, which will deliver on the promise of a more efficient network including one truck, one neighborhood, along with consolidated facilities, where we are targeting $2 billion in savings by the end of FY 2027. Tricolor, the redesign of our global air network, which positions us for strategic growth while improving the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system.\nAs a separate company, FedEx will strengthen its leading value proposition with an emphasis on delivering outstanding service, continuing to provide a differentiated offering in premium segments, and remaining focused on higher yielding service, and building on our technology ecosystem to create smarter supply chains for all.\nOur capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We will prioritize maintaining a strong balance sheet and investment grade profile. We will continue to make high return investments in the business while reducing capital intensity and increasing stockholder returns through buybacks and dividends.\nLooking ahead, we expect to execute the separation within approximately 18 months. Claude Russ will lead our Separation Management Office, bringing the DRIVE rigor and accountability that we use to run our operations. Claude has spent nearly 25 years at FedEx as the former CFO of FedEx Freight, is well versed in our freight business and the LTL market dynamics. Claude is currently Enterprise VP of Finance and has been a critical enabler of our DRIVE execution.\nToday we have shared the outcome of the assessment and our initial plans. As we have new details and separation milestones to share, we will keep you updated upon completion. This full separation will result in two strong, well-capitalized industry leaders, FedEx Freight, which will benefit from continued strategic and operational competitiveness and more flexible capital allocation.\nFedEx well positioned to continue executing on our strategic initiatives in pursuit of sustainable profitable growth. We're confident the separation is the right strategic decision for FedEx and FedEx Freight at this point in our evolution with a clear path ahead to create significant long-term stockholder value. Importantly, for our employees and our customers, it's business as usual as we look forward to a seamless transition. We are used to navigating change, and we will do it while continuing to deliver on the Purple Promise every single day.\nNow, turning to our Q2 results.\nLooking across the enterprise, we delivered sequential improvement both in DRIVE savings and adjusted operating profit. At Federal Express Corporation, we achieved strong results on a year-over-year basis and greater flow-through to the bottom line, with adjusted operating profit up 13% on essentially flat revenue. We did this despite the challenging demand environment, as well as headwinds we have previously identified, including the US Postal Service contract expiration and the timing shift of Cyber Week.\nThis is evidence that our transformation is clearly working. Similar to last quarter, we experienced weakness in the industrial economy, which negatively affected our B2B volumes, particularly in the US domestic package and the LTL markets. Continued market pressure, coupled with difficult year-over-year comparisons, weighed on our freight segment in the Q2.\nWith B2B revenues comprising nearly 60% of our package business, and 90% of our LTL business, we are well positioned for profitable growth when the industrial economy recovers.\nAgainst this backdrop, in support of evolving market dynamics, we continue to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent FedEx. As we deliver for our customers, we achieved DRIVE savings of $540 million in Q2. We remain confident that we will deliver our targeted $2.2 billion in incremental savings in FY2025. Our Network 2.0 rollout continued, and the Canadian market integration will be largely complete in early calendar year 2025.\nWith the expiration of the US Postal Service contract, we are strategically matching capacity with demand and flexing the network as needed to transport packages more efficiently. At the end of September, we reduced our US domestic daytime flight hours by nearly 60% and swiftly began to reduce other associated costs, and we delivered solid service for our customers. This is always our priority, and especially important during peak.\nI'm very pleased with how our teams are navigating a condensed period between Thanksgiving and Christmas. During peak, they're delivering more packages per day on average while maintaining the high-quality shipping experience that our customers expect, with the ground average time in transit at two days in the US this Peak.\nAs we look to the second half of the fiscal year, we remain focused on what is within our control, executing against our transformation initiatives to reduce our cost to serve, and drive improved performance. However, amid continued uncertainty around the demand environment, we are updating our expectations for FY2025. We now expect an adjusted EPS outlook range of $19 to 20. John will provide more color on the underlying assumptions shortly.\nTurning to DRIVE, on past earnings calls, I've talked about DRIVE as our structural cost optimization program. The reality is that within FedEx, DRIVE has evolved to be so much more. It's a new data and technology-driven business architecture that has changed how we work across our entire enterprise, introducing more rigor and accountability to every decision we make, leading to a continuous cycle of efficiency and optimization.\nTake Europe where we expect to achieve $600 million in total DRIVE savings by the end of the fiscal year. Our European business is predominantly a ground-based business. We introduced new European leadership over the summer, including a senior operator from our US Surface team. In the spirit of one FedEx, we are bringing hub and sort best practices from the US to Europe, and we have achieved many recent wins. Our progress includes revenue growth, which, combined with the DRIVE benefits, leads to improved performance this quarter.\nThis gives us confidence in Europe's near and longer-term trajectory. Our ability to enhance the financial performance of our European business starts with technology. Having implemented a common data platform, we now have a better view of our European network assets and cost to serve, using these insights to increase efficiency in the region.\nFor example, with our improved routing in Europe via the enhanced data flow, we reduced the number of touches on intra-European packages. This is not only improving productivity, but also expediting clearance, leading to better service. We also introduced dimensional pricing at our Charles de Gaulle hub in Paris. This enhancement, enabled by new and updated technology, seamlessly captures package dimensions and weight, and then integrates applicable surcharges via standardized processes.\nAs a result, we are now better and more accurately compensated for the goods we transport, especially for the higher margin packages with unique dimensions. We'll continue to roll out this capability to other European facilities over the next year. Together with non-stackable shipment surcharges, we expect this initiative to deliver an operating income benefit of over $50 million in FY2025.\nThis is a prime example of our new business architecture translating into improved financial and operational outcomes. Looking ahead across Europe, the team remains focused on deploying the right value proposition and network design, the digital tools that enhance the customer experience, and the right processes to deliver this experience efficiently and effectively. Improving our financial performance in Europe is a top priority for our entire leadership team. I'm very encouraged by our recent progress and confident in the opportunity ahead.\nIn October, just in time for Peak, we celebrated the grand opening of a new state-of-the-art sorting facility at our Memphis World Hub. This new sorting facility marks an important milestone in our modernization efforts, improving the work experience for our employees, and service for our customers, while increasing the efficiency of our hub. We also continue to roll out Network 2.0 in select markets in the first half of Q2, and we have now optimized 200 stations to date.\nWe are continuing to execute on Tricolor, our international air network design strategy, which is improving density and asset utilization across the enterprise, while targeting profitable growth. Before I close, I want to thank the FedEx team once again as we approach the end of our peak season. They make every FedEx experience outstanding, positioning us well through peak and beyond.\nNow let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. Market conditions remain soft, but our solid service levels, unique value proposition, and innovative offerings supported our Q2 performance and have positioned us well for a successful peak season. Consolidated revenue declined 1% in the quarter, driven by the weak industrial economy. US manufacturing PMI has indicated a contraction for 24 out of the past 25 months, representing the second longest downturn in US history.\nReviewing each segment on a year-over-year basis. Now at Federal Express, revenue was essentially flat. Higher yields across our services were partially offset by volumes, which declined year over year. We again saw increased demand for our lower-yielding services. Some of this demand increase was driven by a shift in customer preferences, particularly with the shift from Home Delivery to Ground Economy, but the majority was due to organic demand and not related to trade down between services.\nAt FedEx Freight, lower volumes, fuel surcharges, and weight per shipment drove the top-line decline year-over-year. Comparisons were challenging as some customers won last year from the Yellow bankruptcy have since left in search of lower prices. That being said, we are ready to capture additional profitable volume when the market returns.\nTurning now to volume trends by service during the quarter, volumes were pressured led by weakness in the US domestic market, partially offset by strong international growth. Across US domestic express services, volumes declined 1%, primarily due to weakness in the industrial economy. Ground volumes were down 1% as well, with the soft B2B environment weighing on ground commercial growth.\nWhile we recognize that e-commerce will continue to outpace B2B growth in the years ahead, we know that the priority customer base is stable, with low rates of churn, and the current priority volume weakness reflects the state of the broader global macroeconomic environment.\nBrown residential volumes were adversely affected by a difficult comparison due to Cyber Week, which occurred in Q2 last year and is in Q3 this year. International export package volumes increased 9% in the quarter, driven by international economy, which is largely consistent with recent quarterly trends. Within FEC, average daily pounds were up 10% for international priority freight and 5% for international economy freight. This signals early progress from our Tricolor strategy to drive profitable growth in the global air freight market.\nAt FedEx Freight, the soft industrial economy led to weakness in both weight per shipment, down 3%, and average daily shipments, down 8%.\nThe pricing environment is competitive, but I am encouraged that revenue quality actions are gaining traction. Revenue quality remains our highest priority as we ensure that revenue growth is benefiting the bottom line. At Federal Express, composite package yield increased 1%, driven by International Priority, US Priority, Home Delivery, and Ground Commercial. Overall yield for Ground services was flat, with yield growth at Home Delivery and Ground Commercial offset by Ground Economy.\nAs expected, International Economy parcel yield declined due to mix and lower weight per shipment. Moving to FedEx Freight, composite freight yield was up 4% driven by lower postal service volumes tied to the contract expiration, and also successful commercial execution in the international export freight market. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 4% driven by decreased fuel surcharge revenue due to lower fuel prices and lower weight per shipment.\nWe are through a significant part of Peak and project the demand surcharge revenue over this season will be up year-over-year. I am confident that this pricing strategy is supporting the revenue and profit expectations for the Q3. Looking at the second half of fiscal year 2025, we anticipate consolidated revenue to be up slightly on a year-over-year basis in both Q3 and Q4. While we still have five days to go.\nI'm very pleased with December volumes, which are ahead of our forecast. We expect our general rate increase of 5.9%, which goes live in January, to have a very strong capture.\nFederal Express revenue growth in the back half will be supported by Ground residential and International Economy volume growth driven in Asia, and also through European market share acquisition. We continue to see strong commercial traction, particularly in Europe. At FedEx Freight, we anticipate revenue to decline slightly in the second half due to continued softness in average daily shipments and modest yield improvement. As Raj mentioned, in January we begin hiring 300 incremental LTL specialists. We believe this increased focus will provide better support for our customers, and enable us to accelerate profitable growth.\nAs we wrap up the calendar year, it's a great time to remind you of our commercial strategy. I am proud to lead the best team in the industry, and I am confident that the commercial strategy we have in place will drive significant value in the years ahead. Our strategy is in service of our vision to make supply chain smarter for everyone. For our customers, our mission is to be their unrivaled partner in moving their business forward. To deliver on this mission, we will provide a superior digital portfolio and customer experience.\nIt's essentially the Purple Promise 2.0, powered by the FDX platform. In fiscal year 2026, we will begin the transition of our fedex.com customer base to the FDX platform. This will improve our speed to market and allow us to expose new capabilities, like advanced visibility for the millions of FedEx small and medium customers.\nWe are designing new experiences for high-value segments and planning for above-market growth where we already have a differentiated portfolio. Our target segments are B2B for both healthcare and automotive, domestic e-commerce, global air freight, and of course Europe first. B2B, we have experienced tremendous success in healthcare, which has been our priority. B2B vertical Federal Express already has a double-digit percentage of our revenue in the fast-growing $70 billion healthcare segment, and this segment is an important contributor to FedEx profit today.\nThis fiscal year, we expect to gain market share in the US by leveraging our unique portfolio, including cold chain support, our new quality management program, and FedEx Surround monitoring and intervention. While most of our healthcare revenue is US-based, the international healthcare market represents significant opportunity.\nWe will globalize our portfolio and accelerate revenue growth outside of the United States.\nAutomotive is also a massive market, and we are focused on what we estimate to be a $10 billion market within this industry that requires premium services critical to automotive supply chains. We have created an automotive vertical and expect to provide new benefit in early fiscal year 2026.\nOur second priority is the US domestic e-commerce market. E-commerce will continue to drive 90% of the market's incremental parcel growth in the years ahead within our US Ground services. Our superior speed and coverage give FedEx a competitive advantage, not to mention Picture Proof of Delivery, which continues to help us close new business.\nAs we execute on Network 2.0, we will continue to lower our cost to serve, which will lead to improved incremental flow-through from these volumes.\nOur third target segment is the global air freight market. This is a market with significant potential. We currently have a low single-digit market share in the $80 billion air freight market. International Priority Freight already serves as a profit driver for us. Our Tricolor strategy is a necessary condition to competing and winning in this market commercially. We've also made numerous changes to improve our performance. We have created a dedicated sales organization, a new customer service model, and are investing in the digital experience.\nThe air freight market is fragmented, and the shipping processes are antiquated. It's a market ripe for disruption. Fourth is Europe. The European parcel market is roughly $130 billion and will continue to grow in the years ahead. Our mix of revenue in Europe is already favorable, with the majority coming from B2B.\nAs Raj mentioned, Q2 revenue in Europe grew nicely, with strong execution. DRIVE continues to transform our cost to serve and improve service on the continent, while enabling us to lean into the most attractive parts of the market.\nRegardless of the target segment, revenue quality and capacity management are critical to growing profitably. We have made tremendous progress in yield capture in the last several years. A great example: total non-standard surcharges are generating a significant year-over-year benefit of over $180 million annualized. This is the result of a new AI image capture process.\nIn calendar year 2025, we will accelerate our work on an end-to-end capacity management system. Within SDX, there is a digital twin of the network. We now have real-time view of the network capacity globally. We will use AI in our Digital Quote platform to profitably fill voids at a scale and pace that was previously not feasible. I am very confident about the future as we lean into these commercial priorities. I am proud to be part of the best team in the industry, and extend my sincere thank you to the team members as they deliver for our customers this peak season. With that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. Despite soft market conditions, our Q2 performance demonstrates the team's strong commercial execution and actions to lower our cost to serve. We sequentially grew adjusted operating profit by approximately $170 million and increased our adjusted earnings per share year-over-year, with the growth driven primarily by our Federal Express segment, and we achieved these results despite revenue declining 1%.\nWalking through the dynamics of the quarter, the soft global industrial economy, coupled with the competitive pricing environment, constrained our results.\nThe Postal Service contract expiration negatively affected two months of the quarter, resulting in additional operating profit headwind. However, our plans to remove costs associated with this contract expiration are on track. DRIVE benefits of $540 million offset these headwinds, and supported our consolidated year-over-year adjusted earnings growth.\nProviding more detail by segment. At Federal Express, we grew adjusted operating income by $146 million year-over-year as a result of DRIVE savings, base yield improvement, and increased international export demand. We achieved this result despite inflationary pressures and several significant headwinds, including the Postal Service contract expiration, a $90 million headwind from the Cyber Week timing shift, and a $20 million headwind from the hurricanes in the Southeast US.\nAs Raj and Brie mentioned, we're pleased that in Europe, our continued network optimization initiatives and strong execution contributed to the profit improvement at Federal Express, and the ramping of our Tricolor strategy drove higher average daily pounds and yields year-over-year for Federal Express International Freight.\nIn Q2 we decreased total US domestic flight hours 24%, largely due to the 60% reduction in daytime flight hours that Raj mentioned due to the expiration of the Postal Service contract at FedEx Express, while operating profit was down $179 million. Approximately $30 million of this decline was due to our lapping the gain on sales of multiple facilities in Q2 of FY2024.\nConsistent with the broader LTL market, lower average daily shipments, fuel surcharges, and weight per shipment continued to be a headwind largely due to the soft industrial backdrop. These pressures were partially offset by cost management and continued base yield growth.\nMoving to DRIVE, as planned, we delivered a sequential improvement in savings in Q2 versus Q1, and savings of $210 million in Q2 were a significant lever in the quarter as we continue to optimize our IT and back office functions and reduce outside vendor spend. Surface savings of $150 million benefited the quarter as we continued to maximize third party rail usage, which lowers our cost to serve on our deferred service offerings, and adding the $180 million from Air Network and International, we achieved $540 million total savings in the quarter.\nAs we look to the back half of fiscal 2025, we continue to expect a sequential build in DRIVE savings, and we're encouraged by the trends we're seeing in base yields. However, the global industrial economy continues to constrain demand on our most profitable priority and commercial services. As a result, we are revising our FY2025 adjusted diluted EPS outlook to $19 to 20 compared to the prior range of $20 to 21.\nAt the top end of our range, we assume revenue is up a low single digit percentage, driven by a modest improvement in industrial production, leading to higher flow-through from B2B demand. At the low end of the range, we're assuming a low single digit decline in revenue due to incremental softness in the industrial economy and the pricing environment.\nRegarding our expected earnings cadence for the second half of the fiscal year at Federal Express, we anticipate Q3 will benefit from ramping DRIVE savings, improved top line flow-through due to the timing of Cyber Week, continued revenue quality actions, and the encouraging peak demand that Brie talked about.\nHowever, as a reminder, the Postal Service headwind is expected to increase in Q3 and will lessen in Q4 as we exit the fiscal year, and the Q3 Postal Service headwind will more than offset the benefit of the Cyber Week timing shift. We continue to anticipate DRIVE savings to build incrementally in Q3 and Q4, with a full year total of $2.2 billion. At FedEx Freight, we expect a continued softness in the US industrial economy and lower fuel prices to pressure operating profit for the remainder of FY2025.\nFinally, our Q4 is typically our strongest earnings quarter of the year. We expect this dynamic to continue despite having one fewer operating day in Q4.\nI'd now like to turn to our latest full year adjusted operating income bridge, which shows the year-over-year operating profit elements embedded in our revised outlook. This bridge now reflects adjusted operating profit of $6.6 billion, equivalent to $19.5 of adjusted EPS.\nFor revenue net of cost, we now expect a $700 million headwind compared to the $100 million FY2025 headwind assumption we shared last quarter. This reflects both our lower revenue assumptions and continued inflation.\nAt the same time, we now forecast a $300 million headwind from international export yield pressure, which is an improvement compared to the prior $500 million estimate. This is a result of execution on our revenue quality initiatives internationally.\nWe still expect about a $300 million headwind from two fewer operating days, one that was in Q1 and one that will be in Q4. Lastly, we anticipate a $500 million headwind from the US Postal Service contract expiration. We remain confident in our ability to offset these headwinds with the $2.2 billion from incremental DRIVE savings. Further supporting this revised outlook is our continued commitment to revenue quality, as evidenced by our calendar year 2025 general rate increase, Peak surcharges, and fuel table price changes announced in recent months.\nFor the full year, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion at Federal Express and operating margin contraction at FedEx Freight, given the challenging industrial production environment.\nAt the midpoint of our revised FY2025 outlook, we're assuming 9.6% adjusted EPS growth on approximately flat revenue. This expectation further highlights how DRIVE is fundamentally changing the way we do business. We're improving our cost structure to enable us to profitably grow with e-commerce, and are well positioned to see significant incremental margins on our priority services once global industrial production improves. It remains my highest priority to ensure that we continue to unlock the value that I know exists in our business.\nMoving to capital allocation, we remain committed to reducing our capital intensity while increasing our capital returns. In Q2, capital expenditures were approximately $820 million. Our planned FY2025 CapEx remains $5.2 billion, which is flat on a year-over-year basis, and this will translate into continued strong levels of adjusted free cash flow. We completed an additional $1 billion in share repurchases in Q2, bringing the year-to-date total to $2 billion, with an additional $500 million of repurchases planned for the fiscal second half.\nI remain confident in our near and long term ability to grow earnings while continuing to deliver strong levels of adjusted free cash flow, which will support increased shareholder returns in the years ahead. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touchtone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question, and at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster.\nThe first question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nGreat, thanks.\nGood afternoon. Maybe I could just hit on the guidance for a moment. I think the Q2 results were generally in line with at least what you guys talked about on the last call. As we think about the dollar cut coming from the back half of the year, I know John, you talked about sort of the industrial production outlook and maybe how that's a bit more tempered. I guess I also wanted to kind of think about LTL or the freight business within that context. It was obviously under some pressure here.\nI guess maybe if you could help break down the moving pieces of the dollar in a little bit more detail, then also talk about the cadence of how that plays out. Is it a little bit more Q3 weighted or is it a little bit more Q4 weighted?\nDo you think things get better by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year? Just kind of curious how to think about.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Chris.\nI appreciate the question. As you know, our prior guidance factored in DRIVE savings as well as the pricing actions that we implemented. However, you know, the expected volumes and related revenue just did not materialize. Our updated adjusted EPS range, which is in the $19 to 20, reflects our revised revenue expectations. From a timing standpoint, while we are not giving quarterly guidance, I can tell you that Q3 will benefit from ramping DRIVE savings, improved top line flow-through due to the timing of Cyber Week that we talked about, and continued revenue quality actions.\nAs Brie talked about, you know, we are seeing encouraging signs from our peak demand. It is important to remember for Q3, though, that the USPS headwind is expected to increase in Q3 and then somewhat less than in Q4.\nThat headwind will more than offset the benefit of the Cyber Week I just mentioned. We continue to anticipate DRIVE savings to build incrementally in Q3 and Q4. From a Q4 standpoint, that is traditionally our strongest earnings quarter of the year, and we expect this dynamic to hold. That's true despite even having one fewer operating day. Hopefully, that gives you some more perspective.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Congrats on the freight spin. Obviously long anticipated and a great move to see in value creation. My question is, Brie, you talked a little bit about peak season here and how it's shifting into Q3. Maybe can you give a little bit more color on kind of, you know, you mentioned peak was strong. Is there anything we can read into that in terms of volumes, ability to get price to flow through? I guess I'm more focused on the volumes both at ground and express. Thanks. Yeah.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHey Ken, great question. From a December perspective, we are pleased. I will say it picked up right after Cyber Monday. It was a very strong week, and we are, from a December perspective, pleased volumes are running ahead of forecast. As I mentioned, our peak surcharge capture from an absolute dollar amount will be up year over year. We do think that December is going to be a very strong month.\nThat being said, I do want to talk about our top line outlook for the back half of the year because we do not necessarily believe that the December performance is going to carry through in the back half. As we're thinking about the back half top line outlook, we're looking at, you know, some improvement.\nI think you're going to see that improvement come in the form of domestic volumes, in particular at Ground. We think that will improve in the. We do anticipate that Q2 was the trough for FedEx Freight from a revenue perspective and that from an international. Actually, what we think we'll see in the back half is that total volume will look a lot like the first half, with actually some slight softening in Asia. We're very pleased with December. The execution is going to be great, the capture is going to be great, but we're not yet thinking that this is a signal of more to come in the back half.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ari Rosa with Citigroup.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nAri Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, good afternoon, and congratulations on the strategic move here. Raj, I'm just curious to hear you.\nTalk a little bit about kind of how you see the separation playing out.\nJust if you could talk about what are the things that kind of need to be done to ensure a smooth transition. Also, what are your thoughts on kind of the risk of customer attrition as you separate out the two businesses and just kind of ensuring that customers aren't confused by the separation or maybe see it as a risk to their operations. You guys separating out the two businesses. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Ari. I think, you know, we are, you know, we decided to separate because of the potential to increase shareholder value for both FedEx and FedEx Freight. As far as we have put in place the Separation Management Office with Claude Russ as the head to make sure that we get from here to day one to the points that you made. As Brie talked about, we have appointed a VP of LTL Sales, and we are going to add 300 sales folks in the next year to make sure that we pay more directly.\nDeal with the issue that you talked about. We're also going to continue to improve our customer experience. It's very important for you to note also that the FedEx Freight company benefits a lot from the association with FedEx.\nThat association, whether it's commercial, operational, or technological, we'll have those arrangements in place as we proceed through the separation.\nSo, I think we'll be able to handle this transition quite well.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research Analyst in Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Just curious, if you give a little more color around the Network 2.0 rollout, the progression that's planned from here, and given the experience with Canada or any other areas, what do you think has gone particularly well and what has been the more challenging aspect of it all? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you very much, Jordan. I think, yeah. We may continue to make significant progress on Network 2.0. We've taken a deliberate approach to rollout and prioritizing service quality. We have optimized 200 stations so far, including 130 in Canada. We will complete the rest of the Canada integration early in 2025, with the last major market being Montreal as a feature of how we roll this out.\nEvery time we roll out something, we take lessons learned and we keep applying into the next one. That's working quite well. We are continuing to see 10% P&D cost reduction where we have fully rolled out 2.0. At the end of FY2025, we expect to have approximately 250 stations integrated. Hopefully that answers your question, Jordan.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research, Stephens Inc\n\nHey, good evening, everybody.\nThanks for taking the questions. John, maybe one on capital allocation and the balance sheet. First, I guess how do you envision maybe debt being divvied up or how should we think about target leverage for each business?\nJohn, you've worked hard to reduce the capital intensity of both businesses. How do you envision capital allocation changing at all? Will this spin enable certain investments you previously weren't making, or how did that change?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Thanks, Daniel. Yeah, no, we're not anticipating any changes in capital allocation. You know, we're continuing to be focused on optimizing our existing business, ensuring, you know, the significant adjusted free cash flow is returned to stockholders. That's going to be true both before and after the separation.\nYou know, we continue to have the programs in place. We're going to. We've already accomplished $1 billion of share repurchases in Q2 for a total of $2 billion for the full year, with a remaining $500 million for the remainder of the year. That's all going to remain in place now in terms of, you know, capital allocation in kind of the post separation environment. That's all going to be something we're going to be reviewing over the coming months, and look forward to keeping you updated on the progress of that.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nJason Seidl\n\nManaging Director, TD Cowen\n\nThank you, operator. Everyone, evening, and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the spin. It's always nice to see some value creation out there.\nWanted to focus a little bit on. the commercial agreements you spoke about, you mentioned the ones that were, you know, with peak help and drayage. How long are these agreements for? Also, what about anything on the bundle side between the two companies? You know, I'm assuming existing contracts that are offered will be honored, and how should we look at the bundle going forward?\nI'm assuming they'll just go away.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThat's a great question. I think we just need to take a step back and just clarify, you know, what the customer base at FedEx Freight looks like today. First and foremost, obviously FedEx Freight would not be the powerhouse that it is today without the incredible strategy to take these three networks together, put them together, put the FedEx brand on them, and then to build off just the incredible relationships that FedEx has with customers.\nThat is one of our commercial strengths, deep solutioning and partnerships with our customer, and that has really created a lot of momentum. That being said, if you look at the majority of the FedEx Freight revenue base today, while the majority of small customers are bundled, the majority of the actual volume at FedEx Freight is negotiated on an independent contract.\nToday we really made a pivot, I guess about four or five years ago. Recognizing that when we were competing in a fragmented market, we had to negotiate the freight business separately. Those contracts will be honored. As you know, the vast, vast majority of FedEx Freight contracts are renegotiated every year. They will be honored as we go through this process. That is why we are very confident in the incremental focus from a dedicated sales team.\nIt's important to note we have about 75 sales reps today that are dedicated to large accounts at Freight. This will be additive to them. As we go through the process, we will look at the small customer strategy and I anticipate that will be slightly nuanced because that is where we really have leveraged the benefit of the earned discount program at FedEx.\nThere is a common myth that FedEx Freight revenue is diluted because of that bundle, and that is not true.\nActually, the way the earned discount program work is that as they ship more FedEx Freight or more LTL, you actually get incremental benefit on your parcel side. There is some potential benefit from small customer improvement too. We're very comfortable in our commercial strategy, and we can execute it.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nI think what I would add to that, from a kind of intra company standpoint, it's important to recognize that through the separate operating companies previously, and as Raj mentioned in his comments, freight has benefited from providing services to Federal Express. A lot of agreements already exist that will just be enhanced as we go forward with the separation. We're not going to have to reinvent the wheel on this.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nTravel and Transports Analyst, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone. Thank you. Maybe going back to the first question just on EPS, the change in the guidance. Freight was clearly pressured in the quarter is the entirety of the change in the guidance associated with the freight business. It just seems like the underlying core trends in Express are actually improving. I don't know. If you could just talk a little about the dynamic between the two businesses. The changes overall. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. Thank you, Connor. Look, there's a number of considerations. The pricing actions that we've implemented are supporting our FY2025 earnings growth assumptions for sure. However, revenue expectations remain constrained due to the demand environment, largely resulting from the continued weakness in the US industrial economy that Raj talked about. US Premium services, even though there's some, you know, we talked a little bit about peak, but US Premium services are expected to remain muted for a while, thereby putting pressure on income and margin.\nWe do expect continued growth from our deferred services, which are contributing, but with lower margin and lower flow-through to the bottom line. Really, you know, the top end of our range assumes a modest improvement in global industrial production and slight growth in revenue.\nThe low end of the range assumes revenues declined slightly year over year, driven incrementally by incrementally softer industrial production and pricing. The midpoint just assumes flattish revenue year-over-year. You know, we're going to be focused on controlling those things we can, we remain confident in DRIVE, and those savings will continue to ramp incrementally during the second half. Those are some of the considerations that are going into our outlook.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, let me just add one other thing, Conor. I think at an overarching level, I mean, it's been really surprising to me to see the last 25 months that we are declining ISM for 24. It's, you know, very difficult to say when that will turn around. The fact that we have produced such, you know, the results and especially in FEC in this environment, I think it says a lot about what we can do and also shows what can happen when that market turns. We are assuming that the industrial production and the manufacturing continues to be similar to what we saw in the first half or the second half, as was stated earlier.\n60% of the revenue for the FECs comes from B2B, while 90% comes from LTL. Hopefully, that will help you with the calculations.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Transportation, JPMorgan\n\nHey, evening.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Thanks for taking the question. Bri, just wanted to come back to you on the general trends for price and competition you mentioned. It's still pretty competitive out there. You don't see a trade down necessarily, but it does sound like the deferred side of the business is growing faster. Just want to see if you can offer a little bit more comment. Sounds like the demand surcharge is sticking, but what about the other ones that you've put into place to help optimize the network and sort of get that revenue management moving in the direction that you would want? How are those sticking and how would that progress into the back half of the year? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi Brian. Great question. The market certainly is competitive. I do feel that it's rational from a pricing strategy. As we think about the yields in the back half, they are going to remain pressured. That is a function of two things: one, the economy, and two, to your point, there is a mix change. I do want to emphasize that we do have some customers trading down.\nWe're also, as we go to acquire new volume and customers, because all of our customers are simply trading less. You know, in a downturn, you need new customers to be able to add to the portfolio. There is growth in new customers in the deferred portfolio. From a pricing strategy perspective, I think the team, despite the economy, is executing really well. The pressure that we're seeing is on the base rate, and then weight.\nWe know every time we're in a downturn, weights are pressured really across all the portfolio, especially in the freight portfolio. There's not a lot that the team can do from a weight perspective. What they can do is be really disciplined in getting the surcharges, especially those surcharges that drive a disproportionate amount of cost. Peak is a great example. They're executing on Peak. From a large package perspective, nobody moves large packages better than we do.\nActually, we're seeing that. Part of what we're seeing in December is a lot of flow through from a fourth perspective. As you heard, not only are we being disciplined from a large package capture on surcharge, but the dimensional capabilities that we're putting in to get capture is increasing it.\nFrom a rural perspective, we have the best value proposition here in the United States into the rural markets. That matters for a lot of our customers. You know, the last 3 or 4% of their volume, they don't want to have to use a different provider. We're really being disciplined on getting those surcharges. They are contributing, but the base rate is really pressured because of the economy. I hope that helps.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good evening and congratulations on the spend. I know a lot of your shareholders will definitely be happy here too. I guess, Raj, can you expand on what you are doing differently under DRIVE? You spoke about how it is driving the way you do business today versus what you did yesterday, especially in the context of revenue quality, which I think Brie has mentioned many times and maybe even reflecting on losing your largest customer. It looks like your margins have actually come up. What else in the portfolio potentially can you change looking forward?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nOkay, I'm trying to digest that question, Brandon, but let me just start with DRIVE. Firstly, I think, you know, DRIVE has clearly evolved to be how we work in this company. We have established an overarching, market-leading approach to overall governance that leads to disciplined execution. You know, we are, it's a data-driven approach and very rigorous and very timely decision making, and ultimately leads to much, much better execution. This is going to stand us in good stead as a foundation for FedEx to execute as we go forward.\nThe second thing is we also adopted a data-first, digital mindset in solving problems while creating differentiation in our service offerings. The underlying technological innovation and transformation that we have created is quite profound. Those are the two things powering our execution.\nThat's also why as we have changed our vision to making supply chains smarter for everyone, it starts by making our own supply chain smarter. Of the $4 billion of DRIVE savings, I think roughly $1.8 billion would be a direct result of the new technologies that we put in place. That's what DRIVE is all about. As we look at what comes next, whether as we implement Network 2.0, or whether we improve and expand on Tricolor, or expand our operations and expand our performance in Europe, all those are going to be guided through DRIVE. That's what gives us the confidence of execution. I hope that answers the question that you asked.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nManaging Director, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone, and echo the sentiments on the spin. Great to see. Maybe somewhat of an oblique follow-up here to Brian's question. Just, you know, there's been some suggestion of a USPS privatization. You know, maybe we could get your thoughts on what that would mean for the competitive environment. Is that, you know, a new bona fide competitor, or is that maybe introducing a more material profit mandate and thus, you know, making the Postal Service more rational? You know, any thoughts and color there would be great.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, it is very early for us to comment on something like that. We will keep that. We monitor the developments there very closely, obviously. One of the principles that I think is important to state here is that for our industry, it's important that the package delivery business is not subsidized by the US taxpayer. I think that's a very important consideration set, and hopefully that'll be what will get adopted here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI, please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nManaging Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon, Brie. I was hoping to ask about tariffs. It's a narrative that seems to be dominating some of the sentiment around the group right now. You're a much different cost structure than you were in the first Trump administration. Just as it relates to tariffs, have you heard from your customers about any pull forward? I guess secondly, how would you manage your network if there were to be a surge in demand that may be more of like a short term as opposed to a long term secular shift?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, it's a great question. From a December perspective, you know, there might be a little bit of a pull forward. As we talked about, we are seeing some, you know, some movement both in the freight network and in the parcel network from the ports. There might be a little bit. It's hard to tell right now because we're in the middle of peak, you know, how much of that is inventory as well as how much is just consumer demand. Obviously, it will be much clearer in January from a reaction perspective.\nI am really pleased with how quickly the airline team is able to respond right now. You know, to Raj's point, we are doing things differently with DRIVE. As far as being able to adapt, I'm very confident. You know, as Raj has shared many times, we're everywhere.\nWe have customer relationships everywhere. As customers prepare to pivot, we're there to pivot with them. You know, it's very hard at this point to predict what might happen under a future administration. We're not going to try to, but we are ready to respond with agility.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nJon, let me just say that as you can imagine, we are a referendum on global supply chains every single day, especially of the high value economy. We see this information from the bottom up, and the fact that we have a scaled network already in place that connects 99% of global GDP is a significant advantage because we can move our capacity much, much quicker than manufacturing can move. We are very agile, much different than what's been the case before.\nOne other thing I would say is that you can imagine that as part of our value proposition is an end-to-end delivery international that includes customs clearance. We have the data, the expertise, and the insights about what it takes to move a package from one country to any other country and all the commodities therein.\nThis becomes a competitive differentiation advantage for us as we make our customer supply chain smarter.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon, John, you said a couple times that the post office headwind is bigger than the cyber week tailwind. There's a lot more moving parts, so maybe can you just clarify. What you're trying to sort of communicate around Q3 expectations, and then on the LTL spin, I just want to understand a couple things.\nWhy is it 18 months seems a little long, and then as we do our math, is there any way to just think about if there's much, if any, of the corporate unallocated costs that we should apply to LTL? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Scott. Let me start with the 18 months. You know, from a timing standpoint, the 18 months period for a transaction of this magnitude is really consistent with what is reasonable to expect. We do look forward to keeping you posted on our timing and milestones along the way. We'll look forward to keeping you posted on there.\nYou know, with regard to the Postal Service, as I mentioned in my remarks, we are on track to take out cost as planned with the US Postal Service contract expiration. We talked about the flight hours taken out. Roughly 60% of our US domestic daytime flight hours have been taken out, and that makes up about 24% of our total daytime hours. We're also going after all the other related costs. You know, as I mentioned in my remarks, Q3 will be impacted because it'll be a full three months of impact from the Postal Service contract, and that'll start to wind down in Q4, and we'll start to see it as a tailwind into FY2026.\nYou know, that just gives you some background and perspective. We're pleased with the work that's been done. There's more to be doing and taking that cost out. Hopefully, that gives you some good color on the postal service.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Thanks for getting me on for a question. I appreciate it. Let's see on the LTL. Thanks for all the detail on this spin. It's complex, but it's helpful to hear your thoughts. Raj, would you anticipate that you get somewhat more volume focused with LTL in the future? You talked about the 1,100 basis points of improvement in the margin over a period of time, and I think that was driven by some of the change in focus on pricing and a lot of discipline.\nI'm wondering, would you anticipate that hiring a bunch of salespeople, focus on SMB, those things, would you potentially be more volume focused and maybe compete harder for freight in the future, or is that the wrong way to look at it? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Thomas. Bri.\nI think first in the main, we're really pleased with the discipline that we've got across the team from a revenue quality perspective. You know, we've made great strides as we look forward. We do see this as an opportunity to play offense. We are going to invest commercially and new salespeople. We know we've got an opportunity from a different industrial mix, and as I mentioned earlier, from a weight.\nWhile our weight is down right now in our base because of the macro, when we look competitively, we think there is some opportunity using technology to fill up the capacity. We know the FedEx Freight network right now can run very comfortably at 100, 105. We've got some opportunity to be a little bit more strategic also to look at the 3PL market.\nYes, we're going to play more offense, and we think there's some great things to come.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nPlease go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for fitting me in here. Coming back to Network 2.0. I think Raj, you mentioned like 225 stations would be consolidated or something like that by the end of, I think it was fiscal 2025. Can you give us a sense for kind of what percentage of volume you might have touched with the Network 2.0 integration to date?\nAs you think about the timing of when the more difficult to tackle major metros may start to be coming in play, is this a fiscal 2026, fiscal 2027 sort of timeline? Just trying to get a better sense for when the rubber really starts to meet the road, so to speak, on the physical integration of the courier operations in the heart of the domestic network. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, David. The FY2025 number is 250 stations integrated. I think the big lift is going to be in FY2026. We have FY2026 and FY2027 are the two big years. FY2026 will be the big lift for us, for Network 2.0.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, operator. In closing, I'd like to thank our team members for delivering this outstanding peak season. We have five more days to go, and I really look forward to a very strong finish. Let me wish all of you listening on this call a very happy holiday season. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.\nYou are muted."

Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Jenny. Our Q4 performance marks a strong end to a year of successful execution. We delivered year-over-year operating profit growth and margin expansion in every quarter of FY2024. We lowered our capital intensity, reaching our FY2025 target of less than 6.5% a year early. With lower CapEx and higher free cash flow, we returned nearly $4 billion to stockholders, and we meaningfully improved our return on invested capital. The entire industry faced a challenging demand environment in FY2024. Our team focused on what we could control, and as a result, we delivered full-year earnings towards the higher end of our original guidance range, up 19% year-over-year on an adjusted basis. We did this despite a decline in revenue compared to our initial growth expectations.\nWe also advanced our network transformation, continuing to roll out Network 2.0 and finalizing the transition to One FedEx, which went into effect 1 June. We did all of this while maintaining an intense dedication to serving our customers, a relentless pursuit of innovation, and an unwavering commitment to our people, service, and profit culture. Our transformation journey will continue in FY2025 as we build on the team's outstanding progress. Now turning to the quarter in more detail. At the enterprise level, revenue growth inflected positive this quarter, as expected. While we saw modest yield improvement and signs of volume stabilization across segments, we have not yet seen a notable increase in demand. Continued execution of DRIVE, alongside effective expense management, enabled year-over-year improvements to adjusted operating income, margins, and earnings per share. Let me pause here to acknowledge and provide context around the team's tremendous Q4 and full-year results.\nGround delivered its highest adjusted operating income in company history for both Q4 and the full year. At Freight, Q4 operating income increased despite significant demand weakness. In fact, because of our strong Q4 performance, Freight ended fiscal year 2024 with full-year operating margin equal to last year's all-time high. Adjusted express operating margin increased sequentially in the quarter but declined year-over-year as expected. We continue to take action to unlock the full profit opportunity that exists in this business. DRIVE continues to change the way we work at FedEx. We've achieved our target of $1.8 billion in structural costs out in FY 2024, with approximately $500 million from air network and international, $550 million from GNA, and $750 million from surface network. In our air network, structural network transformation and reduced flight hours drove the Q4 savings.\nWithin GNA, we realized procurement savings by centralizing third-party transportation, sort equipment, and outside service contracts. Our surface network continued to maximize the use of rail. As part of that effort, Freight now handles nearly 90% of the drayage volume, up from about 25% just one year ago. Looking ahead, we are firmly on track to achieve our target of $4 billion of savings in FY2025 compared to the FY2023 baseline. Let me spend a moment on Europe, where we are executing on the $600 million FY2025 DRIVE savings target we have shared previously. I would like to thank Karen Reddington for her more than 27 years of service at FedEx, most recently as our Europe Regional President. A couple of weeks ago, Karen announced her impending retirement. We wish her all the very best.\nWalter Roels, who is an exceptionally seasoned and experienced executive, will become our Europe Regional President on 1 July. Walter has been leading our Europe DRIVE domain since his 2022 inception. I'm confident that under Walter's leadership, the team will continue to advance DRIVE initiatives to support improved performance. John, Brie, other FedEx executives, and I were in Europe visiting the team just last week. Our team members there are working with rigor to execute on our efficiency plans, and our performance improved on a year-over-year basis. The Q4 route optimization, improved thought processes, and productivity gains led our Europe DRIVE domain savings. Key actions are already underway for FY2025. I left the continent encouraged by our progress and with even more conviction in the opportunity ahead. On 1 June, we reached an important milestone in our transformation, what we call One FedEx.\nThis is the consolidation of FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation. There are many benefits. This foundational step improves efficiency and reduces costs, allows our teams to move with speed, and makes it easier for our team members to manage their FedEx careers. In Q4, we also continue to roll out Network 2.0, including the launch in Canada, our largest market yet. In the first half of FY2025, we will complete the Canada transition and optimize dozens of additional locations in the US. We expect to significantly pick up the pace into FY2026. Importantly, even as we streamline our structure, we are maintaining our strong service levels, and we continue to offer the widest portfolio of services with the most compelling value proposition for our customers.\nOur integrated portfolio offering is a long-term driver of sustained profit improvement and a key enabler of our Tricolor network design. We also continue to leverage data to create a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. In November 2023, we began introducing a new tool to our contracted service providers in the US to track and drive improvement across key operating metrics tied to demand, safety, service, and productivity. This tool is a common platform that we plan to scale globally, providing insights and enabling outcomes that are beneficial to FedEx, our contracted service providers, and our customers. Across the 65% of service providers currently using the platform, it's already driving service and safety improvements, which are translating into cost savings. Real-time visibility tools like this are critically important as we start to flow packages across our network irrespective of service offerings.\nOur FY2024 results create a strong foundation as we kick off the new fiscal year. In fiscal 2025, we will continue to execute on our transformation strategy and expect to deliver adjusted EPS growth of 12% to 24%. John will provide more detail on our outlook and the underlying assumptions shortly. With the recent completion of the FY2025 planning process, we have turned our focus to the next phase of our long-term stockholder value creation plans. As a part of this work, our management team and the board of directors, along with outside advisors, are conducting an assessment of the role of FedEx Freight in our portfolio structure and potential steps to further unlock sustainable shareholder value. We're committed to completing this review thoroughly and deliberately by the end of the calendar year.\nWe'll conduct this assessment while continuing to focus on customers, team members, and the safety of our operations. Before I close, I want to thank our FedEx team members for their continued commitment to our customers and their focused execution in FY2024. I'm truly excited about the value creation opportunities in front of us as we continue to win profitable share, execute on our structural cost initiatives, and leverage the insights from the vast amount of data we compile from moving more than $2 trillion worth of goods every single year. We are firmly on track to achieve our $4 billion FY2025 DRIVE cost savings target compared to the FY2023 baseline. We expect another $2 billion to follow from Network 2.0. Our Tricolor strategy will improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system.\nWe expect to continue lowering our capital intensity, improving our ROIC, growing free cash flow, and delivering significant returns to stockholders. We have a clear line of sight to achieving 10% adjusted operating margin on $100 billion revenue. I have never been more confident in our future as we create the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. With that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to congratulate our team on their outstanding Q4 and full-year performance. Our service and speed advantages continue to attract customers in high-value industries and segments. With this focus on profitable growth, we have continued to gain market share both in the United States and around the world. We are very pleased to see revenue growth turn positive in the Q4 with volume stabilization and modest yield improvement.\nLet's review Q4 top-line performance by segment on a year-over-year basis. At FedEx Ground, revenue increased 2% on a 1% increase in yield and a 1% increase in volume driven by ground commercial. At FedEx Freight, revenue increased 2% driven by higher yield. Average daily shipments increased slightly. At FedEx Express, revenue in the Q4 was flat with package yield up 2%. While positive, yield growth was pressured by a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of deferred services. International yields were also pressured by an increased capacity in the global air cargo market. Turning now to monthly volume trends during the quarter. Volumes continue to stabilize. In US domestic package, year-over-year volume declines continued to moderate. International export package volume increased 8% in the quarter driven by International Economy, largely consistent with the monthly trends we saw last quarter.\nOur continued focus on reliable service at Ground drove volume improvement in Ground commercial. FedEx Freight shipments inflected positive as the quarter progressed as we lapped last year's demand softness. As we previously announced, our contract with the United States Postal Service will expire on 29 September 2024. Until then, we will continue to meet our service commitments. We expect volumes to be near contract minimums consistent with what we saw in the Q4. After the expiration of the contract, we will implement adjustments to our operations and network that will drive efficiencies and create more flexibility. Similar to last quarter, the pricing environment remains competitive, but rational. During the Q4, we continue to grow yield as we focus on profitable growth and revenue quality. At Express, package yield increased 2%, driven by higher US domestic package yield, partially offset by international export yield pressure.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1% driven by home delivery and ground commercial. Our value proposition is translating to increased ground commercial market share gains, which positively contributed to our yield. And at FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was up 1% driven by a continued focus on revenue quality as we grew share in the most attractive parts of the market. This was Freight's strongest yield performance since the Q3 of fiscal year 2023. In light of the overall pricing environment, I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong US domestic capture rate on the 5.9% GRI in January. We recently announced fuel surcharge table increases across our services, which should also benefit yields in fiscal year 2025. We continue to enhance our portfolio and value proposition to drive profitable growth.\nOur world-renowned brand, the breadth of our network, and our strong reliability, along with our digital portfolio, are winning the hearts and the minds of customers around the world. A few commercial highlights I would like to share. We are very proud of our healthcare portfolio. Last year, as part of our commercial drive focus, we increased focus on this attractive segment and experienced great results. We have over $1 billion of healthcare-related revenue that comes from customers who utilize FedEx Surround. The FedEx Surround platform provides insights to help our customers monitor and solve their supply chain challenges. Surround gives customers real-time visibility into their shipments by combining information about the package with external data, such as weather, to predict delivery timeliness and to mitigate the risk of disruption.\nAnother critical element of our healthcare strategy is our ability to demonstrate our high reliability and our ability to meet customer Quality Agreements. The Quality Agreement is essentially a customized standard operating procedure for critical healthcare shipments. In fiscal 2024, we signed new Quality Agreements for customers tied to over $500 million in revenue. As we expand our healthcare portfolio, we'll continue to focus on high-value areas like clinical trials. Earlier this month, in the Netherlands, we opened our first European Life Sciences Center. This state-of-the-art cooling facility is the sixth of its kind in our global network, offering an end-to-end supply chain solution for temperature-sensitive medical storage and transport. In addition to the tremendous work with our healthcare customers, our e-commerce portfolio is the most robust in the market. We have the best speed, coverage, and capabilities.\nPicture Proof of Delivery was a great new feature to improve customer confidence. We recently launched our Picture Proof of Delivery APIs. These APIs enable our customers to expose Picture Proof of Delivery within their own branded notifications and websites. This quarter, we signed several new pricing agreements with large retailers for our new Picture Proof of Delivery API. This is a great differentiator and represents what will be the first of many wins for our new FDX platform. Looking ahead in fiscal year 2025, we expect the demand environment to moderately improve as we move through the year. Currently, we expect US domestic parcel and LTL volume to continue to improve with the year-over-year increase growing as the year progresses. International air cargo demand from Asia accelerated in early May and is stronger versus previous expectations. We expect year-over-year growth to be driven by e-commerce and low inventory levels.\nShippers are facing tightened capacity both in air and sea freight services. Red Sea disruptions have further exacerbated shipper challenges from Asia to Europe. These conditions should bring strength to the overall air freight yields from Asia. In closing, I am very confident in our outstanding team, our strong value proposition, and our new digital solutions. These will continue to power our success as we build on our momentum in fiscal year 2025. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. For fiscal year 2024, we delivered $6.2 billion of adjusted operating profit, which is nearly a $900 million or 16% year-over-year improvement, adjusted operating margin expansion of 110 basis points, and adjusted EPS up 19%. This is a very strong result in a year where revenue was down 3% or nearly $2.5 billion.\nWe also reduced our capital intensity and achieved our CapEx to revenue target of 6.5% or less a year ahead of schedule. With the continued strong cash flow and lower capital intensity, we returned nearly $4 billion to stockholders. These results reinforce that our transformation efforts are taking hold and demonstrate our commitment to creating value for our shareholders. Taking a closer look at our Q4 consolidated performance on a year-over-year basis, adjusted operating income increased by over $100 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. At Ground, the team delivered another strong quarter. Adjusted operating income increased by $133 million, and adjusted operating margin expanded by 130 basis points. This was driven by continued progress on DRIVE, increased yield, lower self-insurance costs, and commercial volume growth.\nAt Freight, operating income increased by $58 million, and operating margin improved by 220 basis points driven by higher yield. Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and cost management has enabled improved profitability despite the soft demand environment. As directionally expected, adjusted operating income at Express fell by $92 million in the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was down 90 basis points. Express results were pressured by lower international yield, higher purchased transportation costs due to the launch of our Tricolor initiative, and a headwind from annual incentive compensation. DRIVE cost reductions and higher US domestic package yield partially offset these pressures. With respect to Europe, earlier this month, we announced a planned reduction in the size of our European non-operational staffing to further support Express profit improvement. We expect $125 to 175 million in annualized benefit beginning in FY2027, with tailwinds starting later in FY2026.\nDecisions like these are never easy, but are a necessary step to improve profitability in the region. In addition to our segment results, our Q4 results include a non-cash impairment charge of $157 million relating to our decision to permanently retire 22 Boeing 757 aircraft from our US domestic network, along with seven related engines. These actions, coupled with the previously announced retirement of nine MD-11s in the quarter, resulted in the permanent removal of 31 jet aircraft from our fleet in FY2024. This reflects our strategy to continue to right-size our air network capacity with demand and unlock additional operating efficiencies. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal year 2025. Our adjusted earnings outlook range for the year is $20 to 22 per share. Let me talk through our key assumptions and variables. Starting with revenue, we expect low to mid-single-digit growth driven by improving trends in US.\nDomestic parcel and international export demand. The primary factors that will ultimately determine our revenue growth are the rate of yield expansion, the pace of global industrial production, and growth of domestic e-commerce. We expect FY2025 yields to benefit from both improved base rates and increased fuel surcharges. Consistent with what we have seen over the past year, we're anticipating a pricing environment that is competitive but rational. On the expense side, we remain committed to aggressively managing our cost structure, including the incremental $2.2 billion benefit tied to DRIVE. I'll walk you through the puts and takes in our FY2025 operating profit bridge in a moment. But at the business level, in fiscal year 2025, we expect the newly combined Express, Ground, and Services segment, now called Federal Express, to be the larger driver of FY2025 adjusted income and margin improvement.\nWe expect FedEx Freight margins to be up modestly year-over-year due to both yield and volume growth. I'd also like to provide some color on our quarterly cadence in light of the US Postal Service contract expiration at the end of September. We anticipate headwinds from the expiration of that contract to begin in Q2 starting in October. With this headwind lessening in H2 as we aggressively reduce our Postal Service-related costs, including our US domestic air network costs. Turning to other aspects of our outlook, our estimated effective tax rate for the full year is approximately 24.5% prior to mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. We're also forecasting $560 million of business optimization costs in FY2025 associated with our transformation. Our operating income bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full-year outlook.\nBy way of illustration, we're using adjusted operating profit of $7.2 billion, equivalent to $21 of adjusted EPS, the midpoint of our outlook range. To get to $7.2 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming revenue net of variable costs and continued inflationary pressures is up $100 million. The US Postal Service contract termination results in a $500 million headwind, international export yield pressure of $400 million as demand surcharges diminish and mix continues shifting toward our deferred services, and two fewer operating days in the year decreases profitability by $300 million. And as a side note, we have not experienced this adverse calendar dynamic since fiscal year 2001. And lastly, performance-based variable compensation increases by $100 million. DRIVE, however, will more than offset these pressures, delivering an incremental $2.2 billion in structural cost savings.\nAs a result of all of these factors and at the midpoint, we would expect fiscal year 2025 adjusted operating income to increase by approximately 15% year-over-year. In FY2024, we remained focused on reducing our capital intensity, increasing ROIC, and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.2 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $5.2 billion, which is a decline of nearly $1 billion compared to last year. We delivered ROIC of 9.9%, which is an increase of 120 basis points from last year's 8.7%, and we'll continue to focus on improving ROIC, and it is now a significant element of our long-term incentive program. Consistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed $500 million of accelerated share repurchases in the Q4, bringing our total share repurchases for the fiscal year to $2.5 billion.\nThis is $500 million above our plan that we came into the year with. For the full year, we also generated $4.1 billion in adjusted free cash flow, which is up about $500 million year-over-year. Looking ahead to FY2025, we anticipate capital spend of $5.2 billion, which will again be down year-over-year as a percentage of revenue. We'll work by prioritizing our capital toward optimizing our network as part of Network 2.0 and further enhancing our fleet and automation to improve operating efficiency. We remain committed to decreasing aircraft CapEx to approximately $1 billion in FY2026. Due to improved earnings and CapEx discipline, we expect to further grow adjusted free cash flow. This will enable us to deploy $2.5 billion in stock repurchases in FY2025, including a planned $1 billion of repurchases in Q1.\nAs previously announced, we're also enhancing our stockholder returns by increasing our dividend by 10%, and this is on top of the 10% increase we implemented in FY2024. Lastly, we're planning for $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans, and these plans continue to be well funded, and we're at the 98.6% funding level at fiscal year end. Finally, a quick update on our segment reporting changes. Now that we have successfully completed the consolidation of Express, Ground, and Services into Federal Express Corporation, I'm pleased to announce that our reportable segments in FY2025 will be Federal Express and FedEx Freight with no changes to corporate and other. FedEx Freight will include FedEx Custom Critical, which was previously included in FedEx Express. We're making this change to Freight due to the business synergies between Custom Critical and Freight.\nOur new segment structure reflects our commitment to operating a fully integrated air and ground Express network. And let me be clear, notwithstanding the consolidation of Express and Ground, optimizing our Express services and associated costs, including the cost of our global air network, remains critical to our profit and return objectives. This consolidated structure will support One FedEx and Network 2.0 objectives and will provide a more flexible, efficient, and intelligent network as One FedEx. We'll continue to provide service-level volume and yield detail, and we plan to share a revised statistical book in late August, which will include our recast results for FY2023 and FY2024. Overall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in delivering these strong FY2024 results and improving profitability despite a very challenging demand environment.\nI'm also really inspired by their commitment to achieving even stronger results in FY2025 and beyond as we continue to deliver on the purple promise. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today will come from Daniel Imbro with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.\n\nDaniel Imbro\n\nManaging Director and Equity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nHey, good afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask on the Express side. So some margins obviously came in at 2.6% for the year. I think obviously it's been volatile, but with the cost progress in Europe, the USPS contract shift, and then just other moving factors in the core business, can you talk about how you expect those margins to trend both in the near term and then as we move through fiscal 2025? Raj, you gave a little bit of color, I think, on some of the USPS headwinds and timing, but any more detail there in quantifying, that would be helpful. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thank you, Daniel, for that question. Let me start, and then John can fill in on some of the other details here too. Firstly, we are sequentially improving our performance in our Express services. It remains a top priority for me and the entire team. We're taking multiple actions here. Firstly, we're aligning capacity with demand, as we already heard. We moved 31 aircraft from our jet fleet in Q4. As I've mentioned to you in some detail last time we spoke, I talked to you about Tricolor. That's a fundamental restructuring of our network. It does two things. One, it improves our density, it improves our asset utilization, and expands margins. Secondly, because of the reduction of cost to serve, it puts us in a position to profitably take share in the premium freight segment.\nNext, as I mentioned in my remarks, we will improve our European performance. Our DRIVE commitment is to improve $600 million from FY 2023 baseline, and that's a critical part of how our Express services get better in FY 2025. Finally, we are taking active efforts to make sure that our global SG&A is streamlined. We are extremely confident that we can continue to unlock significant value in our Express services business. Now let me turn it over to John to add more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, no, thanks, Raj. And I think you covered it very well. We were pleased to see the sequential improvement in our margins, but recognize we have more to go. I will also add there is a significant sense of urgency as well. DRIVE is heavily focused on the Express business. And as Raj mentioned, this is going to be a key part of our margin expansion as we go forward here. And we'll look forward to updating you along the way.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So in the bridge, the $500 million postal headwind for the year, how much of that is in Q2, and what do you think that should mean for sort of the quarterly earnings cadence? And I guess ultimately, how much of the revenue decline with the post office do you think you can fully offset over the next few quarters? And then if I may, just a separate topic, Raj, just can you just talk about the puts and takes of why you would or wouldn't go ahead with an LTL spin? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo thanks, Scott. And I'll start with regard to the $500 million. We haven't laid out the spread of where it's going to impact us the most. What we can say is we've got a pretty good hold on what those costs are. We're going to be aggressively going after them beginning in Q2, and it's going to flow into Q3. And those aggressive mitigation efforts should start to really take hold in Q3 and beyond. And look forward to keeping you posted on that. And Raj, I'll turn it over to you on the other question.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, Scott. At this point, all I'm going to say is that the assessment of FedEx Freight and the company's portfolio structure is well underway. We'll do this analysis thoroughly, deliberately, and when we have something to communicate on this, we'll, of course, do so. Thank you, Scott.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nI'm sorry, I guess I didn't touch your revenue question on that part. As you can see from our outlook, we are looking to year-over-year improve our revenue. That's part of our plan as well as we go forward.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director, Wells Fargo\n\nHey, thanks. Maybe kind of just a follow-up again. On the LTL piece, Raj, just want to get a sense. Does this include a spin or sale of the assets? Just want to make sure we understand that all opportunities, or potential, is on the table. And then, I guess, John, maybe you're thinking about that kind of revenue cadence, I guess. How do you think that sort of plays? I guess that's the piece I'm looking at as the first step in the bridge on the revenue side, how that sort of plays out. Obviously, you have the big dip in revenue relative to USPS starting in Q2. Just want to get a sense of kind of how to think about that over the course of the year.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nOkay, let me start and then give it to John. Honestly, at this point, I'm not going to say much more on this topic than what I've already said. As I said, we are looking at the FedEx Freight and the company's portfolio structure, and we'll do the analysis, and we'll come back to you when we have something to say.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo I'll touch on the cadence. Well, we're not going to give quarterly guidance by segment, but for your modeling purposes, we're anticipating normal seasonal trends to hold steady in FY2025 Q1. I will note that Q2 will be impacted by a couple of events, including the impact of the US Postal Service contract termination, as well as Cyber Monday moves from Q3 of last year to Q2 of this year. We'll look forward to keeping you, I'm sorry, the other way around, from Q3 to Q2. Q2 to Q3, I'm sorry.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nHi everyone, thank you. Just in the context of your revenue assumptions, just curious if you could frame up some of the moving parts, just maybe on when you expect volumes to inflect positive, and then just any of the, and this doesn't seem like a macro-driven plan, but just any of your assumptions around the macro environment, what you need to see there to kind of see volumes perk up. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure, thanks, Conor. It's Brie. From a macro perspective, we are expecting sort of moderate improvement as we work our way through this fiscal year. As we look at kind of the subsegments of our business, from a B2B perspective, we are forecasting the overall B2B market to be around 2% growth. E-commerce will be ahead of that, as we've just seen. E-commerce reset is somewhat done. When we just looked at e-commerce as a percentage of retail in calendar year Q1, we actually were up 1% year-over-year. So we do like the fundamentals from an e-commerce perspective that will help us here in the United States and around the world. And then from an air cargo perspective, we are looking at the growth in the market around 4%. So as we work through the year, we do expect there to be modest improvement.\nWe are forecasting that we will have to take some small market share in our profitable target segment, and we feel really good about the plan as we move forward through the year.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nI'll just add one more point here, just to make sure. We will obviously monitor this demand very, very carefully, and we'll make adjustments as needed. I would just point out on our tremendous execution in fiscal year 2024, where we drove significant bottom line growth despite a lack of any revenue growth.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nGreat, thank you. Good afternoon. So, Raj, lots to digest here, and thanks for all the detail. Maybe just thoughts on the integration of the networks, your early take on how that's proceeding. And I don't know if it's for you, John, or Brie, but your $20 to 22 range, maybe thoughts on what's the upside and downside within that range from the midpoint. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you. Let me start, and then John can weigh in on this. Again, I appreciate the question. We are very pleased, firstly, with the execution and transition to One FedEx, which delivers multiple benefits. Firstly, it's more efficient in reducing overlapping costs. But more importantly, it's much more effective. We are one organization. It makes it also easier for our team members to manage their careers much better. On the Network 2.0, we continue to make significant progress in this regard. As one of the biggest markets, obviously, the one is Canada. In the first half of fiscal year 2025, we'll complete the Canada transition. Then we expect to significantly pick up the pace into FY 2026. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. Hey, Ken, look, on the guidance, as always, we continue to take a very thoughtful and methodical approach. There are a number of factors we've taken into account. As Brie mentioned, we expect a modest improvement in the demand environment in FY2025 and supporting our revenue outlook of a low to mid single-digit percentage increase, as we noted. That'll be driven by improving trends at US domestic parcel and international export. While headwinds remain, and we align those out in our bridge, we continue to focus on aligning our costs across the enterprise with expected volume and are focused on executing on revenue quality strategy. We're going to be focused on DRIVE. I would direct your attention to the right side of that slide, the $2.2 billion of focused on DRIVE and controlling those things within our control.\nAnd that's going to be critical for us to deliver on this guidance.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good afternoon. Maybe if I can just follow up from Ken's question there, Raj, on Network 2.0 and the integration, I think investors are pretty excited about this, but also concerned that there could be network disruption. I mean, if we've just looked across 20 or 30 years of transportation network integration, it always hasn't gone all that well. We can look no further than TNT. So what are you guys doing from a systems perspective and maybe a physical network and facility pickup and delivery linehaul perspective that mitigates some of those risks? And what are the lessons learned thus far?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nWell, I'll start first, and then maybe Brie can comment on it. Absolutely, we are making sure that our customer experience actually gets better. And we now have a very rigorous process through DRIVE. The rigor and discipline that we have established on multiple projects that's associated with this is very critical. So we will follow this very carefully and rigorously and make sure that our customer experience gets better as we go through this process.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThe only thing that I would add, Brandon, is when we looked at Network 2.0, is we've given ourselves time. From a pace perspective, we have built in the right cadence so that if we do need to pause, we can. We haven't needed to. I think that's really important. The rigor, the planning, the technology, and the tools that Scott Ray and John have worked. Service is good. And in fact, as I've mentioned previously, this also solves our single pickup feature of service, which has been just a huge opportunity for us as we move forward from small business acquisition. So I feel really good. Service is the strongest in the market at FedEx, FEC, I guess I have to say, moving forward. And I feel really good about the domestic network right now.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good morning. So or good morning. Good afternoon. Day's going by quickly. Let's see. Wanted to see if you could give, I know you talked a little bit about some of the factors in DRIVE. Wanted to see if you could give a little bit more maybe on Europe. I think some of the cost savings you announced, the headcount reductions come a couple of years out, not in fiscal 2025, or they ramp in 2026 and more so in 2027. Can you give just a little more perspective on the changes in Europe and just how important the $600 million improvement in Europe is to the overall DRIVE? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, thanks. Tom, it's John. Yeah, the $600 million is very important to drive, and it's one of our top priorities. As Raj mentioned, we were all just in Europe last week, meeting with the team, the leadership, not only there to support them, but also to stress the urgency of how important this is. We're looking at every aspect of our operation in Europe. There will be new leadership as well, and we're going to continue to focus not only on the commercial side, but some operational efficiencies, including the network. There's also opportunity now that we're in Network 2.0, full swing of implementation, to leverage the expertise that John Smith and his team bring on the US side, which is where we're very strong, to work in coordination with our team in Europe.\nSomething that's been done in the past, but we're really taking it to the next level. So I think all those things are key, and we're serious about the $600 million, and we'll look forward to updating you on our progress in the other main categories. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, and Tom, the point that John just talked about is very important. I think the biggest opportunity that we have in Europe is the intra-Europe theater, and that is ground-based. We have a significant amount of interaction now between the management teams, and between Walter and Scott Ray, for example, and everyone below that. Also, we have now established KPI dashboards that very much provide real-time visibility on package flows, and to improve service and reduce costs. It's a lot of work going on here. Very excited about what we can make happen.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. John, you pointed to the right side of the bridge again on the $2.2 billion. I think maybe some of the debate is that $2.2 billion gross or net. It feels like you're saying it's both. How much of that is truly in your control, kind of independent of everything else going on in the macro environment and even the yield environment? And I guess the other part of it would be, if the non-peak demand even doesn't play out the way that you've kind of expected it to, are there other kind of variable cost levers to pull, or is this strictly just more of a structural DRIVE cost initiative for fiscal 2025?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure, thanks, Jom. Yeah, the 2.2 is structural in nature. So from our perspective, that is all within our control. And to the extent the macro environment doesn't cooperate, we're going to keep at it. The 2.2 includes projects that are in motion now. And as I've said in prior calls, some of our programs are going to overdeliver, some may underdeliver, but the pipeline is constant. So we're going to adapt aggressively, not only to the plans that are in place, but also to the change in the demand environment as well.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nJohn, look no further than what we did in FY2024.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi, afternoon. Question. So the low to mid single-digit revenue growth that you talked about for the year, is there a way to think about the blend between the yield and volume? Is it two and two, something along those lines? And then just sort of along those lines, I think you get some color around B2B volumes or demand of up 2% or so. I'm just sort of wondering, with retailers maybe doing more of this just-in-time focus these days, does that sort of play into B2B and fast-cycle logistics companies like FedEx? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, great question, Jordan. So as we think about this year's revenue plan, you will see it be largely volume-driven, and it will be driven from a deferred and an e-commerce perspective. As we have just mentioned, we do think e-commerce is going to outpace the B2B growth. To your point, from a speed perspective, we are actually seeing the speed conversation elevate in the market, especially with what we would consider sort of your tier one or your household brand. From a competition perspective, we're absolutely increasing that conversation. And actually, there is increased demand from a speed perspective within it. So I hope that gives you a little bit more clarity, but we do see volume moving throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So Brie, maybe just to follow up on the demand environment, can you tell us what you expect from peak season and how the planning and integration visibility, I guess more importantly, is going with the major approvals over the prior years, where it's been a little bit harder to get maybe the right information and the right assets in place? And then John, can you just give us any sense, and you don't want to give formal guidance, but any sense in terms of how the DRIVE $2.2 billion will roll out throughout each quarter this year? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brian. So from a peak season perspective, we had a really phenomenal peak last year. That's going to be hard to top, but if there's a team that can do it, it's John. From a collaboration and an insight, we are actually getting further integrated with our largest retailers. So we have even better information than we have ever had. So from my perspective, I think from an asset and an alignment with capacity, this peak, I can't control the weather, nor can John Smith. He can do a lot of things, but he can't control the weather. But I do feel really good going into peak. And in fact, we have taken all of our peak best practices from the United States, and we are expanding them around the world. We just had an incredible hot sale in Mexico domestic as an example.\nI feel pretty confident about peak season.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBefore John goes, I just want to make sure that in terms of the volume growth, what we're expecting is low single-digit volume growth for the year.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nYeah, and with respect, Brian, to your question on DRIVE, the $2.2 billion, we are committed to that. And as I said, a number of plans are already in place. We talked about the $600 million for Europe. The majority of the savings will come from the surface network and our legacy express operations as we're looking to optimize our processes and improve efficiencies there. And G&A, IT, and procurement will be key drivers for the savings. I know you asked about the timing of that, but we look forward to keeping you updated as these plans solidify and as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nFor the investment community, it's very clear to see the potential benefits of separating the Western Truckload business, just looking at multiples and investor favorability there over the last three or four years. What do we miss when looking at the other side of that? What do you lose? What are you thinking about as the offset when you make that decision over the next six or so months? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nBascom, as I've said before, I'm not going to comment too much more on this. We have already said historically about what value FedEx is part of the network. We'll do the full analysis. And again, like I said, it's going to be very thorough. And when we have something to talk about, we will definitely communicate it.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shankar\n\nExecutive Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThanks for that, everyone. Just want to confirm that the headcount reductions in Europe, were they part of DRIVE? I mean, given that you're going to see the benefit of that in FY2027, just wondering if that was incremental. And also kind of when you think of the actions you're taking right now, kind of how much of that is commercial, kind of operating, kind of revenue-driven versus actual cost cutting in Europe? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nSo it's certainly in line with the DRIVE philosophy. Because some of the benefits are going to flow beyond the DRIVE FY2025 period, we haven't included it in that number. It truly is cost takeout. These are non-operational positions. We look forward to keeping you posted.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, guys, and thanks for the time. So Raj, I hate to come back to the same topic again, but when you were with us a few weeks ago here in New York, you were sounding like it was a little bit more of you're moving in the direction anyway of more closely integrating some of the freight stuff with the Tricolor network strategy. So my question for you is really kind of what's changed in the thinking in the last couple of weeks? What's the impetus for the decision to do a review here? And secondly, as you think about what that review will mean, are there any downstream implications for that Tricolor network strategy that we should be thinking about?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation",
    "content2": "Well, David, thank you for the question. As we've heard from several investors and analysts in this regard, and obviously, we take input from our shareholders very, very seriously. And so this is the right time in our national planning calendar. As for Tricolor goals, no changes. We're moving on ahead. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe a question for Brie here. You noted you're pleased by the pricing capture that you've been able to achieve, noted in light of the current pricing environment. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the current pricing environment, from a competitive standpoint or overall rationality? Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. Thanks, Stephanie. So from a market perspective, it absolutely is competitive. That's nothing particularly new in this market. So it's competitive, but it's rational. I think our team has been very disciplined. We have absolutely been able to maintain the yield increases that we captured in CY2022 and CY2023 and then built on there. I think it's also really important to note that we're very focused not just on total yield, but getting yield in the right place where we need it. So for example, I think our team is doing the very best in the market at getting peak surcharges. I should have said that when the peak question just came up. The team has done a really good job in getting the increase we need to deliver an amazing peak where we do have to expand capacity.\nThe same goes to rural coverage as well as large packages. So yes, it's competitive, but I think the team is doing a really good job of navigating kind of market share, profit market share growth with getting the right yield for the right package and working really, really closely with the operation. So I'm incredibly pleased.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks. And good afternoon, everyone. Lots of good and interesting stuff happening here. But maybe just switching gears a little bit, we've got some elections coming up. And I'm just curious how big of an issue tariffs have been as part of your customer discussions to date. And maybe more specifically, just given your commentary, Brie, around China e-commerce, you've got a couple of big direct e-com customers. Can you just maybe remind us of how big they are right now as a percentage of your book and what's maybe the risk to volumes here if there is a change in trade policy?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nSure. I'll start with the last question, and then I'll certainly turn it to the boss to talk about the overall tariff situation. So from an e-commerce perspective, yes, e-commerce is the largest driver of intercontinental out of China, but actually around the world, both domestically and internationally. We are really proud of how diversified our revenue base is. Yes, we have a great relationship with all of the major e-commerce players out of China. But the benefit of those customers is that they're really large. And so we can partner with them to find the right solutions, what makes sense for us, as well as what makes sense for them. No one carrier can serve their entire needs. And I think we found a very productive and profitable relationship. And again, I do want to emphasize very diversified base. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nAnd on the broader point here, the trade as a percentage of GDP has essentially flatlined since about 2016. So we've been operating in this environment for some time. Now, it's important to note that the trade patterns are fundamentally shifting. And the good news for FedEx is our network. We are here, there, and everywhere. And we get the intelligence from the market at the ground level. That is, we are a referendum on a global supply chain every single day. And so because of that, we are able to react very quickly, much faster than manufacturing can move. And so the supply chain pattern changes actually works in our favor in many ways because the only companies that have established networks that connect all these countries can actually do these things.\nSo for example, when manufacturing moves to Mexico, we have a significant presence in Mexico and the United States. In fact, our competitor said we are the only one who can say that with conviction. So while we see the overall trade trends flatten out, there are opportunities as supply chain patterns change. And again, our established networks that we have in place and the digital tools that we now have make us very compelling.\n\nOperator\n\nThis will conclude our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, operator. Before we wrap, I want to congratulate Rob Carter once again on his upcoming retirement after more than 30 years of dedication and service to FedEx. I also want to take this opportunity to welcome Sriram Krishnasamy into his expanded role as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective next week. In closing, I'm extremely proud of our FedEx team for a strong end to a year of incredible performance. Margin expansion and operating profit growth for four consecutive quarters, despite revenue decline in three of those quarters, is a tremendous achievement. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead as we continue to focus on enhancing our profitability and stockholder returns while providing outstanding service for our customers. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Jeni Hollander, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJenifer Hollander\n\nHead, IR, Kyndryl Holdings, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year.

We are happy to have you on board leading the Investor Relations team.\nBefore we discuss the quarter, I would like to congratulate Rob Carter on his upcoming retirement, which we announced last week. He has served as CIO for the last 24 years leading FedEx in modernizing our IT infrastructure. I'm immensely grateful to Rob for his numerous contributions in establishing FedEx as an innovative, data-driven and a people-focused company. We thank him for his dedication and service to FedEx over the years, and wish him well in his upcoming retirement.\nThank you also to the FedEx team for their exceptional work in Q3 by providing superior service for customers and delivering strong results, all while advancing our transformation initiatives.\nFor the third consecutive quarter, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion in a declining revenue environment. This is a very positive dynamic and a unique one in our industry. It demonstrates clear progress on our transformation and ability to manage what's within our control through DRIVE.\nWe're strengthening our value proposition, improving the customer experience and increasing profitability. This progress supports our long-term goals for sustainable margin expansion, improvements in ROIC and value creation for our stockholders.\nNow turning to the details. Our transformation is driving continued improvements in adjusted operating income, margins and earnings per share. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 16% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin expansion of 90 basis points compared to the prior year, even as revenue declined 2%.\nAdjusted operating income growth was driven by continued strength at Ground and improvement at Express. At the segment level, I'm particularly pleased with the results at Ground, where adjusted operating income increased 14% on 1% revenue growth and adjusted operating margin improved to over 11% in the quarter. This reflects continued progress controlling expenses and effective yield management, including the ramping benefits from DRIVE.\nAt Freight, the team's continued focus on profitable growth and cost management delivered strong margins and mitigated year-over-year volume challenges. Service levels remain exceptionally high, demonstrating our differentiated execution capabilities.\nWe're also making progress at Express, where adjusted operating income increased enabled by our ability to remove structural costs.\nLooking ahead, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our fiscal '24 adjusted EPS range while narrowing the range to $17.25 to $18.25. In fact, we now expect to deliver adjusted earnings above the midpoint of the range we shared last June despite full year revenue expectations that have deteriorated significantly over the past 9 months. This is clear evidence of our ability to execute.\nTurning to the Express business. It is my top priority to continue to make the changes necessary to align our air network with an evolving demand environment and unlock the full profit opportunity. While we have made progress at Express this quarter, there are several areas we are aggressively working to address in order to accelerate profit improvement: service mix, network utilization, continued inflation and other cost headwinds.\nFirst, with respect to service mix. We're seeing a clear international market shift towards deferred services. This is tied in part to the rapid growth of many of our e-commerce customers, where we are a critical enabler of global trade, offering unique solutions for our customers. More on how we are addressing this mix shift shortly.\nSecond, weakness in global trade continues to constrain demand in our international business, which has remained challenged for longer than expected. As such, we're continuing to proactively realign our air network to match capacity to demand.\nAnd third, this quarter, Express experienced over $200 million of inflationary pressure on a year-over-year basis. We offset this with benefits from DRIVE as well as responsible head count management. The dynamics I just outlined create significant opportunities for us to improve our network utilization.\nLast quarter, we introduced our Tricolor strategy. Ultimately, this network design will enable us to improve the efficiency and asset utilization of the entire FedEx system; put the right product in the right network, taking advantage of our continental surface networks in Europe and our market-leading FedEx Freight LTL network in the United States; and profitably penetrate new market segments at the right cost structure, including the premium air freight market. As we move forward, we are managing the execution of Tricolor with the rigor and discipline of DRIVE, and this will be a key element to our success.\nMoving to another area of opportunity. In Europe, we continue to improve our service levels and focus on commercial execution. However, the B2B environment remains challenged. And in this context, we are making progress on DRIVE on track to generate $600 million of savings in fiscal year '25 and seeking further profit optimization opportunities.\nAs we have mentioned in previous calls, we are also experiencing a continued headwind for the United States Postal Service, which has reduced volume. Despite this volume and revenue drawdown, our service obligations to the USPS remain fixed.\nAt Express, and across the business, DRIVE remains a key enabler of improved profitability, both in the near and the long term as we change the way we work and identify areas for structural cost reductions. In Q3, we delivered $550 million of benefits from DRIVE, offsetting the impact of revenue declines and cost pressures.\nI'm encouraged by the progress across all 3 categories. This includes $290 million in our surface network, $110 million of savings in air network and in international operations and $150 million of G&A. Given the progress we have made year-to-date, we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in permanent cost reduction benefits from DRIVE this fiscal year and are highly confident on the additional $2.2 billion in fiscal year '25.\nThe work we are doing with DRIVE is also helping advance planning for Network 2.0. This quarter, we rolled out our new surface operations leadership structure. Under this new structure, leaders and their teams will be responsible for all Express and Ground package operations and facilities in their respective divisions, regions and districts. This will enhance operational execution and offer greater insights into the package business overall with accountability at all levels.\nMore broadly, we have now implemented Network 2.0 in over 50 locations, with dozens more to follow in calendar 2024, all while maintaining outstanding service. And as a reminder, we will begin the rollout of Canada in April and expect to complete this transition by October of 2024.\nAnd as part of our transformation, we are on track to complete the consolidation of FedEx operating companies into one streamlined and simplified organization, creating efficiencies as we build a stronger, more profitable enterprise. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services will consolidate into Federal Express Corporation.\nThe work we are doing to create a more flexible, efficient and intelligent network is translating into direct improvements in our customer offering and profitability. When severe weather hits, it can cause a domino effect of delays and reduced service levels across our network. While we have always used data and analytics to assess the effect of weather events, our new weather contingency playbook developed by our planning, engineering and data works teams enhances the process by leveraging predictive capabilities to proactively divert storm-bound volumes across our networks.\nBy combining the power of digital insights and predictive analytics with our physical network, we effectively mitigated the impact of the January winter storm that hit our Express hub in Memphis, by shifting Memphis down Express volume to ground our freight at the origin location. Despite this year's event having a longer impact to Memphis operations when compared to the weather event in February 2023, our network recovery was twice as fast.\nThis quarter, we also announced a significant initiative, fdx, a fully integrated data-driven commerce platform that connects the entire customer journey from demand to returns. It will provide real-time visibility to help our customers optimize and grow their business, leveraging our analytical capabilities and data from the 15 million packages we deliver every day.\nI'm excited to have Sriram Krishnasamy serving as Chief Digital and Information Officer effective July 1. His proven track record of driving optimization and innovation for our business through data and insights, combined with his deep knowledge of the network, will be critical to moving FedEx forward as we become a data-driven, digital-first company.\nAs I look across the business and these financial results, there are clear signs of progress on our transformation. Our strategy is generating results, and we are well placed to maintain our leadership position while delivering improving financial outcomes. Together, we remain focused and committed to our long-term goals, supporting the creation of significant, long-term value for our stockholders.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President & Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, FedEx Corp.\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I want to thank our FedEx team for strong performance during the peak season. As a result of their hard work and commitment, we once again delivered the best service offering in the industry.\nWe continue to execute on our commercial priorities, with a focus on revenue quality while maintaining our industry-leading service. As a result, we took profitable share in the quarter at market rates and we continue to retain the vast majority of the volume we gained from UPS in the second half of 2023.\nOur unmatched value proposition has enabled recent high-value wins in the semiconductor, health care and aerospace industry. We will continue to execute our commercial strategy to compete and grow further in the high-margin areas of the market.\nLooking now by geography. In the United States, conditions have been weaker than we anticipated. And internationally, we continue to see softness. We, however, remain very focused on strong commercial execution.\nTaking a look at third quarter revenue performance by segment. At FedEx Ground, revenue was up about 1% year-over-year on a modest yield improvement and flat volumes. Our team remains disciplined on growing with the right customers and mix while offering the best value proposition in the industry.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue declined 3%. While volume decreased compared to last year, the year-over-year decline moderated on a sequential basis. Revenue was also negatively affected by lower fuel surcharges and a decrease in weight per shipment, although the decline was partially offset by higher base yields.\nAnd at FedEx Express, revenue was down 2% year-over-year, driven by continued volume softness, lower fuel and demand surcharges and a mix shift towards deferred and e-commerce products. The actions Raj outlined will allow us to profitably grow this business while continuing to deliver excellent service for our customers.\nTurning to our monthly volume trends during the quarter. Broadly speaking, volumes are stabilizing as we lap weaker demand from a year ago. International export increased 4% in the quarter, driven by a 29% growth in international economy, which, of course, is the market reset we expected. Freight shipments declined, but they continued to moderate sequentially.\nAs Raj mentioned, postal volumes were a headwind in the quarter. Our current contract with the United States Postal Service expires on September 29. We have made significant progress in negotiations for a new contract that aligns with our ongoing network transformation plan while providing the USPS with the operational reliability and outstanding service we have delivered for them for more than 2 decades. A new multiyear agreement would provide a more efficient network with service to fewer markets. It would allow us to better adjust our overall network to demand. We, of course, will let you know when we have an update.\nWe continue to operate in a competitive but rational market environment. During the quarter, yield trends were similar to what we saw last quarter, with dynamics remaining mixed across the segments. At FedEx Express, yields remained pressured due to a tapering of international export demand surcharges and an increasing mix of lower-yielding e-commerce and deferred products. Yield was also pressured by increased capacity in the market.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery, partially offset by ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year. And at FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment was down 1%, driven by lower fuel surcharges and lower weight.\nIn January, we rolled out a 5.9% GRI. And importantly, we've been able to capture a high percentage of that rate increase. During peak, our holiday peak residential surcharges enabled us to respectively offset higher costs, delivering $120 million in profit. We are very confident we have the right strategy in place balancing both volume and yield growth.\nWe are building our network of the future with digital and data-driven solutions that simplify the customer experience and further strengthen our best-in-class customer offerings. For example, earlier this month, we enhanced our health care offering with more powerful capabilities to prioritize critical life-saving health care shipments above other volume within the network.\nHealth care customers now have the ability to select monitoring and intervention service options. They cover categories such as temperature requirements and vaccines, and they do this at the package level. Each Express shipment now includes specific health care identifiers so that if we need to intervene, we are able to do it with more speed and more precision.\nAnd of course, in January, we announced the fdx Commerce platform. fdx connects the entire customer journey by offering end-to-end e-commerce solutions, making it easier for companies to grow demand, increase conversion, optimize fulfillment and streamline their returns. The fdx platform will enable us to enhance our longstanding relationships with merchants of all sizes to help them optimize and grow their business. We have opened a private preview for select brands and retailers. And based on their feedback, I am incredibly excited about the official launch later this year.\nIn closing, I am very proud of our entire global team and how they continue to deliver outstanding service as we navigate a very dynamic market. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover our financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nAI Assigned\n\nThanks, Brie. Our third quarter results reflect ongoing progress on our DRIVE initiative as well as our continued focus on service and revenue quality. As a result of these efforts, we delivered operating income growth and margin expansion for the third quarter in a row despite declining revenue in a challenging market environment.\nTaking a closer look at our performance in the quarter on a year-over-year basis and at the enterprise level, adjusted operating income increased by $192 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 90 basis points. At Express, adjusted operating income increased by $134 million and adjusted operating margin expanded 130 basis points. The benefits of DRIVE initiatives and an additional operating date more than offset lower revenue.\nAt Ground, the team delivered another quarter of strong results. Adjusted operating income increased by $120 million and adjusted operating margin expanded by 140 basis points due to cost reductions and yield improvement. Despite slightly lower volumes and in an inflationary environment, ground cost per package was flat year-over-year, with lower line-haul expenses and improved dock productivity offsetting higher first and last mile costs.\nAnd at Freight, while operating margin remained strong, operating income declined by $46 million and operating margin declined by 170 basis points driven by lower fuel surcharges, reduced weight per shipment and lower shipments. These results also reflect the lapping of a $30 million facility gain last year, partially offset by the benefit of an additional operating day during the quarter. Looking at the quarter overall, weather had an immaterial year-over-year effect on profitability.\nBefore turning to the outlook, I'd like to spend a few moments updating you on our cost reduction initiatives, including DRIVE and more specifically, G&A. As an initial matter, and as part of responsible headcount management, we have reduced our workforce by nearly 22,000 over the last year and expect additional opportunities in the future as we move forward with our transformation.\nWithin G&A, we continue to make significant changes to how we approach areas like procurement and technology so that we are a more efficient, digitally led organization. In addition, global functional alignment provides savings opportunities. I'm pleased that we have achieved $350 million of G&A savings year-to-date, including $150 million in the third quarter.\nTaking a closer look at sourcing and procurement, we've continued to evolve the sourcing and procurement function from a segregated and regional structure to a centralized global organization that will manage most third-party spend across the entire enterprise. With new leaders in place, we're developing new category strategies and have already identified about 20 discrete categories that we'll manage centrally in cooperation with functional leaders.\nBy implementing these new strategies at the enterprise level will have tighter spend oversight, will better leverage our scale and buying power and generate significant cost savings. Overall, I'm very pleased with our enterprise-wide DRIVE progress this quarter and we will deliver $1.8 billion in savings for the full fiscal year.\nNow turning to our fiscal year outlook. And as Raj shared earlier, based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming the midpoint of our adjusted EPS range while narrowing our outlook from the prior range of $17 to $18.50 to $17.25 to $18.25. At the midpoint of the narrowed range, we continue to assume a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue for the full year. As always, we'll closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory restocking, global trade, inflation and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected revenue.\nWith regard to our fourth quarter expectations, as implied by our outlook range, we expect year-over-year profit improvement despite lapping the onset of certain structural benefits executed in last year's fourth quarter at Express and Ground. Looking on a sequential basis, the leap day in the third quarter affects our typical seasonality. At the segment level, we're maintaining our full year expectations for a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express, adjusted margin improvement at Ground and strong but lower year-over-year margin at Freight.\nAt Express, we're looking at every aspect of the business, including taking a fresh look at additional opportunities to improve our European business. And we're confident in our ability to unlock more value at Express and across all our businesses as we continue to seek optimization opportunities.\nOur bridge shows the operating profit elements embedded in our full year outlook. For illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, the equivalent to $17.75 of adjusted EPS, as the midpoint of our narrowed outlook range.\nTo walk the bridge to $6.3 billion of adjusted operating profit, we're now assuming that revenue net of cost increases is up $200 million that we experienced $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges diminished and product mix continues shifting toward deferred, variable compensation increases by $300 million and that these pressures are more than offset by $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from DRIVE. At the midpoint, we would expect fiscal 2024 adjusted operating income to increase approximately 17% despite revenue declining by a low single-digit percentage.\nAs I've discussed on prior calls, we remain focused on reducing our capital intensity and continuing to provide increased stockholder returns as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet prudent capital allocation and improving return on invested capital. Our capital investment priorities will be on improving efficiency, modernizing facilities and optimizing our network.\nCapital expenditures for the quarter were $1.4 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $4 billion. We now anticipate capital spend of $5.4 billion for the full year, which is down over $700 million from last year and down $300 million from our prior forecast of $5.7 billion. We also continue to expect aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '26. And we expect CapEx as a percentage of revenue will keep declining in the future as we reduce our facilities footprint through Network 2.0 and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx beyond fiscal year '26.\nWe currently have 37 jet aircraft parked, which is up from 20% last quarter. And as previously communicated, we will retire 9 more MD-11s in Q4.\nConsistent with our goal of increasing stockholder returns, we completed a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction in the third quarter bringing our total share repurchases for the first 9 months of the fiscal year to $2 billion, and we expect to repurchase an additional $500 million of common stock in the fourth quarter bringing total fiscal year '24 repurchases to $2.5 billion, while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan.\nI'm also pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which augments the $600 million that remains available for repurchase under the $5 billion 2021 authorization. This reinforces our commitment to support long-term stockholder returns.\nOverall, I want to acknowledge and thank the entire team for their efforts in continuing to improve profitability in a challenging revenue environment. We have more work to do, but I'm encouraged by the commitment and focus I've seen from our teams to advance our transformation and provide our customers and stockholders with even greater value.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

[Operator Instructions]. Please note this event is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Stephen Hughes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nStephen Hughes\n\nDirector of DNA Programs, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc.\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The earnings release Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at investors.fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to 1 question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

Let me begin by thanking the FedEx team for their commitment to delivering yet another -- FedEx has the best service offerings in the industry. This includes the most expansive global network and the fastest U.S. Ground service with -- broadest weakened residential coverage. Strong service and speed are also coming with a more aggressive peak transit compared to this time last year with a Ground time in transit in the U.S. at [ one ] incredibly proud of the team's ability to sustain superior service levels while we continue to transform our global network.\nOur second quarter performance reflects clear signs of progress in our transformation in what remains a difficult demand environment. We are moving at speed and agility to deliver on Drive, which is supporting improved profitability and enabling us to maintain our earnings outlook for the year even as our revenue expectations have moderated further.\nYou can see in our results in Slide 6, our transformation is driving improved profitability. At the enterprise level, we delivered a 17% improvement in adjusted operating income and adjusted margin improvement of 110 basis points compared to the prior year even as the total revenue declined 3%. These results reflect benefits by a continued focus on revenue and meaningful differentiation across our products and services as we build the world's smartest logistics network. Our focused execution enabled us to retain a majority the high-quality volume we won over the summer from UPS and as a result of the Yellow [ shut ].\nAt the segment level, Ground continued to deliver outstanding results with adjusting operating income of 57% and adjusted margin expansion of 370 basis points. This was driven in part by revenue growth due to higher yield and volume combined with solid operational performance.\nFreight delivered strong performance as well driving double-digit profit improvement and margin expansion of over 270 basis points compared to the prior year. Express total revenue declined due to both volume and yield pressures. These headwinds more than offset continued benefits will drive and led to a margin decline compared to the prior year. There's more work to do at Express, whereas [ are density ]. We continue to make progress at Express to unlock the value that exists across this business.\nTurning to Slide 7. In Drive continues to fundamentally change the way we work. The impact of Drive is clear as our lower cost structure enables improved profitability. Let's look at the powerful chart on the left-hand side of the slide, if you look across market cycles over the last 15 years, we have now delivered 2 consecutive quarters of operating income growth against declining revenues. When you step back and review how our business has performed in environments with suppressed demand, we are delivering much better profitability today than we have historically.\nIn the quarter, we reduced cost by approximately $200 million in our surface network, including our U.S. Express operations. This was driven by shifting to a single daily career dispatch applying dock product initiatives, consolidating underutilized sorts and maximizing the use of rail. Across our air network and international operations, our Drive initiatives are helping offset pressures with about $115 million in total cost reductions in Q2, primarily driven by structural flight takedowns.\nAnd in G&A, we're making significant changes to how we approach procurement and functional. In the second quarter, we realized over $100 million in savings driven by reducing the use of temporary labor, leveraging the scale of the enterprise to negotiate favorable surface transportation rates, optimizing certain benefit programs and lowering headcount. Given our progress, we are highly confident that we will deliver on our goal of $1.8 billion in cost reduction effects from Drive this fiscal year.\nTurning to Slide 8. Despite progress on Drive, profitability at FedEx Express was pressured by an ongoing volume mix shift and related yield headwinds. Our ability to drive margin improvement in the near term has been constrained by transitory factors, including the year-over-year decline in the U.S. postal service volume, combined with minimum required service obligations associated with our current USPS contract. And also the timing of the structural redesign of our air network.\nHistorically, our unmatched global air network was primarily built on a hub and spoke system to support speed and global connectivity. With the rapid growth of e-commerce and as volume mix shift to deferred, we recognize the need to reconfigure our network to focus on both speed and density. This fundamental network redesign, which we call Tricolor design, is moments in our history and includes several key elements.\nFirst, we will deploy what we call our, Purple tail fleet which is our FedEx owned assets time for delivering high priority, high-margin volumes using the existing hub and spoke model. This is our Purple network which will be the backbone of our International Priority Parcel business.\nSecond, we will retime a portion of our Purple tail flights for what we call our Orange network which will operate off cycle. This change will give us time to build density, decongest our hubs during the precious night sort and feed into our surface networks including our international road network as well as FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight in the U.S. This provides us a differentiated capability to drive profitable, less capital-intensive growth, a sizable global deferred parcel and air freight markets. And third, we will continue to leverage our global partner network as an adaptive capacity layer, particularly on imbalanced trade lanes. This is our white network.\nThese changes will improve utilization of our assets, increase margins and enhance ROIC. The air network redesign is a critical piece of our Drive execution at Express and will support the realization of our targeted $4 billion of total Drive savings in fiscal year 2025. We're approaching this network in a deliberately measured manner to ensure we continue to provide our customers with the best service levels in the industry.\nSimultaneously, as you know, we're executing Network 2.0. Taken together, these efforts improve our ability to protect profitability and returns through various market environments. Big picture, we're making clear progress on our transformation and drive is having a real impact. Additionally, our team is advancing efforts to combine the strength of our physical transportation network with our digital and data-driven solutions. We are leveraging our world-class engineering skill base to deliver cost-effective cutting-edge capabilities globally.\nEarlier this month, we opened our first advanced capability community or ACC, in Hyderabad, India. Which will serve as a hub for our technological and digital innovation. I'm truly excited about the opening of the ACC and the vast opportunity to use digital to run our business better, enhance our customer experience and generate new profitable revenue streams.\nOverall, I'm confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to create significant stockholder value. In these last few months and weeks, our team's dedication to the Purple Promise has been tremendous. And I would like to express my sincere thanks to our colleagues. This performance has put FedEx in good portion as we enter the full structure peak and deliver the best service offerings in the industry.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive Vice President, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue quality and industry-leading service remains top priorities for us in the quarter. Our ability to retain the majority of the business we won from both UPS and Yellow is a testament to the team's hard work and our value proposition, which is the best service offering in the industry. And as a result, we are gaining parcel share here in the United States and around the world.\nLooking at the U.S., market conditions remain soft, with Q2 demand lower than we anticipated. The Indus now experienced 10 consecutive quarters of decline in U.S. domestic average daily volume. Additionally, international market pressure continued. Despite this pressure, our Europe and EMEA teams did a great job of growing parcel volume.\nLet's now look at each segment. At FedEx Ground, second quarter revenue was up 3% year-over-year, driven by higher yield and volume. We remain focused on growing our business with the right customer and service mix to improve profitability and maintain our position as the price leader in a domestic market segment. At FedEx Freight, new customers that came over as a result of the Yellow shutdown are enjoying a better value prop and we have retained a majority of this volume. Freight results showcase our disciplined focus on revenue quality as we gained share amid the industry disruptions. The market was down and revenue declined 4% as lower shipments offset an increase in yield. But on a sequential basis, our revenue decline moderated significantly as volume pressure lessened and revenue per shipment inflected positively.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 6% year-over-year, driven by market contraction and lower fuel and demand surcharges. Global Freight pounds were down 18% year-over-year, driven by lower postal service volume as well as the weakness in industrial production. Despite these headwinds, we are encouraged by the progress in areas we can control. For example, the improvement in European service levels enabled profitable share gains. With less than 1 week to Christmas, our focus remains on delivering outstanding service. Our networks are running extremely well, and we are receiving very positive customer feedback this peak. We are delivering this excellent service while creating new value for customers and driving customer acquisition.\nThis holiday season, we estimate over 365 million packages will be delivered with a picture showing proof of delivery, CPOD as we call it. It's a great new feature that has helped us win new customers. CPOD and other digital tools such as estimated delivery time window and FedEx Delivery Manager provide customers with peace of mind when it comes to holiday shipments. Overall, this year's peak season has been relatively similar to last year, and it's in line with our expectations. But looking ahead, we're ready to support our customers for post-holiday returns. Our robust returns portfolio is well positioned to handle the returns that inevitably follow peak. Our portfolio includes both a prelabeled and a no label no-box solution that creates convenient, seamless experiences for retailers and for consumers.\nNow taking a step back to look at monthly volumes during the quarter. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, we gained parcel share in both the United States and in international markets. This is a clear indication of our winning value proposition in a contracting market. Volumes have continued to improve sequentially with ground and international export maintaining last quarter's trend of growth on a year-over-year basis.\nTurning to Slide 14. Overall, the market is competitive but rational. And we are committed to delivering on our revenue quality strategy. During the quarter, yield trends improved slightly, but the dynamics were mixed across the segments. At FedEx Ground, yield increased 1%, driven by home delivery and commercial Ground offset by Ground economy. Higher weight per package and favorable customer segment mix offset a lower fuel surcharge relative to the prior year.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment increased 1%, with base rates strong despite lower surcharges and weights. At FedEx Express, yield was pressured due to lower fuel and demand surcharges. Shift towards e-commerce and the reopening of our international economy service in EMEA also pressure yield. We continue to focus on our revenue quality strategy. Earlier this month, we raised U.S. Express and Ground fuel surcharges by 1% and international Express fuel surcharges by 1.5%.\nLooking ahead, we expect a high capture rate from our 5.9% general rate increase. We will reset our delivery area surcharges consistent with our usual practice. As we've shared previously, we are also resetting our approach to dimensional pricing for international shipments. This is moving from a shipment to a per piece dimensional pricing, which is the global market practice. We are confident in our strategy, and we are balancing both volume and growth.\nMoving now to Slide 15. Raj mentioned our focus on digital and efforts to identify new revenue streams. I am particularly excited about our new tracking API that we will launch in early 2024. Our tracking API is for both e-commerce shippers and platform, providing them with best-in-class visibility for their customers, including a picture proof of delivery. This new for offering is a significant enhancement for our retail customers as well as for those third-party e-commerce platforms that rely on our data as an integral part of their value proposition. This is just one example of how we're thinking about our digital capabilities to better serve our customers and generate profitable incremental revenue for FedEx.\nIn closing, I want to thank our entire global team for how they are executing around the world to deliver an absolutely positively outstanding peak season.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it to John to discuss the financials.\n\nJohn W. Dietrich\n\nPresident & Chief Operating Officer, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc.\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on Slide 17. Despite a revenue decline, the FedEx team delivered improved profitability with strong adjusted operating margin growth driven by a continued focus on revenue quality and execution of the company's drive initiatives.\nTaking a closer look at our segment performance in the quarter, starting with Ground. The team continues to deliver strong results. Adjusted operating income increased 57% due to yield improvement, cost reductions and higher volumes. Cost per package -- by 2% driven by lower linehaul expense and improved first and last mile productivity.\nAt Freight, operating income increased 11% during the quarter, driven by higher yield and increased efficiency, partially offset by lower shipments. The team continues to focus on improving profitability while navigating this lower demand environment -- and profitability was pressured as impacts of softening demand on revenue were only partially offset by structural and volume-related cost improvements. Adjusted operating income at Express declined 49% during the quarter on a decline in revenue. As Raj mentioned, we have more work to do at Express, and I'm confident that the structural redesign of our network and other drive initiatives once complete, will make us more resilient in future periods of demand weakness.\nNow turning to our fiscal year outlook. Based on our performance year-to-date and our current view of the rest of the year, we are reaffirming our outlook for adjusted EPS in the range of $17 to $18.50. At this midpoint of the range, we're now assuming a low single-digit percentage decline in revenue. This is lower than our previous assumption of flat revenue growth. Reformation of our earnings outlook despite the weaker demand environment reflects the continued benefits of our transformation. We'll continue to closely monitor the global demand environment and other key factors, including inventory risking, inflation and e-commerce trends, which informs our view of overall expected performance.\nWith regard to our third quarter expectations, as we've shared previously, we anticipate our typical seasonality, which implies a lighter quarter sequentially for earnings. We're also facing a higher comp at Ground given our exceptionally strong operating income performance during the third quarter year. At the enterprise level, we continue to expect year-over-year adjusted margin expansion in FY '24.\nAt the segment level, we continue to expect adjusted margin improvement in FY '24 Ground. We also continue to expect freight margin to remain strong in FY '24, but lower than FY '23, given volume reductions in yield -- we now anticipate a modest year-over-year adjusted margin contraction at Express.\nTurning to Slide 19. And consistent with previous quarters, we're providing a bridge to share how we're thinking about operating profit considerations embedded in our full year outlook.\nFor illustrative purposes, we continue to use adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion equivalent to the adjusted EPS midpoint of $17.75. As a reminder, and while our revenue performance will vary based on market trends, we are committed to delivering the $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from our Drive initiatives. Importantly, while this bridge remains the same as what we showed you in the first quarter, the composition of the second bar showing revenue net of cost increases has changed significantly. We now forecast materially lower revenue but expect to achieve the same net profit impact of $500 million at the midpoint as we proactively manage volume-related expenses and revenue quality in this difficult demand environment.\nNow moving to Slide 20. We remain focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet, prudent capital allocation, improved return on invested capital, all while providing increased shareholder returns. Our liquidity position remains strong, ending the quarter with $6.7 billion in cash. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.3 billion, bringing year-to-date CapEx to $2.6 billion. And we continue to expect to achieve our target of less than 6.5% CapEx to revenue for the year. As we previously stated, our capital expenditures will decline as we continue to reduce capital intensity by reducing facility and other capacity investment and continue to plan for lower annual aircraft CapEx. We still anticipate aircraft-related CapEx to decline to approximately $1 billion in fiscal year '26.\nConsistent with our capital return priority, we completed another $500 million accelerated share repurchase transaction in the quarter. This brings our total share repurchases for the first 6 months of the fiscal year to $1 billion and $2.5 billion over the last 18 months. Looking ahead, we expect to repurchase an additional $1 billion in common stock this fiscal year while also paying our dividend in line with our previously stated capital return plan.\nBefore we turn to Q&A, I just wanted to comment that now that I'm nearly 5 months into my new role as CFO, I'm even more excited about our strategy. Let's focus on execution and the opportunity ahead to create long-term value for all our stakeholders. I want to thank all our team members for their continued efforts and focus on our common goals.\nWith that, let's open it up for questions.",

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing the star key followed by zero. After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch tone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of Investor Relations, FedEx\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The Q1 earnings release, Form 10-Q, and Statbook are on our website at fedx.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about one year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media. During our Q&A session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the investor relations portion of our website at fedx.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO, Brie Carere, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer, and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Before I turn the call over to Raj, I wanted to let everyone know that I'm retiring from FedEx at the end of October. It has been a privilege being a longtime part of the FedEx team. I truly believe that FedEx's best days are ahead, but I will be cheering from the sidelines as I am 67 years old, and I want to spend more time with my family. With that, I will now turn it over to Raj for him to share his views on the quarter.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon. I would like to first congratulate Mickey on his upcoming retirement. He has led our investor relations team for nearly 18 years, spanning 70 earnings calls and, after tomorrow, 18 annual meetings. He will be missed by all, and especially this audience, and we thank him for his outstanding service to FedEx over the years. Let me also take this opportunity to welcome John Dietrich, our Chief Financial Officer for FedEx. With more than 30 years of experience in the aviation and air cargo industries, John brings a unique blend of financial and operational expertise to our leadership team at a very important time for this company. He's already hit the ground running, and I'm very happy that he has joined FedEx.\nSo now, turning to the quarter, we entered Fiscal Year 2024 with strength and momentum, delivering results ahead of expectations in what remains a dynamic environment. I'm proud of what the FedEx team has accomplished over the last 12 months. Amid significant demand disruption, we delivered on what we said we would do, driving over $2 billion in year-over-year cost savings in Fiscal 2023. We are now well advanced in executing on that transformation to be the most efficient, flexible, and intelligent global network. Our Q1 progress gives me great conviction in our ability to execute going forward. We came into the quarter determined to provide excellent service to our customers despite the industry dynamics. We achieved that goal while delivering innovative and data-driven solutions that further enhance the customer experience. As a result, we are well positioned as we prepare for the peak season.\nAs you can see in our results on slide six, our transformation is enhancing our profitability. Ground was a bright spot with higher revenue year-over-year driven by higher yield. On top of this growth, Ground drove exceptional operational performance, leading to its most profitable quarter ever on an adjusted basis. As expected, total revenue declined as volumes and yields were pressured at Express and Freight. We indicated last quarter that Express revenue would be adversely impacted by international export yield pressure, as well as a change in strategy by the US Postal Service, which we are addressing through DRIVE as we build a more nimble airline. For the total company, we delivered 200 basis points of adjusted margin improvement as we realized efficiencies across our networks. This performance is a testament to the power of DRIVE and the FedEx team working collaboratively to implement structural cost reductions throughout the enterprise.\nDuring the quarter, labor negotiations at our primary competitor and the bankruptcy of Yellow disrupted the market. Our priorities were clear: protect our customers, deliver outstanding service, and focus on high-quality revenue. We delivered on those priorities, leveraging our flexible network to profitably add volume while maintaining the highest levels of service. While we captured upside as a result of these one-time events, we were highly discerning in terms of the business we accepted, in keeping with our goal to drive high-quality revenue. Importantly, we expect to maintain the majority of the volume we added in the quarter. I want to thank our FedEx team for deftly navigating these conditions to execute on our disciplined strategy. Now, turning to DRIVE, we are fundamentally changing the way we work.\nDRIVE is taking cost out of our network, and we are on track to deliver our targeted $1.8 billion in structural benefits from DRIVE this fiscal year. At Ground, our DRIVE initiatives reduced costs by $130 million this quarter. These savings were primarily driven by lower third-party transportation rates as a result of a newly implemented purchase bid system, as well as optimized rail usage, the continued benefit from reduced Sunday coverage, and the consolidation of sorts. At Freight, we continue to manage our cost base more effectively. For example, during the quarter, Freight completed the planned closure of 29 terminal locations during August. And at Express, despite headwinds from Asia yields and the US Postal Service, we delivered on our plan. We're making our global network more efficient primarily through structural flight takedowns and efficiencies at our hubs and sorts as we right-size the capacity across the network.\nIn Europe, DRIVE initiatives are on track, and we expect them to gain further traction over the course of the year and into FY 2025. Looking ahead, we're excited to leverage John's aviation experience as we continue to transform our air network. Our DRIVE expectations for this year include the G&A savings we have previously outlined, which we believe will start to ramp in the second half of this fiscal year. Finally, on slide eight, I'll provide a brief update on our key strategic focus areas as we move into the next phase of our transformation. This includes OneFedEx, which is how we are better aligning our organization to enable Network 2.0. We are well underway with plans to simplify our organization. In June 2024, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Services will consolidate into one company, Federal Express Corporation.\nThe reorganization will reduce and optimize overhead, streamline our go-to-market capabilities, and improve the customer experience. To date, we have implemented or announced Network 2.0 in several markets, including Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada. As each market is different, we're continuously learning and tailoring the network to adapt to the operational characteristics unique to each region while delivering the highest quality service for our customers. We'll continue to use both employee couriers and service providers for pickup and delivery operations across the network. As with any significant transformation, these changes are being thoughtfully executed and will take time to complete. The network that FedEx has built over the last 50 years provides us a foundation that is unmatched. This physical network enables us to transport millions of packages a day around the world, generating terabytes of data that contain invaluable insights about the global supply chain.\nWe are focused on harnessing the power of this rich data to make supply chains smarter for everyone, for our customers, for our customers' customers, and for ourselves. As we move to the next phase of our transformation, I've given the team three specific challenges: to use data to make our network more efficient, make our customer experiences better, and drive new profitable revenue streams through digital. Looking ahead to the rest of FY 2024, we remain focused on delivering the highest quality service and aggressively managing what is within our control. Factoring in better-than-expected Q1 results, we are increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS outlook range. As we continue to deliver on our commitments, I'm confident we have the right strategy and the right team in place to create significant value. With that, let me turn the call over to Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q1, we remained focused on revenue quality and being a valued partner to our customers. We did this in an operating environment marked by continued but moderating volume pressure, mixed yield dynamics, and unique developments in the competitive landscape. Let's take each segment in turn. At FedEx Ground, Q1 revenue was up 3% year-over-year, driven by a 1% increase in volume and 3% increase in yield. Revenue at FedEx Express was down 9% year-over-year. Volume remained pressured, though total Express volume declines moderated sequentially. International export package volumes were up 3% year-over-year. Similar to Q4, parcel volume declines were most pronounced in the United States. Additionally, US freight pounds were down 27%, continuing the trend we mentioned last quarter tied to the change in strategy by the United States Postal Service.\nAcross Ground and Express, volumes improved sequentially, aided by the threat of a strike at our primary competitor. We onboarded new customers who valued our service and were committed to a long-term partnership with FedEx. As a result, we added approximately 400,000 in average daily volume by the end of Q1, and the team did an excellent job focusing on commercial ground business acquisition. At FedEx Freight, revenue was down 16%, driven by a 13% decline in volume. We experienced significant improvement in volume in August due to Yellow's closure. Freight benefited from approximately 5,000 incremental average daily shipments at attractive rates as we exited the quarter. As you can see on slide 11, monthly volumes have improved sequentially, with Ground and international export volumes inflecting positively on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue benefiting from this quarter's market share gains throughout the fiscal year.\nWe anticipate improved year-over-year growth rates, especially late in the fiscal year, albeit within a muted demand environment. The yield trends we shared last quarter persisted, particularly at FedEx Express, where we saw reduced fuel and demand surcharges year-over-year. Product mix shifts, including an increase in e-commerce volume, and demand for our international economy service after the May reopening in EMEA, also put pressure on yield growth. At FedEx Ground, we saw better-than-expected yields as a result of higher weight per package and product mix. At FedEx Freight, base rates were strong despite lower weights. The revenue per shipment year-over-year decline was due to lower fuel surcharges. Now, looking ahead to peak, we recently announced demand surcharges for the holiday shipping season to stay well-positioned relative to market. We also announced a 5.9% general rate increase effective this coming January.\nThis average annual increase, one point below last year's rate, reflects the current costs and market environment, along with the investment we need to serve customers effectively. We had a high capture rate for our GRI in FY 2023 and believe this year's increase will ensure that continues. We continue to find new revenue quality opportunities. In 2024, we will implement technology changes to increase our capture of package dimensions in several markets outside of the United States. Further, we are updating our dimensional pricing to market practice in Europe, moving from per shipment to a per piece strategy. Moving to slide 13, I was very pleased with our service levels around the world. I'm proud of how our team delivered here in the United States as we added volume late in the quarter. We are also building momentum in Europe. We improved service year-over-year in the region.\nAs a result, the Europe team was able to win back market share that we lost due to previous service challenges. There's still work to do, but our service improvements are also leading to better financial performance in Europe, with much more to come. As Raj stated, we have a vision to make supply chains smarter for everyone. I have a few examples of how our digital infrastructure is enabling new capabilities for our customers. We are improving the customer experience through technology with recent investment in Salesforce Data Cloud. We will integrate three customer platforms: customer service, marketing, and sales into one, giving the customer a more informed, efficient, and personalized experience when doing business with FedEx. We are now offering our estimated delivery time window, which provides customers with a four-hour window for their package delivery for 96% of inbound volume globally across 48 countries.\nThis growing capability is nicely complemented by Picture Proof of Delivery, or as we like to say, PPOD, which has expanded across Europe in the Q1. Now available in 53 markets, PPOD provides shippers with increased confidence in package delivery and helps reduce the volume of customer calls and claims. OneFedEx and Network 2.0 will simplify how we do business, which is particularly important for our small and medium customers. For example, our current customer contracts reflect three independent companies. OneFedEx will enable us to change that, making doing business with FedEx and becoming a new customer easier. Network 2.0 will be more efficient for FedEx, but also more efficient for our customers. When we integrate a market with one truck in one neighborhood, that's not just for deliveries. It also means a streamlined pickup experience: one pickup per day versus two.\nThis is a simple but very impactful change, and customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Small and medium businesses are a high-value growth segment, and we are confident that the improvements underway will further enable share gains. Lastly, we've expanded MyFedEx Rewards beyond the United States into nearly 30 other countries, with nine more European countries to launch later this year. MyFedEx Rewards is the only loyalty program in the industry and benefits our customers by providing them with rewards they can invest back into their business. They can use them to recognize their employees for a job well done or give back to their communities. MyFedEx Rewards has been a successful program in the United States, and we've built lasting relationships as we continue to invest in our customers. We are excited about the potential to replicate this success in Europe and around the world.\nStriving to anticipate customers' needs and provide them with superior service is deeply embedded in our FedEx culture. I'm proud of how our teams work together to support our current customers, build relationships with new ones, and ensure that FedEx was positioned to succeed during the quarter. Now, I will turn it over to John to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm really excited to be here. It's been a full sprint these last few weeks as I continue to get up to speed with this great company. As some of you may know, I've done business with FedEx throughout my career. Through that experience, I've always admired how FedEx literally created a new industry and has built a differentiated network that serves customers all over the world. I've also admired its great culture that has thrived through the People, Service, Profit, or PSP philosophy. After only being here a few short weeks, I've seen the incredible opportunity we have before us. Not only will we continue to provide our customers with the best service and product offerings, but our plans to bring our businesses together through OneFedEx and execute on DRIVE and Network 2.0 initiatives will be truly transformative.\nThese initiatives will leverage and optimize everything that the talented teams across FedEx have built over the last 50 years. It will make us smarter, it will make us more efficient, and it will enable us to serve our customers better. Before getting into the numbers, I want to share a brief overview of the priorities that will guide me and the finance organization as we move forward. First and foremost, I'm committed to setting stringent financial goals that reflect the significant opportunity we have to improve margins and returns. This will be enabled by the Drive initiatives and the integration of Network 2.0 as we move towards OneFedEx. I've been really impressed by the tremendous amount of work already completed on DRIVE from the initiatives in place, the accountability embedded in the program, and the team's steadfast focus on execution.\nIn terms of our capital priorities, I'll focus on maintaining a healthy balance sheet, returning cash to shareholders, and reinvesting in the business with a focus on the highest returns. Our finance organization will partner closely with Raj and the leadership team to ensure we deliver consistent progress towards these priorities with the goal of delivering significant value for our employees, partners, customers, and shareholders in the years to come. Finally, a guiding principle for me will be to have open and transparent communication with all key stakeholders, including all of you in the financial community. I already know some of you from my prior roles. I look forward to continuing to work together and engaging with the rest of you in the weeks and months ahead.\nNow, taking a closer look at our results, our Fiscal Year 2024 is off to an outstanding start, as demonstrated by the strong operational execution in Q1. At FedEx Ground, DRIVE initiatives are taking hold, and we delivered the most profitable quarter in our history for that segment on an adjusted basis. Adjusted operating income at Ground was up 61%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 480 basis points to 13.3%. These strong results were driven by yield improvement and cost reductions, including lower linehaul expense and improved first and last-mile productivity. As a result, cost per package was down more than 2%. At FedEx Express, the business was able to improve operating income despite a decline in revenue. This further demonstrates that DRIVE is working. Adjusted operating income at Express was up 14%, and adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 2.1%.\nCost reductions and transformation efforts at FedEx Express included structural flight reductions, alignment of staffing with volume levels, parking aircraft, and shifting to one delivery wave per day in the US, all of which more than offsets the impact of lower revenue. It's important to note that expanding operating margins and reducing costs at Express will be a key focus for me and the team. At FedEx Freight, the team diligently managed costs and revenue quality amid a dynamic volume environment. Operating margin declined 290 basis points based on lower fuel surcharges and shipments, but remained strong at 21%. Now, turning to our fiscal year outlook on slide 17. As we've been discussing, we're beginning to see the benefits of our DRIVE initiatives and our focus on improved revenue quality.\nBased on our solid first quarter performance and our view of the rest of the year, we're raising the low end of our full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook by $0.50. We're now expecting adjusted EPS in the range of $17 to 18.50. We're confident we can deliver on this higher earnings outlook despite the constrained demand environment. We're now assuming revenue to be relatively flat at the midpoint of our Fiscal Year 2024 adjusted EPS outlook range. Of course, an improvement in demand would translate into greater operating leverage and earnings upside, supporting the high end of our range. We'll be closely monitoring the demand environment going forward, including economic activity in North America, Europe, and Trans-Pacific trade. We'll also be keeping a close watch on other key factors that impact the demand environment, including inventory restocking, inflation, and e-commerce trends.\nTurning to slide 18, and consistent with last quarter, we want to share how we're thinking about the operating profit considerations embedded in our full-year outlook. For illustration purposes, we used adjusted operating profit of $6.3 billion, which is the equivalent of the adjusted EPS midpoint of $17.75. Within this outlook, we're highlighting a few key assumptions. Revenue net of cost increases is now expected to be up $500 million due to improved revenue quality and flow-through at Ground. We continue to expect approximately $800 million of international export yield pressure as demand surcharges significantly diminish and service mix continues shifting towards deferred offerings. As a result of our strong first quarter performance, we're also planning for a $600 million increase in variable compensation.\nThese headwinds are more than offset by the $1.8 billion in structural cost savings from our DRIVE initiatives, which we shared with you last quarter and are on track to achieve. Moving on to slide 19. We remain steadfast in our commitment to prudent capital allocation and shareholder returns. Our liquidity position remains strong, and we ended the quarter with $7.1 billion in cash. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $1.3 billion, and we continue to expect to achieve our target of less than 6.5% CapEx to revenue for the year. Our capital expenditures at Ground will decline as we reduce capacity investment, and we're planning for lower annual aircraft CapEx over time, which we expect to be approximately $1 billion in fiscal year 2026. As we've previously communicated, we're standing behind our commitment to capital discipline by tying executive compensation to ROIC.\nGiven improved earnings, we're generating significant and improved cash flow. This is supporting our ability to enhance shareholder returns, demonstrated by the completion of our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion in common stock this fiscal year, while we're also paying our dividend. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question at this time. We will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Thank you. The first question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie, if I can ask you a question, you've had a major competitor that's really been very disciplined on price over the last few years, but now, after some of the disruptions that you mentioned in your prepared remarks, it seems like they may be more aggressive on price to win back volume. How does that change the way you think about strategy, both as it relates to share and pricing, not just for this year, but kind of for the two- to three-year time period?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Jon. Thanks for the question. So a couple of things that I would like to comment on. I think the first and foremost is the pricing market has been very rational for the last several years. I think it's also important to remember that we are the price leader in every market segment in the domestic market. We actually lead on price, and that's because we have the better value proposition. We've got seven days a week, so we've got Picture POD, and we've got the faster network. So as I think about responding to the current competitive pressure, my job is to make it very difficult for our primary competitor to win back that share. The team has done an outstanding job of onboarding the business that we won in the last quarter, and we had some time to prepare for it.\nSo the executive team has been out. We've met with a lot of these new customers. They're happy. Service is good. And that's really what I'm focused on right now, is delivering just awesome service. And so they want to stay with FedEx because they're the better provider.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThanks, Brie.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you. And first, John, congrats to you on your new role with FedEx, and Mickey, congratulations on your great career. So I guess I would like to maybe dig into the revenue guidance for a moment in terms of what's changing there. It feels like the macro assumptions are perhaps a bit weaker, but we have some competitive dynamics both in Freight and at Ground that are helping. Could you maybe kind of help us understand a little bit, Brie, in terms of what's changing to your macro outlook? And it seems like you're a bit more conservative there.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, absolutely. Fair question. So as I just mentioned, we really did feel good about how we executed within the quarter, but the macro did not help. As we're thinking about the domestic market specifically from a parcel perspective, if you look at calendar year 2023, total volume for the whole year will be down about 0.5% for the total year. That's a little bit lower than we anticipated the full year. So we have adjusted. Like I said, the market's not helping, so we really have to work hard to kind of grow the yield, and the team's doing a great job. When we get to international, again, the team executed. They took share in Europe, but when I look at the macro, a couple of things. Trade is growing at a 1.7%. That's down versus 2.2% the previous year.\nAs we look at inventories, they're in a pretty good place in that from a retailer's perspective, I think the retailers have done a good job. They're not carrying a lot of extra inventory. Wholesalers are, but the net takeaway is that inventory restocking is not going to help us. And then if you look at capacity, from a PACS perspective, Transatlantic PACS capacity is back. And while it's not that coming out of Asia, total capacity is back to pre-COVID levels. So we don't see inventories helping. We don't see trade giving as a huge boost, and so we're going to work really hard to execute. That being said, I think it's really important to note that this revised sort of demand outlook is already reflected in the range. And so despite the fact that the macro is a little bit softer, we raised the midpoint. So really good.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Jack, let me just add on to the last point that Brie just mentioned. That's really important as we, even despite the fact that we have lower revenue expectations, we actually raised the bottom line. This is the sign of our DRIVE execution working. Last time on the call, I gave you all a simple formula of one, two, three. 1% revenue growth at the bottom of the range and 3% at the top of the range. Well, I can now say it's minus 1, 0, 1. It's not quite as catchy as one, two, three, but in fact, it's better performance. Thank you for the question, Jack.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nAnalyst, Stephens\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. Congratulations on the good results, particularly in Ground, a very impressive margin performance. I wanted to ask you about how we think about that Ground margin going forward and what happens if the volume side is a little bit softer. We would think that some volume probably came over from diversion, maybe from UPS. Kind of how much was that a factor in driving this Ground margin performance? If you lose a little momentum on volume, should we still expect a lot of momentum on that Ground margin? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. Hi, Tom. This is John. Thanks for that question. Yeah, look, we've demonstrated substantial improvement in year-over-year margins in Q1, and we anticipate continued improvement in Q2 on a year-over-year basis. Also, we're focusing on revenue quality, which resulted in solid yields in Q1, up 6% year-over-year, excluding fuel surcharges, which also helped boost margins. I think the team's doing a great job identifying those opportunities with the best revenue quality, and we'll continue to do so. And as Brie mentioned, we got this business and we want to keep it. So thanks for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP of Equity Research, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\n\nYeah, hi. Thanks. Just curious, can you talk a little bit more about DRIVE? You sort of talked about some of the things that you've worked on this quarter, but can you maybe tease up what we could expect upcoming quarters or two, whether it be cost saves, aggregate cost saves expected in Q2, and maybe some of the targeted areas in Ground and Express from here, what we could look forward to? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Jordan. Let me start off, and then I will turn it to John for additional color here. I am just delighted with the way we are executing against Drive. It's not any one thing, and there's a series of initiatives. It's changing the way we are working inside this company with a lot of rigor, a lot of accountability, and a lot of measurement. In fact, last week, we had an internal DRIVE meeting with all the stakeholders.\nI have not seen a much energetic conversation and with real numbers. So that's one of the, if you look at Q1, obviously, we got some benefit from the competitive activity, but the bigger issue is really the execution of DRIVE, which we expect to continue to perform as we go forward. So momentum that we have in Q1 gives me a lot of confidence. So let me give it to John to give some more color on that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Raj. I echo everything that you said. As I said in my remarks, one of the things I'm most impressed with is the rigor around this program, the accountability, and the project plans. It's really extraordinary to see that come together such that we're really confident in our reaching our goal of the $1.8 billion for the year. To Raj's point, it's coming from everywhere in the organization. One of the examples we used was the example of Ground. I think it was the $130 million we referenced. The reason I referenced that, not only because of the significant savings, because it also adopted some technology tools, which helped us, and our bidding system, which allowed us to capture more revenue on a more efficient basis with bidding systems. So it's a combination of everything: operational execution, leveraging technology, and going after the market. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. I'm in a car. Hopefully, you can hear me okay. John, any color on how much of the $1 billion in DRIVE you've gotten so far? And then I know you said Ground margins would continue to improve year-over-year in Q2. Any thoughts on sequential margins of Ground and just across the rest of the business for Q2? Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. And good to talk to you again. Yeah, with regard to DRIVE, we're at $1.8 billion. We expect it to be reasonably spread out fairly evenly through the year. We had an exceptional Q1. We're expecting that to continue to ratchet up in Q2, maybe a slightly heavily loaded in the back half of the year as some of these programs get their traction and start to show the results through the year. So again, I'm not going to sit here and say there's any dramatic changes for any one quarter. It's fairly evenly spread.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Citigroup\n\nHey, thanks. Good afternoon. Hey, John, just to follow up on that, I guess, can you outline what the savings were realized from DRIVE in the other segments, Freight and Express? I know you outlined the Ground, the $130 million there. That would be helpful. And I just wanted to sort of think about the guidance a little bit bigger picture. So it sounds like you want to hold on to or expect to hold on to a big piece of the 400,000 packages per day that you captured from a competitive standpoint. But can you walk us through the puts and takes of the guidance of what you're adding in at Yellow and maybe UPS into that, and then maybe some of the macro there to help kind of bridge from where you were before to kind of move in that midpoint up a little bit?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. With regard to DRIVE first, it really is coming from every aspect of the organization. We highlighted Ground, but for some of the flight restructurings, for example, I think Express is doing a nice job there as well, taking down aircraft as well as revised flight schedules. And that will be a continued focus for me. I'm not going to be listing by group exactly specifically on the savings, but in the aggregate, what I will say is we're committed to achieving and will achieve that $1.8 billion for the year. With regard to the guidance, look, we took a thoughtful approach on guidance. It was a strong quarter. We recognize that, and we're delighted to have been able to raise our guidance for the full year.\nNot only does that reflect strong execution for the quarter, but really a focus on those things that we can control amid a soft market. Things are playing out largely as we expected, and there are going to be puts and takes. Yes, we enjoyed some upside from UPS and Yellow, but as Brie mentioned, it was a soft market. There were some offsets there, and yield pressure in the soft market. Also embedded in our outlook is $600 million in incremental variable compensation through the balance of the year. That's $100 million more than our prior estimate. But at the end of the day, we're really pleased to have increased the lower end of the range, even when we're seeing this uncertainty, and we will keep you posted as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n\nHey, thanks. Good evening. I just wanted to ask about another angle of the Teamsters contract negotiation. Obviously, we've seen a lot of these union contracts get reset higher. This one reset the bar for comfort benefits and logistics, and I think it came in even higher than you guys expected. So do you think there's a catch-up across the board from a cost perspective as you look across your various segments as they now deal with what was reset and the reality in the market? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thank you, Brian. As you all know, or maybe recall that in FY22, we increased compensation annually by about $1 billion. I mean, we were dealing with market conditions in real time, and we knew that our competition would see a step change. It's exactly what happened. And also, we have two pickup and delivery models in the market. And while we have taken a majority of the increase, we will continue to invest in our people. That's a given, and our outlook reflects that.\nIn fact, coming up in October, we have our annual merit increases, which are a regular and important component of our overall compensation structure. It's also important to remember that beyond compensation, working at FedEx offers our team members a great overall value proposition, a collaborative culture, and offers great career opportunities, among other things. So it's a very important for all of us, an issue for all of us, and we are staying right on top of it, and we appreciate your question. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good evening. Raj, you mentioned peak season, the upcoming peak season in your opening remarks. Just given sort of the dynamic environment, your approach to disciplined revenue quality and such, has your approach to this peak season changed at all? Just any colors there?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question, Allison. The peak season, I would say, is that there is really no difference in our approach other than to say our service is really strong. There's not what we expect normal seasonality versus the volumes we are seeing today, and probably year-over-year comparable to where we were last year. The networks are running very well, and the team is ready to support our customers during this most important season. Brie, I don't know if you want to add any more to it than I just said.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nNo, Raj, I think you covered it. We feel good about peak, and from a pricing strategy perspective, we're committed to our strategy, which does include peak surcharges. We think that's really important. We need to invest in the network. This is a really important time of year for us, but it's also a really important time for our customers. And so having that surcharge there allows us to flex the network, deliver great service, and then we'll wind it down in January, but we see no major change in strategy this week.\n\nAllison Poliniak\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKenneth Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America Corporation\n\nHey, great. Good evening. Mickey, best of luck in retirement. It's been a great 18-year run, and John, welcome. Look forward to working with you. Just overall, great job and results, and particularly at Ground. But at 2% margins at Express, any reason we're not seeing maybe more leverage at Express given the moves you've made with parked aircraft and the structural change you talk about? Maybe walk through some of the timing on the gains at Express in particular.\nAnd I guess to wrap it up, given the beat of $0.80 in the quarter versus the street, yet you're raising the bottom target by $0.50. Is that, are there softening gains the rest of the year on some of the margins? I know you talked about the $600 million in cost, but you had prior talked about $500 million. I'm just wondering if there's maybe some slimmer margins that you're looking at in other areas. Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, again, let me start off, and John, can I add to what I say here? I think it's important to remember for Express some of the key headwinds that we're facing in this quarter. Firstly, the demands or charges declined substantially year-over-year. We also opened up the international economy, and the reopening of the international economy resulted in yields decline. As you had mentioned in the talk track earlier, that the volumes from USPS also declined as part of their strategy. That's number three. And then at the same time, we also have market-driven headwinds from fuel prices. So net-net of all that, there was a revenue decline of $1.1 billion. In addition to that, the variable compensation increase for Express was also there. Despite all that, we increased our earnings and improved profits, and this is actually DRIVE working.\nAnd as we start to lap these headwinds, DRIVE progress will become even more visible in the numbers. And again, we think there's a tremendous opportunity, and the teams are working hard to capture that. I'll just make a quick comment on the forecast, and then I'll turn it over to John. The demand environment remains uncertain, and we are being prudent in our financial projections given the environment. And once again, our ability to drive better results even in a lower demand environment is what's really encouraging to me. Now, the environment changes, and we are more positive. Obviously, there's significant leverage on that. So John, if you want to add anything to it?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nNo, Raj, I think you've really captured it. All the significant headwinds that Express faced, yet they were able to turn a profit, and a year-over-year improvement is exceptional. But that said, we're going to be focusing on those margins. We're going to be focusing on continuous improvement. We're going to be focusing on the DRIVE initiatives to keep improving those margins. And on the guidance, yeah, I think, Raj, you covered it. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks, operator. Hi everyone. Congrats on the quarter. John, I guess I'm wondering on the Ground performance. Obviously, it's incredibly strong. I'm just wondering if you would, is there anything to ring-fence there that you would consider kind of one-time due to the volume diversion opportunity? I'm just looking at that plus four in August and wondering, is there any cadence shift throughout the month and some of that volume went back? And I guess just clarifying on Express, I think it sounds like there was a $150 million step-up sequentially in Express related to the incentive comp. Can you just confirm that? I can get it from the 10-Q, but I was just wondering that maybe that may explain why the decremental sequentially were so high, and I guess that moderates as we go on because that's now in the cost structure. If you can just clarify that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nI think what I said was $100 million incremental to our last report from the last time we reported on it. So that piece of it. With regard to Ground, look, as I mentioned just a short while ago, we think the improvement is going to continue on a year-over-year basis in terms of ring-fencing anything as Brie talked about. We're going to be looking to keep that incremental business and, in fact, have terms that require we are very discerning on the customers we took on and have agreements in place with those customers. And on the Freight side as well with Yellow, that capacity, at least for now, has come out of the market, and Freight is going to be taking advantage of those additional volumes.\nBut I mean, just getting back to Ground for a moment, we're expecting continued year-over-year improvement and no ring-fence to identify. With regard to Express, we're going to be focusing on the margin expansion. I'm not exactly sure on your question from a perspective otherwise, but we're going to be focused on that margin expansion and continuing to grow and leverage the opportunities we have at Express.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThis spring, your primary competitor talked about potentially launching some dynamic pricing products in the parcel space, which we haven't seen a lot of from the larger carriers before. Can you talk a little bit about where and if FedEx uses dynamic pricing in its US domestic products at this point, and has that evolved in the competitive landscape as a tool for market share and network efficiencies? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure. Great question. We're actually really pleased with the progress that we're making. Our pricing team, along with DataWorks, are building a great platform to be able to price more dynamically. Where we are currently using this capability now is we have made our peak surcharges around the world more dynamic. We have a great spot pricing capability that we're using in our air freight products that we are using to kind of match capacity to the market, as well as we're starting to use that domestically in some backhaul lanes. We've got a long roadmap of things that we're going to bring to market that we're very excited about to drive revenue quality. But I have to admit, I really don't want to share much more than what's already visible in market because I certainly don't want to provide any competitive intelligence that I don't need to.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nSenior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good evening, and thanks for making the time. Mickey, congratulations, John. Welcome to the circus. Quick question for you on the cost per piece in the Ground segment. The $10.30 sort of sequentially is a big surprise. How should we feel about that number in absolute terms as we look at the rest of the year? Should we be kind of running at that $10.25 to 10.35 range? Are there additional things that are going to be popping in and out of that on a cost per piece basis? I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of where we should be expecting the cost structure for the full year. If you could talk a little bit more about the DRIVERS in this quarter, you mentioned line haul.\nI'm just wondering if you renegotiated a bunch of line haul rates in a down truck market, that kind of thing, which should be sticky for the rest of the year. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSo I'll take that in reverse order on the measures taking. Yeah, it's across the board with DRIVE, line haul, and all the things we mentioned in our prepared remarks. With regard to the rate environment, we're expecting it to remain consistent. So that's factored into our forecast, but we will continue to update as time goes on. Again, line haul, dock productivity, higher wage and settlement rates that we're focused on, as Raj touched on. Just across the board, focused on productivity. That's true at Ground, and that's going to be true at Express and with Freight as well. I mentioned first and last mile in my remarks.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglensky with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nEric Morgan\n\nAnalyst, Barclays\n\nHi, good evening. This is Eric Morgan for Brandon. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats to Mickey, and welcome to John. I wanted to ask on Network 2.0, Raj. You mentioned you're continually learning and tailoring the network as you go through this process. So can you give us some color on what has gone right and wrong so far with co-locating the Express and Ground terminals and on the employee service provider decisions? I know it's market by market, but maybe could you give us some insight into what variables you're considering when making those decisions? Just trying to better understand the strategy there and how confident you are in execution.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you for the question. Things have been going quite well as we feel we are on track to complete our network through our commitment of fiscal year 2027. As you know, we have announced and/or implemented optimization changes in Alaska, Hawaii, Canada, as well as several other locations in the lower 48. We are definitely learning a lot in this process. I mean, we have technology, we have facilities, we have people, and our principle is pretty straightforward.\nIt's going to be data-driven, and it's going to follow the PSP philosophy. Again, it's important to note that we'll continue to use both the courier and the service provider model for pickup and delivery operations tailored to the characteristics of each market. So so far, so good. Again, we're putting all this in place as we move forward. Post-peak, we'll announce the next wave of rollout of network throughout.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Helene Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Head Advisor, TD Cowen",
    "content2": "Thanks very much, operator. Mickey, congratulations. John, welcome on board. And thanks for the time, team. So my number one question is, the UAW is doing these targeted strikes, and I know automotive and automotive parts is a big part of your vertical, one of your big verticals. I'm kind of wondering how you're thinking about that, the impact in the current quarter, how you're thinking about mitigating any impact, and so on, if you can help out there. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Helene. Yes, it's a fair question. We do have a healthy business in automotive here in the United States and around the world, but we're also highly diversified. We have looked at our initial numbers, and we have accounted for in our current demand forecast for some fluctuations in automotive. We do anticipate that there will be, in certain locations, some rolling strikes, and so we have accounted for that within the current demand outlook. Right now, we believe that both FedEx and the entire economy would benefit, obviously, from a fast resolution, but we've accounted for it.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone. Mickey, John, congrats to you both. If I could maybe go back to something that you talked about, Brie, FedEx having a superior value prop with regard to service and speed. Does Network 2.0 make FedEx even faster? And if so, do you think that opens more yield capture opportunity that maybe goes beyond some of the guidance that you've given around the initiative?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSo from a Network 2.0 perspective, I'm actually really excited about this from a FedEx service perspective. The piece that I mentioned in my opening remarks is pickup, and I just wouldn't underestimate this. We have long known that this was an opportunity. When Raj talked about some of the early learnings in the US market, we knew it was an opportunity, but the enthusiasm from customers on how much easier it is to manage as we collapse and make not just the pickup experience, the physical pickup one, but we also will rationalize our pricing there. We will automate pickups in a more streamlined fashion.\nSo it's a better customer experience. To date, we have not yet found opportunities to speed up the network from a Network 2.0 perspective, but we continue to iterate. What we have found is it's a lot easier to respond and adapt in the network as we bring them together. And so that has also been something that customers have asked for, especially in the B2B space in healthcare. So we are learning a lot, but the net takeaway is customers are actually very supportive and excited about Network 2.0.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nRavi Shanker\n\nManaging Director, Morgan Stanley\n\nThank you, everyone. Mickey, good luck again, and thanks for the help over the years. Brie, just one quick follow-up for you. You said that pricing traction was good so far, and you're converting a pretty decent amount of the base rate increase. What percentage of that? I think historically it's been closer to 50%. Kind of what rate are you converting right now? And also, you said that the pricing environment remains pretty rational, but you saw the USPS basically say they're not going to have any pricing surcharges in the USPS. So the UPS changes were noted on the call. I think Amazon is launching some competitive services as well. Do you think 2024 could be a tougher environment pricing-wise across the industry?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay, that was a lot, but I think I got it, Ravi. Jump in here if I don't get it all. So from a GRI perspective, if we go back to last January, the answer is the vast majority of our customers pay the full GRI. That is excluding the large customers where we've already pre-negotiated, but the customers that are on our service guide terms, we get a very high capture rate. And so we anticipate that we will see the same thing this coming January. From a peak surcharge perspective, I think it's really important to understand that we structure our peak surcharge to really target volume that will surge and drive the network to flex. So the vast majority of our customers actually do not pay a peak surcharge because their volume just doesn't flex up enough to qualify for the peak surcharge.\nSo when we look from a competitive environment, I actually don't think the USPS's peak surcharge is particularly relevant in what we're doing. So I'm not worried about that and actually continue to feel good. And we've also pre-negotiated peak surcharges with the vast majority of those customers that pay them. So I feel good heading into peak. And then when you think about Amazon or ship with Amazon, I think it's really important to remember we spent the last 50 years building the best transportation network in the world. We get up every day thinking about nothing other than making our supply chain better for our customers. And the market and customers, I think, really value the fact that when they win, we win, and they don't have to worry about a provider who's going to compete with them.\nI do think that we take competition very seriously, and I'm focused on continuing to provide an even better value proposition. We've got some things planned for 2024 that I'm really excited about sharing with you in a couple of months. I feel good. Thanks, Ravi, for the question.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSVP of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you for the question. I appreciate the color that you gave on the Freight segment and kind of what you're seeing in August. Given just the major disruption in the market, could you talk a little bit about how some of those diverted volumes, just the mixed quality fits with FedEx's current Freight mix would be helpful just for context? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure. Happy to answer that question. So when we talk about the volume that came on, I think it's important to split it. Actually, if you look at it, about half of it came directly from Yellow customers. So give or take about 2,500 pieces a day. And the reason being is that Yellow had a lot of low-quality revenue. And so there was some revenue there and some customers that really didn't want to pay for the value of the FedEx Freight speed and the quality that we provide.\nWhat happened, however, was some competitors took on more Yellow volume, and their service was not what it needed to be. And so as a result, we went and got an additional 2,500 pieces from the market. Net takeaway is the margin of the 5,000 was very healthy. The sales team was incredibly disciplined, and both Lance and I are very, very pleased with that volume. The network is running really well, and I am confident that we will keep the majority of that, and that's what we have planned to do.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question today will come from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeffrey Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much for squeezing me in. Congratulations, John. And Mickey, it's been great working with you all these years, so thank you. John, question for you, and I just wanted to go back and clarify kind of what Ken Hoexter was asking on the guidance. The adjusted earnings went up, I guess, about $0.25 at the midpoint, and you highlighted the reasons why, but it looked like the unadjusted earnings went down about $0.15 at the midpoint. You took the high end of the range down to $16.60 and the low end up a little bit. And I just want to understand, you talked about the $100 million of incremental incentive comp. You talked about some of the continued yield pressure.\nYou talked about some of the negatives, and then I saw that it looked like you also extended the adjustment range for the business optimization costs up from about $500 to 620 million. So is that the net that explains the difference between the $0.15 reduction in the unadjusted guidance and the $0.25 increase in the adjusted guidance at the midpoint?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYes, Jeff, that's correct. You have that right.\n\nJeffrey Kauffman\n\nPartner, Vertical Research Partners\n\nOkay, that's my question. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks. Please go ahead, sir.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you very much, operator. Let me say that, in closing, how proud I'm of our team for delivering such a strong start for the year. Our execution of the structural cost reductions remained on track, and as we prepare for peak, we will continue to make every FedEx experience outstanding for our customers. We've proven that DRIVE is changing the way we work, and we're enabling continued transformation across FedEx as we build the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. Thank you for your attention today. I will see you next time.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

Now over to Raj.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Before I start my remarks, I first want to acknowledge the upcoming retirement of Mike and his terrific contributions and accomplishments at FedEx over the last 18 years. Mike was named CFO in March 2020, and I'm grateful for his leadership over the three years since then as we navigated a global pandemic and significant change. Due to his tireless work, FedEx is on solid footing as we execute the next phase of our strategy. Above all, Mike has been a good friend and a colleague of mine, and I wish him all the very best. Now, let me turn to my remarks for the quarter.\nThanks to the hard work of the FedEx team, we have demonstrated continued progress on our journey to transform into the world's most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network. In Q4, we introduced and began preparing for One FedEx. At the same time, we continued to bend the cost curve through our Drive initiatives. This supported our fiscal year 2023 earnings, which came in above the midpoint of our March outlook despite continued soft demand and an unplanned year-end tax expense, which negatively impacted our earnings by $0.18 for the quarter. Our operating performance remains solid. We are entering fiscal 2024 with a continued focus on areas within our control and a commitment to execute swiftly on our priorities.\nThis focus will support sustained profit improvement in FY24 through an environment that we expect to remain marked by demand challenges, particularly in the first half. Turning to slide six, I will start with a snapshot of the quarter. Total revenue in the Q4 was down 10% year over year as volumes declined, with demand remaining soft across the market. With this said, the rate of volume decline in Ground and Express improved sequentially. As expected, yield trends have been pressured in international markets where the supply-demand balances have changed.\nWe continue to maintain our focus on revenue quality and are committed to a disciplined pricing approach focused on the long-term. While we expect these pressures to persist, we do expect moderation throughout the fiscal year. With our execution on a number of cost actions, we delivered adjusted operating profit of $1.8 billion. Our Q4 performance enabled us to close out the year with an adjusted operating margin of 6% and adjusted earnings per share of $14.96. While our revenue declines were in line with the industry, I'm pleased to note that our flow-through performance continues to improve, and we believe it is the best in the industry in the Q1 of the calendar year.\nBeyond the headline numbers, our results this quarter embed continued progress on our transformation. I'm pleased to see our cost-out efforts take hold, but I'm also equally excited about the operational improvements we are driving as we build the smartest logistics network in the world. For example, our market-leading Picture Proof of Delivery is now available to 90% of global residential deliveries, having launched in Europe earlier this month. Picture Proof of Delivery gives our customers visibility to their delivered shipments at the click of a button, and it has led to a 14% reduction in disputed delivery cases and contributed to a 17% reduction in call volume in the United States. Our four-hour estimated delivery time window, which we have rolled out to 47 countries, is also improving the customer experience.\nAt Ground, our dock modernization efforts are enhancing productivity, helping us run our docks smarter with new technology and key data insights. This includes a new network operating plan that uses machine learning to develop more detailed and accurate volume forecasts. Ground remained a standout in this quarter as the team delivered operating income of over $1 billion. For the first time in company history, the Ground team expanded margins despite lower volumes in the second half. This is a clear indication our Drive transformation is working and gives us confidence as we push forward. Amid continued volume pressure, cost per package this quarter increased only 1.9%. This was supported by a total reduction in operating expenses of $350 million as the company continued to manage staffing levels effectively, benefited from stock closures and consolidations, and reduced Sunday operations.\nThese actions helped bring Ground's Q4 operating margin to 12.1%. At Express, we have made significant progress aligning costs with underlying demand. Our initiatives continue to ramp, and we expect accelerating benefits in the upcoming fiscal year. Demand dynamics combined with yield pressure drove a 13% decline in revenue at Express. This performance was generally in line with our expectations coming into the quarter. In the face of these headwinds, the Express team was able to accelerate cost and productivity efforts driven by a combination of structural and volume-related initiatives. The Express team reduced total flight hours by 12% year over year and permanently retired 18 aircraft, including 12 MD-11s this quarter.\nThe team is also planning to take another 29 aircraft out of scheduled flying in fiscal 2024. In addition, we made excellent progress implementing structural cost savings initiatives beyond flights, including certain domestic efficiency initiatives. This includes the shift to a single daily dispatch of couriers, which achieved its target of $50 million in Q4 savings, as well as accelerated hub productivity measures. In Europe, we continue to improve operational execution across the region. Notably, we announced the official opening of two of our hubs this quarter. In April, we reopened our international road hub in Duiven, Netherlands, and this month we opened our new state-of-the-art road hub in Novara, Italy.\nThese two facilities have enhanced our capabilities, enabled more efficient routing, and improved our service on the continent. In aggregate, total operating expenses at Express were down $1.1 billion in the quarter. The magnitude of the operating margin decline has continued to narrow sequentially as our initiatives take hold. At freight, the team is focused on maintaining pricing discipline while flexing costs to protect profitability. The freight team was able to reduce operating expenses by over $330 million in the Q4. This will be further supported by our announced plan to close and consolidate 29 locations, which will be completed by August. Consolidation will improve service levels while lowering our cost to serve.\nFurther, we have conducted another round of furloughs to match staffing with volume levels and are limiting hiring of salaried employees. Turning to slide seven, we continue to make significant progress in taking cost out of our network, delivering a $2 billion year-over-year reduction in operating costs in the Q4 of FY23. This included more effectively matching flying with demand, marking the Q1 of this year where our flight hours declined more than the underlying volumes. Additionally, we continue to aggressively manage headcount, including attrition, to align our teams with the network changes underway. We exceeded our target with US headcount down by about 29,000 in FY23. Also included in these cost reductions are ramping benefits from the numerous initiatives we have identified across the 14 Drive domains.\nGiven our progress, we are confident that we can deliver on our previous goal for about $1.8 billion in cost reduction benefits from Drive this fiscal year and $4 billion of permanent cost reductions in fiscal year 2025. As we introduced in April, between now and June of 2024, we will be consolidating our operating companies into one unified organization. One FedEx is the next step of this journey to realize our full value potential. It aligns our organization to one corporate structure that will facilitate the execution of our Drive transformation and will further enable the work that's underway in Network 2.0. Our work toward this goal is already taking shape. We have taken a significant step forward in the implementation of Network 2.0 with today's announcement of the transformation of our Canadian operations.\nIn April of 2024, we will begin to transition all FedEx Ground operations and personnel in Canada to FedEx Express, creating a truly integrated and unified Canadian network. This unification is enabled by the nature of the Canadian market, where the population is heavily concentrated in a few key geographies currently serviced by both OPCOs. Consolidation will create significant efficiencies throughout the business from first to last mile and across our support teams. We expect this change in Canada to generate an annualized benefit of over $100 million upon completion in FY25. We have announced transitions in 20 markets, and Canada marks the first large-scale implementation of Network 2.0, which builds on the learnings from our completed transitions in other geographies.\nTo be clear, we're not taking a one-size-fits-all approach to our Network 2.0 strategy. Success depends on a mix of models, including employees and contracting with service providers, as all are important pieces of how FedEx moves packages. Looking ahead to FY24, we're entering the year with a clear focus on what is within our control in an underlying environment that remains dynamic across geographies. This backdrop is likely to pressure revenue growth, particularly in the near term. As a result, we're taking a prudent approach to our full-year outlook that builds upon our solid finish to FY23. We'll also make progress on reducing capital intensity by continuing to focus on the highest return opportunities in an efficient manner. After FY25, we have no additional firm commitments on jet aircraft CapEx.\nAs such, we expect our aircraft-related CapEx to decrease after FY24 and be approximately $1 billion in FY26. This capital allocation strategy represents our approach to a more efficient and nimble network. We will continue to look for additional opportunities as we proceed with our aircraft modernization strategy. We'll bring this discipline, along with our improved flexibility and agility, to ensure that we are successful given the uncertain external environment. In closing, I'm confident that the progress we are making on our transformation will translate into improved margins, returns, and cash flow throughout the year. At the same time, our commitment to driving operational improvement will further enhance the customer experience. Now, let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, who will discuss market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. As expected, the Q4 operating environment remained pressured with year-over-year volume declines and sequential moderation in yields across all transportation segments. We remained focused on revenue quality and creating meaningful differentiation while managing through these dynamics. Let's take each segment in turn now. At FedEx Ground, Q4 revenue was down 2% year-over-year, driven by a 6% decline in volume, partially offset by a 5% increase in yield due to surcharges and product mix. We once again delivered strong service levels and best-in-class market transits. Revenue at FedEx Express was down 13% year-over-year. Parcel volume declines were most pronounced in the United States. And in addition, US freight pounds were down over 25% due to a change in strategy from a very large customer. International export volumes were about 4% lower year-over-year.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue was down 18%, driven by an 18% decline in volumes, with revenue per shipment flat. This decline was driven primarily by the slowdown in the market and high inventory levels. Although the pricing environment is moderating, our pricing discipline remains strong. Let's move now to slide 11. As expected, yield was pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalized. Customer demand rebalanced between priority and economy services with capacity availability. This is most notable in the Asian markets. In response, we remained focused on revenue quality while managing our mix. At ground and US domestic express, yield improved year-over-year, but at a moderating rate versus the previous three quarters. And as I mentioned a moment ago, freight yield was flat.\nTurning now to slide 12, our efforts to make the network the most flexible, efficient, and intelligent network in the world are taking hold. We are delivering better service and outcomes for our customers, creating deep relationships, and of course, incremental revenue for FedEx. These efforts are supported by a fantastic portfolio of services. Raj spoke earlier about the benefits we and our customers are seeing from the expanded rollout of Picture Proof of Delivery and continued enhancements to the estimated time delivery window. Later this year, we plan to narrow our four-hour delivery window in many locations and provide new enhanced mapping capabilities to help customers track their package movements.\nReturns is also an area where we're underpenetrated, and so we're focusing on growth. Returns move through our network similarly to B2B shipments and are highly efficient in our network. In Q4, we introduced our new returns program, FedEx Consolidated Returns, which is available at FedEx Office locations. For merchants, it's a low-cost e-commerce solution for lightweight apparel returns with end-to-end visibility. For shoppers, it's a convenient, no-label, no-box drop-off experience using a QR code. We have received excellent feedback and look forward to continuing to scale the solution very quickly. Finally, last month, we launched FedEx Sustainability Insights, a cloud-based tool that enables customers to view estimated carbon emissions for both individual tracking numbers and all their FedEx accounts.\nThis platform marks the foundation of a new suite of tools for our customers. It enables customers to transfer their carbon data to their own internal systems via an API. The insights are also available online for our small customers. Leveraging the vast shipment data that we have and using our AI and machine learning capabilities, we are able to provide information to our customers in a meaningful and actionable manner. I am very excited about these portfolio expansions and firmly believe that a supply chain powered by FedEx is a competitive advantage for our customers. I'm proud of the team for their unwavering commitment to service and for delivering these innovative solutions. Now, I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on slide 14. The FedEx team demonstrated strong operational execution to close out fiscal 2023. Looking at our transportation segment performance for the Q4, starting with ground, which continues to deliver strong results. Operating income increased 18%, and operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 12.1%, even with volumes down 6%. Margin expansion was supported by yield growth of 5% and strong cost controls driven by lower linehaul expense. At Express, we're seeing sequential operating margin improvement as our team continues to move with urgency to drive structural and volume-related cost improvements. Adjusted operating income declined 47%, and adjusted margin contracted 320 basis points to 5% as package volumes were down 7%, and yields declined 3% due to international package yield pressure.\nAt Freight, the team continues to navigate a softening volume environment. Operating income decreased 26%, and operating margin declined 210 basis points as shipments declined 18% and yield moderated. Our Q4 results include several non-cash items. We recorded an impairment charge of $70 million related to the decision to permanently retire from service 18 aircraft and 34 related engines. The results also include $47 million of goodwill and other asset impairment charges related to the ShopRunner acquisition. In addition, we incurred an unplanned tax expense of $46 million from a revaluation of certain foreign tax assets. To provide additional color on recent demand trends and what we are planning for in our outlook, slide 15 shows trailing monthly volume trends over the last six months for our major service categories. Volume declines continued in the quarter.\nWhile still negative, Ground and US domestic Express year-over-year package volume trends improved into May on a sequential basis. As we look to the Q1 of FY24, we expect volume declines to continue to moderate at Express and Ground as we lap the onset of softer volumes, while freight will continue to experience pressure. This brings me to our FY24 earnings outlook on slide 16. We remain acutely focused on maintaining our strong commercial position, prioritizing revenue quality, and driving profitability improvement through our efficiency initiatives supported by Drive. These efforts are more effectively aligning our cost base with demand, reducing our permanent costs, and increasing the flexibility of our network.\nWe do expect external business conditions to remain challenging near term, and there remains significant uncertainty with respect to the timing of demand recovery, particularly in the back half of our fiscal year. As a result, we are preparing for several potential outcomes as we think about the year ahead. This led us to establish an Adjusted Earnings Per Share outlook range of $16.50 to $18.50 for fiscal 2024. In a demand environment that remains consistent with what we are currently experiencing, we anticipate flattish revenue for the full year and full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share toward the low end of the range.\nShould macroeconomic conditions support an improving demand environment in the back half of the year, we expect to see modest volume improvement for the year. In this scenario, we expect revenue to be up low single-digit percentage for the full year. This would also translate into greater operating leverage from our more efficient network on a higher revenue base, driving an outlook for full-year Adjusted Earnings Per Share closer to the high end of our range. The key external factors that will determine the FY24 outcome are broader economic activity in North America, Europe, and in trans-Pacific trade, inventory restocking, and the development of e-commerce activity as we continue to differentiate our offering. At Express and Ground, we expect to build on fourth quarter cost momentum and see adjusted margin improvement in FY24.\nFreight margins will remain strong in FY24, but lower than FY23 given significant volume reductions and yield pressure. Turning to other aspects of our outlook, first, we expect a $230 million net non-cash pension headwind with a $330 million headwind below the line, offset by $100 million lower pension service costs. Partially offsetting this below-the-line impact, we expect higher interest income on our cash balances. Our projection for the full-year effects of tax rate is approximately 25% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. We are projecting $500 million of business optimization costs in FY24 associated with our transformation. We still expect a total pre-tax spend of $2 billion through FY25, and the timing and amount of these business optimization expenses may change as we revise and implement our plans.\nMoving to the next slide, we want to share how we're thinking about the operating profit considerations embedded in our expectations for the full year.For illustrative purposes, I'll use adjusted EPS of $17.50, the midpoint of the outlook range. This scenario is based on modest demand recovery leading to limited coverage of base cost inflationary pressures. In addition, we expect approximately $800 million of international export yield pressure as peak surcharges significantly diminish and product mix continues shifting toward deferred offerings. We also include a $500 million increase in variable compensation to ensure our compensation package is competitive. This is critical to retain key talent as we execute our Drive transformation. Importantly, though, these pressures are more than offset by the $1.8 billion in cost savings from Drive.\nTogether, these illustrative components lead to FY24 adjusted operating profit of approximately $6.2 billion at the midpoint of our outlook. Moving to slide 18, we continue our unwavering focus on efficient and responsible capital allocation in our pursuit to drive shareholder returns. For the year, we ended with $6.8 billion in cash, in line with where we began the year, despite the challenging business environment. We accomplished this through continued improvement in cash conversion cycles and net working capital, along with reduced capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were $6.2 billion, which represented 6.8% of revenue versus 7.2% of revenue in fiscal 2022. FY23 CapEx was slightly higher than our projection due largely to timing, as easing supply chain constraints accelerated the delivery of equipment and other projects.\nWith a slight acceleration of certain spend into FY23, we are now projecting $5.7 billion in CapEx for FY24, which achieves our target of less than 6.5% CapEx as a percentage of revenue a year earlier than we projected. Our fiscal 2023 adjusted free cash flow of $3.5 billion supported the repurchase of approximately $1.5 billion in stock at an average share price of approximately $163 a share. We paid $1.2 billion of dividends. In addition, we funded $800 million in voluntary pension contributions. Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in attractive return improvement initiatives. We're committed to further reducing capital intensity. Capacity investments at Ground will decline, in addition to the lower aircraft expenditures Express Raj mentioned.\nWe expect to repurchase an additional $2 billion of stock in fiscal 2024. As previously announced, we are raising our dividend by 10%, which increases our adjusted payout ratio to over 30%. These significant stockholder returns reflect confidence in our continued execution of profitability and return improvement initiatives. Lastly, we are planning for $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to our US plans, which were 94.5% funded at year-end. In closing, we are making progress on our transformation and remain focused on delivering shareholder value by driving improved profitability, lowering our capital intensity, while continuing to deliver strong return of excess cash to shareholders. And with that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Before we close, to ask a question, you may press star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. And to withdraw your question, please press star then two. Please limit yourself to one question. And at this time, we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And the first question will come from Allison Poliniak-Cusic with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nHi, good evening. Just want to go back to the optimization in Canada. I know you talked a little bit about the uniqueness of the region. Could you maybe talk to how does that impact the deployment of the optimization? And then, more importantly, relative to, say, the US, how is the scale different in Canada versus the US and how that deployment would go forward? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Allison, thank you for your question. Of course, Canada is a unique market, and we're taking a different approach there than the market-by-market approach we're taking in the US. The Canadian population is heavily concentrated in a few key geographies, and the volume is split roughly 50/50 between Express and Ground. We made the decision to consolidate everything under Express. It's the right time to take these steps because we'll begin in April 2024 and complete by September of 2024.\nIt's very important that you understand that this is unique to Canada because we're going to take a market-by-market approach in the United States, and we'd have a hybrid in the United States between couriers and package handlers. It's a very important step for us in Canada. It reduces our cost by about $100 million and, importantly, improves our portfolio and service differentiation. Thank you for the question, Allison.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nVP and Equity Research Analyst of Transportation and Logistics, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi, thanks. You sort of gave some parameters for the EPS range, $16.50 to $18.50, and mentioned in the second half what it would mean if the macro sort of accelerated in terms of the revenue side. But I'm sort of curious, as you think about the first half of the fiscal year and the second half of the year, is a way to give a sense, maybe at the midpoint, the proportion of EBIT in both halves? Because I suspect that it's more of a second-half acceleration with the cost in the economy. Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure, Jordan, this is Mike. So let me break that down to a couple of elements. First, the demand projection we're talking about for the second half of the year would be relative to what we have been currently experiencing. So that's the degree of uncertainty there in terms of how that flows going to the back half of the year. In the front half of the year, keep in mind that the significant inflection that we saw last year was very late in Q1, with that most pronounced at Express. So we will be lapping that for Q1. And in addition, the trail-off in freight volume accelerated into the mid to upper teens later in the calendar year as well, largely in the fall when that started.\nSo you got to think about the Q1 considerations there as you put the whole year together and are modeling. But in terms of the outlook overall, we're not projecting any material inflection in the demand environment to get to that point there that you've referenced.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJon Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Mike, just sticking with you on the Slide 17, the $300 million revenue net of cost increases, is there any way to break down how much of that is volume versus price? And if it is more kind of price-driven, the $2.7 billion of variable costs that you took out this year, how much do you have adding back in fiscal 2024?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Jon, let me take a swing at that here. So the way we have framed this is that our expectation is for continued but moderating underlying inflation. So what we illustrated here in this midpoint scenario is positive contribution beyond inflation amidst a muted demand growth scenario. Then, obviously, on top of that, the Drive savings are greater than the non-recurring headwinds. So again, as Brie mentioned, we'll see moderating volume declines as we move through the year here. But at the same time, the degree of yield increases that we saw last year are not going to continue into this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst of Transfortation, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. For Brie, can you just talk about any signs of demand destruction or trade down in this uncertain environment? You mentioned one customer making a change. I think it was within US air freight, I believe it was. And then relatedly, can you just talk about if you're seeing any diversions from the UPS network that might be driving some of those month-on-month incremental gains in terms of ground and express? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nOkay, I think I got all that, Brian. I think you had a couple of questions. Let's start with the last part first. So I think the question was, are we seeing any benefit from the UPS labor negotiation? So the short answer is in Q4, we did not see any material benefit because of those discussions, and we have not planned for any benefit moving into fiscal year 2024. What I can tell you is that this has opened a lot of doors. We're having a lot of great conversations with legacy UPS customers, and we feel really strong. We feel really good about the sales pipeline because of the strong value proposition we have versus our primary competitor.\nI think the other question was about the mix, and are we seeing any customers make trades within the portfolio? Where we're seeing that most pronounced, and we have planned for it, to Mike's point, it's in our range accounted for, is in Asia. Obviously, capacity has come back relative to demand, and we did reopen our IE product in the Q4. That has performed well. And actually, I'm really pleased with the performance that I'm seeing from the Asia Pacific team and their sales pipeline, but that's where we've seen the biggest shift.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jack Atkins with Stephens. Please go ahead.\n\nJack Atkins\n\nResearch Analyst, Stephens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you for taking my question. So I guess maybe, if I could, a two-parter here. The guidance itself, I think the bottom end, Mike, if the way you described it, if I understood it correctly, contemplates the operating environment sort of remains as is right now. If we were to see things deteriorate in terms of just underlying customer demand, is the company prepared to maybe pull forward some of the Drive savings from FY25 into FY24?\nIs that even really plausible at this point? If you maybe could talk about that. And then for Brie, for the second part of the question, is the $800 million of international export yield pressure that you guys are going to be seeing this year going to fully capture sort of getting back to sort of pre-COVID levels there? Again, thanks for the two-parter, but would appreciate the insights.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Jack, we'll give you a special pass then. So on the low end there, I characterize that's flatish revenue year over year. So that would be the low end of our expectation. But in terms of how we navigate and manage through that, the flexibility that Raj mentioned too that we are incorporating into the network is allowing us to then react to that and adjust. And again, point to the tremendous progress we've made and the results you've seen at Ground in the last few quarters of material volume declines, yet improved margins and profitability. And you saw in the last quarter here, Express is mitigating the flow-through from the reduced demand. So we will move with great urgency should it be below our range of expectations.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAnd let me just jump in before I turn it over to Brie here. So it's a simple one, two, three formula. At 1%, we are at the low end of the range. At 2%, we are in the middle. At 3%, we are at the higher end of the range in terms of revenue growth. Now, to go beyond that, we become non-linear in terms of significant operations leverage. So yeah, Drive is working, and we have flexibility to pull additional levers as we need to. Brie.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks, Raj. So Jack, the short answer is yes, that we have planned for the $800 million impact this fiscal year. And then as we lap that impact, we will be able to build back from there. So the short answer is yes.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nSenior Research Analyst, Citigroup\n\nYeah, hi. Maybe just on the one point going into the call, say, can we just understand the timing of that as we go through fiscal 2024? How much of that comes, I guess, in one Q or in the first half, and how much should be sort of spread out over the rest of the year?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure, Chris, this is Mike. Of the $1.8 billion, it is a sequential build as we go through. We continue with the discipline and rigor of the Drive framework. So as certain things are implemented during the year, we won't get the full run rate of that because there is a continuous flow of initiative. So it'll be the least amount of that 1.8 will be in Q1, and it'll build as we go through the year. And then that gives us the run rate momentum then to get to the $4 billion fully by FY25.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglanski\n\nDirector and Senior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nYes, thank you. And good afternoon. Raj, I think in your prepared remarks, you said that you've already transitioned something like 20 markets to one FedEx operation, but not every market is the same. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? And how is this hybrid model going to work in the states where you do have overlapping contractors and potentially employee drivers? Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Brandon, the markets that we have transitioned over are in Alaska. We're working through Hawaii and certain other markets in Minneapolis. So we have learned a lot in this process from technology, from facilities, and people. And the hybrid model is that in some markets, we will have couriers. In some markets, we have a contractor. So those things will be determined. They'll be data-driven, and they'll work through with our people first, PSP philosophy. And as I said, this is going to take a little bit of time, as we told you, but I'm glad we're making the progress we're making already. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nSenior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, good afternoon. So Raj, if I take a look at what happened last kind of August, September, the outcome was quite a bit different than you expected. I think your international fell off quite a bit, maybe some other things. I think the way you guided looking forward, if we look at your results in November quarter and February quarter, you set a bar that was achievable. Maybe you just executed a little better. How do you think about the guidance that you're giving us for fiscal 2024?\nYou've talked about the different macro assumptions and revenue, but is there some element of having a conservative bar where you could potentially do better on cost or maybe pricing comes in a bit better? Just kind of reflecting what seemed to be a pattern of giving yourself a little bit of room to overachieve in the last couple of quarters. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nTom, firstly, let me say this much. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's the first time in the history of FedEx that in FedEx Ground the volumes declined and our operating margin expanded. So clearly, this is beyond just flexing for volume, and this is really Drive taking effect as well. So we are just very, very pleased with how John and his team are performing in Ground. And by the way, I'll give kudos to the Express team and Richard's team as well as we have started to see significant improvement in the Q4. To your question about the macro, so when we talked in September, we pointed to three things. We said that the industrial economy was slowing down because of inflation, interest rates, and slowdown in global trade.\nWe said that the consumer spending was shifting to services versus goods. And then thirdly, there was an e-commerce reset coming out of the pandemic. Well, all those three things happened, and they were detrimental to volume for the whole industry. So I mean, we're roughly the same revenue performance on the calendar quarter that is comparable across the sector. If you look ahead here, at this point, the one and two are basically along the same lines we've seen in the last few months. I think on the e-commerce side, we expect to see growth now. I think the reset is probably complete, and e-commerce is going to grow into the next calendar, sorry, the next FY24 timeframe. So we are watching this very carefully.\nVisibility, especially in the second half, is very difficult given the dynamic circumstances we're seeing. We'll see how the industrial production goes. We'll see how GDP and trade goes, and we'll follow the inventory stocking and inventory to sales ratio very carefully. But at the end of the day, we are focused on the things we can control. We made a determination that we're going to come out of this stronger than we went in, and it's exactly what we're doing. And I'm very, very pleased with the way we are executing Drive. So sorry for a long answer, Tom, but I thought I wanted to give you a full perspective there.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah. And Tom, this is Mike. I want to just amplify one aspect there as well to just highlight. We talked about Ground and the progress and the numbers there, but there has been tremendous progress at Express amidst the headwinds here.\nSo you ask about the guidance broadly, but keep in mind all $800 million of that international headwind is at Express as a non-recurring headwind. A significant component of the variable compensation is at Express. And the domestic freight headwind that Brie alluded to earlier, that's about $400 million right there as a headwind in 2024. So despite all that, through the discipline and rigor of drive and a muted demand environment, we are projecting up margins at Express in 2024. So again, just to reiterate, we're looking at this very thoughtfully and are planning to adapt to any further changes in the environment.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, great. Mike, if I can just follow up on a couple of thoughts there. Your thoughts on the scale of improvement at Express, can you reach mid-single digits? Is there kind of a range as you'd put within the target? Same at Ground, is that going to reach double digits if we're going up? And then magnitude at Freight margin, if you're looking at declining expectations. And then I guess within that, any thoughts on Europe and TNT integration within that Express category? Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThat was a lot. Certainly, like I said, we will see margin improvements at Express and at Ground in 2024. Freight, we'll definitely see some margin pressure there. So I'm going to leave it at that. The Freight will mitigate. Like I said earlier, we'll see the largest margin pressure at Freight in Q1, and that will mitigate as we move through the year. Similarly, I would expect Express margin improvement to improve to a greater degree beyond Q1 as well as we move through the year. So I'll leave it at that.\nAs it relates to Europe, we are absolutely, as a component of that Express improvement, projecting improved profitability in Europe. Keep in mind that within the Drive domains, we've identified $600 million of value that we'll realize from the Europe initiatives there. So we will absolutely see progress on that in 2024 and going forward.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nHey, thanks. Afternoon. So Raj, in one of the earlier answers, you basically said one, two, three, right, for the earnings sensitivity and revenue sensitivity. So that's basically every billion of revenue gets you an extra dollar of earnings. Is that the right sensitivity to think about just longer term beyond just this year as freight eventually recovers? And then just separately, the $5.7 billion of CapEx this year, how much is included in aircraft? I just want to get a sense of what the CapEx could look like in a couple of years when we're spending a lot less on planes. Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Scott. So first, on the aircraft CapEx, we came in at about $1.7 billion in 2023, about $1.5 billion for 2024, slightly lower than that in 2025. And then as Raj said, approximately below that even into 2026. So that's the aircraft component of it.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAnd Scott, on the one, two, three, I just wanted to keep the math straightforward here. It's a simple one, two, three formula. But the point I wanted to make also is that as it accelerates beyond that, then the curve becomes non-linear. As we have significant operating leverage, I think you are the one who called it the opening the jaws of the crocodile, then that's kind of what's going to happen.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector of Travel and Transport Research, Melius Research\n\nHey, everyone, thank you. Just on the 2024 revenue assumption, I'm a little confused on how that will work with export yield pressure. It just seems like the other lever is going to be volumes in general. Just to be super clear, are you assuming a year-over-year increase in 2024 at the midpoint? Just any help there would be great. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nSure, Conor. Yes, the assumption at the midpoint, as Raj just mentioned, would be 2% revenue growth. As you think about the build back from a revenue perspective, it's important to note, as I think Mike mentioned earlier, in the US domestic, as we get late into Q1, early Q2, you will see volumes, domestic Express and Ground parcel.\nThey'll get to flat, and then we do anticipate they will build back from there. FedEx Freight will lag that slightly because, as Mike talked about, the impact lagged. And then when we get into our international business, the 800 is really yield impact. We are anticipating to build back some volume in our international business this year. And again, that will happen throughout the year. So yes, 2% is the midpoint. Volumes will start to build back throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. Brie, I just want to follow up on that if I can. You gave your range of outcomes, but we do have higher interest rates, credit cards. I know there's been a lot of chatter about school loans being paid later this year, and that may be a negative for holiday season and e-commerce. As you look around the world, let me phrase this a little differently than you've been answering. Where are potential green shoots starting to show up in your network or reasons for optimism? And where are we seeing, let's forget the international yields, but more in terms of activity that you're seeing out there, incremental red?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYeah, absolutely. It's a fair question. So we plan right now for flattish to low single revenue growth. And that's really basically on the backdrop of the economy that we're experiencing right now. We're all watching the consumer. As Raj talked about, we are still seeing consumer strength here in the United States, but we are seeing an e-commerce reset. So from a green shoots perspective, one of the things that we're going to be looking at is that e-commerce growth. It's sitting at 7% to 8%. It's important to note our percentage of that is closer to 2% to 3% because we don't play in grocery. And obviously, within that 7% to 8% is also a buy online, pickup in store.\nSo we will be keeping an eye on that consumer strength here in the United States and would love to see, as we head into peak, a little bit of a different shift. We have not seen that yet, but we'll be watching for it. And then the other thing from an Asia perspective is we are going to watch closely on Asia reopening. We haven't seen significant uptick there, but if that happens to Raj's point, that will absolutely be a tailwind for us. And then honestly, our own execution in Europe. I'm really pleased with the service that the European team is delivering. We've got some green shoots in the domestic markets in Europe, and we're working that really, really hard from an operations and a sales perspective. So there are definitely some green shoots we're working on.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\n\nHelane Becker\n\nManaging Director and Senior Advisor, TD Cowen\n\nThanks, operator. Hi, team. So, easy questions. I think the pilots are voting on a new contract, and I'm wondering if the cost increase associated with that is included in the guidance. And the other part of the question is, as you retire your older aircraft, are you also retiring pilots, or is there an excess of pilots?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Helane, a couple of questions there. So first, as it relates to the aspects of the pilot tentative agreement there, a component of that is a payment upon implementation. So we've previously accrued for that date of signing payment there. And then within the guidance here, we have the FY24 scale increases. And then within the pension figures I gave earlier, that incorporates the considerations as it relates to that as well. So that's fully incorporated into the outlook there. And as we mentioned earlier, we're expecting to park 29 additional aircraft during the year, nine of which will be permanently retired.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\n\nScott Schneebeger\n\nManaging Director, Oppenheimer\n\nThanks very much. Good afternoon. I'm going to keep it on the airplanes.Just curious on flight, if you can kind of frame the answer in where you were a year ago, where you are now, and where you anticipate being in a quarter or two with regard to taking out flights, Trans-Pacific, Trans-Atlantic, Asia-Europe, if we could just get an update on that for what you've done and what may come going forward. Thanks.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nScott, look, as Raj mentioned, flight hours were down 12% in the Q4, which is greater than the volume decline. So we've taken significant flying out of the network. We've said that that was anticipated once the supply-demand constraints were eased. And so that is the decision to then retire these aircraft because we continue to reduce the Trans-Pacific and Trans-Atlantic flying to match demand. And we'll continue to lean into that as well as utilizing the flexibility of capacity in the market.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, thanks for fitting me in here. So Mike, in the scenarios you've outlined for us, is there a scenario where margins on a consolidated basis don't get better on an adjusted basis in 2023? Or are we looking for margin expansion? And then Brie, as you think about the large customer change in behavior, I'm assuming we're talking about the post office. Are we expecting more of that priority mail revenue to decline given what DeJoy has said publicly around his desire to ground some of that traffic? And then how do we think about that sort of in connection with your desire also to kind of reduce the flying network a bit?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx",
    "content2": "Yeah. Well, I mean, David, the shorter answer is we're projecting margin improvement with the outcomes here that we have highlighted and the specific drivers within that.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nYes. And the customer we are talking about is the United States Postal Service. Obviously, we've had a long and productive and profitable relationship with the post office. You're correct. Their 10-year strategic plan is to track more volume and fly less. So to Mike's point earlier, we have accounted for that in this year's fiscal range. We are committed to meeting the service obligations in that contract, which does end in September 2024. And so we've accounted for that headwind. At that point, it will become a tailwind as we either renegotiate or we will adjust our network accordingly.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\n[Analyst] (Jefferies)\n\nAnalyst, Jefferies\n\nGreat. Good evening. This is actually Joe hopping on for Stephanie. Thanks for squeezing me at the end here. I'll keep it to one. My question is maybe for Mike. It's a bit in the weeds. Looking at the Ground operating profit expansion, purchase transportation costs are obviously down big year over year at 40%. I think it's the lowest % of revenue in 10 years or something with the softer macro. So how should we think about PT, particularly in the context of volume rebound and the need to maybe source third-party capacity if the macro improves, especially as more costs are coming out of the network? Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Joe. Well, in my remarks, I mentioned how one of the drivers of the margin expansion and cost control at Ground was lower linehaul expense. So we moved a lot of high-cost ad hoc external linehaul spend into our scheduled network as we optimize that and lower rates on the planned linehaul purchase transportation. So again, it's all part of the broader optimization of the networks holistically, both pickup and delivery, linehaul, as well as the sort and facility operations.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question will come from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector, Stifel\n\nHey, thanks. And good evening. And congrats, Mike, on the retirement. Just want to ask about the LTL side since we haven't talked about it too much. You recently had a large competitor announce some material solvency concerns. And I just wanted to see what the playbook here is if we do see a major competitor exit. Would you rethink some of the facility closures and furloughs at that point, or even just if it's a stronger-than-expected LTL market?\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nSure. And thanks for that, Bruce. But yeah, on the LTL side, look, you've seen how fast the team reacted to the declining volume environment earlier in the year, and we still were expanding margins. That accelerated, so that was more challenging. So look, we will continue to look to optimize the facilities. It's a holistic perspective. So the 29 facilities were smaller ones that weren't the most efficient. So as we lean into what could be a demand recovery, that volume could be accommodated within the larger facilities. And that just has that much more incremental contribution as and when that comes back.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the final question will come from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nAmit Mehrotra\n\nManaging Director, Deutsche Bank\n\nThanks. Hi everyone. Mike, I know there's a lot of questions on the long-term 12-month view. That's hard. I get it. But maybe help us calibrate expectations for the near term. Do you expect Express and Ground profits to be up in the next quarter? I know there's seasonality, but the question, there's obviously Drive savings. And then Raj, the decision to go external for the CEO search, that obviously wasn't lost upon me, that external criteria. That's a big deal for FedEx, obviously. And wondering if you can talk about what the board, what you're trying to achieve there in terms of hiring somebody from the outside, which really hasn't happened before for such a senior position. Thank you.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAll right, Amit. This is Mike. So first, I'll reiterate, as I mentioned earlier, freight margins will be down for the year, and that will be most pronounced in Q1.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nAt Express, as we saw the significant inflection in demand very late in the Q1 last year, Express will see the smallest year-over-year margin change in Q1 relative to the rest of the year. So I'll leave it at that and go from there.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nAnd Amit, yes, first of all, and again, thank Mike for just incredible work over the last 18 years, and particularly in the last three. And we have a fantastic finance team and a great organization. From a succession planning, we are looking at somebody who has deep financial expertise, but also strong operational capabilities and help lead FedEx through our Drive transformation program. So again, thank you for your question.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, operator. Before we close, I want to give Mike an opportunity to say a few words.\n\nMike Lenz\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Raj. The last 18 years at FedEx have been a tremendous experience, and it was my great honor to serve as CFO for the last three years. Who would have known when I was named to this position in March of 2020 what we in the world were about to face? But this team rose to the occasion again and again through many obstacles, and we are now well-positioned for the future. I want to express my gratitude to the entire FedEx team and the finance team in particular for their dedication throughout all of the change. To Fred and Raj for their vision and leadership, and most importantly, to my wife, Jane, and our sons for their support along the way.\nI've also valued the engagement with this audience in sharing the exciting plans and bright future for FedEx. As I start my next chapter, I leave knowing that FedEx is in a strong position. I couldn't ask for any more than that. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Mike. In closing, I also want to thank our team members for the hard work and dedication as we build the world's smartest logistics network. We made tremendous progress on our transformation efforts in fiscal year 2023, and the team is already moving with urgency as we enter fiscal year 2024. We know there's significant opportunity ahead, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute. Thank you very much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

(Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's call is being recorded.\nI will now turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations at FedEx. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.\n\nArthur M. Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. During our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to 1 question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nI want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nWe are hosting a DRIVE Update Meeting in New York City on April 5. If you have not yet received your invitation, please call or e-mail me or anyone on the Investor Relations team. For those who are not able to attend the meeting in person, this meeting will also be webcast.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive Vice President, Chief Customer Officer. And now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thanks to the hard work of the FedEx team, our third quarter earnings were ahead of our expectations in what remains a challenged demand environment. The team delivered outstanding service throughout and following peak despite significant weather disruptions across the United States.\nImportantly, our third quarter results also reflect our continued progress on the fundamental transformation of FedEx as we moved with urgency to realign our cost structure. Our cost reduction actions supported margin expansion at both Ground and Freight but have not yet fully offset the impact of continued pressures at Express. Results at Express came in below where they need to be and below the potential we know exist in this business. We're committed to addressing these cost imbalances, and we'll be taking further actions in the coming months, including a more pronounced readjustment of the air network. Because of the magnitude of changes we are planning across our air network and our continued need to maintain high service levels, there's a lag in the timing of expense adjustments. We expect to see sequential progress in the fourth quarter.\nOverall, our efficiency efforts are gaining traction ahead of schedule, and I'm pleased that this translates into an improved earnings outlook for fiscal year '23.\nNow turning to Slide 6 for a snapshot of the quarter. Volumes declined by a low double-digit percentage across all segments, partially offset by higher yields at Ground, U.S. Domestic Express and Freight. This led to a year-over-year revenue decline.\nWhile revenue fell across all segments, the decrease was most pronounced at Express. Adjusted operating margins and EPS declined year-over-year as volume softness was partially offset by higher yields and cost reduction actions.\nLast quarter, we shared our expectation for continued pressures from lower volume and inflation. But what is also embedded in these results and what I'm seeing firsthand every day are tangible signs of the fundamental transmission happening at FedEx through DRIVE. We are rightsizing our cost base to match today's realities and creating a more efficient and agile network. We're not simply taking out cost. We are simultaneously focused on running our business more efficiently, flexibly and profitably, which will create significant value for our stockholders in the years to come.\nI'm particularly pleased with the progress we are seeing in Ground. The team has taken aggressive actions to address its cost structure and has effectively mitigated volume pressures. One of the key drivers at Ground was the ability to manage staffing levels and associated expenses which resulted in reduced salaries, benefits and purchased transportation costs. Combined, these expenses were down 8% year-over-year.\nDespite the dynamic environment, Ground continued to deliver customers during peak with an average time in transit of approximately 2 days compared to 2.35 days in fiscal year 2022. In aggregate, these initiatives led to a modest increase in cost per package of 1% despite 11% volume declines, and total operating expenses were down $345 million year-over-year. When combined with our continued focus on revenue quality, total operating income was up 32% year-over-year and operating margin of 9.7% that improved 240 basis points year-over-year.\nFreight has also illustrated disciplined commitment to profitable growth, revenue quality and managing cost to volumes. The team continues to execute cost reduction actions in this regard. Beyond day-to-day management of variable costs, the Freight team is temporarily parking and selling equipment to rightsize the fleet and reduce future maintenance costs. The team is also limiting hiring and furloughing employees to match staffing with volume levels. We're taking the relevant learnings from this proven Freight model and implementing them at both Ground and Express.\nTotal operating expense at Freight was down 6%, supporting 270 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. Importantly, our cost initiatives did not compromise the consistent outstanding service levels delivered by the Freight team.\nTurning to Slide 7. We have made significant progress in taking cost out of our network with $1.2 billion in year-over-year cost savings in the third quarter. We are highly focused on taking permanent cost out of the system and remain on track to generate permanent savings of $1 billion this fiscal year relative to plan.\nLast month, we announced a streamlined reporting structure that will reduce the size of our officer and director team by more than 10%. We will continue to aggressively manage head count, including attrition, to align our teams with the network changes underway. By the end of this fiscal year, we expect U.S. head count to be down roughly 25,000 year-over-year.\nAt Express, our cost base is constrained in the short term. Our Express network is vast and complex and requires time to adjust to changing demand conditions. Therefore, we are taking additional steps to address our fixed expense structure. This quarter, we reduced flight hours by 8% and salary and benefit expenses by 4%. We also parked an additional 9 aircraft, down-gauged on certain routes and implemented various productivity improvements. As a result of these actions, we mitigated 45% of total revenue declines on an adjusted basis. This was a significant improvement versus the first half.\nWithin the U.S. Domestic Express, we implemented a single daily dispatch of couriers in February. This change removes domestic pickup and delivery routes, improves hub and ramp efficiency. We expect this will achieve about $50 million in savings in Q4 and ramp up to about $300 million annual savings by fiscal 2024. We expect progress to accelerate in the fourth quarter, with total flight hours expected to be down double digits and further FTE reductions by year-end. This will support mid- to high single-digit reductions in total expenses year-over-year at Express. We also plan to temporarily park additional aircraft in the fourth quarter. With continued cost discipline, we anticipate sequential operating margin improvement in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter.\nAssuming the challenging demand environment persists in Q4, we expect to be able to mitigate at least 60% of the revenue-related headwinds we are facing in Express. This supports improved profitability in the fourth quarter compared to the third. We will build profitability from here at Express.\nBefore we dive into the financial results in more detail, I'll provide a quick update on DRIVE, the program to support our transformation to create a more nimble, efficient and profitable FedEx. We are on track to deliver $4 billion of permanent cost reduction by the end of fiscal 2025.\nI'm very pleased with the progress the team has made in identifying actions that will not only reduce costs but will make our network more agile and flexible as we execute Network 2.0. One part of this effort, as shown on Slide 8, is to reconfigure our air network. This requires many steps, including plans currently being developed to phase out our fleet of MD-11s. Our aircraft modernization program and use of 777s and 767s affords us the ability to flex our plans. And as we operate more collaboratively, we are leaning into the ground transportation more, requiring less CapEx while enabling us to reconfigure our network more quickly. This directly supports our goal for meaningful ROIC improvement in the coming years.\nWe're excited to share more about the strategy at our DRIVE program update on April 5. There, we will focus on the actions we are taking to improve our performance, along with additional information to help you better model the impact on our progress.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, who will discuss market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail. Brie?\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj, and good afternoon, everyone. As expected, the operating environment in the third quarter remains challenging. The trends we saw through the first half of the year persisted, but we started to see some moderation, and importantly, our team delivered excellence for our customers.\nAt FedEx Ground, revenue was down 2%. The volume decline was significantly offset by a double-digit percentage yield increase driven by better product mix, fuel and large package and peak surcharges. We are very pleased with the results from the implementation of our global rate increase this past January, which has maintained a very high capture rate.\nAt FedEx Freight, revenue was down 3%. The team's continued execution on revenue quality actions and profitable share enabled us to offset 12% volume decline throughout the quarter. Importantly, pricing discipline across the LTL industry is strong, and we expect the market to remain rational.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to lower volumes globally and yield softness in Asia and Europe.\nIn Europe, we're seeing improved operational execution with service at the best levels they have been since fiscal year '21. There's more work to do but the momentum is building as our team has improved service levels while maintaining a healthy sales pipeline. Our pipeline and signed contracts are at their highest levels this fiscal year and our closes per week are at a double-digit percentage higher than they were in Q1. Additionally, having a freight and parcel bundle for our customers in Europe differentiates us from the rest of the market.\nIn Asia, market demand is rebalancing, resulting in lower yields and softer demand for priority services. The reopening of our international economy service this May will help stabilize our volumes out of Asia, given the market's increased shift to deferred services.\nMoving now to Slide 11. As expected, yield growth has been increasingly pressured across segments as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shift. FedEx Express international turns negative driven primarily by Asia, with Europe also softening. U.S. Domestic Express, Ground and Freight yield growth also decelerated. Despite market headwinds, we're pleased with the team's ability to manage volume, share and margin at both FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight. Looking ahead, we remain prudent in our expectations for yield in the fourth quarter.\nTurning to Slide 12. Service is always top of mind for us at FedEx. Our team delivered another busy peak season highlighted by FedEx Ground achieving pre-pandemic service levels. In fact, across the board, FedEx Ground delivers to more locations in 1 or 2 days than our nearest competitor's ground service. I would also like to share progress we're making at Express where service levels improved significantly over fiscal '22 peak and are quickly approaching pre-pandemic service levels. While this is great progress, we know we have more to do, and we're taking meaningful action to continuously enhance our service.\nFor example, in Europe, with the reopening of our Duiven Netherlands road hub this past October, we have expanded capacity, enabled a more efficient routing and we have improved our service. These improvements are a testament to our team's ability to deliver outstanding service while we change our business.\nComing out of peak, service improvement has translated into good momentum for our sales team. Jill and I are also very pleased with the market's response to several new or enhanced offerings that further improve customer experience. First, the online FedEx Ship Manager has been fully modernized to make shipping more efficient, highly personal and easier to use for all of our customers. Our customers can cater the interface to the way of working they prefer and that fits their business. Customer feedback has been very positive, and we're finding that the more customers engage with Ship Manager, the more they appreciate it. FedEx Ship Manager is the primary tool for small business customers, and we plan to migrate 98% of all parcel shippers to this new experience before next peak.\nNext, we launched Picture Proof of Delivery ahead of peak season, making us the first to market with this great capability. It has fulfilled a key customer need, driving confidence around successful package deliveries. Benefits from this launch include fewer delivery disputes and fewer customer service calls post proof of delivery. We are winning new business because of this unique feature here.\nWe have also continued to build on our dynamic pricing infrastructure with our DataWorks team. In peak, our dynamic pricing capability enabled holiday peak residential surcharges to adjust dynamically based on individual customers' weekly peaking factor, delivering $150 million in profit. In the coming fiscal year, our predictive anomaly detection will improve revenue quality. We have already built infrastructure that helps us identify instances when we have overbilled our customers. Now we will use those same capabilities to better manage customer performance and contract compliance. Finally, in January, we rolled out new visibility insights in 13 countries, providing customers with a 4-hour time window for their package delivery. By delivering these innovative solutions, our teams are creating great value enhancing the overall customer experience.\nNow I will turn it over to Mike to discuss the financials in more detail.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie. Starting with our performance in the third quarter. We delivered earnings ahead of our expectations as our team moved with urgency to align our costs with lower revenue as global volumes remain under pressure.\nTurning to the Transportation segments. At Ground, operating income increased 32%, and operating margin expanded 240 basis points to 9.7%. Margin expansion was supported by both yield growth of 11% and cost reduction actions. These factors were partially offset by lower package volume, higher infrastructure costs related to previously committed projects and increased other operating expenses.\nAnd at Freight, the team's focus on revenue quality and managing costs drove better profitability as operating income increased 15% and margins expanded 270 basis points. This was driven by revenue per shipment, up 11%, as well as a gain on a facility sale and partially offset by decreased shipments.\nAt Express, our results continue to be pressured, and our team is acutely focused on driving improved profitability. Adjusted operating income declined 81% due to 10% lower package volumes as cost reductions lagged volume declines. Volume pressures were partially offset by improved yields. Revenue per package grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates, partially offset by exchange rate impacts. Yield growth decelerated and inflected negatively in international export, increasing pressure on profitability. Despite our performance in the third quarter, due to the actions we are taking in Express, we expect to see sequential operating profit and margin improvement in the fourth quarter.\nTo provide additional color on recent demand trends and what we are planning for in our outlook, Slide 17 shows trailing monthly volume trends for our major product categories. Volume declines continued throughout the quarter. While still negative, U.S. Domestic Express, International Priority and Ground Package trends improved somewhat into February on a sequential basis. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect volume declines to continue moderating at Express and Ground as we lap the onset of softer volumes. Yield growth will be pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shifts most prominently in Asia.\nMoving to Slide 18. Our focus on efficient and responsible capital allocation has not wavered. We are in an era of lower capital intensity at FedEx. Last fiscal year, CapEx was 7.2% of revenue, down from our historical levels of roughly 8%. By fiscal year '25, our commitment is to be at 6.5% or lower.\nAs I mentioned in December, we reduced our fiscal year '23 capital spend forecast of $5.9 billion, which is approximately a $900 million reduction from initial plans for the year to account for the lower demand environment. We are prudently deferring and slowing the pace of projects, improving our capacity utilization and planning for moderated aircraft fleet investment to drive ROIC improvements. In line with this approach, we expect capital spend to be roughly flat in fiscal 2024 versus fiscal 2023 and be down as a percentage of revenue.\nTurning to liquidity. Our cash position remains a source of strength. We ended the quarter with $5.4 billion in cash and continue to generate solid cash flows, which supports our capital return strategy. We remain committed to rewarding our stockholders as we transform our business and execute on our long-term strategy. In fiscal year '23, we will return $2.7 billion to our stockholders.\nIn summary, our capital allocation strategy reflects our commitment to reducing capital intensity and creating value for stockholders while continuing to reinvest in FedEx for today and tomorrow.\nTurning to Slide 19. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we expect market conditions to continue to negatively impact revenue and operating profit. However, on a sequential basis, we expect FedEx's fourth quarter results to follow our historical seasonal pattern, representing the high-water mark on the year. We will continue to execute on the previously identified cost actions and identify additional opportunities to reduce costs in order to mitigate the impact of volume declines on our operating results.\nAs part of these reductions, we will manage capacity to lower demand levels, including further reducing flight hours at Express and reducing Sunday operations, closing certain sort operations and taking other line-haul expense actions at Ground. We are executing targeted actions to reduce shared and allocated overhead expenses, reducing vendor utilization, deferring certain technology projects and discontinuing same-day city operations at FedEx Office. In addition, we expect to achieve savings related to further head count attrition and the elimination of certain global officer and director positions, which we announced in February. Putting these factors together, our updated expectation of full year adjusted earnings is $14.60 to $15.20 per diluted share.\nAnd with that, let's open it up for questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. And now at this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of FedEx Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nArthur M. Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The second quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book on our website at fedex.com. This call and the accompanying slides are being streamed from our website, where the replay and slides will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. During our question-and-answer session, callers will be limited to one question in order to allow us to accommodate all those who would like to participate.\nI want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance may be -- certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the mostly directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; and Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to take a moment to remember our colleague, Jeff Smith, who passed away on November 17, after courageous battle of brain cancer. Jeff's contributions to the Investor Relations and FedEx team were immeasurable, and our hearts remain heavy at his loss. He will be greatly missed.\nSeparately, I'd like to congratulate Elizabeth Allen on her upcoming retirement at the end of the month after 32 years at FedEx. Elizabeth has been instrumental to the Investor Relations team, and she will be missed by our FedEx colleagues and the investment community alike.\nAnd now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me begin by thanking our more than 550,000 employees who are working diligently to deliver another strong peak season for our customers. I'm extremely proud of the team's ability to sustain excellent services season while we continue to transform our global network, (inaudible) to the FedEx team.\nI'm encouraged by our second quarter results and the momentum underway against our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy. We exceeded our Q2 earnings target and cost action goals shared in September, even as the environment remained challenged.\nAt the same time, there is more work to be done. The declining demand trends we saw at the end of Q1 softened further in the second quarter, and we are moving faster and with more determination than ever to accelerate our cost actions. Today, we will provide more detail on those cost actions and our plan to structurally transform our network to be nimbler, leaner and more efficient, supported by our DRIVE program.\nTurning to Slide 6 for a snapshot of the quarter. Volumes declined across all segments, primarily at Express down low double digits. As such, revenue was down 3%, driven by a decline at FedEx Express, which was partially offset by growth at FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground.\nAdjusted operating margin and EPS declined with volume weakness, partially offset by higher yield and cost management actions. All of this said, we knew coming into this quarter that we would continue to be challenged by volume softness and high inflation.\nI'm exceptionally proud of the team's execution to date, which enabled us to exceed the second quarter earnings and cost targets. A great example of our meticulous focus on cost actions was a result at FedEx Ground, where, despite volume being down 9% in the quarter, we were able to grow both operating income and margin.\nAnd at FedEx Freight due to operating margin improved 320 basis points due to the continued focus on revenue quality, aligning the cost structure to lower volume levels and delivering an outstanding customer experience.\nNow I'll provide an update on our aggressive and decisive plan to cut costs in fiscal '23 relative to our June plan. In Q2, we achieved over $900 million of savings, exceeding the cost target we shared with you last quarter. This brings our total year-to-date progress to $1.2 billion. As we look to the remainder of the fiscal year, we have identified additional savings, bringing our target for fiscal year '23 to be approximately $3.7 billion in cuts.\nTurning to Slide 8. As we execute these cost actions, we are also laser-focused on delivering upon the superior service that has defined FedEx throughout our nearly 50-year history. As I mentioned, our team is performing exceptionally well this peak season, with ground time in transit in the U.S. at just 2 days. FedEx Ground is delivering holiday shipments faster to more locations than our nearest competitor. Our ground service is now back to pre-pandemic levels, supported by continued enhancements to our route optimization and package handler scheduling technologies.\nService levels also continued to improve at Express. In Europe, we have made strong progress with Italy, France, Germany, Spain and the U.K. showing sustained high levels of service performance. The service challenges at Paris Charles De Gaulle Airport have been largely alleviated, and we are capitalizing on efficiencies in the network to further improve service.\nWe're taking swift action to address the remaining issues for our intra-Europe service, including the reopening of our Netherlands ground hub in October, which will continue to improve transit and depressurize the rest of the network and completing the Novara Italy road hub in February of 2023.\nMoving to Slide 9. I'll now provide an update on our ongoing structural transformation. We have spent 50 years building our networks and growing our portfolio. As a result, we now have the most extensive network of any provider in the industry. We are now focused on optimizing this network to realize our full value potential. This includes advancing our global transformation through DRIVE, our comprehensive program to support long-term profitability and deliver on our fiscal year '25 financial targets.\nDRIVE is how we are executing that strategy, achieving more than $4 billion in annualized structural cost reductions by fiscal year 2025.\nI'm confident I have the full commitment of our executive team, our Leading DRIVE with purpose and a sense of urgency and of Sriram Krishnasamy, our Chief Transformation Officer, who is facilitating the program.\nWe have identified 14 specific focus areas, which we call domains to target for efficiency improvements. Each is led by an executive sponsor and is aligned around a strategic vision for the business. We are measuring success against each domain's FY '25 permanent cost savings target in addition to using clear operational metrics to track financial and service level progress.\nOur focus within DRIVE is in 3 main areas: FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and shared and allocated overhead expenses.\nAt Express, the team is transforming the network to be more agile, efficient and digitally led. An initial priority is to optimize the global air network where we expect to generate approximately $400 million in savings. This work includes deploying digital assets that allow us to efficiently balance our Purple tile airplanes and third-party lift as we build the network of the future.\nWe are also addressing our express pickup and delivery operations globally to improve efficiency. In February, we will implement a new U.S. network design that will improve P&D efficiency and result in cost savings of approximately $300 million annually.\nIn Europe, where we expect over 1/3 of Express' drive savings, we have spent the last several years bringing the networks together.\nWith integration behind us, we have shifted to optimization. We're adjusting our network, deploying route productivity tools and investing in digital capabilities for planning and automation. Additionally, we are rightsizing our intra-Europe air network and improving processes to enhance the end-to-end customer journey. This will all serve to improve both service and profit of our European business.\nNow turning to FedEx Ground. We are focused on every portion of the package life cycle. For instance, in linehaul operations, we are applying new tools, technology and processes to drive increased packages per trailer. Within Ground, we have a dock domain. This team's responsibility is to improve packages per labor hour. In Q2, that metric increased 3.5% year-over-year, and we expect continued improvement as we deploy additional capabilities.\nAcross both the Express and Ground focus areas, we are leveraging our operational insights platform. This provides the foundational data, tools and insights critical not only for delivering DRIVE savings goals but also for sustaining those savings and transforming the way we operate.\nFinally, shared and allocated overhead expenses are a significant opportunity. This includes procurement and digitizing and centralizing support functions. One example of digitizing support functions is our ability to reduce customer service calls by redirecting customers to best-in-class digital applications, a win for FedEx and a win for our customers.\nWithin procurement, we are reducing spend through our operate collaboratively model and creating a central function to optimize our enterprise spend. For example, we are setting up a cross-OpCo initiative to consolidate our contract transportation spend to realize value in the second half of fiscal year '23.\nIn conclusion, there is strong momentum underway as our team focuses on cutting costs immediately and structurally transforming our network.\nWe will continue to provide updates on our DRIVE progress, and we plan to host a DRIVE deep dive call in the first half of calendar 2023 to provide additional details on our ongoing transformation.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, to discuss recent market trends and our commercial strategy in more detail.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon. As expected, the operating environment in the second quarter was challenging. The trends we saw toward the end of the first quarter persisted through November. As a result, we experienced lower demand for FedEx products and services, but we acted with urgency to adjust our network while continuing to deliver for our customers.\nRevenue at FedEx Express was down 6% year-over-year, primarily due to volume and yield softness in Europe and Asia. In Europe, we're making steady progress as volume trends improved quarter-over-quarter.\nI am confident in our momentum as we have a robust sales pipeline in Europe. We are leveraging our faster road network and our unique ability to bundle parcel and freight.\nAs we anticipated, the softening demand created yield pressure, especially in Asia. Despite volume softness, I am pleased with the team's ability to manage volume, share and margin in our trans-Pacific lane.\nAt FedEx Ground, revenue was up 2% due to higher yield driven by fuel surcharges, base rate increases and improved product mix. It was partially offset by lower volumes. We once again delivered strong service levels and best-in-market transit times.\nAt FedEx Freight, we delivered solid performance despite the operating environment beginning to moderate. Pricing discipline across the LTL industry is strong, and we expect the market to remain rational. Revenue was up 8% as the team remains laser-focused on driving improved revenue quality and profitable share growth.\nWhile navigating the current environment, FedEx Freight continues to innovate. We're expanding dimensional capture and piloting dimensional weight-based pricing. We believe this simplified pricing is the future of the LTL industry, and we're leading in this transformation.\nI also wanted to provide an update on our enterprise pricing strategy and the initiatives to improve revenue quality. We remain disciplined. We are focused on growth in the right segment to optimize network profitability. We announced a 6.9% general rate increase in September, and I remain confident in a continued high capture rate. We are also continuing to leverage surcharges to align our pricing to cost. Our recent announcement for demand-based large package and U.S. export fuel surcharge are good proof points.\nI'm also very pleased with the team's progress to create new capabilities. A great example is the partnership between pricing and DataWorks to build a price anomaly detection engine.\nThe team has had success detecting overbilling and correcting invoices before they are sent to our customers. This is a significant customer experience improvement. We are now adapting these capabilities to identify underbilling opportunities, which will increase revenue quality.\nAs we look toward the back half, service improvement has translated into good momentum for our sales team. In addition, we have a robust pipeline aligned with our strategy, which includes small and medium and European segment targets.\nIn Q4, we will be lapping the impact of the beginning of the war in the Ukraine as well as the air integration disruption we experienced in the region. As a result, our year-over-year volume comps will improve as we move through the back half of this fiscal year.\nHowever, in Asia, we do expect to face continued yield pressure due to lower demand for priority services. In the current economic environment, the market is increasingly shifting to deferred services. We have the deferred portfolio to capture the shift in demand, and our DRIVE program will ensure we have the right cost to serve to profitably manage through this market transition.\nIn conclusion, we remain prudent in our expectations for volume and yield in the second half of the fiscal year. That being said, our service value proposition relative to our competition will remain strong. And in fact, our relative market position will improve in the back half of the year. And with that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lenz.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThanks, Brie. I'll start on Slide 16. In the second quarter, we delivered improved alignment between variable costs and lower revenue amid a more challenged volume environment that impacted our profitability. Second quarter revenue was approximately $700 million below the lower end of the range we expected coming into the quarter. Approximately $300 million of this variance was due to an accelerated decline in forwarding revenue at FedEx Logistics.\nThe remaining variance versus our Q2 outlook was driven about half by Express and the balance by Ground and Freight combined. We have moved faster to offset this shortfall with cost reductions, reducing the lag between incremental volume softness and the savings offsets realized. This, combined with an additional $200 million in discrete cost actions, led to improved earnings relative to our Q2 outlook.\nTurning to the Transportation segments. Starting with Express, profitability continues to be pressured. Adjusted operating income declined 65% due to lower volumes as cost reductions lagged accelerating volume declines.\nVolume pressures were partially offset by yield management actions. Package yield grew 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher fuel surcharges and base rates, partially offset by exchange rate impacts.\nYield improvement slowed from Q1 levels across nearly all products and regions. In Ground, operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 130 basis points to 7.1%, supported by yield growth of 13% as higher fuel surcharges, product mix and pricing initiatives drove improvement.\nOur cost reduction actions, combined with solid execution by the ground team to adjust near-term variable costs amidst greater volume declines also supported margin improvement. These factors were partially offset by increased costs, including higher purchase transportation and other operating expenses.\nAnd at Freight, the team continues to drive strong profitability with operating income increasing 32%. This was driven by yield improvement, including higher fuel surcharges, partially offset by decreased shipments as well as higher wage rates.\nTurning to Slide 17. I'd like to build on what you heard from Raj on our near-term cost savings, reviewing our progress by category.\nAs mentioned, we've identified $3.7 billion in discrete cost reductions relative to our plans going into fiscal '23, which is $1 billion higher than our prior projection. Express is where we have the most work to do and where the majority of the reductions are focused. A large portion of those savings is coming from reduced flight frequencies.\nYear-to-date, we've reduced 8 international routes and 32 U.S. domestic routes, while parking 5 additional aircraft. This translates into pulling down U.S. domestic flight hours by 6% and international flight hours down 7% in the second quarter year-over-year.\nMoving to 18. In addition to the expense actions, we are also lowering our FY '23 capital spend forecast by an incremental $400 million to $5.9 billion, which represents an approximate $900 million reduction from our initial plans for the year. With the lower demand environment, we're deliberately deferring and slowing the pace of projects as we maintain the emphasis on using our assets more efficiently and reducing our overall capital intensity.\nOur liquidity remains a source of strength, and we ended the quarter with $4.6 billion in cash. We continue to generate solid cash flows supporting our capital return strategy. We executed a $1.5 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction, which will be completed by the end of this calendar year.\nOur capital return strategy reflects our commitment to reducing capital intensity and creating value for shareholders while continuing to reinvest in FedEx for today and tomorrow.\nProvide additional context for the changes in demand during the first half and what we are planning for in our outlook, on Slide 19, we've shown first half monthly volume trends for our major product categories. Volume declines continued to accelerate across major product categories, both in the U.S. and internationally throughout the second quarter.\nAs we look to the second half of the year, we expect volume declines to begin moderating in Express and Ground by the end of the third quarter with comparisons easing further in the fourth quarter as we lap the onset of softer volumes.\nYield growth will be increasingly pressured as year-over-year fuel surcharge comparisons normalize and customer demand shifts most prominently in Asia.\nThis brings me to our outlook on Slide 20. While we continue to aggressively drive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second half of FY '23. Our current expectation for full year adjusted earnings per share is between $13 and $14.\nOn a quarterly basis, we expect results to follow our historical seasonal pattern with lower earnings in the third quarter versus the second quarter and highest in the fourth quarter.\nSecond quarter adjusted expenses were essentially flat year-over-year as inflation impacts, particularly fuel, offset our activity reductions on an absolute basis.\nAs we move through the second half, we project year-over-year expenses to increasingly decline as our cost initiatives accelerate in conjunction with lapping certain inflationary increases.\nClosing, I'd like to reiterate that the entire team continues to aggressively identify and implement both immediate cost reductions as well as structural cost efficiencies to drive improved performance.\nWith that, we'll open it up for your questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's first quarter earnings conference call. Before we begin, we want to recognize our SEC 8-K was filed earlier than planned due to a technical issue. The first quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stat book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about 1 year.\nJoining us on the call today are members of the media. (Operator Instructions) We want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call such as projections regarding future performance may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.\nFor additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC. Please refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nJoining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer.\nAnd now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, CEO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everyone. I'd like to start today by acknowledging our pre-announced first quarter earnings results and updated outlook we provided last week. Our network capacity did not align with the demand we experienced as the quarter progressed. But as communicated last week, we have taken swift actions to address what's within our control. Getting cost out rapidly is my priority, and today, I will outline why I'm confident in our ability to drive improved performance and profitability through aggressive cost actions.\nBefore providing more details around these actions, let me briefly discuss what happened since we last spoke to you in June. We saw a decline in our volumes during the first quarter, which accelerated in the final weeks. Our softening volumes in Asia and the U.S. were predominantly due to the economy while the shortfall in Europe was both economic- and service-related. Therefore, we had costs in the system for volumes that didn't materialize. While we immediately took action, savings from these cost efforts lagged the volume decline due to the scale of our operations.\nAs a result, while revenue was up 6% year-over-year, these dynamics translated to volumes being down year-over-year at all our transportation segments. The volume decline directly impacted our bottom line, driving total company adjusted operating income down roughly 18% year-over-year.\nNow what matters most is what we are doing about it, and this brings me to our aggressive and decisive plan to reduce costs. I'll speak to you -- I'll speak to our actions in 2 parts: first, our fiscal year '23 steps to immediately reduce costs; and second, our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow transformation strategy to permanently reduce cost and optimize our network. Starting with fiscal year '23, we are prioritizing cost actions to generate $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion of savings, of which about $1 billion will be permanent.\nTaking each key contributor in turn, at FedEx Express, we expect to drive $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion in savings this fiscal year. The largest single expected contributor in fiscal '23 will be the changes we are making to our express air network as we cut global flight hours. This reduction includes 11% of pan-Pacific daily frequencies, 9% of transatlantic daily frequencies and 17% of daily frequencies on the lane between Asia and Europe. As volumes deteriorated later in the quarter, we began making these structural changes to our network. The impact of these initial changes will be fully realized in October, and the benefit of our continued actions will steadily increase throughout the fiscal year.\nWe are also evaluating additional reductions to be implemented post peak. Further, we're taking steps to enhance our ground efficiency, including reducing routes, hours, vehicle rentals and other on-road expenses. For example, in Europe, we are altering ground network routes to improve productivity, leading to a reduction of approximately 11% of routes in the U.K. and 12% in Germany.\nNow turning to FedEx Ground. We expect savings in Ground to be $350 million to $500 million in fiscal '23. Our approach to cutting costs in Ground primarily centers around rationalizing our operations. We are consolidating sorts, which will reduce costs while maintaining service and have canceled several planned ground network capacity projects. And as mentioned last week, we're also reducing select Sunday operations in over 170 stations. Mike will provide more details on our capital plans shortly.\nThe final components of our expected fiscal '23 savings will be from overhead expenses as we rightsize our overall cost structure. These actions include our plans to close nearly 140 FedEx office locations and at least 5 corporate office facilities. Additionally, FedEx Services has stopped all noncritical projects. In total, our overhead reduction actions, including FedEx services, will contribute $350 million to $500 million. We realized nearly $300 million in cost savings from these actions in Q1 and expect approximately another $700 million in Q2, with the remainder of the fiscal '23 savings realized during the second half of the year.\nThe second part of our cost plan is focused on permanent reductions, and we have launched DRIVE, a program supporting our Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy introduced in June. DRIVE is how we execute on that strategy. Our team has already started implementing cost reductions under this program, and this will ultimately enable Network 2.0, the long-term end-to-end trend optimization of our network. Sriram Krishnasamy, our newly appointed Chief Transformation Officer, will facilitate DRIVE and continue reporting directly to me. In total, we expect to take out an additional $4 billion in costs related to DRIVE by fiscal year 2025. To be clear, these are incremental to the fiscal '23 savings I just outlined. These transformational changes will lay the foundation for Network 2.0, which will create an additional $2 billion benefit over the long term.\nIn closing, we are focused on actions we can control as we stabilize our near-term performance and execute against our long-term strategy. I'd like to sincerely thank our highly motivated team for their hard work and dedication to deliver upon the Purple Promise.\nNow let me turn it over to our Chief Customer Officer, Brie Carere, to discuss market trends that underpin our outlook and our commercial strategy in some more detail.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP, Chief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, and good afternoon, everyone. As Raj discussed, during the first quarter, manufacturing, global trade and consumer spending decelerated, particularly late in the quarter and certainly more than we anticipated. As a result, our first quarter volumes were lower than we forecasted. Our current expectations for 2022 U.S. GDP growth and U.S. industrial production forecasts have declined by about 100 basis points since June.\nData shows that U.S. consumer spending has slowed as inflation remains a challenge. Further, consumption is skewed towards services, demonstrated by the fact that in June, excluding auto, the real retail inventory to sales ratio fully recovered to its pre-pandemic level. From October to June, the real inventory to sales ratio, excluding automotive, increased 14 basis points, which was the fastest gain over an 8-month period in the 25-year history of the series.\nAlso, real retail sales, including auto, after growing 4.6% and 10.8% in calendar year '21 and '22, respectively, are now down 3.1% year-over-year through July and are pacing to have the worst decline since The Great Recession.\nTurning to our transportation businesses. I'd like to spend a moment on the dynamics occurring within FedEx Express and most specifically in Asia and Europe. Starting with Asia, our results were impacted by macroeconomic weakness. Our lower demand is consistent with the broader market, with ocean and air freight rates under pressure in recent weeks. A good indicator of how quickly the market changed in Asia is to review the spot rates coming out of Hong Kong and Shanghai. In June and July, spot rates were between 20% and 40% higher year-over-year, respectively. In early August, these rates fell to single digits, and by the end of the month, Shanghai had plummeted to a 10% decline year-over-year, while Hong Kong rates were flat.\nThrough June, which is the latest data available, we have had small market share gains in our Asia region. In Europe, the economy was weaker than we anticipated and service further pressured our results. Our network integration was successfully completed in March, but it is an incredibly complicated effort to combine 2 individual networks of this scale. Throughout the quarter, we continued to refine our standard operating procedures to improve service levels and create momentum across our European division.\nMoving now to FedEx Ground. Revenue growth was driven by higher yields from higher fuel surcharges, base rate increases and improved volume mix. Despite volumes being lower than anticipated, we have held market share in the United States. FedEx Ground has strong service levels, best-in-market transit times and an exciting new picture proof of delivery capability. We are ready to deliver for peak. We will remain nimble in leveraging peak surcharges to balance demand and the capacity of our network as we monitor volume trends.\nAnd at FedEx Freight, momentum continues to build. The Freight team delivered another strong quarter marked by 21% revenue growth. The team continues to drive disciplined execution, focused on revenue quality and profitable share growth. For the company overall, we continue to execute our revenue quality strategy and pursue business that provides attractive yields.\nWe continue to deliver new pricing capabilities, and we've taken recent actions to stay well positioned relative to the market as we approach peak. We have maintained a brisk pace for repricing contracts for the renewals and continue to negotiate strong increases.\nWe just announced a 6.9% general rate increase this coming January in our response to inflationary pressures on our costs. We also announced our new remote area surcharge and peak residential pricing in the United States. In Europe and Asia, we will launch a new handling surcharge as well as [January]. In August, we implemented international fuel surcharge table adjustments for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Fuel surcharges are an important pricing tool. We rigorously monitor fuel prices to ensure that we are appropriately positioned relative to the market.\nWe're moving with speed and agility to reposition our business model for today's operating environment. As you heard from Raj, we had a great -- we have a great opportunity to align costs with volume levels. We are committed to doing this while executing against our commercial strategy and delivering for our customers. Importantly, we're still focused on the longer-term opportunity growing in high-value segments, driving improved service quality and, of course, delivering an outstanding customer experience.\nI am really pleased with how our teams have responded in this dynamic environment, and we are well positioned to deliver during the upcoming peak season. Service is strong and we have a fantastic value proposition.\nWith that, I'll turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Lenz.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie. While revenue was up 6% for the quarter, profitability was challenged with operating income down 18% on an adjusted basis, and adjusted operating margin down 150 basis points year-over-year. At Express, adjusted operating income declined 72% due to lower average daily package and freight volume and increased expenses as cost reductions lagged volume declines. These factors were partially offset by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges. Package yield, including fuel, grew 16% year-over-year.\nTurning to Ground. Operating income increased 3%, primarily due to yield improvement and home delivery volume growth. Yield including fuel grew 12% year-over-year. These factors were partially offset by higher operating expenses, driven by increased purchase transportation and other operating expenses.\nFreight delivered another strong quarter with operating income increasing over 67% as the Freight team continues to execute. This was driven by yield management actions, including higher fuel surcharges. Yield, including the surcharges, grew 27%. This was partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefits as well as lower shipment volumes.\nTo address the changed environment, we're focused on what's within our control and moving with urgency to take costs out of the network. Our team is operating at speed to identify cost-saving opportunities and accelerate for implementation.\nThe $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion fiscal '23 savings we're targeting are relative to our initial plans heading into the year. The majority of this year's savings will come from Express where the demand change has been most pronounced. We expect about $1 billion of our fiscal '23 savings to be permanent in nature, with slight reduction as the largest component along with corporate and back office costs. These permanent cost reductions were not part of the Deliver Today, Innovate for Tomorrow strategy we shared in June, which is about how we structurally optimize our networks. These reductions are directly related to flexing in a changed environment with a view to build back differently in the future.\nAs Raj mentioned, we remain committed to the profit improvement objectives we shared at our June investors meeting. We have launched efforts to accelerate initiatives, identify incremental opportunities and implement metrics to track progress under the DRIVE program.\nSo next, I'll give more details on the targeted $4 billion savings by fiscal '25 enabled by DRIVE. About $1.4 billion of the total will come from the FedEx Express operating expenses. Four largest areas of opportunity we are actively advancing are: first, restructuring the air network by reducing routes and more efficiently deploying crews, aircraft and commercial line haul; next, optimization of sort, surface line haul and on-road design to improve efficiency, asset utilization and service; next, driving efficiencies of Europe, as we've discussed previously; and lastly, harmonizing global clearance processes to lower cost.\nAbout $1.1 billion of the total will come from FedEx Ground operating expenses via dock productivity initiatives, network and line haul efficiencies and reduced liability costs. And approximately $1.5 billion will come from shared and allocated overhead expenses led by procurement savings, back-office automation and infrastructure modernization, increased deployment of digital self-service and further consolidation of shared service functions.\nMoving to our capital spending plans. We've reduced our forecast for capital spend for fiscal 2023 to $6.3 billion compared to our prior $6.8 billion forecast. We're intensely focused on allocating capital to the most attractive ROIC initiatives. Our liquidity remains a source of strength as we ended the quarter with $6.9 billion in cash. And based on our cash flows and liquidity, we remain committed to our capital return strategy, including our plan to repurchase $1.5 billion of stock in fiscal 2023. We expect to purchase $1 billion in the second quarter.\nOur capital return strategy reflects our confidence in our business despite the headwinds we're currently navigating. We have significant flexibility to maintain our balanced capital allocation and preserve a resilient balance sheet.\nNow turning to second quarter guidance. While we continue to drive aggressive cost reduction actions, we expect business conditions to remain challenging in the second quarter. As a result and consistent with the update we provided last week, currently expecting revenue of between $23.5 billion to $24 billion in the fiscal second quarter, and adjusted earnings per share, excluding costs related to business optimization and realignment initiatives of $2.75 or greater in the second quarter.\nFor the remainder of the year, while we are not providing guidance, given current uncertainties, our plan is based on an expectation that the weak trends we saw in late Q1 will persist across our major geographies. This is embedded in our guidance for the second quarter and driving our cost takeout initiatives for the fiscal year.\nLonger term, we remain committed to our fiscal 2025 targets for operating margin improvement, return on invested capital and capital intensity that we shared with you in June. We're leaning more heavily into cost actions to get to those goals.\nThe start of the year presented greater-than-expected challenges, but I can assure you that we are moving with urgency to address these pressures while remaining focused on creating long-term value by prioritizing revenue quality, expanding margins and elevating financial returns through profitable growth and reduced capital intensity.\nAnd with that, we'll open it up for your questions.",

I'd like to start by thanking Team FedEx for continuing to move the world forward amid unanticipated challenges. This was recently displayed during Operation Fly Formula, where, in response to the critical shortage rippling across the United States, we have moved hundreds of thousands of pounds of baby formula from Europe to the U.S. And this weekend, our team will move 52 tons of medical relief to Poland for Ukrainian refugees in coordination with Direct Relief International.\nNow turning to our financials. I'm proud to share that in the face of an increasingly challenging global backdrop, we finished fiscal '22 with our highest-ever revenue of $93.5 billion and adjusted operating income of $6.9 billion, both up 11% year-over-year. This is a testament to our value proposition and continued execution against our long-term strategy.\nAs I shared on the last call, we have worked through many network inefficiencies caused by labor shortages. Although wage rates remain higher than this time last year, they are stabilizing. Still, COVID-related conditions slowed global recovery and pressured second half performance.\nWhile Q4 volumes were down year-over-year at all our transportation segments compared to an extraordinary fiscal year '21, we successfully implemented strategic actions that drove double-digit yield improvement across the board, with Express composite yield per package up 20%, Ground up 11% and Freight yield per shipment up 28%.\nWe remain focused on revenue quality as one of the key levers to help offset the ongoing macroeconomic pressures and driving improved margins going forward.\nTurning to Express. Even in the face of higher operating expenses related to inflationary pressures, we delivered improved quarterly operating income and revenue. Thoughtful execution of our new revenue management actions has allowed us to overcome headwinds from COVID lockdowns in Asia and geopolitical uncertainty in Europe.\nAt FedEx Ground, we experienced modest revenue growth driven by higher yields as a result of pricing actions and improved volume mix. Volumes declined year-over-year due to our efforts to constrain economy volume as well as lower customer demand.\nWe will continue to leverage opportunities to maximize utilization of existing facilities through operational adjustments, including multiple preload and relay operations. Ground operating expenses continued to be pressured by higher purchase transportation and wage rates, although we see these pressures stabilizing.\nWe continue to proactively address labor availability head on through multiple levers as we increase the front-line retention and refined the recently launched package handler scheduling tool, will not only ensure we have the right level of staffing for every sort based on volume, will ensure a workforce that is safe, efficient and highly engaged to stay and grow with the company.\nAdditionally, we are implementing several technology-based initiatives that are driving increased productivity in our line haul and dock operations as well as continuing our efforts to optimize the last mile. We're seeing early benefit from these efforts, with productivity of Ground dock operations improving 6% in Q4 compared to Q3.\nFedEx Freight once again delivered outstanding results with fourth quarter operating margin of almost 22% driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. A job well done to Lance Moll on his first full fiscal year as Freight CEO and to our Freight and Commercial teams for their solid execution.\nAs we look ahead to fiscal year '23, we expect the macroeconomic risks both in the U.S. and globally to continue to put stress on supply chains and trade. Brie will cover this in more detail shortly. Let me now reaffirm confidence in our key strategies.\nAs CEO, my focus is maximizing total shareholder return driven by improved revenue quality, higher margins and a balanced capital allocation strategy, which Mike will provide more color on shortly. Importantly, our foundational long-term investments have set the stage one of the strong year, driven by focus on lowering our cost to serve.\nA great example of where we are going to lower our cost to serve is in Europe. The integrated network and consolidation of many flights into our Charles de Gaulle hub allows us to improve operational efficiency and enhances our network. For instance, since April, the number of European airports we service from CDG increased by 71%, but the number of flights intra-Europe was reduced by 13%. We're confident that actions like this will drive bottom line improvement in fiscal year '23.\nAs we move forward, I'm honored to lead our global team who enable FedEx to deliver what's next. And speaking of what's next, we are looking forward to hosting our investors in Memphis in a few days. Our goal for this 2-day event is for attendees to leave with a deep understanding of our strategies, including financial targets and priorities and how we plan to execute.\nNow before I turn it over to Brie, I'd like to say a few words about FedEx Express' President and CEO, Don Colleran, whose 40-year career with FedEx has been nothing but short of exceptional. As one of the pioneers of our international business, he helped lay a foundation for the significant growth in that sector of the FedEx portfolio. Since assuming his current role in 2019, he's launched new capabilities for our customers and led our global FedEx Express team through some of the most challenging times, including the COVID pandemic.\nAs announced in March, Don will move into CEO Executive Advisor role in September of this year in support of Richard Smith's transition to the CEO of FedEx Express and will retire from FedEx in December. Don, we appreciate your service and countless contributions to this company. We wish you nothing but the best in your well-deserved next chapter.\nAnd now let me turn it over to Brie, who last week was named Chief Customer Officer in a move that aligns several teams under her leadership to give us even greater focus on our commercial strategy and our end-to-end customer experience. So Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nChief Customer Officer & Co-President and Co-CEO of FedEx Services, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj. It's an honor and a privilege to take on this responsibility to deliver for our customers and drive quality growth for our shareholders. I'd like to reflect on fiscal year '22, then drill down to fourth quarter '22 revenues. Finally, I will discuss the outlook for fiscal year 2023.\nFiscal year 2022 was another year of change for FedEx. The operating environment was quite challenging, requiring flexibility and creativity on the part of our management, staff and front-line team members to ensure we deliver for our customers. I am proud of how our team rose to this challenge. We executed against our commercial strategy and remained intently focused on revenue quality across the business.\nIn the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenue increased 8% year-over-year. Revenue management actions drove our growth, which was partially offset by lower shipment demand. FedEx Ground and FedEx Express generated year-over-year revenue growth of 4% and 6%, respectively, despite lower volume levels.\nAt FedEx Ground, yield management actions affecting our FedEx Ground Economy service is the primary factor behind volume declines, with FedEx Ground Economy volumes down 36%. In contrast, our commercial and our home delivery volumes declined 1% due to macroeconomic conditions.\nAt FedEx Express, COVID lockdowns, geopolitical uncertainty and slower economic growth contributed to package volume decline of 11%. In some areas, we also selectively reduced volume to ensure we could deliver the service that is expected of FedEx.\nFedEx Freight had a banner revenue quality quarter, growing yield of 28%. FedEx Freight's market-leading value proposition, combined with the disciplined execution of our sales team, drove these exceptional results. The FedEx Freight team continues to do a phenomenal job at managing revenue quality.\nNow let me take a moment to discuss 2023. We anticipate consumers will keep spending, and their spending will continue tilting towards services from goods. We expect more consumers to return to stores. With this backdrop, we do expect pressure on B2C volumes.\nThrough May, industrial activity has been solid. But today's June flash of PMI was a sharp decline. Further, after a strong build late last year and early this year, inventory restocking is slowing. This will dampen Freight demand.\nOur international businesses continue to navigate a dynamic environment. Global trade growth has slowed from disruptions related to lockdowns in China and the conflict in Ukraine, limiting the flow of goods and reducing international export volumes. We do anticipate supply chain disruptions throughout the fiscal year.\nWe continue to expect passenger airlines to fully recover to pre-COVID levels, and that, that recovery will take some time. Belly capacity on passenger airlines is expected to remain constrained in fiscal year 2023, resulting in a pricing environment still favorable to FedEx if a little less than before.\nThe Europe to Asia lane is estimated to recover in Q1 calendar year '24, and belly capacity on trans-Pacific airlines is estimated to recover in Q3 calendar year '24. Commercial capacity between Europe and Asia is not expected to recover until Q1 of calendar year 2025.\nOur fiscal '23 forecast assumes a normalized economic environment. The factors I discussed earlier have been incorporated into our volume forecast. Our volume forecast has low single-digit volume growth.\nWe've also prepared plans to manage through a slowing economic environment, if required. We will take costs and revenue actions to mitigate impact of further economic softening, incorporating the lessons learned over the last 2 extraordinary years.\nIn fiscal '23, we will execute a very targeted growth strategy. We will prioritize revenue quality and our intent on pursuing business that provides attractive yields on our assets.\nWe expect the pricing environment will remain rational here in the United States and also around the world. We believe that the systemic changes, especially e-commerce peak surcharges, are durable changes for the industry. We are closely monitoring both inflation and fuel prices. And as a reminder, we adjust our fuel surcharge weekly in response to market rates.\nI am confident we have the tools to get -- to continue getting inflation plus pricing. Strong revenue quality is possible because we will target customers who value FedEx's unique capabilities.\nLet me talk about 4 of our favorite capabilities. First, we're the only provider to bundle our parcel and LTL portfolio. Second, FedEx Ground has 2 very significant advantages over our primary competitor. FedEx Ground is faster to more locations than UPS Ground, and FedEx Ground delivers on Sunday while UPS does not. Third, we continue to evolve our digital portfolio. Express and Ground are the first nationwide carriers to announce we will provide a picture proof of delivery for every U.S. residential delivery that doesn't require a signature. And fourth, we have a robust intercontinental offering for both B2B and B2B segments. FedEx provides fabulous solutions for the world's manufacturing, health care, high-tech and e-commerce customers.\nIn closing, this has been an extraordinary year for FedEx. We generated strong growth, executed on our revenue quality strategy and overcame industry-wide challenges. Our plan for fiscal '23 incorporates a dynamic environment, and we have the right strategies and the right team in place to deliver profitable growth and margin improvement.\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. We had a strong fourth quarter, with adjusted earnings per share improving 37% year-over-year, revenue increasing 8% and consolidated adjusted operating margin expanding 50 basis points to 9.2%. These results reflect the outcome of the revenue management emphasis Brie described as we aggressively adjust to mitigate continued inflationary cost pressures.\nNotable fourth quarter year-over-year expense items included higher self-insurance costs, primarily at Ground, as well as a roughly $130 million impact from higher rates for both wages and purchased transportation. Offsetting these headwinds were favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $300 million and last year's $100 million contribution to Yale University to support our carbon neutrality goals.\nWith that overview of consolidated results, I'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. Ground reported a 4% increase in revenue with operating income down approximately $260 million, resulting in an operating margin of 10%. Self-insurance expense increased approximately $200 million, reflecting a higher loss experience as well as an adjustment to the reserve for the projected cost of claims. We have multiple initiatives underway to mitigate the cost of risk, including new vehicle safety technology and driver certification standards in our service provider agreements.\nThe strong 11% yield improvement at Ground was not enough to offset that headwind, along with higher cost of wages and purchased transportation. Looking forward, the continued revenue quality emphasis in conjunction with specific productivity and workforce initiatives will drive improved profitability. Stabilization of the labor market will also support further traction in these areas.\nAt Express, adjusted operating income increased by nearly 10% year-over-year, with operating margin improving by 20 basis points to 8.2%. This improvement was driven by higher yields, including the favorable net impact of fuel and lower variable compensation, which more than offset volume declines.\nIn addition, crew cost per flight hour have been further elevated as operating the network has had to accommodate not only COVID protocols, but also to the routing changes to avoid layovers and locations with stricter COVID regulations as well as conflict airspace.\nFreight had an incredible finish to the year, with revenue for the fourth quarter increasing 23% and operating profit growing 67%. These outstanding results are a testimony to Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth as we build on our strengths as the leader in the LTL market.\nTurning to FY '23. We are projecting continued momentum with a range of 9% to 19% adjusted earnings per share improvement. We expect margin expansion at all of our transportation segments on an adjusted basis as we execute on key priorities, including enhanced revenue quality beyond inflation, technology-driven operational efficiency improvements and increasing utilization of our assets.\nAs we begin fiscal 2023, we are seeing the lower customer demand trends we experienced in the fourth quarter continue into June and expect first quarter volumes will continue to be pressured. In addition, Express continues to experience flight constraints due to crew COVID protocols, as has been highlighted industry-wide.\nWe do expect both Express air network efficiency and year-over-year volume comparisons across all of our transportation segments to strengthen as we go through the fiscal year. In addition, our outlook includes an approximately $450 million noncash pension headwind due to lower asset returns realized in fiscal 2022. This is all below the line expense that will be recognized evenly over the year.\nOur retirement plan's operating expense will be relatively flat as lower pension expense will be offset by higher 401(k) expense. And as a reminder, our primary U.S. pension plans were closed to new entrants beginning in 2020, and we introduced a new 401(k) plan with a higher company match in January of 2022. Our projection for the full year effective tax rate is approximately 24% prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments and costs related to business optimization initiatives.\nTurning to capital allocation. Our fiscal 2022 adjusted free cash flow of $3.6 billion supported the repurchase of approximately $2.2 billion of our stock and $800 million of dividend payments. In addition, we funded $500 million in voluntary pension contributions and ended the year with a solid $6.9 billion in cash. As we look to fiscal 2023, we remain focused on driving total shareholder return and thoughtfully allocating capital.\nFirst, we will continue to invest in attractive ROIC initiatives. Fiscal 2023 capital expenditures are projected to be roughly the same as the $6.8 billion invested during fiscal '22, which came in lower than our initial $7.2 billion estimate as supply chain considerations extended time lines. Facility investment at Ground will decline as well aircraft expenditures at Express. Offsetting that is increased investment in vehicle replacement, including rollout of our vehicle electrification initiatives as well as additional automation projects. We project fiscal 2023 CapEx as a percent of revenue to be under 7% compared to 7.2% for fiscal 2022.\nNext, we expect to repurchase an additional $1.5 billion of stock in the first half of fiscal 2023. And of course, as we announced last week, we are raising our dividend by over 50%, which increases our adjusted payout ratio to over 20%. These significant shareholder return advances reflect confidence in our continued execution and ability to adapt to the evolving market. And lastly, I'd add we are projecting $800 million of voluntary pension contributions to the U.S. plans.\nSo we entered fiscal 2023 with a strong foundation for driving improved profitability and returns. We are mindful of the uncertainty across many fronts, including the pace of global economic activity, inflation, energy prices, additional pandemic developments and further geopolitical risks. We're actively adjusting to these changing circumstances.\nIn closing, we are focused on delivering shareholder value by driving profitable revenue growth, expanding margins, lowering our capital intensity and improving returns to shareholders. And we look forward to sharing additional insights about our plans for this year and beyond at our investor meeting next week here in Memphis.\nNow we'll be happy to address your questions.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I will turn the call over to Mickey Foster, Vice President of Investor Relations for FedEx Corporation. Please go ahead.\n\nMickey Foster\n\nVP of IR, FedEx Corporation\n\nGood afternoon, and welcome to FedEx Corporation's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. The third quarter earnings release, Form 10-Q and stack book are on our website at fedex.com. This call is being streamed from our website where the replay will be available for about 1 year. Joining us on the call today are members of the media. (Operator Instructions)\nI want to remind all listeners that FedEx Corporation desires to take advantage of our safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Certain statements in this conference call, such as projections regarding future performance, may be considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act. Such forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For additional information on these factors, please refer to our press releases and filings with the SEC.\nPlease refer to the Investor Relations portion of our website at fedex.com for a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures discussed on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and COO; Mike Lenz, Executive Vice President and CFO; and Brie Carere, Executive VP, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer. And now Raj will share his views on the quarter.\n\nRajesh Subramaniam\n\nPresident, COO & Director, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Mickey, and good afternoon, everybody. First and foremost, our thoughts are with those affected by the ongoing violence in Ukraine. The safety of our team members in Ukraine is our utmost priority, and we are providing them with financial assistance and various resources for support. We have suspended all services in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. Additionally, we are helping to move relief to Ukraine, and we have provided more than $1.5 million in humanitarian aid.\nTurning to Q3. Execution of our strategies resulted in substantially higher operating income for the quarter as Team FedEx delivered yet another outstanding peak season. December 2021 was our most profitable December in FedEx history. Our ability to handle the influx of packages was years in the making as we've taken deliberate steps to enhance our unparalleled network and support of customers large and small.\nWe have fundamentally changed our performance as we handled increased e-commerce volume during peak and set a new precedent for peak seasons moving forward. Having said that, we are laser focused on improving our margins. You'll hear us talk more about this today and then more specifically at our upcoming Investor Day.\nEven with the successful execution of peak, the new year brought new challenges, mostly driven by Omicron. This affected our business in 2 ways: first, we experienced staffing shortages, particularly in our air operations. In January alone, the absentee rate of our crew due to Omicron was over 15%, which caused significant flight disruptions. Second, our customers experienced Omicron-driven staffing shortages, which reduced demand for our services, especially in U.S. domestic and European markets. Both of those factors resulted in softer-than-expected volume levels, especially in January. We estimate the effect of Omicron-driven volume softness in our Q3 results was approximately $350 million.\nWhile it was significant, it was also temporary and we have seen volume rebound from January levels. Even with these challenges, FedEx Express delivered strong adjusted operating income growth of 27% year-over-year. Speaking of the Express team, we announced that after nearly 40 years of distinguished service, Don Colleran, President and CEO of FedEx Express, will retire later this year and named Richard Smith, current Executive Vice President of Global Support and Regional President of Americas at FedEx Express, as a successor. We'll have much more to say about Don and his countless contributions to the business during our call in June.\nFedEx Freight once again delivered strong results with third quarter operating income nearly tripling year-over-year, driven by a continued focus on revenue quality. Turning to FedEx Ground. Operating costs continue to be challenged by the competitive labor environment now primarily manifesting in increased labor rates. We estimate the total impact of approximately $210 million at ground in the third quarter, which is significantly lower than what we saw in Q1 and Q2 as we have seen substantial improvement in labor availability (inaudible)\nWith the stabilization in the labor environment, I'm pleased to share that we have successfully unwound network adjustments that were necessary to provide service but cost inefficiencies. Staffing levels and the rapid acceleration in labor costs have stabilized and our network is operating at normal levels. Despite improvement in the labor headwind, volume levels in Q3 were softer than we had previously forecasted, in part due to Omicron surge slowing customer demand. As such, we expect our second half Ground margins will be lower than our previous expectations and not reach double digits.\nOver the years, FedEx Ground has built a strong foundation to serve B2B and small and medium customers with an unmatched value proposition. As a result, we have grown market share in these segments and they remain strong priorities for the future. And then more than 3 years ago, we built upon this foundation and embarked on a strategy that positioned FedEx squarely in the center of the fast-growing e-commerce market with a differentiated portfolio and a diversified customer base. This included a period of strategically investing in our network to meet growing market demand.\nLet me note here that this strategy is different than what our primary competitor has pursued. By building on our current base of business and making those prior investments in our network to facilitate growth, we are in a position to generate improved operating profit and margins. We saw this potential in our financial results for December prior to the surge of Omicron.\nAnd moving forward, our financial performance will be further enhanced by maximizing existing assets, improving capital utilization and leveraging technologies that facilitate optimization of our existing physical capacity and staffing.\nAs we prepare to close fiscal year '22, permit me a moment to share what's on the horizon for FedEx as we continue to focus on margin expansion and shareholder return. In addition to the opportunity to enhance performance at Ground that I just discussed, we have other levers for profitable growth, which include: number one, driving improved results in Europe; number two, increasing collaboration and efficiency to optimize our networks, lower our cost to serve and enhance return on capital; and number three, unlocking new value through digital innovation. Of course, we'll do this in an environment of strong revenue quality management.\nOur International business, particularly Europe, remains a big profit opportunity. Air network integration remains on track for the end of the month to complete the physical integration of TNT into FedEx Express and enable full physical interoperability of these networks, both in the air and on the road. Paris CDG airport will serve as the main hub for all European and intercontinental flights. Liege will connect specific large European markets and ensure we have the flexibility to scale our operations in response to market needs, thus enabling us to focus on international growth.\nOur expanded collaboration across operating companies will utilize our air and ground networks in a smarter and more calculated manner. For example, FedEx Freight trucks have traveled more than 7 million miles while operating on behalf of FedEx Ground this fiscal year. FedEx Freight has also provided FedEx Ground with intermodal containers, which have already been dispatched more than 36,000 times. We'll continue to comprehensively look at all our assets and our network to put the right package in the right network and the right cost to serve.\nAdditionally, we are unlocking value through digital innovation, our accelerated integration of data-driven technologies that will drive increased productivity in our linehaul and dock operations as well as in the last mile. Enhanced sortation technology will be operational at FedEx Ground in hundreds of facilities fired as we speak. It will increase upstream efficiencies, enabling managers to do better balance and planned sortation operations, thereby unlocking key capacity. For example, during Cyber Week, this technology helped keep 1.9 million ground economy packages out of constrained sorts.\nWe're also modernizing the planning and staffing of our dock operations as well as the systems, training and technology that maximizes productivity on every sort. One such example is a recently rolled out package handler scheduling technology that will help ensure the right staffing levels for every sort and every facility across the Ground network. This will improve dock productivity. And when combined with a focus on employee retention, it will enable us to significantly reduce the cost of turnover and strategically target recruiting spend when and where necessary.\nFor last mile, we continue to improve upon the optimization technology already implemented to enable service providers to make real-time decisions that enhance their business' daily efficiency. These ongoing investments in automation and technology have helped FedEx build the most flexible and responsive network in the industry and will enable us to improve our margins.\nIn closing, we have the networks, the strategy and the right team in place as we deliver financial returns and drive shareholder value for years to come. With that, let me turn it over to Brie.\n\nBrie A. Carere\n\nExecutive VP and Chief Marketing & Communications Officer, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Raj. Good afternoon, everyone. Several macroeconomic forces, including the tragic conflict in Ukraine, uncertainty around the pandemic, a tight labor market, supply chain disruptions, high energy prices and inflationary pressure have dampened the current GDP outlook globally and for the United States. Last week, we lowered our economic outlook. U.S. GDP is now expected to increase 3.4% in calendar year 2022, revised down from 3.7%, and our outlook is 2.3% in calendar year 2023, with consumer spending tilting towards services and B2B growth supported by inventory rebuilding.\nGlobal GDP growth is expected to be 3.5% in calendar year 2022, previously 4.1% and it will be 3.1% in calendar year 2023. Growth will be driven by the release of pent-up demand for services while investment demand and inventory restocking support global manufacturing and trade. Given the tremendous fluidity of the macroeconomic environment, we will continue to update our outlook. Our teams are ready to adjust plans, as required, to drive margin improvement despite the dynamic environment in which we operate.\nWith fuel prices increasing around the world, today, we announced a fuel surcharge increase effective April 4 for FedEx Express, Ground and Freight. Additional details can be found on fedex.com. The change in economic outlook does not change our confidence that e-commerce will continue to drive strong parcel market growth. We believe the e-commerce growth rate in the United States will be in the mid- to high single digits for the next 3 to 4 years.\nWe will continue to build differentiated value propositions to achieve market-leading pricing in all our customer segments, including e-commerce, our small and medium customers and our commercial B2B business. We are very pleased with the results of our revenue quality strategy and know we have a great opportunity to increase the flow-through to margin expansion. In the third quarter, revenue growth was 10% year-over-year, with double-digit yield improvement for FedEx Express and FedEx Freight, close behind with FedEx Ground at 9% year-over-year yield improvement.\nIn the United States, our package revenue grew 9% in Q3 on strong yield improvement of 10%. We executed on our peak pricing strategy in the month of December, delivering more than $250 million in peak surcharge revenue. Softness in parcel volumes came predominantly from constraining FedEx Ground economy and the effects of Omicron on both our network and on our customers.\nThe focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth drove outstanding results for FedEx Freight this quarter. For the quarter, revenue increased 23% year-over-year, driven by a 19% increase in revenue per shipment. Additionally, FedEx Freight Direct continues to gain great momentum as an e-commerce solution for heavy bulky items with phenomenal growth in Q3 year-over-year.\nOur international businesses are navigating a dynamic environment. Capacity constraints continue to be a reality. At this point, valet capacity on Trans-Atlantic passenger airlines is expected to recover faster than Trans-Pacific. Passenger airline capacity is not expected to fully recover to pre-COVID levels until 2024 or even later across our largest global trade lanes.\nScarce capacity on international lanes and strong demand out of Asia is resulting in a continued favorable pricing environment. With the completion of our integrated air network at the end of this month, we have 1 European air network and 1 road network in and out of Europe. Our international portfolio of services contains the best European road network, the broadest U.S. next-day coverage and a combined parcel and freight offering that no one else in the market has. As a result of the integration, we will be able to offer improved transit times, earlier delivery and later pickup services to more customers in more locations.\nSeven new countries will now be connected on a next-day basis within Europe, while 14 countries will be expanding our new delivery coverage. In several countries, this will be the first time we have introduced next-day service to the rest of Europe. We will leverage the expanded European portfolio to improve international profitability, drive revenue growth and gain market share.\nIn addition to the improvements in our European value proposition, we have made significant strides to enhance our digital solutions as well. In January, we enhanced our tracking service based on an advanced machine learning and artificial intelligence model developed by FedEx DataWorks. This new experience delivers greater estimated delivery date accuracy, including updates for early or delayed shipments through all tracking channels. This improves both the shipper and the recipient experience, and it will reduce calls to customer service.\nAdditionally, our new modernized FedEx Ship Manager, which is our online shipping application, has now been rolled out in more than 153 countries. In January, we began introducing customers to it in the United States and Canada. FedEx Ship Manager is the primary shipping application for our small and medium customer segment. We believe a market-leading digital portfolio will enable FedEx to continue to take market share in this very profitable segment.\nIn summary, we remain optimistic about Q4 and beyond, and we'll continue to deliver on our market-leading value proposition. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike for his remarks.\n\nMichael C. Lenz\n\nExecutive VP & CFO, FedEx Corporation\n\nThank you, Brie, and good afternoon, everyone. After a strong start to the third quarter with the most profitable December in company history, January was significantly influenced by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and its negative effect on our operations and the macro environment. These challenges subsided during February, resulting in third quarter adjusted operating income of $1.5 billion, up 37% year-over-year on an adjusted basis.\nThere are a number of factors influencing our third quarter results for both this year and last year that I will cover. As Raj explained the effects on our operations, I will give further context for the financial implications. First, labor market conditions, although much improved, once again had a significant effect on our results at an estimated $350 million year-over-year, which was primarily experienced at Ground. For the third quarter, that was primarily due to higher rates for both purchase transportation and wages. Labor availability-driven network inefficiencies were significantly less of a factor in the third quarter compared to earlier in the year.\nThe implications from the Omicron variant surge reduced third quarter operating income by an estimated $350 million, predominantly at Express, as it influenced customer demand and pressured our operations, resulting in constrained capacity, network disruptions and lower volumes and revenue.\nThe third quarter had favorable year-over-year comparisons for variable compensation of approximately $380 million, including the onetime Express hourly bonus last year and significantly less impactful winter weather that (inaudible) to $310 million.\nWith that overview of the consolidated results of the third quarter, I'll turn to the highlights for each of our transportation segments. Ground reported a 10% increase in revenue year-over-year, with operating income down approximately $60 million and an operating margin at 7.3%. While pressures from constrained labor markets began subsiding, the effect was still significant at an estimated $210 million year-over-year, predominantly due to the higher purchase transportation and wage rates.\nIn addition, our volume was softer than expected due to the Omicron variant surge slowing customer demand. A 9% yield improvement partially offset these headwinds, and our teams remain very focused on improving ground performance, as Raj outlined earlier.\nExpress adjusted operating income increased by 27% year-over-year, driven by higher yields and a net fuel benefit, with adjusted operating margin increasing by 100 basis points to 5.8%. Express results also benefited in the third quarter from $285 million of lower variable compensation as well as much less severe winter weather.\nThe strong results were partially offset by the headwinds I mentioned earlier, with the Omicron surge having the largest effect, especially during January, of an estimated $240 million. Team member absences primarily among our pilot severely disrupted operations, requiring many flight cancellations and further constraining capacity. Additionally, during this time, the Omicron surge reduced customer demand in many parts of the world.\nFreight had another outstanding quarter, delivering an operating margin of 15%, 850 basis points higher year-over-year, and revenue for the third quarter increased 23% with operating income up over 180% despite the pressures from higher purchase transportation rates and wages. And for the first time in Freight's history, they realized sequential operating income and operating margin improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter. This is all thanks to Freight's continued focus on revenue quality and profitable share growth.\nTurning to the balance sheet. We ended our quarter with $6.1 billion in cash and are targeting over $3 billion in adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2022. As I emphasized last quarter, our stronger cash flow provides extensive flexibility as we continue to focus on balanced capital allocation. As such, I'm pleased to share the accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter was completed during Q3 with 6.1 million shares delivered under the ASR agreement. Total repurchases during fiscal '22 are nearly 9 million shares or 3% of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year.\nThe decrease in outstanding shares resulting from the ASR benefited third quarter results by $0.06 per diluted share. Also during the quarter, we made a $250 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. pension plan and have funded $500 million year-to-date.\nNow turning to what's ahead. We are affirming our full year adjusted EPS range at $20.50 to $21.50. The operating and business environment uncertainty I mentioned in December did materialize to a greater degree than anticipated during Q3, but we have navigated those challenges and project a solid finish to our fiscal year. Labor-related network and efficiency effects have diminished and the wage rate component should become less of a headwind as we lap the onset of labor rate increases in the fourth quarter. Lastly, variable compensation expense will be a tailwind as it was in Q3.\nTurning to capital spending. We have lowered our FY '22 capital spending forecast from $7.2 billion to $7 billion. Much of the change is driven by extended time lines resulting from supply chain considerations. While we are still developing our FY '23 plans, our focus remains on lowering our capital intensity while investing in strategic initiatives to drive returns. We are highly focused on ensuring our capital investments generate returns to drive further growth in earnings and cash flows.\nLastly, our projection for the full year effective tax rate is now 22% to 23%, prior to the mark-to-market retirement plan adjustments. While we are confident in our ability to deliver a strong fourth quarter, uncertainty remains across many fronts, including additional pandemic developments, the labor market, inflation, high energy prices and further geopolitical risk and the potential effects on the pace and timing of global economic activity. We continue to monitor these trends and adjust accordingly.\nWith that, we are all very much looking forward to sharing additional background in our upcoming investor meeting on June 28 and 29 in Memphis. Mickey and the Investor Relations team will soon provide specifics on logistics, and now we will be happy to address your questions.",

Joining us on the call today are Raj Subramaniam, President and CEO; Brie Carere, Executive Vice President and Chief Customer Officer; and John Dietrich, Executive Vice President and CFO. Now I will turn the call over to Raj.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThank you, Jenny. We have only one week left in peak season, and I want to extend my sincere thank you to our frontline workers, pilots, and all of Team FedEx as we approach the finish line. These individuals are out there working hard to deliver a successful peak for our customers, making every FedEx experience outstanding. Before I turn to our Q2 results, I also want to acknowledge that our thoughts and prayers remain with those at UPS, along with the families and community affected by the recent tragedy. We are working closely with Boeing and the FAA to ensure the safety of our own MD-11 fleet, which we will discuss later on the call. Now, let's review our performance in the quarter.\nIn Q2, we provided excellent service to our customers, won new business in high-value verticals, and delivered strong results: high single-digit revenue growth, margin expansion, and high-teens adjusted EPS growth. Quite remarkably, we did this while navigating multiple external headwinds, including the unexpected grounding of our MD-11 fleet, nationwide air traffic constraints, weakness in the industrial economy, and, of course, the impact of global trade policy changes. We're extremely pleased with our Q2 performance, especially in the face of these challenges. It's a direct effect of the rigor we have embedded into our culture over the past several years and the resulting transformation from Network 2.0, Tricolor, and structural cost reductions, all enabled by data and technology. We're demonstrating the resilience and flexibility we have built into our network, and our ongoing efforts to reduce structural costs are leading to significant improvements in profitability.\nWe remain on track to spin off FedEx Freight on 1 June 2026, as a separately listed public company with the best value proposition in the industry. We recently appointed Marshall Witt as CFO of FedEx Freight. Marshall brings significant external public company experience, having served as a CFO of TD SYNNEX for the past 12 years. He also has deep industry and company expertise from his 15 years previously working at FedEx Freight, primarily within the finance organization. FedEx Freight's entire executive leadership team is now in place, and the team is moving quickly to prepare for the separation. Our conviction in the potential value that will be unlocked from this spin-off is stronger than ever. Turning to our consolidated Q2 results, revenue was up 7% year over year, driven by yield and volume strength across our US Domestic Package Services.\nWe achieved our targeted transformation-related savings and grew adjusted operating income by 17%. Federal Express Corporation, or FEC, delivered another quarter of strong operating leverage. On an 8% year-over-year increase in FEC revenue, we grew adjusted operating income by 24% and expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points. Nearly half of our revenue growth was driven by B2B services, an important enabler of increased profitability. This marked our fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year adjusted operating margin expansion at FEC. In line with ongoing LTL industry trends, freight results remain pressured, driven primarily by lower volumes, partially offset by higher weight and revenue per shipment. This is the result of our sustained focus on maintaining strong revenue quality. Given the strength of our Q2 results and our updated assumptions for the second half, we are raising our adjusted EPS outlook to $17.80-19.\nBrie and John will detail the underlying assumptions shortly. We are demonstrating our ability to execute well in any environment, reflecting the progress of our network, organizational, and digital transformation efforts. This quarter truly showcased the importance of network integration and optimization, along with the power of a resilient industrial network. Both shifting global trade patterns and the unexpected grounding of our MD-11 fleet required significant changes to our network, which we implemented swiftly and successfully. To that end, let me provide a quick update on how we flexed our network during the quarter. From a global trade perspective, we reduced our purple tail trans-Pacific Asia-bound capacity by about 25% year-over-year. We also decreased our third party, or white tail capacity, by nearly 35%. We continue to shift some of our capacity to the Asia to Europe lane.\nAnd importantly, these flights typically have an attractive B2B mix of over 75% with high load factors. When we grounded our MD-11 fleet, our focus, as always, was on safety above all, making sure our planes would be inspected and as safe as possible. We're also focused on helping our customers and providing technical support to the regulators. Of the 34 MD-11s we own, 25 were in operation at the time of the groundings. Our network planning team immediately implemented contingencies, prioritizing protecting our customer commitments and stabilizing the network. We revised our November schedule quickly, condensing our planning process into three days.\nAnd the actions we took included trucking more volume in the United States instead of flying, given 18 of our MD-11 flights were US Domestic, shifting volume to other types of aircraft within our FedEx-owned fleet, adding capacity via third-party lift, and adjusting the timing of maintenance for our remaining fleet while staying compliant with regulatory guidelines.\nAs a result, we were able to mitigate the operational and financial impacts of the MD-11 groundings, which ultimately pressured our Q2 adjusted operating income by about $25 million. For the final week of peak, we have additional contingencies in place. We lost about 4% of our global cargo capacity before mitigating actions during our busiest season. As a result, our cross-functional teams are working around the clock to minimize any service disruption. Looking beyond peak, we are extremely focused on maintaining high service levels, the benefit of more time to plan. We'll keep you posted on the expected timing of the MD-11 return to service. Network transformation remains a key priority for us.\nIn support of this ongoing transformation, in October, we named Kawal Preet as Executive Vice President of Planning, Engineering, and Transformation. Kawal is known for creating high-performance cultures. With nearly 30 years of institutional and industry expertise, her depth of operational and engineering knowledge will support further progress towards our global integrated network. For the past five years, she served as our Asia-Pacific regional president. Kawal has a proven track record of relentlessly unlocking efficiencies and driving improved bottom-line results. And I am confident she will thrive in her new role. This global centralized planning and engineering function marks an important shift in how we deploy our assets to reduce inefficiencies and increase profitability. Additionally, it provides enhanced oversight of our ongoing Drive, Tricolor, and Network 2.0 efforts. We now have about 24% of our eligible average daily volume flowing through 355 Network 2.0 optimized facilities.\nAdditionally, we have closed more than 150 facilities. We also continue to prioritize improving our operations and performance in Europe, where the team is making good progress with significant opportunity ahead. We remain focused on driving growth in international and B2B segments, which is helping to offset the headwinds created by global trade policy changes. Our European operations teams have done an outstanding job absorbing the growth through improvements in surface, hub, station, and on-road productivity, supported by sustained improvement in net service levels. Data and technology play a foundational role in our transformation, and we are scaling AI adoption across the company to all our 500,000-plus employees. The reality is that AI is becoming an integral part of all business functions, from the back office to the frontline. And we want to ensure that every employee is equipped to thrive in this new era.\nWe recently launched a global AI program to help our teams innovate faster, serve customers better, and solve challenges more effectively than ever before. Importantly, we are customizing the curriculum to be directly relevant to each team member's specific role, experience level, and existing AI fluency. We also continue to explore new approaches that leverage our real-world operational data platform. We are actively pursuing opportunities to bring digital solutions to the market, starting with Logistics Intelligence Insights. Our recently announced strategic collaboration with ServiceNow marks an important milestone designed to make life easier for those who manage complex sourcing and procurement operations. Through this collaboration, we are giving businesses a single system that anticipates, adapts, and acts before they experience supply chain disruptions. And by integrating into ServiceNow's procurement and supply chain solutions, we are beginning to monetize the proprietary insights that only FedEx can provide.\nEnterprises need access to real-world logistics intelligence to power their AI systems and workflows. This partnership demonstrates market demand for what we have built. In closing, I want to recognize our team for delivering another strong quarter while navigating a very difficult operating environment. Our ability to grow adjusted earnings per share 19% year over year, despite multiple headwinds, speaks to the benefits of our transformation and the strength of our industrial network. I look forward to sharing more information on our strategic initiatives and our medium-term financial outlook at our February Investor Day. I hope to see many of you there. Now, over to you, Brie.\nThank you, Raj. First, I want to commend our commercial and operations teams for the outstanding job they are doing to support our customers during peak. Successfully picking up 25 million packages on Cyber Monday requires extensive collaboration and agility.\nOur Q2 performance is a function of momentum we have been building over the past year, managing key performance indicators to ensure a focus on high-quality revenue growth. The team's hard work and strong execution in Q2 led to a 7% year-over-year revenue growth across the enterprise, B2B, B2B, B2B. At FEC, revenue was up 8%, driven by 12% US domestic package revenue growth with strength across all services. FedEx Freight revenue declined 2%, pressured by lower average daily shipments. We grew average daily domestic volume by 6%. Our recent B2B healthcare wins supported robust growth in the United States priority and deferred express services. The onboarding of our new Amazon business, which is focused on large and heavyweight shipments, is also going well. As expected, international export volumes declined, driven again by lower volumes on the China to US lane.\nRaj mentioned how we're shifting some capacity to the Asia to Europe lane, which, along with strong growth on the Asia lane, is providing a partial offset. Additionally, we continued to grow US international outbound revenue, which further offered another offset. And of course, it has high flow-through. At FedEx Freight, weakness in the industrial economy again weighed on our average daily shipments, which were down 4%. This dynamic remains consistent with broader LTL industry trends. Importantly, our growing FedEx Freight team positions us well for the eventual recovery. We now have more than 85% of our planned LTL sales force in place, and we expect to have the full team in place by June. And of course, this is 400 salespeople. We are also very encouraged by our Q2 service quality metrics at Freight, with claims and damage performance at some of the best levels in company history.\nOn-time service is at the highest level since Q3 of fiscal year 2021. Across the enterprise, our strong yield performance this quarter demonstrates the benefits of our efforts to prioritize high-value shipments, the strength of our value proposition, and the continued improvement in the pricing environment. At FEC, US domestic package yield was up over 5%, driven by the strength across all services. International export package yield grew 3%, driven by revenue quality action, higher weight per shipment tied to the de minimis change, plus favorable currency. At FedEx Freight, revenue per shipment increased 2%, driven by higher weight per shipment and revenue per hundredweight, demonstrating our sustained commitment to maintaining industry-leading yields. Now, let me share a few highlights on our commercial priorities. As part of our B2B focus, we have developed vertical strategies, each with dedicated leadership and resources in our targeted growth areas.\nThat B2B contributed to nearly half our revenue growth this quarter demonstrates this strategy is working. It is helping us sustain and win new business in priority areas like healthcare and automotive. For example, this quarter, we won incremental B2B business from BMW. This win is a result of our global reliability and scale, our strong service for time-critical aftermarket and production deliveries, and our collaborative shipping tools. Further, technology companies are investing extraordinary amounts of CapEx in global data center infrastructure over the next several years. As such, we have formalized our work in creating a data center and infrastructure vertical team. This will better support existing customers and also help us acquire new high-tech customers. I am confident our dedicated sales and solutions team will enable FedEx leadership in this high-value market with significant growth ahead.\nWe are very pleased with how our digital tools are supporting revenue growth while creating better outcomes for our customers and their customers. Wayfair is a great example of how we're using these tools to help our customers improve their shipment-related communications and support their customer service teams. By using our premium integrated visibility tool, Wayfair is increasing their Net Promoter Score, reducing where-is-my-order calls, otherwise known as WISMO calls, and decreasing outages with their tracking data. Turning to our revenue outlook for fiscal year 2026, we now expect 5%-6 consolidated revenue growth this fiscal year, supported by sustained US domestic yield and volume growth. We expect second-half international export ADV to remain pressured due to the global trade environment, with a partial offset from yield.\nAt FEC, the midpoint of our range now implies a 7% revenue growth year-over-year, supported by peak trends and our revenue quality actions. Peak ADV is trending in line with our expectation of a modest year-over-year increase. Peak-related demand surcharges at FEC are achieving strong capture, and we expect a year-over-year increase in this surcharge revenue. In light of the recent MD-11 groundings, we have made targeted adjustments to protect network integrity and service reliability. On 1 December, we implemented a fuel surcharge adjustment to partially mitigate the added cost required to maintaining high-quality service for our customers. We expect strong capture of our General Rate Increase of 5.9%, which goes into effect next month. At FedEx Freight, due to the continued pressure on shipments, we now expect fiscal year 2026 revenue to be approximately flat to slightly down on a year-over-year basis.\nYield growth will provide an offset to a low single-digit percentage decline in shipments. In closing, we have a great strategy in place to capture high-value growth with our unmatched industrial network. Our Q2 results demonstrate that this strategy is absolutely working. Our team is doing an exceptional job this peak season. Thank you, team, for delivering the Purple Promise during the holiday season and, of course, all year round. Now, with that, I'll turn it over to John.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nThank you, Brie. I'll start by saying that I'm very proud of the team for executing on our strategies to drive margin expansion and operating income growth in Q2. We achieved these results despite multiple headwinds. Like Raj and Brie, I'm also very grateful for the dedication of our team members who are delivering on the Purple Promise every day, especially during this peak season.\nTurning to our financial results, on a consolidated basis, in Q2, we delivered $4.82 in adjusted earnings per share, up 19% year-over-year. Consolidated revenue grew by 7%, which supported 60 basis points of adjusted margin expansion and 17% adjusted operating income growth. As Brie mentioned, our yield management and strong commercial execution resulted in higher revenue growth from US domestic package services, which was the primary driver of our year-over-year adjusted operating income improvement. We grew adjusted operating income by $231 million despite the headwind from global trade policy changes, higher variable incentive compensation accruals, weaker-than-expected LTL results, a $30 million headwind from the expiration of the postal service contract, and a $25 million impact from the grounding of our MD-11 fleet. At FEC, we grew adjusted operating income by $306 million, up 24%, and expanded adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points.\nThis was driven by higher yields, continued cost reduction efforts, and increased US domestic package volume. These drivers were partially offset by higher wage and purchased transportation rates and the headwinds I previously mentioned. At FedEx Freight, we continue to experience a challenging market environment consistent with trends across the LTL sector. FedEx Freight adjusted operating income declined by $70 million and adjusted operating margin contracted 3 percentage points. Q2 was weaker than we originally anticipated, driven by lower average daily shipments. Additionally, we experienced a $25 million headwind to adjusted operating income as our sales force hiring and other separation expenses accelerated in Q2. That said, I'm encouraged that yields inflected positive in the quarter, demonstrating FedEx Freight's disciplined strategy. We remain confident that FedEx Freight is well-positioned to see strong incremental margins when demand returns. We remain committed to prudent capital allocation and maximizing stockholder returns.\nDuring the quarter, we opportunistically purchased nearly $300 million worth of stock, which, alongside our increased dividend payout, demonstrates our commitment to returning cash to stockholders. We have $1.3 billion remaining under our 2024 stock repurchase authorization and, subject to business and market conditions, will continue to evaluate repurchasing additional shares during the remainder of FY2026. CapEx year-to-date is $1.4 billion, driven by continued investments to maintain our fleet of aircraft and vehicles, Network 2.0-related facility enhancements, and hub modernization. We continue to target $4.5 billion in annual CapEx for FY2026. Given the healthy status of our pension plan, we are further reducing our expected pension cash contribution. We now anticipate making $275 million in voluntary pension contributions to our US qualified plans in fiscal 2026, compared to our prior forecast of up to $400 million.\nMoving to our FY2026 adjusted EPS outlook, I want to note that our outlook is based on information known to us today and our business trends from the first half of the fiscal year. Though the global operating environment remains fluid, our year-to-date results demonstrate our operating leverage and proven ability to successfully drive premium revenue growth. As a result, we now expect to deliver adjusted EPS of $17.80-19. This compares to our prior range of $17.20-19 and reflects a range of potential scenarios for the back half of the year. At the midpoint of our range, we now anticipate a 7% increase in FEC revenue, with adjusted op margin up slightly. Also at the midpoint, we expect revenue for FedEx Freight to be down slightly, with margin down year-over-year. Our expected FY2026 effective tax rate remains approximately 25%.\nI also want to take a moment to walk through what is implied in our second-half outlook at the adjusted EPS midpoint of $18.40. We expect continued FEC revenue momentum on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal second half. We also expect to benefit from strong operational execution and ongoing efficiency initiatives. At the same time, we anticipate somewhat more limited flow-through in the second half versus the first half due to several discrete items challenging comparability year-over-year. First, variable incentive compensation accruals. For context, in FY2025, we paid variable incentive compensation well below target levels. Given strong year-to-date performance, we have embedded a higher accrual for this performance-based pay in our revised outlook. This is important compensation that our people are earning due to their strong execution in a challenged environment.\nSecond, given the sustained weak LTL industry trends, we've lowered our FedEx Freight expectations for the second half of the year. Third, we expect meaningful headwinds in the second half from our MD-11 groundings, primarily in Q3. Taken together, these items represent roughly a $600 million year-over-year headwind to adjusted operating income in the second half. For the full year, they represent nearly a $900 million headwind. Our revised FY2026 adjusted operating income bridge shows the year-over-year elements embedded in our full-year outlook in one midpoint scenario, resulting in adjusted operating income of $6.2 billion, up $200 million versus our prior outlook. Of course, this is just one scenario, and the assumptions at the midpoint may vary as the environment changes. In this scenario, for FEC volume-related revenue net of variable costs, we now expect a $500 million tailwind.\nThis marks a $100 million improvement compared to what we shared in September. This is driven largely by US Domestic Package Services, offset by a material headwind from reduced international export demand. With respect to FEC yield, we now expect a $3 billion tailwind. This marks a $700 million improvement compared to what we shared in September and demonstrates our commitment to revenue quality and pricing traction. Our bridge includes partial offsets to these tailwinds. Most remain unchanged from what we shared in September, except for the FedEx Freight headwind. We now expect a $300 million decline in adjusted operating income at FedEx Freight compared to the $100 million expectation we shared in September. Additionally, we added a bar to reflect the variable incentive compensation headwind I mentioned earlier.\nAs I mentioned last quarter, embedded in our assumptions is the $1 billion in headwind to adjusted operating profit from the global trade environment, offset by $1 billion in transformation-related savings. We're pleased with our year-to-date cost reduction progress and are on track to achieve the billion-dollar savings target. With regard to Q3 adjusted EPS, we now anticipate adjusted EPS to be sequentially lower than Q2. For further context, we expect Q3 revenue to be essentially in line with Q2, with flight increases sequentially in operating expense due to increased peak demand and higher costs due to the MD-11 grounding. As a reminder, we are lapping a Q3 that was unusually strong seasonally. We expect Q4 to be our strongest adjusted EPS quarter of this fiscal year. These directional trends are consistent with the patterns we typically experience.\nBefore turning to Q&A, I want to provide an update on our spin-off of FedEx Freight, which is on track for 1 June 2026. As previously mentioned, we submitted our confidential Form 10 to the SEC, as well as a request for a private letter ruling on the tax treatment of the transaction to the IRS. These were important milestones as we move toward the tax-efficient spin-off. We expect the Form 10, which will provide more details on our go-forward strategy and financials, to be available to the public in January. As a further update, upon the spin-off of FedEx Freight, FedEx Corp intends to retain up to 19.9% of FedEx Freight's outstanding shares. To preserve the tax-free nature of the spin-off, we expect to monetize these shares within a timeframe permitted by the IRS.\nAdditionally, FedEx Freight will be hosting an investor day in New York City on 8 April. John Smith and his team look forward to unveiling for you FedEx Freight's forward-looking strategy to unlock significant stockholder value in the years ahead. As Raj noted, we also look forward to seeing you in Memphis at our FedEx Corporation Investor Day in February. With that, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator\n\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. To ask a question, you may press Star, then one on your touch-tone phone. If you are using a speakerphone, please pick up your handset before pressing the keys. To withdraw your question, please press Star, then two. Please limit yourself to one question. At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. Our first question today is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\n\nBrandon Oglenski\n\nSenior Equity Analyst, Barclays\n\nHey, good evening, everyone, and thanks for taking the question. John, you just covered a lot in guidance there, and I'm sure we'll get plenty of questions on it. But I guess longer term, it looks like you guys are definitely capturing incremental volume share in your domestic US business, the package business that is, and seeing quite a bit of pricing upside too. So I wondered if you can talk to some of the dynamics there on both B2C and B2B, and maybe if there's more to come on yield gains. Thank you.\n\nJennifer Hollander\n\nVice President of Investor Relations, FedEx\n\nHi, Brandon. It's Raj. I'm happy to answer the question. So from a volume and a market share perspective, yes, we are very pleased with the profitable market share. And again, from an FEC perspective, we were really pleased with the flow-through in the quarter.\nThe incremental margin expansion of 100 basis points at FEC is something we're really proud of. That was driven by a couple of things. One, continued focus on B2B. We've been building this strategy for over a year. We've been very focused on our KPIs and our metrics within the sales organization. We made a pivot to our sales compensation model as well to make sure that that is balanced from a B2B, and a B2C perspective. Then also, as you heard, we were really, really pleased with our overall rate discipline and the capture on surcharges. Our goal is to continue to push on this, continue to acquire new B2B market share, and we're really pleased with the underlying momentum.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jonathan Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\n\nJonathan Chappell\n\nSenior Managing Director, Evercore ISI\n\nThank you. Good afternoon. Brie, I wanted to stick with that topic. The B2B, over half the revenue growth in Q2. Just wondering if there's any way to break down how much of that is completely new volume business, how much of that is related to kind of yield and some of the surcharges initiatives you're putting in. And should we think about that as being kind of a similar magnitude of overall growth as you think about the guide for the back half of the year?\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Jonathan. Great question. So overall, from a trend perspective, and I just want to be clear, it was nearly half. It wasn't over half. Still very pleased with that metric. Let me be clear about that as well. But we expect that to be pretty consistent throughout the year from Q1 through Q4. To your question on acquisition, I will really say that the quarter had multiple things going.\nFrom a B2B perspective, yes, we did acquire new B2B. We also did a great job from a share of wallet. And I should not understate that also it was the strongest quarter that we had seen from a small business B2B perspective. So it really was the combination of all three combined with our revenue quality strategy. I don't think it was any one of those things.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Richa Harnain with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\n\nRicha Harnain\n\nLead Surface Transportation & Airfreight Analyst, Deutsche Bank\n\nHey, thank you. So I wanted to ask about service, more specifically the cost of service. Recently, you shared plans regarding management's annual cash incentive, and you added a service component to that, which speaks to the significance you place on service as you work through your Network 2.0 transformation. We would think that comes with additional costs.\nSo how much do you estimate you're carrying today in terms of those additional costs and what's worked into the outlook? And how should we think about those costs trickling off? I'm sure, for instance, Canada is being run much more efficiently now than when you started your integration efforts. So how long did it take for that to become fully efficient?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nOkay, Richa, let me answer that question. In fact, let me answer two components of it. One, you started to talk about the annual incentive compensation. And to add to the points that were made earlier, prepared remarks, last year, our AIC payouts were well below target. This year, we have included the service component, and we anticipated several headwinds. And despite that, the team is doing an absolutely incredible job of performing in this quarter.\nSo while it's a financial headwind for the year, it's absolutely the right thing to do as our team is going above and beyond the call of duty and delivering on that Purple Promise. So that's on the AIC. Your question was really around the Network 2.0 and the cost. Listen, first of all, we are not going to compromise on our service. Good service is good quality. Good quality is actually less waste. And we are very pleased with the progress that we are making there. And obviously, we have made very good progress in Canada as well. You can typically expect in the market roughly three to six months where we get the efficiency back. And that's all dialed into our forecasts both for the short- and long-term Network 2.0. Thank you again for the question, Richa.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\n\nChris Wetherbee\n\nManaging Director and Senior Transportation Analyst, Wells Fargo\n\nYeah, hi. I wanted to ask a little bit about the LTL business, the freight business. As you think about some of the, I guess maybe we're curious about potential duplicative costs as you guys get prepared for the spin. Is there a sense of how much or maybe the increment on the further decline from $100 million-300 million on the EBIT decline comes from that? I guess we're trying to get a sense if there are some temporary costs associated with the spin that stuff comes out, or is it really more of a function of what's happening in the broader market? Obviously, shipments are a little bit weaker. Yield's a little bit under pressure too.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Chris. I'll take that. As I mentioned in my remarks, we had $25 million in this quarter. We are anticipating of the $300 million, $100 million of that is the result of the separation cost. That is a combination of the acceleration of the Salesforce hiring, which Brie mentioned is going extremely well, as well as IT and other costs, all in the spirit of accelerating, which we're seeing some of the results in the improved performance. So thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\n\nBrian Ossenbeck\n\nManaging Director, JPMorgan\n\nHey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe first, John, just to clarify, the costs you're talking about, are those separate from the spin-off costs, which are included or excluded, rather, from the EPS guide? And then just wanted to hear a little bit more about the MD-11 process, getting them back up to speed. It seems like it'll take a little while, but it also seems like there's an incremental step up in terms of a headwind into the third fiscal quarter. Is that more or less because of the peak season? I think we're expecting that to tail off a little bit, but it seems like it's actually increasing. So additional thoughts around that would be helpful. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Brian. I'll cover the first part. Those are separate costs that I identified than the $600 million. These were included in our reportable earnings. So with regard to the MD-11, yeah, our current outlook reflects that those aircraft will return to service in the Q4. We do have some incremental costs in the Q3, particularly in December. As I noted, $25 million was in November, but in December, we'll have significantly higher costs incurred on the MD-11.\nIt's peak season, and it's an expensive time of year to be getting outsourced lift to begin with, let alone when you have fleet grounded. So I would say of the remaining $150 million, a substantial part of that $175 million will be in Q3. And let me just add one more point on this thing, Brian. Our first priority will always be safety above all. And that's the principle which we have built. We are working hand in hand with the authorities on the protocol to get these aircraft back in flight. I was there with the MD-11 hangar just on Tuesday night. We have a phenomenal set of aircraft technicians who are working on it. And we're waiting for the right protocol to get it released and the timing that John talked about. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\n\nScott Group\n\nManaging Director and Senior Analyst, Wolfe Research\n\nPlease go ahead. Hey, thanks. John, just want to follow up on that $600 million headwind you talked about in the back half of the year. I think you gave; there's three pieces to it. Any way you can sort of break down that 600 million into the three buckets you laid out, and maybe how much of that's in Q3? And then maybe just along with that, I know you said earnings would be lower in Q3, but any sort of magnitude, I don't know, maybe the way to think about, do you think earnings are flat, higher, lower year over year? Maybe that'll be helpful if you give a little bit more color. Thank you.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Scott. So of the 900 million, we incurred 300 million of that in the first half of the year. To your question, for the second half of the year, we've embedded the remaining $600 million in our outlook, with about $160 million of that due to expected continued softness in the LTL business, up to a total of about $175 million for the MD-11 grounding, and for the majority of which we expect in Q3, and the remainder, about $265 million, for increased variable compensation. So with regard to your question on Q3, I'm not going to give Q3 guidance, but what I can tell you is that the Q3 adjusted EPS will be sequentially lower than Q2.\nWe expect revenue sequentially to be essentially in line with Q2. Slight increases as well in operating expense on a sequential basis due to the increased peak demand, some of the increased volumes we're talking about, and higher costs due to the MD-11 grounding.\nI think an important reminder too is we'll be lapping a Q3 that was unusually strong seasonally. We had a lot of Drive benefits in the Q3 of last year. We also expect Q4 to be our strongest adjusted EPS quarter for the fiscal year. And directionally, that's consistent with the patterns that we've typically experienced.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\n\nTom Wadewitz\n\nManaging Director and Senior Equity Research Analyst, UBS\n\nYeah, thank you. So I wanted to get your sense of, I think what we've seen in the past over time is that FedEx can, as they're developing momentum a couple of quarters into margin improvement, you do tend to run into this refilling of the incentive comp bucket, and that tends to be a headwind for a period of time. Seems like sometimes that can be like you go a couple of hundred million one year, and then there's more to go the next year. So I guess I'm just wondering about, do you think this is kind of like you take the hit over a couple of quarters now, and then you're kind of ready to go for fiscal 2027 where you see more of the Network 2.0 savings come in? .\nOr I guess just how do we kind of think about that, and then relative to just the progress on your FEC margin, which has been good for, I think you said, five quarters in a row, and it seems like you're maybe pausing, admittedly, for a couple of reasons. But just kind of how do we think about broader FEC margin improvement? Is this kind of a couple of quarter headwind on refilling the incentive comp, or is this something that might carry into kind of next year as well?\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Tom, for the question. Let me lead off. And if John wants to add to it, he can. As we are looking at FY2026, we're basically catching back up where we should have been comparing to last year. I think that is not a headwind that we'll have going forward into fiscal 2027. So that hopefully answers that question. The second part of it is we are very, very pleased with the underlying momentum that we have in our business. This is now working, the transformation that we have on our network transformation, our organizational transformation, our digital transformation, all are working. Our commercial teams are executing at a high level, as you can see the results.\nSo we are pleased with the underlying momentum and the flow through. There are certain things that are happening peculiarly for this. There are incremental headwinds for this next three to six months, but on an ongoing basis, we are very pleased with the ongoing momentum here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\n\nJordan Alliger\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Goldman Sachs\n\nYeah, hi. Just a question. The bridge to the midpoint is very helpful. I'm just sort of curious, though, the $19 are at the high end. Is there a way you could frame up what would push it? Is that mostly tied to volumes looking better, the LTL environment looking better, more acceleration in B2B? How do we think about framing to the north of the midpoint? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, hey, Jordan. I guess my quick response is all of the above. We're not going to really speculate as to all the factors that could go into it. Obviously, if revenue is stronger and our cost environment is better than we're anticipating, you're going to find yourself in the upward end of the range. So there are so many variables in place, but we feel comfortable with the assumptions we've laid out that we're going to be within the range and focused on being as far into the range as we possibly can. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\n\nBascome Majors\n\nSenior Industrials Equity Research Analyst, Susquehanna\n\nThanks for taking my questions. The domestic parcel growth rates have been really solid for several quarters in a row now. And as we get, I think the indication from the guidance is that you expect that to continue. As we get further in the next year and UPS potentially gets some competitive advantages back with the relationship with the Postal Service and potentially maybe some contractual competition three years past the new Teamsters deal and some of the sheer shift that happened there, do you think that growth is something that we can maintain at a high level into fiscal 2027, or could those potentially be headwinds that we should consider tapering the rate? Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nThanks for the question, Bascome. I do not believe that a relationship between our two competitors is a competitive threat. As we've talked about, our focus right now is high-value segments: B2B, Home Delivery, Ground Commercial. These are not services that could be serviced by the Post Office. And so if that does materialize, I do not see it as a threat to our primary growth strategy. We have the stronger value proposition, and we're very focused on continuing to take profitable market share.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Hoexter\n\nManaging Director, Bank of America\n\nHey, good afternoon. Just on simplifying the freight, John, I guess you've mentioned it a few times, but the $300 million impact, if you pull out the $100 million in ongoing costs, is that the leftover $200 million, is that due to weakening demand? And I'm wondering what your view is of the competitive environment there. And then the $152 million in spin costs, is there anything you can maybe detail or break out what's going into that? Is that just continued? Is that ongoing costs? I just want to understand what's one time, what's, if any, and what is ongoing. Thanks.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, Ken, I'll start with the numbers and basically say the $200 million is the result of lower ADV and pressure on the business that's consistent with the LTL industry. Yeah, with regard to the $152 million, those are spin-off preparation costs. And so that's why those are in our adjusted, and those are one-time costs. Thank you. And Ken, if I just add one more point to it, on a broader basis, obviously, our performance is in line with our industry at this point, and this is cyclical in nature. It's very difficult to predict when the turn would come. But however, we are beginning to see some level of industry consolidation, especially in the truckload business. And while it takes a while to translate in the LTL, that process seems to have begun.\nThe next question is from Reed Seay with Stephens. Please go ahead. Hey, guys.\n\nReed Seay\n\nEquity Research Analyst, Stephens\n\nThanks for taking my question. I want to follow up real quick on that last answer about consolidation. Does that mean consolidation of LTL carriers you seem to think will be on the horizon? And then also in that $200 million that you talked about, there is definitely some LTL industry softness, but I was wondering if any of that is from an understandable rationalization of volume as you try to maybe take out some less profitable freight before I spin that off on its own, just if any of that is creating some noise in the shipment numbers. Thank you.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nI'll start off, and then John can answer the second part. I just want to make sure what I said was consolidation of capacity in the truckload business. We can see a reduction of capacity starting to happen, and that will ultimately translate into benefit for the LTL sector, even though it may take a little time. John?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, and if I could talk, we're actually seeing a bit of positive inflection in the yield, the first increase in yield that we've seen in several quarters. So we're encouraged by that, and it also reflects the discipline on the pricing environment in our LTL business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Bruce Chan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\n\nBruce Chan\n\nDirector and Senior Analyst, Stifel\n\nHey, good evening, everyone. So kudos to your network planning, folks. Certainly plenty to keep them busy, including what might be an imminent Supreme Court ruling on the tariffs.\nI'm wondering if we see a decision against the administration, whether you'd view that as a tailwind to trade activity next calendar year, especially maybe in the context of your $1 billion headwind estimate? And I know that's a big question, but you all are very plugged into Washington, so any perspective there would be very helpful.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nWell, Bruce, first of all, thank you for the comments on the network. I mean, these teams have done just an absolutely remarkable job and continue to do so. It's very, very early to answer any question regarding what might or might not happen on the tariff front. Any international volume increase, obviously, is beneficial, but we're not counting on any such thing in our outlook.\nObviously, we are seeing significant shifts in trade and supply chain patterns, and the fact that we have a scaled network in every part of the world stands to our advantage because we are able to get market signals from the bottom up, and we are able to act very quickly and with precision. That's what's helping us very much as far as how the environment on global trade changes and how that might impact our volumes. At this point, it's very early to comment, and we will update you as the months go by here.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\n\nStephanie Moore\n\nSenior Vice President of Equity Research, Jefferies\n\nHi, good evening. Thank you. I wanted to circle back on peak season. Maybe you could provide a little bit more color on what you've seen thus far. I know you said it's tracked in line, but I think there's been a lot of commentary at a high level that we've seen talking about a K-shaped recovery and also some questioning just around the strength of peak season. You also commented a little bit about maybe small business or B2B. So any additional color you can provide on peak season would be great. Thanks.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Stephanie. It's Brie. So I am really pleased with how we're doing from a peak perspective, both from a planning as well as an execution. Right now, we are basically running right on our forecast for peak. What we had predicted was a mid-single-digit year-over-year growth on ADV. That is absolutely the case. We do have an extra operating day. And so in total volume, you're going to see a high single-digit growth from a peak period.\nFrom a forecast perspective, as I mentioned, it is basically in line. What we are seeing, however, especially early in peak, is actually our base and our small and medium businesses are slightly ahead of forecast, and our larger retailers are slightly below, which obviously, from a revenue quality perspective, is a good thing from a results perspective. From a trend throughout peak, what we did see is that right after Black Friday, we had very strong. The second week was a little bit softer, but we have seen building momentum in the last week. Time in transit is two days. Scott and John are doing a remarkable job of running the network. In addition to that, as you know, we are the market share leader in large package, and the team has done a brilliant job of actually keeping the port cities clear.\nThey've pulled that volume into kind of the middle of the country, bypassing some sorts and hubs, which is really important. So right now, we feel really good about peak. I do not want to underestimate that we have still six days to go. We have a lot of work to do. The team is ready, as Raj just talked about. I cannot say enough about the incredible airline work, but the team does need to execute next week without the MD-11. We're very focused on that, and they have demonstrated that this is definitely going to be a strong peak and could not be more pleased.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Ari Rosa with Citi. Please go ahead.\n\nAriel Rosa\n\nSenior Analyst, Citi",
    "content2": "Hi, good evening. Nice job on the quarter here. Good to see the progress. I'm curious. In the slides, you mentioned that you have 24% of volume flowing through Network 2.0 automated facilities. I think I'm remembering that correctly. I just want to understand, what does that mean in terms of the margin profile for those facilities or kind of the cost structure per package on those facilities versus legacy facilities? And how should we think about the timeline or the pace for that to continue to ramp? And kind of going to Tom's question, does that just mean we're looking at kind of potentially structurally higher margins going forward? Thanks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nYeah, thanks, Ari. We intend to talk a lot more about this at our upcoming investor day. But we also have said previously with regard to Network 2.0 benefits, we expect to see the tangible results of that later in FY2027. So I would say not a material impact financially, but great contribution from an operational efficiency standpoint that Brie was talking about earlier.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Connor Cunningham with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\n\nConor Cunningham\n\nDirector, Melius Research\n\nHi, everyone. I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about the healthcare and small and medium-sized business markets and just talk about the opportunity set that you have from here. And then, Raj, you've talked a little bit in the past around just the tech pipeline or the potential there, just given the CapEx that's being spent from the AI players. Just curious on how FedEx kind of fits into that puzzle, if at all. Thank you.\n\nBrie Carere\n\nEVP and Chief Customer Officer, FedEx\n\nHi, Connor. It's Brie. So sure, I'll start first from a healthcare and an SMB perspective. As we mentioned several calls ago, we had just a phenomenal build last year from a healthcare perspective. We have, I think, the best digital portfolio from a healthcare segment perspective. What do I mean by that? We can give our healthcare customers customized visibility, and they can set their own business rules for intervention and monitoring, which is really important. All customers are important, but patients obviously require that next level of service. As I just talked about some of the service performance, that means that we can actually intervene, reroute, and adjust for healthcare customers at a level of precision that I just believe is unmatched in the network.\nSo we are continuing to onboard healthcare with that tool. We also rolled out a new quality program, which is really important to the pharma segment. That is sort of early days.\nThat actually requires, with each one of our pharma customers, for us to work with their quality team, build out a custom SOP, prove we can execute that to be able to win share of wallet. And that is going quite well. So that will continue, I believe, as an ability to take share. And then from there, we're also continuing to expand our cold chain capabilities. Right now, we've got great cold chain in a reactive place. And what do I mean by that? Most of our customers are packing out their shipments. And so we use cold chain predominantly to intervene and ice something or refreeze something if there is a delay in the system. We're moving to end-to-end cold chain. So that's sort of the next wave. Had great momentum here in the United States. We're taking these capabilities to Europe and to Asia.\nSo I think we've got a long runway. We've got between $9 and $10 billion of healthcare in our base. The market is $70 billion. So this is a long-term strategy, but the team continues to execute every quarter. From an SMB perspective, we are, I think, the easiest to do business in the United States. We just had the best quarter in SMB share and performance that I have seen in several years. A huge shout-out to both our sales and marketing team. And again, we're going to keep chipping away at this. And I believe with our value proposition, we'll continue to take share. And then finally, on the data centers, while it's not as big an opportunity as healthcare, healthcare is $70 billion, the data center market's probably between $7 and $8 billion. It is rapidly growing.\nI think global CapEx is predicted to be like $550 billion. In a market that is moving that quickly, there is opportunity. This market expects precision. I don't know anybody who does precision better than we do. So yes, we're winning now, but I think there's a long road ahead of more opportunity.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\n\nDavid Vernon\n\nVP and Senior Analyst, Bernstein\n\nHey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking the question. So John, coming back to the question on the Network 2.0 stuff, right? I think you guys had mentioned before you were looking at 40% of the volume by the end of FY2026 running in an integrated facility. I'm trying to sort of reconcile that with the idea that margins are just going to be up a little. I thought the idea was that when you get the integration done, you're going to be running at a higher level of productivity, and that would flow through to margin. But I think I heard you maybe say that the financial impact maybe wasn't as great. I'm just trying to kind of get my head around that.\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nLet me just give you the latest and greatest on what we expect on Network 2.0. As we said, we are right now at 24% of the volume pre-peak. By the time next peak rolls around, we'll be around 65%. And that's the plan, and that's what we're executing against. At the end of the day, when we are finished with it, we're targeting around a 30% footprint reduction by the end of fiscal year 2027. And those represent, along with One FedEx, $2 billion in cost savings.\nWe see the majority of those savings skewed towards FY2027. I don't know, John, if you want anything more to that. No, I would just add, with regard to our transformational cost savings targets for this year, there are elements of Network 2.0 included in those. That's what I want to elaborate further on at investor day. I don't want to say there's no savings. It's all part and parcel. We'll go into much more detail on our strategic initiatives, including Network 2.0, when we see you in February.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question is from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\n\nJeff Kauffman\n\nLogistics Equity Research Analyst, Vertical Research Partners\n\nThank you very much. A lot of my questions have been answered, but let me ask one for John here. John, thank you for explaining the headwinds on the incremental second-half outlook. I want to ask about the non-GAAP add-backs. You had a nice chart in the release showing about $720 million net this year, $600 million from the spin, $310 million from business optimization. You still have about $450 million of that to go and two quarters to do it. Can you give us an idea of kind of how that's going to weigh? Did you not do as much Network 2.0 integration because of peak season this quarter, and you're going to do more in the fiscal Q3? Kind of how should we think about the flow of those expenses?\n\nJohn Dietrich\n\nEVP and CFO, FedEx\n\nYeah, I think the overwhelming majority of them are going to be tied to our freight separation. We also have a much smaller portion with regard to the change in our calendar fiscal year. And also, finally, a much smaller portion with the ongoing business optimization that has been in play for the last couple of years. Freight separation is the overwhelming majority.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes our question and answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Raj Subramaniam for any closing remarks.\n\nRaj Subramaniam\n\nPresident and CEO, FedEx\n\nWell, thank you, Operator. Before we go, I want to acknowledge how proud and humbled we are by the Memphis-Shelby County Airport Authority's decision today to rename the Memphis International Airport in honor of our founder, Frederick W. Smith. It's a fitting tribute to the man who launched FedEx, a company that revolutionized the airport, the city of Memphis, and the way the world works. We look forward to soon operating our largest hub out of Frederick W. Smith International Airport. And finally, a big thank you to Team FedEx for your outstanding work in Q2 and throughout this peak season with just one more week to go. Happy holidays, everyone. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."

My name is Lisa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin our call.\n\nMichael J. Watts\n\nVice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them and a replay of this call will be available for 30 days. Before we begin, we'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year.\nAlso, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19 which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue and other revenue related to COVID-19. Finally, any percentage changes that we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2025. We're pleased with our performance in the quarter. as we delivered both revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share that exceeded our guidance. We've admittedly hit a few speed bumps the last couple of quarters, but we view our results as clear evidence of the significant progress we have made in putting these bumps behind us as we return to higher growth while improving women's health. We have more work to do, but we believe our performance in the third quarter has us very well positioned for better results as we close out fiscal 2025 and move into next year.\nSpecifically, total revenue for the third quarter was $1.024 billion. This represented a slight growth of 0.4% and exceeded the high end of our guidance range by about $14 million. Our Diagnostics business continued to grow nicely compared to the prior year, and our Breast Health business improved sequentially as planned. surgical met expectations, and we got a positive contribution from our skeletal franchise as previous supply constraints lifted. These solid revenue results helped non-GAAP earnings per share reached $1.08 in the third quarter. This was a slight increase of 1.9% compared to a year ago and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range.\nWe maintained a very strong non-GAAP operating margin just above 30% as we controlled expenses across the organization and mitigated some tariff impacts. Importantly, our third quarter financial results have us squarely on the path toward accelerating growth that we described in our last call. In fact, we completed our annual strategic planning process earlier this summer and are optimistic that we will return to solid mid-single-digit organic revenue growth next year and over our strat plan horizon.\nA key reason we are confident in this outlook is the strengthening of our Breast Health business. I want to spend a little time on this today since it has understandably been a focus for investors. Although Breast Health revenues declined in the third quarter versus the prior year, this was expected. In fact, quarterly sales finished slightly ahead of our internal expectations. I want to highlight 3 areas that underpin this performance and excite us about our future. First, better commercial execution, both in imaging and interventional. In the third quarter, we shipped more 3D gantries than in the prior quarter, validating the sequential improvement we had forecast.\nIn the United States, especially, our new commercial leadership team began to build on the bifurcated sales structure and tighter processes they established earlier in the year. Based on this foundation, we rolled out a new strategy to upgrade older end-of-life gantries, which we expect to bear more fruit in the fourth quarter and into 2026 as we have previously discussed, gantry replacement cycles have become longer, but we remain encouraged that our leading market share remains intact and we believe this has been validated by competitive gantry wins in recent quarters.\nAnd while all of this was happening in mammography, interventional sales increased 6% organically, reflecting an easier comparable, but also the early benefits of our more focused domestic sales force. The second reason we are excited about Breast Health and a major reason we continue to win competitively is our consistent delivery of both clinical and product innovation. For example, a retrospective study we published recently with physicians from Sanford Health in South Dakota, evaluated more than 180,000 mammograms conducted over 10 years. This real-world study found that high-resolution 3D mammography conducted with our Clarity HD software was associated with higher cancer detection rates, than our standard resolution 3D.\nThis is one of the scores of clinical studies published by our radiology customers that demonstrate the value of our technologies creating by far the deepest body of evidence in our category. In terms of product innovation, this quarter, we are launching our latest artificial intelligence solution, Genius AI detection Pro which will extend our leadership in breast focused software. This cloud-based solution developed with our partner, Therapixel, is essentially an all-in-one AI assistant for the radiologist. It analyzes prior and current mammograms through a 2D and 3D deep learning algorithm for increased accuracy and faster throughput, a single streamlined interface boosts efficiency up to a 24% reduction in reading time by capturing all key information in one place.\nThis includes breast density scores, patient history and lesion and case scores. The software will even check image quality and automatically pre-populate the radiologist report with key findings. It is being sold as an upgrade on our three dimension system now and will be available on our next-generation instrument and vision when it launches next year. Third, we are really excited about Endomagnetics, which we acquired last summer. Endomag expands our portfolio of breast surgery products as we offer additional value across the entire breast cancer continuum of care. As a reminder, Endomag markets 2 primary disposable products, [ MAG Seed ], a tiny wireless seed that enables breast surgeons to quickly find and remove a tumor. And Mag Trace, a radiation-free tracer that finds and maps target lymph nodes to be removed or biopsy during surgery.\nBoth products operate with a small piece of capital called the [ Senta mag system ]. In the third quarter, Endomag contributed nearly $20 million of revenue at a very healthy gross margin. The business has been exceeding our deal model and we'll begin adding to organic growth rates in August. Before I turn the call over to Essex, let me conclude by saying that the operative word for Hologic in the third quarter was progress, progress in exceeding our near-term financial commitments, progress in strengthening our Breast Health business and progress toward accelerating overall company growth in the fourth quarter as well as 26 and beyond. All in all, we are confident in our path and optimistic about our future. Now I will turn the call over to Essex.\n\nEssex D. Mitchell\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will first review our divisional revenue performance in the third quarter. Then I'll provide an update on the positive progress we have made in mitigating tariffs. As Steve said, our results in the third quarter were strong, with revenue of $1.024 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance. While we faced several challenges this year, we believe they would be temporary. And we're excited to see the momentum building across the business as we look toward FY '26. Starting in Diagnostics. Third quarter revenue of $448.9 million grew 0.9% or 2.9% organically, excluding COVID-related sales.\nAs a reminder, much of the geopolitical turmoil we've discussed this year affects our Diagnostics business, specifically funding cuts to U.S.A. and Africa and the challenging operating environment. in China lowered otherwise solid growth in the third quarter. As our team navigates these headwinds, the underlying growth drivers in diagnostics remains strong. We are still in the early innings of vaginitis and Biotheranostics opportunities. Worldwide Panther utilization continues to reach new all-time highs. And our cytology customers are excited about the rollout of our Genius digital cytology platform. Molecular Diagnostics continued to lead the way in the third quarter with global growth of 2.4% and or 5.2% excluding COVID.\nIn the United States, molecular growth -- molecular grew 7.3%, excluding COVID. Growth was driven by strong sales of our BV CV assay and our portfolio of Panther Fusion assays. Our Diagnostics team has done an outstanding job taking BBTV from a new product in 2019 to what is now our second largest assay. Much of the growth we realized to this point has been from converting existing manual testing to our fully automated high throughput Panther system. There's still meaningful opportunity to convert more of this testing demonstrated by several key account wins this quarter, but the larger opportunity will be to reach the estimated 60% of women in the U.S. who aren't tested at all when they experience vaginitis symptoms.\nTo this end, we've deployed our physician sales force to provide education and awareness at the provider level. leveraging the same strategy we use to grow testing for sexually transmitted infections. Before moving on, I'd like to highlight our Panther Fusion sidecar and how -- it will play a key role in diagnostics growth moving forward. As we emerge from the pandemic, two things became clear across our customer base. Customers love the workflow advantages of the Panther and labs were looking to consolidate their testing into fewer platforms. The latter is the opportunity for Panther Fusion. Fusion uses PCR technology to unlock our full menu of 23-plus assays spanning across several testing categories.\nCurrently, fusion is mainly used for respiratory testing but we've been seeing good traction this year as customers adopt more menu. In particular, our Open Access testing kits contributed to solid Fusion growth in the third quarter. Open access gives [indiscernible] a flexibility to run their own lab-developed tests on our Fusion platform. In addition, over the next several years, we plan to further diversify our menu by launching IVD test for GI and hospital-acquired infections. As we continue to deliver this innovation and further cements Hologic as an indispensable presence in the molecular lab.\nTurning to our cytology and perinatal businesses. Third quarter revenue declined 2.2%. This result was expected given the reduction in our China forecast that we discussed the last quarter. Excluding China, cytology would have grown low single digits for the quarter, a solid result that was fueled by the rollout of our Genius digital diagnostics system. As we implement Genius at more laboratories around the world, we received resoundedly positive feedback. Genius transforms the traditional manual review of [indiscernible], which was previously conducted on glass under a microscope by capturing a digital image of the slide. This digital image can then be reviewed remotely from anywhere in the customer's network on our review station.\nUsing our proprietary artificial intelligence algorithm, genius identified precancerous lesions and cervical cancer cells for examination by lab professionals, enabling a faster, more accurate diagnosis. These workflow advantages not only address their growing labor shortages our customers face but also enable cervical cancer screening in areas of the world where infrastructure is limited because the Genius system requires an overhaul of the traditional pet screening workflow, we expect the full rollout would be a multiyear process, contributing to growth for the next several quarters.\nMoving to Breast Health. Revenue of $365.2 million declined 5.8% or 10.8% organically, excluding Endo magnetics and SSI. The decline versus prior year was expected as the third quarter of FY '24 presented our toughest comp of the year. Importantly, as Steve mentioned, revenue grew sequentially compared to the second quarter and finished slightly ahead of our internal goal. We were encouraged to see the progress in Q3 that gives us confidence this business is rebounding and will return to growth in Q4. We most apparent in the third quarter results was the strong interventional performance, growing 31.8%. Endomagnetics played a big role in this growth and turned organic in Q4. But even excluding Endomag, organic interventional sales grew 6%, showing the immediate impact of our refocused sales force.\nTurning to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $178.4 million increased 6.3% or 1.2% organically, excluding guidance. Growth continues to be led by international, which grew 24.8%. The investments we've made in our commercial and market access capabilities outside the United States have significantly expanded the reach of our minimally invasive surgical products. International Surgical growth was driven by 2 key factors in the third quarter. adoption in markets where reimbursement has recently been established and expanding into new markets altogether, and we're encouraged by the strong momentum across our entire surgical portfolio. For example, NovaSure, which has faced challenges in the U.S. has consistently delivered double-digit growth internationally over the past several quarters. This highlights the significant opportunity we still have to elevate women's health globally.\nFinally, in our Skeletal business, third quarter revenue of $31.3 million grew 62.1% as we resumed shipping our final DEXA model in the quarter. Sales were roughly in line with our expectations but higher than historic levels as we've continued to meet pent-up demand from the prior shipping hold. Before I turn the call over to Karleen, I wanted to provide an update on the positive progress we have made in mitigating the impact of global tariffs on our business. As a reminder, last quarter, we shared a worst case tariff estimate of $20 million to $25 million per quarter. We anticipated that approximately 2/3 of this amount would come from the 10% tariff with imports from Costa Rica, where we manufacture most of our surgical and interventional breast health products.\nShipments of both shipments of products to and from China, represent the next largest portion, accounting for roughly 15% of the total. Our team has been hard at work over the last 90 days, evaluating options to reduce this tariff impact. through changes to our global supply chain and operating model and various procurement efforts, we expect to mitigate roughly half of the amount we originally provided. This means we now expect to incur $10 million to $12 million in tariffs per quarter. Of course, this is based on tariffs as they stand today and is subject to change.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will start by walking through the rest of our non-GAAP income statement. Then touch on several key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for fiscal Q4 and the full year. In the third quarter, we delivered EPS of $1.08. And growing modestly versus the prior year and exceeding the high end of our guidance range. Strong execution on the top line helped to achieve these results with all our global divisions meeting expectations in the quarter. Now to the rest of the income statement. Non-GAAP gross margin closed the quarter at 60.3%. And representing an 80 basis point decline compared to the prior year.\nThis decrease was driven by product mix, but also by a reserve recorded in our Skeletal Health division based on our plan discontinued sales of our Fluoroscan Insight system at the end of the fiscal year. This was a strategic decision based on the product's low gross margin and growth potential and limited fit in our portfolio. Fluoroscan is expected to generate about $18 million of product and service revenue in fiscal 2025 before we stop selling it next year. I should also mention that cost of goods sold included about $1.4 million of tariff expense in the third quarter, less than anticipated, in part as a result of our mitigation efforts. Moving down the P&L.\nThird quarter operating expenses of $309.6 million increased 2.2%. This increase was driven by the inclusion of Endomag and Gynesonics in our results as well as increased expense related to our deferred compensation plan. Excluding these acquisitions, operating expenses would have declined 4.3%, underscoring our commitment to disciplined expense management and operational efficiency across the organization. Third quarter operating margin finished at 30.1%, representing a decrease of 110 basis points compared to the prior year, but still best-in-class relative to our peers. This decrease reflects the dilutive impact that Endomag and Gynasonics currently have on our bottom line.\nAs we continue to integrate these acquisitions, however, we do expect their profitability to improve especially since both already have gross margins that are accretive to our corporate average. Below operating income, other income net was allowed in our fiscal third quarter of slightly less than $6 million. This was better than anticipated as the increasing value of investments related to our deferred compensation plan largely offset the increase we saw in G&A expense from strong equity market performance in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 19.25% as expected. Altogether, net margin for the quarter was a very healthy 23.8%, decreasing 100 basis points compared to the prior year, but increasing 60 basis points sequentially. Combined, these results led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.08, slightly exceeding our bottom line commitment. Our strong profitability helps to drive excellent cash generation as we delivered $343 million of operating cash flow in the third quarter.\nWe finished the quarter with $1.88 billion in cash and short-term investments on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.6x. We also refinanced our credit agreement earlier this month. so we continue to enjoy tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. Now let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full fiscal year and fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we are expecting total revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.04 billion, and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.09 to $1.12. I would point out that based on our good performance in Q3, the sequential step-up that is required in Q4 is much less than we previously forecasted. At the midpoint of these ranges, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth and high single-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter.\nThis would mark a return to our longer-term goals for financial performance. For the full year, we are also calling up the midpoints of our guidance ranges for revenue and EPS based on our strong performance in the third quarter as well as lower tariff headwinds. We now expect revenue in the range of 4.081 billion to $4.091 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $4.23 to $4.26. All in all, remain on the financial improvement path that we outlined earlier this year, stabilization in Q2, progress in Q3 and a return to growth in Q4. As our teams continue to execute on this plan, our divisional outlook from our prior guidance remains largely unchanged. However, there are a few trends worth calling out for the fourth quarter.\nIn Breast Health, as Steve and Essex discussed, we expect to return to slight top line growth in the fourth quarter. Compared to the prior year, our Diagnostics business outside the United States will continue to be affected by the difficult operating environment in China and reduced funding for our HIV test in Africa. In Surgical, we expect to benefit from an easy comparable period in Q4 of fiscal '24, coupled with better commercial execution. As a result, we anticipate in the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of revenue growth for the year. In skeletal, we anticipate outsized growth in the fourth quarter as we'll be comping against a full quarter of the DEXA stop ship in the prior year period.\nIn 2026, however, skeletal revenue will be less than in recent quarters, as we will have fulfilled pent-up demand and stopped selling our Fluoroscan product. To help with a few other modeling items, based on recent foreign exchange rates, the weaker U.S. dollar should represent a tailwind of approximately $6 million in the fourth quarter. We expect COVID assay sales to be about $5 million in the fourth quarter and sales of COVID-related items to be about $25 million. Finally, we expect blood screening revenue of about $5 million in Q4. As a reminder, both COVID-related sales and blood screening revenue are backed out of our organic growth calculations.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. Our full year expectations for gross and operating margins in the low 60s and low 30s, respectively, remain unchanged. In the fourth quarter, we do expect to incur about $8 million of tariff expenses. And as Essex said, this number will increase to $10 million to $12 million on a quarterly basis in fiscal 2026. While this is roughly half what we originally expected, it will still represent a headwind to gross margin of almost 100 basis points compared to this year.\nBelow operating income, we estimate that other income net to be an expense of approximately $20 million in the fourth quarter. Our annual effective tax rate of 19.5% and diluted share count of 228 million shares for the full year are both unchanged from our previous guidance. To conclude, our strong third quarter results were an important step in the right direction as we delivered revenue and non-GAAP EPS above our guidance ranges. We expect to build on this momentum in the fourth quarter, and we believe we are well positioned to finish the year from a position of strength as we enter fiscal '20. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

Watts\n\nVice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call.

MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Mike, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As everyone knows all too well, it's been a tumultuous few months from a macroeconomic and policy perspective. But in this challenging environment, we took a step in the right direction this quarter by meeting our financial commitments, making good progress on our plans to reinvigorate growth and demonstrating once again the reliability and adaptability of our business model.\nSpecifically, total revenue for the quarter was $1.005 billion, a decrease of 0.5% in constant currency, but toward the upper end of our guidance. Our Diagnostics business continued to grow nicely despite steep declines in our Africa business following funding cuts. And we also got a positive contribution from our skeletal franchise as previous supply constraints began to lift.\nNon-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high end of our guidance range and flat compared to a year ago. This reflected solid gross margin expansion as well as benefits from share buybacks and a slightly lower tax rate.\nWith that overview, let me discuss how we are approaching today's macro environment from a position of strength and why we believe we can continue to deliver solid financial results across a range of unpredictable economic and policy scenarios.\nFirst, our products deliver significant value to patients and customers. For example, our market-leading infectious disease and cancer tests are relatively inexpensive, and they help reduce overall health care costs by detecting disease early when it can be treated most effectively.\nOur Breast Health products are another good example of this. We need to accelerate growth here for sure. And this quarter, we made good progress on our plans to do that, as Essex will discuss.\nWe are confident in our efforts because we know that our foundation is incredibly strong. Our mammography products are best-in-class. And as a result, we command leading market shares. With our increasingly diverse portfolio, we can help women across the entire continuum of breast health care, and we have the best market position in this important category for women's health.\nIn addition, our customer relationships are without peer, which translates into lots of recurring revenue. For example, strong growth in Breast Health service drove $212.6 million of overall nonproduct revenue for the company this quarter. This represented 21% of our total revenue and grew by a very healthy 12%.\nSecond, we have a seasoned management team and a highly engaged workforce of more than 7,000 people who are deeply committed to women's health. In addition to our global leadership team, we are beefing up our organization in key areas like business development, R&D and quality. Importantly, we are adding experienced professionals who bring deep understanding of their respective end markets.\nAnd across the company, our level of employee engagement, which we have tracked every year since 2015, remains terrific. Most recently, we scored in the 98th percentile compared to similar companies, actually tipping up a point from recent years. And importantly, 99% of employees agree that Hologic's mission makes them feel their jobs are important, also up 1 point from last year. High employee engagement really shined through in our impressive response to the COVID-19 pandemic and gives us a competitive advantage in dynamic environments like the ones we're navigating today.\nThird, the strength of our balance sheet and cash flows give us tremendous strategic and financial flexibility. We generated $169.5 million in operating cash in the second quarter, largely due to our durable market-leading brands. At quarter end, we had cash and equivalents of $1.43 billion, short-term investments of $192 million and an adjusted net leverage ratio of only 0.8x. With our fortress balance sheet, we believe we are in a good position to capitalize on market dislocations from a business development perspective. We continue to search for acquisitions and investments similar to recent deals like Endomagnetics, Gynesonics and Maverix, which are performing well.\nAt the same time, we can also return value to shareholders by repurchasing stock. We have repurchased more than $4.5 billion of stock since 2016, including $200 million in the second quarter.\nBefore I turn the call over to Essex, let me conclude by saying that the financial execution we saw in the quarter reflects our strong positions in core U.S. and European markets. But unfortunately, exogenous factors are affecting our growth in geographies like Africa, which we discussed in our last call, and China. Today, we are lowering sales expectations for China, which has become an increasingly challenging market due to geopolitical turbulence.\nWith these areas now largely derisked in our forecast, we look forward to faster growth beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2026. We expect this improvement to be generated by better commercial execution in Breast Health, easier comps in Surgical, Breast Health and Skeletal, organic growth from Endomagnetics and Gynesonics and new product introductions.\nNow I will turn the call over to Essex.\n\nEssex D. Mitchell\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThanks, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will first review our divisional revenue performance in the second quarter. Then I will discuss our exposure to the recently announced tariffs as they stand today.\nAs Steve said, we are pleased to deliver revenue in the second quarter at the high end of our guidance range. Our performance was driven by another strong quarter in Diagnostics and an accelerated recovery of product supply in our skeletal business.\nStarting with Diagnostics. Second quarter revenue of $453.6 million grew 1.5% or 5.2%, excluding COVID-related sales. Growth for the division continues to be led by the molecular diagnostics, which grew 1.7% or 7.8%, excluding COVID. Specifically, we benefited from the continued strong growth of our BV/CV/TV assay, higher sales of our respiratory assays and strong growth in our Biotheranostics oncology business.\nBV CV/TV continues to represent a significant opportunity for Hologic. Studies show that in the U.S. alone, over 20 million women experience vaginitis each year. We estimate that less than 40% of these women are being tested with older manual testing methods still representing a meaningful portion of this. Our Diagnostics team has been making great progress to address this unmet need by driving awareness and establishing reimbursement for our accurate high-throughput molecular diagnostic test.\nAs many of you who track the weekly CDC data now, the United States suffered through a severe flu season this year. This led to strong growth of our respiratory assays in the second quarter. As a reminder, these tests are run on our Panther Fusion sidecar. So heavy respiratory demand boost interest in Panther Fusion among our customer base and also opens up the door for menu consolidation, including with lab-developed tests.\nIn our Biotheranostics oncology business, we continue to see strong adoption of our breast cancer index test, a unique indicator that helps a woman understand whether she'll benefit from continued endocrine therapy.\nOffsetting some of the growth in our core molecular business this quarter was less HIV testing in Africa, which resulted from funding cuts to USAID that were previously discussed. Unfortunately, we're now seeing this affect other nonprofit organizations, resulting in a significant disruption to the testing infrastructure that had been in place in the region. It's worth noting that excluding lower product sales associated with our work in Africa, core molecular revenue would have grown at a low double-digit rate in the second quarter.\nIn our cytology and perinatal businesses, second quarter revenue declined 0.6%. Sales grew modestly in the U.S. as we continue to see adoption of our Genius AI product, but were offset by low single-digit decline internationally. International sales were affected by the ongoing physician strike in South Korea and lower hospital spending in China.\nMoving to Breast Health. Revenue of $356.2 million declined 6.9% or 9.2% organically, excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. As a reminder, when we updated guidance last quarter, we anticipated this would be a down year for gantry replacements. At the same time, we announced new leadership -- a new leadership team. We're excited by the progress this team has already made in 3 key areas, which are laying the foundation for better growth in the future.\nFirst, we've reorganized our sales team to have a clear split between our capital and disposable product sales reps. These selling processes require different skill sets, and we believe this reorg, combined with more concrete selling strategies will drive clear focus and improved performance within our commercial channels.\nSecond, the team has refined our end-of-life strategy for older gantries that still remain in the field. We have clear line of sight to where these older units are. And this month, we are rolling out a new offensive strategy that motivates both our customers and our own reps to upgrade these older units.\nThird, we began selling our Endomagnetics products directly through our own sales force in North America rather than through the distributor that Endomag had used in the past. By leveraging the capabilities of our commercial channel, we feel well positioned to address the significant market opportunity for wireless localization. Our Endomag team has strong momentum entering the second half of our fiscal year, and we continue to be excited about the acquisition overall.\nWhile our commercial team focuses on driving gantry upgrades, our service team continues to do an outstanding job with our current installed base of approximately 15,000 3D gantries worldwide. As Steve said, recurring service revenue grew strongly in the second quarter and now accounts for over 45% of total Breast Health revenue.\nIn Surgical, second quarter revenue of $162.5 million increased 5.1% or 1.1% organically, excluding Gynesonics. Our international surgical business grew 16.2% in the quarter, another strong result.\nAs our team continues to drive market development and awareness for our minimally invasive GYN products, we see meaningful runway ahead globally. Of note, we've seen great traction since we launched our Fluent Pro system late last year. This system helps improve the performance and the user experience of our MyoSure platform, which has resulted in strong customer feedback.\nWe were also excited to close the Gynesonics acquisition early in the second quarter. As mentioned on our last earnings call. Gynesonics financial results are meeting expectations, we're pleased with how the integration has progressed, and we're excited for this future opportunity.\nFinally, in our Skeletal business, second quarter revenue of $33 million grew 22.9%. Our team made great progress partnering with our third-party manufacturer to accelerate the production ramp of our DXA system in the quarter, exceeding our internal expectations.\nBefore turning the call over to Karleen, I wanted to provide some perspective on our exposure to tariffs that have recently been announced.\nAt a high level, the vast majority of our manufacturing is done here in the United States. For diagnostics, we manufacture in California, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We have a small production site in the U.K., but that primarily serves the international market. In Breast Health, our mammography manufacturing is all done in Delaware. We do export products to China that are made in the United States.\nManufacturing that's done outside of the U.S. is primarily for our surgical and interventional breast products. These products, excluding Gynesonics, are produced in Costa Rica. For Gynesonics and Skeletal, we use third-party manufacturers in Mexico, but we expect products made in Mexico to be substantially exempt from tariffs under the USMCA.\nWhen we analyze the tariffs that have been announced relative to our manufacturing activities, we forecast a gross impact of $20 million to $25 million a quarter. Roughly 2/3 of our exposure relates to tariffs from Costa Rica and about 15% from China. All other countries make up the rest.\nKarleen will discuss how these increased costs will affect the balance sheet and income statement. But before I turn the call over to her, let me say that our estimates do not include higher prices that our suppliers may attempt to pass on to us, but they also do not include potential offsets from the many mitigation efforts we have underway.\nIn the short term, we do not anticipate much pricing flexibility since most of our affected sales are made under long-term contracts. But like every multinational company, we are implementing and exploring a number of potential actions to mitigate the financial impact of tariffs in whatever form they may eventually take. Obviously, this is a fluid situation that may continue to change, and we will remain flexible.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will start by walking through the rest of our non-GAAP income statement, touch on several key financial metrics, then finish with our guidance for fiscal Q3 and the full year.\nIn the second quarter, we delivered EPS of $1.03 at the high end of our guidance range. In addition to posting solid revenue, we exercised disciplined expense management and utilized multiple levers such as share repurchases and tax efficiency to drive strong profitability for the quarter.\nStarting with non-GAAP gross margin. We finished the quarter at 61.1%, improving by 40 basis points compared to the prior year. The primary drivers of this improvement were strong diagnostic sales as well as adding Endomag and Gynesonics to our corporate profile. Their accretive gross margins create a solid foundation and clear pathway to operating profitability over time.\nMoving down the P&L. Second quarter operating expenses of $312.9 million increased 1.7%. This increase was driven by the inclusion of Endomag and Gynesonics in our results. Excluding these deals, operating expenses would have decreased 4.6%, reflecting good expense control in a period of lower revenue.\nSecond quarter operating margin finished at 30%, a strong result considering we are integrating 2 acquisitions. Although operating margin decreased by 40 basis points compared to the prior year, it increased 60 basis points sequentially despite lower absolute revenue.\nBelow operating income, other income net was a loss in our fiscal second quarter of slightly more than $14 million. This loss was roughly in line with our expectations but greater than the prior year as we generated less interest income given our capital deployment activity.\nFinally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19%. This reflected a true-up to match our new expected full year effective tax rate of 19.25%.\nAltogether, net margin for the quarter was 23.2%, decreasing 80 basis points compared to the prior year, but still excellent compared to our peers.\nOur strong profitability helped us generate a tremendous amount of cash flow. Over time, this has contributed to our fortress balance sheet, as Steve said. As a result, we have the ability to execute on both tuck-in M&A and share repurchases.\nIn the second quarter, for example, we closed the Gynesonics acquisition for approximately $350 million while also buying back 3 million shares for $200 million. This repurchase activity drove our weighted average diluted share count down to 227 million, a decrease of over 10 million shares compared to the prior year. Combined, these results led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, another quarter of delivering at the high end of our guidance range.\nWith growing uncertainty in the geopolitical environment, our balance sheet and cash flow have us well positioned to navigate whatever comes next. In the second quarter, we generated cash flow of $169.5 million and exited the quarter with over $1.6 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full fiscal year and third quarter. While we are staying nimble in the face of rapid geopolitical changes, the tariffs announced in early April and the ensuing trade war in China are impacting our financial forecast in 2 main ways.\nFirst, even though we manufacture mainly in the U.S., as Essex said, tariffs related mostly to Costa Rica and China will increase inventory acquisition costs by $20 million to $25 million per quarter this year. From an accounting standpoint, we record these costs as inventory as they are incurred, then amortize them through the P&L over inventory turns. This means that in the income statement, we expect cost of goods sold to increase by about $5 million in the third quarter and by almost $20 million in the fourth quarter. These estimates assume no changes in policy and do not include the potential mitigation efforts that we have underway.\nSecond, as China becomes increasingly difficult for U.S.-based companies, we are lowering our forecasted China revenue for the year by roughly $20 million. We now expect only about $50 million in revenue from China in fiscal 2025, which we believe largely de-risks us from future geopolitical turmoil.\nTo reflect the net impact of these items on our annual outlook, we are lowering our non-GAAP EPS guidance range by $0.10, $4.15 to $4.25. At the same time, we are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $4.05 billion to $4.10 billion as the weakening U.S. dollar is roughly compensating for the reduction in China revenue.\nFor the third quarter, we are expecting total revenues of $1 billion to $1.01 billion and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.04 to $1.07. We still anticipate solid growth in our fourth quarter, in line with our longer-term expectations.\nBecause of the weaker U.S. dollar, we now forecast currency to represent a headwind of approximately $10 million to $15 million for the full year and a negligible headwind in the fiscal third quarter.\nIn terms of the divisions, our outlook from our prior guidance remains largely unchanged. We still expect Diagnostics to grow mid-single digits for the year, excluding the impact of the declining COVID-19 sales. Strong growth from our BV CV/TV assay and Biotheranostics oncology business will be partially offset by declining sales of our HIV test in Africa due to the federal funding cuts and lower sales in China.\nFor COVID revenue, we expect assay sales to be about $5 million in the third quarter and approximately $35 million to $40 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the third quarter and $100 million to $105 million for the year.\nFinally, in Diagnostics, we expect blood screening revenue of about $6 million in Q3 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year.\nAs a reminder, both COVID-related sales and blood screening revenues are backed out of our organic growth calculations.\nWithin Breast Health, we still expect a low single-digit decline for the full year on a reported basis and a mid-single-digit decline organically. As discussed on our last earnings call, we are forecasting lower gantry sales this year following 2 years of elevated shipments. We continue to expect Breast Health to return to healthy growth in the fourth quarter.\nLastly, in Surgical, we still forecast this business to grow high single digits for the year, driven by the Gynesonics acquisition. We expect Surgical to grow in the low single digits organically, driven by strong international sales and continued adoption of our new Fluent Pro fluid management system.\nMoving to the rest of the P&L. We expect gross margins in the low 60s for the full year. We forecast gross margins to decline sequentially from Q3 to Q4 as the P&L impact of the tariffs becomes more significant.\nFor operating margin, we continue to expect low 30s for the full year, which is very healthy.\nBelow operating income, we estimate other income net to be an expense of approximately $20 million in Q3 and an expense of approximately $55 million to $60 million for the full year.\nOur annual effective tax rate of 19.25% reflects a 25 basis point savings from our prior guidance. Diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 228 million for the full year.\nTo conclude, in our second quarter, we were pleased to deliver on our financial commitments with revenue and EPS both at the high end of our guidance ranges. Tariffs in China are new headwinds that will affect our results this year, but we continue to be excited about building on strong market positions in our core businesses. We expect to make good progress on these efforts in the second half of our fiscal year and to exit the fourth quarter with improved growth rates.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Lisa, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Mike Watts, Corporate Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Go ahead, sir.\n\nMichael J. Watts\n\nVice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Communications, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lisa. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2025 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them, and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we'd like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement that's included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are organic revenue which we define as revenue, excluding divested businesses and revenue of acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year. Also, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nGood afternoon, everyone. I'd like to begin today by welcoming Mike back to the Hologic team. We are all excited to have him back. And now we are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nAs we pre-announced last month, Total revenue for the quarter was $1.022 billion, an increase of 1% on a constant currency basis. This was in line with our guidance as the stronger dollar subtracted about $9 million from reported revenue since we guided in early November. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.03, at the high end of our guidance range and an increase of 5%. This reflected strong improvement in non-GAAP operating margins of 90 basis points as well as share buybacks and the benefits of our foreign exchange hedging program.\nIn my remarks today, I'd like to revisit some of the themes from our presentation at the JPMorgan conference last month. In that discussion, we reflected back on Hologic's strong financial performance since 2014. Our main point, however, was not about the past. It was that we believe we can continue to grow revenue and earnings at similar rates in the future.\nWhy do we believe that? Because of our market-leading products and the strong organizational capabilities, we have steadily built around them. To be more specific, from 2014 through 2024, Hologic grew revenue from about $2.5 billion to more than $4 billion. This represented a compound annual growth rate of 4.8%, including all our acquisitions and divestitures along the way. Over the same period, non-GAAP earnings per share increased from $1.46 to $4.08, representing a CAGR of 10.8%, more than double the rate of sales growth.\nAt JPMorgan, our primary message was that we believe we can continue to grow earnings at a double-digit rate in the future. While some years like this one may be below this level, we are confident in our future and still believe this is an appropriate long-term goal. The financial algorithm that will get us there includes a continuing of mid-single-digit growth on the top line, modest expansion of our already best-in-class operating margin and a healthy mix of acquisitions and share buybacks to increase our revenue and EPS growth rates.\nThe foundation for this expected performance, of course, lies in our market-leading brands, which generate a tremendous amount of reliable cash flow. From Panther, Aptima and Thin Prep in Diagnostics, to Genius and Breast Health to MyoSure and NovaSure and Surgical, we enjoy leading market shares that have proven durable over time.\nMuch of our growth comes from building around these brands and using the cash they generate to drive future innovation. For example, we now have more than 20 assays or Panther and Panther Fusion platforms. We have built a reliable service business in Breast Health that is now larger than our capital sales, which can be more volatile. And we are adding products to our Surgical division, both organically and inorganically to leverage our excellent sales channel.\nBest-in-class products don't just happen. Instead, they are the result of several organizational capabilities that we have very deliberately built and nurtured over time. And these capabilities give us confidence in our ability to hit our financial targets in the future. For example, our 7,000 employees around the world are motivated by a passion for women's health. They have demonstrated an ability to create and expand markets for the benefit of patients and customers and to redefine clinical standards of care. Examples include transitioning traditional Pap testing to liquid Pap and now adding digital capabilities to catch more cancers and improve workflow. And more recently, we have partnered with our customers to literally create a market for high throughput vaginitis testing, which has fueled our second largest molecular diagnostics test on the Panther system.\nMany of these successes originated in the United States, but we have now built the capabilities to grow internationally on a consistent basis. We continue to go direct in more geographies and businesses, most recently in our Surgical division, while strengthening our market access capabilities around the globe. Similarly, we have learned from past mistakes and improved our business development capabilities. We have strengthened our talent and processes for conducting due diligence on new targets, cultivating relationships with them and integrating acquired assets more effectively. This internal maturation have been reflected in the solid performance of some of our more recent acquisitions. For example, Biotheranostics, Endomagnetics and Gynesonics should all boost our revenue growth rate. These organizational capabilities give us confidence in the future especially our ability to a consistent double-digit earnings compounder and deliver value shareholders reliably over time.\nNow I will turn the call over to Essex.\n\nEssex D. Mitchell\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will first review our divisional revenue performance in the first quarter. Then I'll provide a little color on Gynesonics, a tuck-in acquisition we recently closed in our Surgical business that we are excited about.\nAs Steve said, we made our revenue guidance on a constant currency basis in the first quarter, growing 1%. At the highest level, we outperformed in diagnostics, but lagged in Breast health. Surgical and skeletal were roughly in line with our expectations. Our Diagnostics business continues to be one of the best-performing diversified asset in the space, and Q1 was another strong quarter. Revenue of $470.6 million grew 5.2% and 9.1% organically excluding COVID. Growth for the division continues to be led by molecular diagnostics, which grew 6.7% or 11% excluding COVID. Within molecular, our Biotheranostics lab testing business continued to grow at a healthy double-digit rate, and our BV CV/TV assay also had another outstanding quarter of strong double-digit growth.\nWe believe we are only in the middle innings of realizing the total opportunity for this test. For example, we have just begun using our physician sales force to expand the vaginitis testing market in the U.S., leveraging the same playbook we have used to grow our legacy women's health test.\nOur core women's health assays that run on our audited Panther platform also had a strong performance in the quarter. We often get investor questions about competition and diagnostics. So I want to be clear, these assays have held leading market positions for some time, and our sales force continues to win new business and grow that share despite an always competitive environment.\nAlthough respiratory testing is a relatively small piece of our business, it is seasonal and can vary significantly based on flu prevalence. This quarter, the respiratory season started slowly but worsened in late December. As a result, non-COVID respiratory sales finished close to our expectations for the quarter. These respiratory tests as well as many of the other assays we have in development run on our Panther Fusion sidecar. For our customers, having a Panther Fusion is the key to unlocking our full menu. We have been pleased to see our sales force grow the attachment rate of the Panther Fusion in recent quarters. Nearly 40% of our U.S. customers now have a fusion system.\nIn our cytology and perinatal business within Diagnostics, we saw higher-than-average growth of 4.7% for the quarter. As a reminder, sales in the prior year quarter were slightly depressed, resulting in an easier comp for the current period.\nMoving to breast health. Total first quarter revenue of $369.1 million were disappointing. Sales declined 2.1% or 5.8% organically when excluding SSI and Endomagnetics. The decline versus prior year was primarily driven by lower sales of capital equipment. However, we continue to see strong growth in service revenue tends to be more steady than gantry sales, reflecting our long-term strategy to diversify revenue in this business service accounted for more than 40% of sales in Q1.\nAs we've analyzed the breast health market recently, we have concluded that 2025 will be a softer year for gantry placements than we initially expected. This is for a few reasons. As we recovered from the chip shortage, we saw multiple quarters of sustained double-digit growth in mammography. This clouded our picture of what a normal gantry market would look like entering 2025 and made for tough comps. Now that we have upgraded most 2D units in the United States to our 3D standard of care, our challenge is drive 3D to 3D conversions. In this context, we are seeing customers lengthen their replacement cycles, especially those who are considering our new M. gen platform, which we expect to launch commercially next year.\nOn the bright side, our competitive position remains strong, and we have received very positive feedback on Envision since we introduced it at RSNA, which gives us long-term confidence. Customers are excited about the systems better image quality, patient experience and workflow. Outside of the United States, we are also seeing pressure on capital investments as many private and government hospital customers struggle with local budgetary constraints.\nTurning to our interventional breast health business, we are pleased with the integration and performance of Endomagnetics, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 and is well positioned for a strong year. We are excited about Endomag's innovative market products, but also its R&D capabilities, which will provide opportunities to further broaden our interventional breast portfolio.\nIn Surgical, first quarter revenue of $166.3 million increased 2.5%. Q1 was another strong quarter for our International Surgical business, with growth of nearly 20%. In the U.S., results were in line with our expectations considering the temporary headwind of the IV fluid shortage that we discussed on our core earnings call. Most of our customers saw their IV fluid constraints resolved and exited the quarter, so we do not expect to have -- this to have a significant impact going forward.\nFinally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $15.8 million decreased 37.4%, as shipping for some of our Horizon dexa units resumed later in the quarter than originally anticipated. We expect the manufacturing of these units to progressively ramp up to full capacity before returning to normal in the third quarter.\nBefore I hand the call over to Karleen, I wanted to highlight the Gynesonics acquisition that we completed in January. We're excited to introduce their SOMATEX system into our surgical portfolio. SOMATEX is a minimally invasive radio frequency ablation tool used to treat uterine fibroids that are less accessible by MyoSure or Accesa. So it's highly complementary to our current portfolio in nicely into our sales bags of the largest commercial channel we have.\nGynesonics had about $28 million of revenue in its most recent fiscal year, including a healthy mix of international sales. We expect sales to grow at a healthy dual-digit rate in the hands of our large GY sales force. Gynesonics' gross margin is solid, although planned investments will make the acquisition slightly dilutive to non-GAAP EPS this year.\nAs Steve mentioned, shining our business development capabilities has been a key focus for the organization in recent years. In each division and at the corporate level we now have teams in place that bring a deep understanding of the respective end market and significant experience in diligence and integration. The success of recent deals like Biotheranostics, Endomagnetics and our good start with Gynesonics, give us confidence in our ability to identify and integrate future deals. As we've said many times, accessing high-growth adjacent markets through successful M&A will be key to our growth strategy moving forward.\nWith that, I'll hand the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my comments today, I will start by walking through the rest of our non-GAAP income statement, then touch on several key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for fiscal Q2 and the full year.\nLet me begin by saying we are pleased to grow non-GAAP earnings per share by 5% this quarter when revenue only grew 1%. Although we clearly want revenue to grow faster and we believe it will, this demonstrates the substantial operating leverage you can generate and gives us confidence that we can grow earnings at a double-digit rate over time.\nSo how did we do that in the first quarter? Start, non-GAAP gross margin of 61.6% increased 80 basis points. This margin expansion was primarily the result of favorable product mix and operating efficiencies.\nMoving down the P&L. First quarter operating expenses of $329 million, increased approximately 0.5%. As a reminder, Q1 usually represents our highest level of operating expense for the year due to several large commercial initiatives. Despite this, the year-over-year increase was driven by the addition of Endomagnetics. Excluding Endomagnetics, operating expenses would have decreased 2.3%.\nFirst quarter operating margin finished at 29.4%, representing an increase of 90 basis points. This operating margin expansion came primarily from drop-through of our higher gross margin and good expenditure. As Steve said, leveraging the P&L to drive modest margin expansion from already best-in-class levels and strong EPS growth remains a key focus.\nBelow operating income, other income net loss in our fiscal first quarter by slightly more than $4 million. This result was better than expected due to the benefit of our foreign exchange hedging program. As a reminder, this hedging program seeks to minimize the negative or positive bottom line impact of currency fluctuations.\nFinally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.5% as expected. Altogether, net margin for the quarter was 23.4%, approximately flat to the prior year and very strong relative to our diagnostics and Medtech peers. Because we have tremendous confidence in our long-term future, we continue to bet on ourselves and use our balance sheet to enhance shareholder value.\nIn the first quarter, we repurchased 6.8 million shares for a total of $517 million, including the completion of the $250 million ASR announced on our Q4 earnings call. As a result, we brought our weighted average diluted share count down to $232 million, a decrease of 8 million shares compared to the prior year. All of this led to non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.03, which we were pleased to deliver at the high end of our guidance range.\nWith strong operating cash flow of $189 million in the first quarter and $2 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter, we are well positioned to continue to execute our capital deployment strategy to drive both top and bottom line growth.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the full fiscal year and for the second half. I'd like to start by acknowledging the dramatic shift in the geopolitical and macro environment since we first provided guidance in early November. As everyone knows, we are seeing an immediate impact from the new administration in the U.S., both in terms of policy changes and a strengthening U.S. dollar.\nEntering the new calendar year, we also have greater visibility on our end market landscape for 2025. Combining these pieces together, we are using this opportunity to reset our financial expectations for the year. For the full year, we are lowering our revenue guidance range by $100 million to $4.05 billion to $4.10 billion, but we are maintaining our non-GAAP EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.35.\nOur Diagnostics and Surgical businesses are performing well, and we are adding roughly $25 million of Gynesonics' revenue to our reported results. However, these positive developments are being offset by 3 factors: First, like everyone else, we have experienced a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar since early November. We now expect FX to represent a headwind of $30 million for the full year. This represents a swing of more than $60 million from our original expectations, which we are baking into our reduced guidance today. Second, we are expecting lower sale of our Breast Health capital for the year. As Essex detailed, we didn't have a clear picture of the gantry market, which led to 2 aggressive forecast for 2025, especially considering that our next-generation gantry is still a ways off.\nThird, two potential policy changes in the new U.S. administration are introducing uncertainty in our business. First, the freeze on F&D has affected our main partner for HIV testing in developing countries. The President's Emergency Plan for AID Release or pet far. Although Pet far has been granted an exemption based on the life-saving work they do, activities on the ground have still been disrupted. This disruption could affect our revenue by as much as $30 million for the balance of our fiscal year. Second, contract manufacturers in Mexico make our skeletal and Gynesonics products. So we could be subject to tariffs that lower our gross margins as we import them into the United States. Although these are relatively small pieces of our businesses and the tariffs have been delayed for now, we believe it is appropriate to risk adjust our forecast for the potential impact.\nDespite these headwinds, we are maintaining our full year EPS guidance of $4.25 to $4.35. The strong financial discipline and capabilities we've established as an organization are enabling us to mitigate the bottom line impact of these issues.\nFor the second quarter, we are expecting total revenues in the range of $995 million to $1.005 billion, including a $10 million FX headwind and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1 to $1.03.\nNow let me provide some additional details that underpin our guidance. In terms of quarterly pacing, we expect our revenue growth rate to improve in the third quarter and further in Q4. So we should exit the year above our long-term mid-single-digit target on a quarterly basis. In terms of the divisions, we expect Diagnostics to grow mid-single digits for the year, excluding the impact of declining COVID-19 sales. We continue to forecast that growth will be driven by strength in our molecular women's health assays and Biotheranostics' lab testing.\nFor COVID revenue, we expect assay sales to be about $9 million in the second quarter and approximately $35 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the second quarter and approximately $100 million for the year.\nFinally, in Diagnostics, we expect led screen revenue about $5 million in Q2 and about $20 million for the full year. As you know, both COVID-related sales and led screening revenue are backed out of our organic growth calculation.\nWithin Breast Health, as mentioned, we are lowering our expectations for the full year based on softer capital equipment sales. We now expect this business to decline in the low single digits for the full year, including Endomagnetics. We do, however, expect revenue growth to build in the second half with good year-over-year growth in Q4 as we exit our fiscal year.\nLastly, in Surgical, we expect high single-digit growth for the year with the inclusion of Gynesonics in our results for the 3 quarters. In our core surgical business, we expect growth to be powered by international with contributions in the U.S. for MyoSure fluid.\nMoving to the P&L. We expect gross margin in the low 60s for the full year. We anticipate gross margins to step up in the second half with higher sales the elimination of redundant manufacturing facilities in Breast Health, in sales and Endomagnetics.\nFor operating margin, we're expecting to be in the low 30s for the full year, with steady margin expansion as we move through the year. Below operating income, which made other income net to be an expense of $10 million to $15 million in Q2, in an expense between $40 million and $45 million for the full fiscal year. Our effective tax rate of approximately 19.5% for the full year means unchanged from our prior guidance. To reflect the share repurchase activity we completed in Q1, diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $130 million for the full year.\nTo conclude, our financial discipline and strength have us in a position to meet our EPS commitments even in a year where we're seeing pressure on the top line. We believe these pressures are largely transitory in nature, and we expect top line growth to be healthy as we exit the year. We feel great about the long-term outlook for each of our divisions, driven by our ability to retain and grow our market-leading positions while continuing to add new growth drivers through internal innovation and business development.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer.\nOur third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, other revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\nTotal revenue for Q3 was $1.01 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both again above the high end of our guidance. Importantly, we are excited that with COVID now mostly in the rearview mirror, our reported revenue has returned to growth. Our strong performance goes beyond the top line and shines throughout the P&L.\nFor the quarter, we delivered a solid 31.2% operating margin and deployed $100 million during the quarter to repurchase 1.4 million shares. All in, the $1.06 in EPS translates to 14% growth on the bottom line, a very strong result and also very encouraging as we flip the script now, to reported revenue and EPS growth again.\nLooking back to the start of our fiscal year. We knew there were still certain questions on some investors' minds about the true strength and durability of our underlying business. These were questions that surfaced as we exited a period of uncertainty, created by the pandemic, followed by the global chip shortage. While we and many long-term investors understood the power and potential of our transformed much stronger business, we acknowledge that these unanswered questions created barriers for some of those newer to Hologic.\nAs usual, rather than rely on words, we knew it would be our performance that would emphatically answer these questions and clearly demonstrate that we are indeed a bigger, faster, stronger company than before the pandemic. Our third quarter performance should make this very clear.\nIn Q3, we bent the top line curve to green after 11 quarters of COVID-driven declines. Our top line reported revenue returned to growth at 3.1% versus last year. Organic ex-COVID, we delivered healthy 5.8% growth. And we achieved these strong results on top of exceptionally strong 18.4% organic ex-COVID growth last year.\nTurning to our themes for today. First, we would like to recap our performance since the start of the fiscal year by answering 5 key questions which were on many investors' minds. Second, we'll pass the call over to Essex who will highlight certain overlooked elements of our broad-based international growth as well as provide an update on M&A activities. On to our first theme. The top 5 questions, which have been out there.\nOne, will path or utilization continue to grow? Two, will Breast Health return to full strength and maintain market leadership? Three, will Hologic return to delivering industry-leading 30% plus operating margins? Four, with a $2.4 billion cash position, will Hologic be successful in deploying capital? And finally, five, can Hologic maintained its cervical cancer screening leadership if USPSTF issues and adverse cervical cancer screening guidelines?\nThe short answer to all 5 is, without a doubt, yes. We will continue to thrive. From here, we'll take each question in order.\nFirst, our Molecular Diagnostics business continues to deliver and is so much bigger and stronger than it was prior to the pandemic. Our global installed base of Panthers now exceeds 3,300 and is rock solid. More importantly, our customers continue to praise and utilize our platform. Panther's superior workflow, automation, ease of use and constantly expanding menu continues to drive demand and differentiate us in a competitive environment. In quite simple terms, revenue per Panther and number of assays run for Panther continue to grow, with the simple metric being our Molecular Diagnostics growth rate.\nIn Q3, our molecular business, excluding COVID, grew 10.5% on top of 12.9% growth in the prior year period. We've now delivered high single to double-digit performance in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Quarter after quarter, year-over-year, we continue to deliver by expanding utilization and our outlook remains bright.\nSecond, our Breast Health results continue to demonstrate a profound strength in breast cancer screening. Our gantry business is well on pace to fully recover from the chip shortage, and we continue to maintain our leadership position. Our supply chain is much improved and now fortified from successfully navigating the chip shortage experience.\nOver a decade from the initial launch of our breakthrough 3D mammography, customers still view Hologic as leaders in performance, including image quality and scan time leaders in service and leaders in customer satisfaction. Letting the numbers speak for themselves, in Q3, we delivered 7.1% growth in Breast Health, on top of 27.5% growth in the prior year period. The business is more diverse than ever and continuing to add in even more recurring revenue with our Endomagnetics acquisition.\nThird, operating margins. As Karleen will share in more detail later, we delivered a 31.2% operating margin in our third quarter, a 230 basis point improvement from the prior year period and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially. At the highest level, we are now back to delivering pre-COVID margins even with our international business being over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Consistent with our expectations, we recaptured our strong sector margin profile by maintaining focus on operational efficiency and moving past the amortization of higher-priced chips purchased during the chip shortage.\nFourth, on capital deployment, our balance sheet and cash flow remain incredibly robust. As announced last week, we recently closed the [ Endomagnetics ] acquisition, a transaction that we view as straight down the fairway in terms of execution within our broader M&A strategy. Overall, the deal is a prudent investment of capital that we expect to add revenue, margin and EPS accretion over time. Together, we have an incredible opportunity to improve interventional breast care for women.\nOn top of closing the Endomag deal, we continue to demonstrate that we are willing to bet on ourselves and repurchase shares. As a baseline, we are looking to offset dilution from our internal share plans. And from there, with our strong cash position, we look to layer on additional share repurchases. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased 10.5 million shares for $750 million. We plan to continue on our capital allocation path and fully intend for our deployment strategy to include both M&A and share repurchases.\nAnd finally, before turning the call over to Essex, USPSTF. As we've done for nearly 30 years in cervical cancer screening, no matter the direction the USPSTF may take for its cervical cancer guidelines, we will navigate the landscape and remain strong.\nOverall, we achieved our strong results by maintaining our long-term focus and commitment to women's health. As we shared on our Q2 call, the strength of Hologic lies in the sum of our parts. We expect our results to continue to answer the call and speak for themselves, while we continue to demonstrate our durable strength, quarter-after-quarter, year-over-year.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to share insight on international growth drivers and more on Endomagnetics.\n\nDerik De Bruin\n\nManaging Director of Equity Research\n\nThank you, Steve. Overall, our third quarter performance speaks to the successful implementation of our growth strategy, building multiple durable growth drivers into our franchises around the world. Today, we'd like to quickly highlight three specific growth drivers from international diagnostics and surgical. These drivers are sometimes overlooked because of their strong market shares in the U.S. However, we still have a great growth opportunity outside of the United States.\nThat said, internationally, molecular [ STI ] testing, cytology and MyoSure, all delivered nice growth in the quarter. This underscores the power of the sum of our parts and reinforces our opportunity and ability to grow by expanding markets.\nLet's start with STI testing, the largest category in our Global Molecular Diagnostics business. In the U.S., SBI testing is our largest category, and we have earned and maintained leadership for years. Internationally, we are still in the early days of leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. We have a sizable opportunity to increase our share, not only in STI testing but across all the categories where we offer testing. We have a long runway ahead of us as we continue to build the new markets we've entered. With several irons in the fire, we expect to layer in more contribution over time, driven by more assays and more volume on our Panther systems.\nThe same can be said for cytology and cervical cancer screening. In some regions of the world, we are bringing liquid-based Pap tests to the market for the first time and subsequently growing the market. While overshadowed by the U.S. revenue, international cytology, like STI testing has meaningful revenue that moved the needle over time.\nShifting to Surgical and MyoSure. While MyoSure is still growing strong in the U.S., the MyoSure International growth rate is even higher. This is possible because international markets are vastly underpenetrated, and demand remained high for our minimally invasive option for treating uterine polyps and fibroids. In many regions, we are the first and only minimally invasive alternative to a complete hysterectomy. And it's our belief that all women should have access to this minimally invasive option.\nAll in, while it is clear that certain products across our portfolio more established in the U.S., what is not as obvious is that there are meaningful market expansion opportunities for these same products internationally. As leaders in these areas, and champions for women's health, we are well positioned to capitalize on this global growth opportunity.\nAnd finally, before turning the call over to Karleen, I'd like to provide more detail on [ Endomagnetics ]. As Steve mentioned, we are pleased to welcome the Endomag team to Hologic. 150 employees strong and with seasoned management and R&D capabilities, the company has done an incredible job growing the business to what it has become today. That includes 500,000 plus women treated and adoption by over 1,300 hospitals in over 45 countries. Endomag products include [indiscernible] markers for wireless lesion localization, [ Mag Trace ] for lymphatic tracing and [indiscernible] a simple, easy-to-use handheld device to visualize both. [indiscernible] portfolio enables us to provide robust and differentiated offerings to meet demand in the growing interventional breast surgery market.\nFrom an investment perspective, the business directly aligns with our Breast Health franchise and has proven on-market products that are well accepted into clinical workflows. With our established de rooted sales channels, we expect to amplify revenue growth well above our corporate average and also expect both margin and earnings accretion over time. Overall, we are excited to join forces and determine to go even further together.\nNow I'll turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on certain key financial metrics, and finish with our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal 2024.\nOur third quarter financial results were robust, once again exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability, building on the momentum from the first half of the year. To recap high-level results, total revenue came in at $1.11 billion, beating the midpoint of our prior guidance by $11 million. We delivered 3.1% revenue growth and organic revenue growth of 5.8%, excluding COVID. In addition, non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, growing 14% and exceeding the high end of our prior guidance by $0.01.\nBefore moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q3, we generated over $400 million in cash from operating activities, ending the quarter with $2.4 billion on the balance sheet, deployed $100 million on share repurchases and announced the acquisition of Endo-Magnetics. We continue to demonstrate that our strong cash balance, leverage ratio well below our target range and the ability to generate cash consistently provides us flexibility to fund innovation and pull both levers of our capital allocation strategy, tuck-in M&A and share repurchases at the same time. Moving forward, we still have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital diligently as opportunities arrive.\nTurning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, third quarter revenue of $440.8 million grew 0.7%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, Worldwide Diagnostics grew by 6%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.5% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in [ BBCBTV ], which continues its outstanding growth trajectory and has become our second largest assay globally. Additionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales declined sequentially from Q2, in line with the flu season. However, year-over-year growth remains strong highlighting the continued adoption of, [ Four Plex COVID, Blue A, Blue B ] and RSV assay. And finally, Biotheranostics continues to be accretive to growth for our molecular business.\nRounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal declined 2.9% globally with U.S. declines, partially offset by solid international growth as Essex highlighted earlier. As a reminder, in fiscal 3 '23, customers built up cytology inventory levels in the U.S. due to third price shipping constraints in Q2 '23, leading to elevated sales in the prior year period. While the cytology business has largely returned to normal, year-over-year growth rates were impacted. Looking ahead, we expect flat to modest growth in the cytology business.\nMoving on to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $385 million increased by 7.1% or 8.2% when excluding SSI. Within Breast Health, growth was primarily driven by breast imaging, with solid domestic and international results, contributing 7.2% and 12.1% growth, respectively, excluding SSI. Third quarter performance was driven largely by increased gantry shipments and robust service revenue growth that continues to contribute meaningfully.\nContinuing next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $166.6 million increased 6.2%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure and their related fluent fluid management system. Our [ laproscopi ] business, which while smaller in dollars, grew significantly in the quarter and continues to progress nicely. Additionally, international continues to be a bright spot, growing just under 20% in the quarter.\nFinally, in our Skeletal Business, third quarter revenue of $19 million declined 29.7% due to lower horizon [ DEXA ] shipments resulting from a temporary stop ship related to a nonconformance issue. We are working with our supplier to resolve the situation and expect to resume shipments during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin was 61.1% for the quarter, a 30 basis point improvement from the prior year period, even though COVID assay revenue declines continue to be a headwind. Additionally, gross margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially from fiscal Q2, primarily driven by favorable product mix. Total operating expenses of $302.8 million in the third quarter decreased by 3.5%. This decrease was driven primarily by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI businesses.\nOperating margin was 31.2% for the third quarter. The year-over-year increase of 230 basis points was driven by top line growth, expanding gross margins and lower operating expenses. Sequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 20 -- I'm sorry, 80 basis points from Q2, largely from lower operating expenses and higher gross margin in Q3.\nBelow operating income, other income net represented an expense of nearly $3 million in our fiscal third quarter. Interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases we have completed throughout the fiscal year. Additionally, interest expense is up due to higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 19.75% as expected.\nNow let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q4 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $970 million to $985 million, and EPS of $0.97 to $1.04. For the full year fiscal 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of 4.012 billion to $4.027 billion, and EPS of $4.04 to $4.11. Unpacking this guidance, we lowered the midpoint of our prior revenue guidance by $5 million. This represents about a $20 million headwind related to the temporary [ skeletal ] health stop ship previously mentioned, partially offset by our strong performance in Q3 and in the inclusion of an estimated $4 million to $5 million of revenue from Endo-Magnetics now that we have closed the acquisition.\nWith respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming Q4 will have a headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we are now expecting a slight tailwind of about $3 million.\nTurning to our franchises. We expect Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical to grow mid-single digits in Q4 and full year fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. As a reminder, fiscal '24 has 4 fewer selling days compared to fiscal '23, which we estimated to be a headwind of more than 100 basis points for the full year.\nStarting with Diagnostics. In Q4, we expect Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID, as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our broad Panther menu.\nIn cytology and perinatal, we expect growth in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, however, we expect the business to perform flat to Q3. In Q4 last year, sales dropped below typical ordering patterns due to the inventory buildup in Q3 of '23. We expect cytology and perinatal comps to stabilize in fiscal year '25.\nClosing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $6 million in Q4 and $20 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $7 million in Q4 '24 and about $70 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be about $25 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year.\nMoving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business mid-single digits for the fourth quarter. We expect to see solid gantry placements in Q4, continuing the steady performance we have delivered year-to-date. The demand for our portfolio of products and services remain strong, and we have solid visibility into gantry orders. Further, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We are successfully managing resource availability among both our install teams and our customers, as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints.\nFinally, in Surgical, we anticipate Q4 revenue to grow mid-single digits. We expect the growth to continue to come from MyoSure fluent and our laparoscopy division -- business.\nMoving next to margins. Our guidance continues to assume a cadence of improvements moving into Q4. For both gross margin and operating margin, we remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s for gross margin. Our guidance also assumes Q4 operating margins in the low 30s, and we are on pace to finish fiscal '24 between 30% to 31%, which includes the stub period of Endo-Magnetics.\nBelow operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $8 million in Q4 and $11 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $238 million for the full year.\nTo conclude, Q3 was another strong quarter for Hologic. We continue to deliver robust growth and quality earnings. As we approach the end of fiscal year 2024 and look ahead to 2025, we are excited by the performance across all our franchises and the additional strength provided by a pristine balance sheet. As always, our stakeholders can count on us to deliver while also advancing the state of women's health around the world.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essex Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer.\nOur second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking.

MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance, reflecting another strong quarter.\nSimilar to Q1, it is again important to view our Q2 performance in proper perspective. As we shared on our Q1 earnings call in February, throughout 2024, we faced double-digit comps, massive comps in the first half and still very strong comps in the second. As a reminder, in Q2 of last year, organic Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID posted growth of nearly 25%. And both Surgical and Breast Health posted phenomenal growth of over 25%. This year, in Q2, on top of the high growth rates from a year ago, we grew our Molecular Diagnostics business, ex COVID at 10.7%. Our surgical business, 7.4%, and our Breast Health business 1%, excluding the divested SSI business, a solid result given the elevated gantry placements in Q2 a year ago.\nWe also delivered operating margins of 30.4% in Q2, improving 190 basis points sequentially from Q1 and setting us up nicely to approach 31% for the full fiscal year. Now past the halfway point of fiscal '24, we believe we are in an excellent position to achieve our full year goals.\nBefore moving on to our themes for today, our fiscal second quarter marks the fourth anniversary of when the COVID virus changed the world. When COVID initially surged, we had 3 goals: one, ensure that we take care of our employees; two, make a huge difference in the world with our Panther system and COVID testing. And three, emerge as a bigger, stronger, faster growing company in a post-pandemic world.\nFast forward to today, as you can see from our results, we have delivered against these 3 goals, and we're aiming for more. Not only did we achieve our primary objectives, we also successfully managed to strengthen all of our franchises, both in the U.S. and internationally, remain innovative and disciplined in executing our growth strategies and build a fortress balance sheet to facilitate future growth.\nOn top of these achievements, we continue to elevate our already high employee engagement scores and all through complicated macro challenges. That said, we are never satisfied and firmly believe the best is still ahead. As we look further out beyond the horizon, we see significant potential to continue to innovate and unlock growth opportunities for years to come.\nNow on to our 3 themes for today. First, our core franchises Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical continued to showcase the benefits of our diverse portfolio. As planned, we continue to yield robust growth and durability because we benefit from being both Diagnostics and Medtech. Second, our international business quietly continues to drive strong top line growth. demonstrating our ability to capture potential growth opportunities and turn them into reality. And third, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, empower us to fortify our foundation as we've done this week with the announcement of the Endomagnetics acquisition. We have the ability to build on our strength with significant operational flexibility, which allows us multiple levers to deliver top and bottom line performance.\nTurning to our first theme. Sometimes overlooked and misunderstood, the strength of our business comes from the sum of our parts. We are a unique collection of Diagnostics and Medtech businesses with many more growth drivers than meets the eye. Each business has multiple growth drivers with tremendous runway ahead. To the outside, it may be unclear how we can keep driving growth with the strong market shares we have. In reality, our product and service diversity creates enduring strength as we advance forward and notch incremental lens.\nOver time, these wins collectively deliver meaningful and durable growth across multiple franchises and multiple geographies. While we know we don't fit neatly into either diagnostics or medical device, we do fit neatly into the world of improving women's health. Our unique set of businesses equips us to deliver results and positively impact more and more women regardless of external macro challenges. Our strong growth over the past 4 years reflects a combination of multiple durable growth drivers intentionally built into each of our businesses.\nThe beauty here is that over time and in any given quarter, our growth drivers can change and morph. What we've done is create multiphase extended and stacked growth cycles. The net result is our ability to consistently deliver on a consolidated basis over time. A few examples to highlight from across our business. In our second quarter, worldwide Diagnostics growth ex COVID of 9.8% was again primarily driven by our Molecular Diagnostics business.\nIn Molecular Diagnostics, over the last few years, we've dramatically expanded both our installed base and menu, nearly doubling our installed base from 1,700 Panthers to over 3,200 during the pandemic and going from 4 FDA-approved assays to over 20. Our next phase of growth is about menu adoption and driving more volume by focusing largely on existing customers while adding more geographies. At the same time, we continue to broaden our menu. As a result, we create years of growth ahead as we extend our commercial reach and continue to add products to our portfolio.\nIn the second quarter, U.S. Molecular Diagnostics delivered double-digit growth, led by ongoing adoption of BV/CV/TV on the Panther, strong contributions from our respiratory suite of assays on the fusion as well as continued growth from Biotheranostics. Each of these are newer products to our portfolio, underscoring the power of our extended reach, layering on top of the strong U.S. molecular performance, international cytology was also accretive to worldwide diagnostics growth. Outside the U.S., Diagnostics growth was driven primarily by multi-country adoption of our innovative Genius AI digital cytology in the quarter.\nAs a reminder, digital cytology was only recently approved in the U.S. earlier this year. meaning the U.S. opportunity is still ahead.\nIn Breast Health, we've expanded our product offering from imaging to cover the continuum of breast cancer care, including biopsy and surgery. In the second quarter, on a worldwide basis, the gantry and service businesses performed well against very strong comps from the prior year period. Meanwhile, outside the U.S, our emerging interventional breast business grew double digits in Q2, accretive to the worldwide growth rate.\nAnd finally, in Surgical. Once essentially only a U.S. 2 product business with NovaSure and MyoSure, we now have Fluent, Accesa and Bolder. And internationally, we are just getting started with both the core business and new product lines. In Q2, worldwide growth of 7.4% was very strong against the high prior year comp. Our performance was driven in large part by very strong double-digit growth in our International Surgical business, which in Q2 is a reflection of continued market penetration as well as our go-direct strategy in the Nordics.\nAll in, we are a powerful women's health composite. As we extend our reach globally, we expect to grow even in product categories and territories that may on their surface appear to be mature and well penetrated.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Essex to discuss our final 2 themes for today.\n\nEssex D. Mitchell\n\nChief Operating Officer\n\nThank you, Steve. As previewed by Steve's discussion of our diverse and durable growth drivers, our strong international growth is a direct result of identifying and capturing underpenetrated market opportunities with steady execution. As a reminder, our international business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. We are in more territory and more direct than ever before. That said, big picture, we are still in the early days of our international opportunities. Our early success is driven largely by 2 approaches: One, going direct; and two, entering markets where we elevate the standard of care.\nFor example, on the latter, while the ThinPrep Pap test, 2D and even 3D mammo and procedures like NovaSure and MyoSure are widely accepted as standard of care in the U.S., internationally, this is unfortunately not yet the case. Many parts of the world even those considered developed and industrialized, still have the opportunity to elevate their screening, diagnosis and treatment of women to gold standards. These women deserve it, and Hologic is poised to realize this potential. Acceptability to women's health options around the world remains a priority and a great opportunity for Hologic. This is why our work with the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our worldwide partnership with the Women's Tennis Association to elevate women's health, education and access are critically important.\nReinforcing our position, the index clearly shows that we are only scratching the surface of the global opportunity, and this holds true even in Europe, with other large market geographies like Asia Pacific being further out on the time horizon. From our perspective, as leading champions for women's health, we believe there is still significant market adoption opportunity ahead of us. And this adoption will not happen overnight, we expect adoption to grow over time, at different paces around the world as more and more governments prioritize women's health.\nAnd for our final theme today, we'd like to underscore the importance of our strong balance sheet and recap our capital allocation priorities. With over $2 billion in cash and strong cash flow we have the capacity to fund key in-house initiatives and also deploy cash towards both M&A and share repurchases. Regarding capital allocation, our strategy remains the same. We are focused on tuck-in opportunities for our 3 core franchises. And as we have stated in the past, we have a strong preference for any potential deal to have a clear line of sight to accretion on both top and bottom line, if not immediately, the sooner, the better.\nOur business development teams across each of our franchises are consistently building and reviewing opportunities in their respective pipeline. We view our ability to shop across multiple aisles as a strength as we continue to grow into an even greater performing composite than we are today. The ability to shop in multiple aisles also creates the flexibility to maneuver potentially unfavorable valuations in one aisle versus another.\nOverall, a blend of adding in-house developed and external innovation across our strong franchises is an important part of our growth strategy. Leading into our strategy, on Monday, we announced our agreement to acquire Indo-Magnetics LTD -- a provider of breast cancer surgery technologies for approximately $310 million. Endomag's portfolio of innovative breast surgery localization and lymphatic tracing products complements and diversifies our expanding interventional breast business. We are excited for the potential to join forces, amplify growth and better serve patients around the world. In calendar 2023, Endomag generated approximately $35 million of revenue, and we believe our combined global reach and breadth of interventional options will accelerate growth in this exciting space.\nAt this point, we are still early and do not have a definitive time line on closing the transaction, though we estimate to close in the second half of the calendar year.\nBefore I turn the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying we are proud of our strong Q2 results that build on our Q1 performance. All said, we are in a solid position to carry our success into Q3 and Q4.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Essex, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I will provide an overview of our revenue results, walk down our income statement showcasing strong performance, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal 2024.\nAs highlighted, our second quarter financial results were very strong. exceeding our expectations on revenue and profitability. Q2 was a continuation of our momentum from Q1. Total revenue came in at $1.018 billion beating the midpoint of our guidance by $18 million. We delivered organic growth of 4.9%, excluding COVID, on top of a challenging double-digit comp from the prior year.\nIn addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.03, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by $0.03. Before moving on to our franchise results, we want to highlight the continued strength of our balance sheet. In Q2, we generated over $290 million in cash from operating activities and ended the quarter with nearly $2.2 billion on the balance sheet. Our strong cash balance leverage ratio well below our target range and ability to consistently generate strong cash flow provide us the flexibility to fund innovation and execute our capital allocation strategy.\nWe have significant firepower to continue to deploy capital as opportunities arise.\nTurning to our franchise results. In Diagnostics, second quarter revenue of $450.1 million declined 3.2%. Excluding COVID assay and related revenue, worldwide Diagnostics grew by 9.8%. Within Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to contribute significantly, growing 10.7% excluding COVID. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which continues its outstanding growth trajectory. BV/CV/TV is tracking to become our second largest assay globally, with very little international revenue as we have focused primarily on the U.S. market.\nAdditionally, as expected, non-COVID respiratory assay sales remained solid as the flu season continued into our second quarter. Growth was a combination of more volume year-over-year across our respiratory menu plus ASP lift from elevated contribution from our COVID, [ Flu A, Flu B] and RSV for [ Plex ] assay. Finally, Biotheranostics remains a strong pillar of growth for our base molecular business.\nRounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 7.9% globally, primarily fueled by double-digit growth internationally as well as impact from the prior year comp. As a reminder, Q2 last year was adversely impacted by supply constraint issues related to a third-party logistics partner. Level set growth in the second quarter is above our long-term expectations for this business.\nMoving on to Breast Health. Total second quarter revenue of $384.6 million decreased 0.3%, but grew 1% when excluding SSI. As a reminder, Q1 '24 resulted in an elevated growth rate assisted by lapping soft prior year performance due to supply constraints in Q1 '23.. The opposite is true for Q2 '24, where we faced significant prior year comps.\nIn Q2 of last year, we placed an elevated number of gantries as semiconductor chip supply and visibility improved. For the remainder of the year, we expect growth rates in the gantry business to normalize. Within Breast Health, growth was driven primarily by our international interventional mix. This highlights the diversity of growth drivers Steve and Essex commented on. And the fact that growth drivers across our business and within our divisions can change and morph over time.\nContinuing next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $156 million increased 7.4%. Surgical growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related Fluent fluid management system. As anticipated, NovaSure continues to be a headwind to growth as we lapped the prior year NovaSure V5 ASP lift.\nAnd finally, in our Skeletal business, Second quarter revenue of $27.1 million declined 14.3% from lower capital placements and upgrades.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin was 60.7% for the quarter and in line with expectations. The decline of 160 basis points from the prior year was anticipated and primarily driven by lower COVID sales compared to the prior year period. As a reminder, we expect gross margin to improve as we work past the amortization of previously procured higher-priced semiconductor chips.\nTotal operating expense of $307.6 million in the second quarter decreased by 3%. This decrease was primarily driven by elimination of expenses related to the divested SSI business. As Steve mentioned, the operating margin was 30.4% for the second quarter. The year-over-year decline of 90 basis points was driven primarily from lower COVID sales.\nSequentially, as expected, operating margins expanded 190 basis points from Q1, largely from lower operating expenses in Q2, a strong result for the quarter. Below operating income, other income net represented a loss of nearly $6 million in our first -- in our fiscal second quarter. As expected, interest income is lower due to lower cash balances from the significant share repurchases completed earlier in the fiscal year.\nAdditionally, interest expense is up due to lower proceeds from our interest rate swaps. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19.75% as expected.\nNow let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2024. For Q3 2024, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $992.5 million to $1007.5 million, and EPS of $0.98 to $1.05. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $4 billion to $4.05 billion, and EPS of $4.02 to $4.12.\nWith respect to foreign exchange, we expect the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar to create a significant headwind in in the second half of the year. For Q3, we are assuming FX headwind of about $3 million. For the full year, we now expect a slight tailwind of about $2 million. All in, this represents about a $10 million impact to our prior guidance. And as a reminder, prior guidance assumed a $12 million tailwind for the full year.\nTurning to our franchises. We want to reiterate that we expect each to grow at least 5% to 7% in our fiscal 2024, excluding the impact of COVID. While we have navigated the most challenging comps from fiscal '23, we still have strong double-digit comps across the board to close out fiscal '24. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect our Molecular Diagnostics business to drive high single-digit growth, excluding COVID as customers continue to adopt and drive utilization of our expanded menu.\nIn cytology and perinatal, however, we expect minimal growth in Q3. In Q3 of last year, customers built inventory as a result of the third-party shipping constraints experienced in Q2 of '23, resulting in slightly elevated sales. We expect to see more normalized comps for our cytology and perinatal business in fiscal year '25.\nClosing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of approximately $7 million in Q3 and and $28 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $5 million to $10 million in Q3 '24 and about $60 million to $65 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $25 million in the third quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year.\nMoving on to Breast Health. We remain on pace to grow the business within the 5% to 7% range for the year. As a reminder, we closed out fiscal '23 with 3 straight quarters of 25% plus growth rates. We expect steady performance in Breast Health in the back half of the year as the business continues to improve sequentially. The demand for our portfolio of products and service remains strong. And we continue to have excellent visibility into gantry orders.\nFurther, our confidence in delivering more gantries than last year remains high. We continue to successfully manage resource availability among both our install teams and our customers as customers balance the need to meet elevated demand for screening and staffing constraints.\nFinally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal 2024 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. The growth will continue to come from MyoSure Fluent as well as both Accesa and Bolder.\nMoving next to margins. We reiterate that our guidance assumes the cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q3 will improve sequentially from Q2 as we continue to work through our higher cost chips in Breast Health, remain on pace to exit the fiscal year in the low 60s. Our guidance also assumes Q3 operating margins in the low 30s, and we remain on pace to finish fiscal '24, approaching 31%. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be an expense of approximately $10 million in Q3 and an expense between $30 million and $40 million for the full year.\nOur guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $238 million for the full year. To conclude, Q2 was another strong quarter and sets us up nicely for the second half of the year. As always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded.\n[Operator Instructions]\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer; and Essen Mitchell, our Chief Operating Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings. Also during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release.\nTwo of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue, excluding divested businesses, and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which further excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.01 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98. Both revenue and EPS came in above the high end of our guidance. Before diving into our results, it is important to view our Q1 growth performance in proper perspective. Simply put, our first 2 quarters of fiscal '24 faced incredibly difficult comps. Despite Q1 '24, having 4 fewer selling days compared to the prior year and even against a prior year Molecular Diagnostics ex COVID revenue growth of 24.5% and a surgical revenue growth rate of nearly 15%, we grew total organic revenue ex COVID, a solid 5.2%.\nEven more impressive, when adjusting for the 4 fewer selling days, our Q1 results stand taller. On an adjusted basis, we estimate the total company organic revenue growth ex COVID, was in the high single digits for the period. These are incredibly strong results against challenging comps as we continue to perform exceptionally well against our 5% to 7% ex-COVID long-term target.\nWe continue to showcase our durability and broad strength across our divisions, both delivering on our short-term guidance and maintaining our long-term targets. Keep in mind that our long-term revenue targets are more impressive today given we are growing off a much larger base than we originally contemplated. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver.\nDuring our call today, we will focus on building upon our messaging from the JPMorgan conference 3 weeks ago. During our presentation, we highlighted that we are a new Hologic, bigger, faster, stronger and poised for continued success.\nAs part of our discussion, Essex will share more insights about our high confidence in our future success. He will also shed light on what we view as underappreciated elements of our growth strategy, that are helpful to fully recognize the potential of our business. Before then turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our detailed financial results, we will share reflections from our participation at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\nWhile we continue to make progress elevating women's health, it is clear we still have a long way to go.\nStarting with our meetings at JPMorgan. We realize there are 2 camps of investors. There is one camp that understands our transformation and recognizes the drivers powering our current results and future growth potential. At the same time, there is another camp that quite frankly, does not. That said, we certainly appreciate the complexity. Over the past 3 years, there have been many moving pieces, clouding the narrative of the force we've become, from revenues still normalizing following the ups and downs of COVID to moving past semiconductor chip supply challenges, to selling days dynamics only naming a few. Each has contributed to irregular comps that may be difficult to interpret and also challenging to model.\nWe appreciate that each represents a layer of complexity that must be pulled back to fully appreciate the underlying strength of our business. Looking beyond the quarterly nuances, our steady performance over time really shines. Above all, we are bigger, faster, stronger and poised for further growth. We are a durable and diversified growth company with disciplined operations, peer group-leading margins, an exceptionally strong balance sheet and above all, a talented and engaged employee workforce. We are poised to continue to drive top line growth while growing the bottom line even faster.\nTo shed more light on what gives us high confidence in our future, I'll pass it over to Essex.\n\nUnknown Executive\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.\nAs we commented over the past several quarters, we have dramatically transformed our business since 2019 through the challenges of the pandemic. More recently, as we've moved further away from the peaks of COVID testing and prevalence, we have posted exceptional ex-COVID results. These results back up our claims then we are much more than a COVID story and without a doubt, built for the long term. At the same time, as Steve mentioned, there is a lot to unpack to fully understand our business. Many recognize that we are a new Hologic compared to where we were in fiscal 2019. Since then, we've grown our Molecular Diagnostics business approximately 80%, our breast business, nearly 10% and our Surgical business, nearly 40%. Yet there are still some on [indiscernible] and uncertain of our future growth potential. As some of our peers have also performed well over this time period, it's not easy to see the true wins. The underlying assumption is that winners must be exclusively taking share.\nIn reality, there was much more to it. In addition to competing and taking share, Hologic's growth is centered on innovation and making share. We then drive this innovation to commercial execution by leveraging our world-class sales teams. As we are positioned today, our future growth is much less about hand-to-hand combat in the trenches of the markets where we operate. Instead, our growth is derived from growing and expanding markets through education, awareness, innovative new products and tapping into underpenetrated markets.\nAs an example, our 3 largest revenue product lines launched since 2019 excluding COVID, our BV/CV [indiscernible], Biotheranostics and Fluent. These 3 lines alone collectively delivered over $300 million in revenue in 2023. That was essentially nonexistent to start 2019. Moreover, each product line falls into one or more of our market-creating strategies, and each is still in their earlier stages of growth.\nSimilarly, outside of the top 3, we have a number of other product lines new since 2019, which could each individually represent $100 million revenue opportunity over time. And these lines are also still in their earlier innings of growth.\nTo highlight a few, our respiratory assays, GYN scopes and laparoscopic surgical portfolio each delivered double-digit growth rate for fiscal '23. On top of our market expansion activity, we continue to drive further growth by leveraging our large installed and user bases of core products in each division. Through the Panther, our gantry and our hysteroscopic surgical portfolio, we have incredibly deep customer relationships in each of our unique channels.\nPost COVID, our call points around the world are stronger than ever. Customers associate Hologic with industry-leading differentiated technologies, ongoing innovation, best-in-class workflow and automation solutions. Moreover, our strong reputation as leaders and champions for women's health continues to open doors. Earning this advantage provides us a unique opportunity to supercharge growth from products introduced into our channel.\nWhile there are many out there that claim to be winners, even in categories, we continue to lead it year-over-year. We are extremely confident in our ability to carve out and create opportunities for growth. Similarly, we are equally confident in our demonstrated ability to gain and maintain market share across our core product lines. With our core businesses incredibly healthy in many of our growth driving products still in early innings. All in, we believe we are well positioned for the future and well positioned to maintain our strong performance for the years to come. Steve?\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Essex.\nTo close out the discussion of our growth prospects, while we continue to make significant progress outside of the U.S. we still have tremendous opportunity to grow and build a much greater presence internationally.\nShifting gears, before turning the call over to Karleen, we'd like to share reflections from our time at the World Economic Forum in Davos. For a third year in a row, we had the opportunity to participate at the Forum where we presented the results of our third annual Hologic Global Women's Health Index. The index, which is the largest study of its kind, examining the overall state of women's health and well-being, continues to generate tremendous support from major organizations dedicated to improving women's health.\nAs we've said before, over time, we believe the index may be the single greatest contribution to the world that we make at Hologic. This year's results show that we all need to stand behind women more than ever. The harsh reality is that women's health globally has not only stagnated over the past year, but is sadly moving in the wrong direction. The data shows that only 11% of women were screened for cancer and only 10% for STIs. Billions of women are not being screened, this must change and we have a tremendous opportunity to lead the way with our women's health portfolio.\nThe key takeaway here is that in many ways, our markets are still in the early innings of reaching their potential. As we look ahead, we are even more inspired to live into our purpose, passion and promise. We continue to believe, and we have proven that we can drive results through our unwavering commitment to women's health. Our strong results come from our strong purpose.\nAnd finally, in late breaking news, we are incredibly proud to announce that just last night, our new genius digital diagnostic system with the genius cervical AI algorithm received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This accomplishment is only made possible by the creativity, focus and dedication of our outstanding diagnostics team. Continuing to trail blaze our path, our system is the first and only FDA-cleared digital cytology system that combines deep learning-based AI with advanced imaging technology.\nIt can help more accurately detect cervical cancer, improved cytology workflow and and ultimately enhance patient care. We continue to deliver and at a time when women need it most.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone, and congratulations again to our diagnostics team.\nIn my statements today, I will provide an overview of our divisional revenue results and walk down our income statement that highlights the broad-based strong performance across our business. I will also touch on a few additional key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal '24 and the full year.\nJumping right in, we are pleased to share that our first quarter financial performance was strong. We exceeded our expectations on both the top and bottom line. Total revenue came in at $1.013 billion, beating the midpoint of our guidance by about $40 million. As Steve mentioned, despite 4 fewer selling days in the quarter, we delivered organic revenue growth of 5.2%, excluding the impact of COVID in line with our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%.\nIn addition, non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.98, exceeding the high end of our guidance. Overall, we continue to deliver robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. Before moving to our divisional results, we again want to emphasize that our balance sheet and willingness to deploy capital remain a core strength of our business in a macro environment that remains dynamic.\nAs an example, in our first quarter, we initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. We purchased an additional $150 million of our stock and also paid down $250 million of floating rate debt. With a cash balance of $1.9 billion, a leverage ratio well below our target range, and roughly $350 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization, we have significant firepower and flexibility to deploy further capital, should the opportunity arise.\nTurning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, first quarter revenue of $447.8 million declined 20.6%. Excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenue, Diagnostics revenue declined 0.9%. Yet adjusted for selling days, we estimate we grew mid-single digits compared to the prior year. As a reminder, Q1 '23 was a very strong quarter for Diagnostics, posting 15.8% growth ex COVID and Molecular Diagnostics 24.5% growth ex COVID.\nAnd without a doubt, our Q1 '24 results was impacted by 4 fewer selling days compared to the prior year. Within Diagnostics, our Molecular business continues to drive the division's results, delivering growth of 1.9% ex COVID or mid- to high single digits when adjusted for the impact of fewer selling days. We continue to see underlying strength in BV/CV/TV, which grew more than 20% in the quarter and is still in its early innings of adoption by our customers.\nMore than 95% of our BV/CV/TV revenue is derived in the U.S., representing incredible longer-term opportunity internationally. In addition, non-COVID respiratory revenue delivered ahead of our expectations as we experienced stronger-than-anticipated demand for our flu RSV and [indiscernible] assays. Our responding with published CDC data on respiratory virus positivity, sales ramped up in the final weeks of the quarter.\nFinally, Biotheranostics remains a positive driver of growth for our molecular business and delivered accretive revenue performance in the period.\nNow moving to Breast Health. Total first quarter revenue of $377.7 million increased 12.2%, showcasing solid double-digit growth. Demand for our gantries remains robust, and our interventional business also delivered a strong quarter. In our gantry business, we continue to benefit from a strong cadence of orders in our elevated backlog continues to give us high confidence in the performance of this business going forward.\nFinally, as a reminder, Q1 '23 results were impacted by constrained supply. In Interventional, we continue to see strong performance from our [indiscernible] needle as well as from our 2 markers used for marking biopsy sites in suspicious lesions in [indiscernible] tissue. Leveraging strong performance in the quarter, we believe our Breast Health franchise remains well positioned to deliver on its financial targets in fiscal '24.\nContinuing next to Surgical. Our first quarter revenue of $162.2 million increased 4.6% or high single digits when adjusted for selling days. The division's growth continues to be fueled by MyoSure in the related fluid system with an increasing contribution from our laparoscopic portfolio. As anticipated, NovaSure declined in Q1 as we lapped the selling price contribution from the product's V5 extension introduced just before fiscal '23. And finally, in our Skeletal business, first quarter revenue of $25.4 million declined 5.6% from lower capital placement and upgrades.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven primarily by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID revenues, which carries a favorable impact to our margins. However, as anticipated, our gross margin results remains temporarily depressed due to the ongoing amortization of semiconductor chips purchased at higher costs during the chip supply headwind.\nAs we continue to deploy gantries, we are moving farther away from this high-priced inventory. And as a result, we expect margins to continue to benefit from this inventory cycling as we progress through the year.\nShifting to operating expenses. Total operating expenses of $327.3 million in the first quarter decreased by 3.6%. This decrease in the period was driven by lower marketing spend, lower costs from fewer days and less expense due to the recently divested SSI business. For Q1 '23, this translates to a 28.5% operating margin, in line with our expectations. While we continue to deliver peer group-leading operating margins, we continue to exercise operational discipline and continuously seek to improve where it makes sense for our business.\nBelow operating income, other income net, represented a gain in our fiscal first quarter. As expected, we benefited from elevated cash balance and high interest rates, even though we deployed significant cash in the quarter. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19.75% as expected.\nMoving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $220 million in the first quarter. In addition, as previously mentioned, during Q1, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. This activity was above and beyond initiating a $500 million ASR, showcasing our high confidence in our business and willingness to bet on ourselves as well as our ongoing strategy to deploy capital.\nNow let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal '24. For our fiscal Q2 '24, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $990 million to $1.01 billion and EPS of $0.95 to $1. For the full year '24, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.99 billion to $4.065 billion and EPS of $3.97 to $4.12. With respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of $2 million for Q2 and $12 million for fiscal '24. Much of this tailwind was realized in Q1. And therefore, we estimate that foreign exchange will remain neutral to marginally favorable throughout the remainder of the year.\nTurning to our divisions. We want to reiterate that we expect each business to grow at least 5% to 7% for the full fiscal '24, excluding the impact of COVID. Starting with Diagnostics. We expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term framework for the remainder of fiscal '24. While performance was below this level in Q1, primarily due to the impact of fewer selling days compared to the prior year period. We expect the division to return to more normal growth in Q2 and for the remainder of our fiscal year. We expect improving utilization and menu expansion on the Panther coupled with ongoing contributions from Biotheranostics to continue to drive molecular growth.\nClosing out on non-COVID diagnostics, we expect [indiscernible] revenue of approximately $7 million in Q2 and $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $20 million in the second quarter of '24 and $60 million for the full year. COVID related items are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the second quarter and approximately $105 million for the full year fiscal '24.\nMoving to Breast Health. We continue to expect fiscal '24 to showcase strong demand for our portfolio of products and services. While moving on, it's important to understand the comp dynamics that will impact the breast business through fiscal '24. As previously noted, Q1 '23 was a softer comp due to shipped supply constraints. As a reminder, in Q2 '23, we delivered a strong quarter of gantry placements to meet pent-up customer demand during these earlier days of chip supply recovery. And deliveries in Q3 and Q4 of '23 were both lower than Q2. We expect this dynamic to result in a lower breast health year-over-year growth rate in Q2 that will improve in the back half of fiscal '24. For the full year, we continue to expect to deliver more gantries in fiscal '24 than in '23 as we move further from the chip supply headwinds while maintaining excellent demand visibility.\nFinally, in Surgical, we anticipate our full year fiscal '24 revenue growth to be at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term target. Although impacted by fewer selling days, Q1 started the year strong, and we expect the business to perform well in Q2 and the remainder of the fiscal year.\nMoving next to margins. Our guidance assumes a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin. For gross margin, we anticipate Q2 levels similar to Q1, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. As well, our guidance assumes Q2 operating margins approaching 30% with the Q4 '24 exit rate around 31%.\nContinuing down the P&L. We expect Q2 operating expenses to step down from Q1. As a reminder, Q1 is typically our highest spend quarter seasonally as we kick off the fiscal year with our internal global sales meetings and major trade show events such as RSNA. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expenses to be about $300 million to $310 million.\nBelow operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be in an expense of approximately $10 million in Q2 and an expense between $30 million to $50 million for the full year. Our current guidance assumes an increase in interest income relative to our previous guide as we expect to have a higher cash balance throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $239 million for the full year.\nTo conclude, Q1 was a strong quarter across each of our businesses and sets us up nicely for the rest of the year. As we closed Q1, we moved forward to Q2 in fiscal '24 with good momentum. And as always, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to our shareholders, employees, customers and patients around the world.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded.\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\nPlease go ahead, sir.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today is Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer, is currently on bereavement and will not be joining us today. Karleen is with family, and I will be covering for her on our call.\nPlease join me in wishing Karleen and her family well.\nOur fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation and a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days. Before we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding divested businesses and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. And before I get started, I just want to do a quick shout out to Karleen and her family and let everybody know our thoughts and prayers are with her today. So we are pleased to discuss Hologic's financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Total revenue was $945.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.89. It was another strong quarter overall with revenue finishing at the high end of our range and EPS exceeding our guidance. Our fourth quarter capped off a tremendous year where we continued our track record of success, strengthened our business and delivered on our commitments. .\nFor the full year, we posted $4.03 billion in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $3.96. In 2023, quite frankly, we delivered some pretty exceptional organic growth rates, which were far above our longer-term targets. At the start of the year, we committed to deliver low double-digit growth. across each division. In the end, we delivered more, growing annual organic revenue ex-COVID, in the mid-teens at 15.6% with every division growing north of 13%. And international growth just above 20%. Despite various macro challenges, like clockwork, we continued to deliver, raising our financial guidance throughout the year, and living up to our commitments.\nAt the same time, our balance sheet remains incredibly strong, and we have the financial flexibility to grow our business for the long term. For fiscal '24, we are confident in our ability to deliver against our 5% to 7% ex-COVID long-term organic growth target even against significant comps, one less selling week and a challenging macro environment. In fact, if we look at 2024 on an adjusted daily sales basis, our annual organic revenue growth rate, excluding COVID, is projected to be in the 6% to 8% range. Whether adjusting for selling days or not, we believe our results will truly stand out from the crowd as we progress throughout fiscal 2024. Particularly following a year of almost 16% growth ex-COVID in 2023.\nBefore sharing more of our excitement for 2024, we will first reflect on our Q4 results. In Q4, we grew total organic revenue, excluding COVID 16.7%, with double-digit growth in every division. We again delivered on our promises. At the division level, Breast Health grew 27.4% and driven primarily by the recovery in our gantry business. Interventional Breast also posted a strong quarter, growing in the low double digits. We are pleased the division's gantry recovery is tracking to our expectations following the industry's chip supply challenges.\nMoving on to Diagnostics. Organic growth ex COVID was 10.2%, again, driven by our strong molecular business. Organic molecular diagnostics ex COVID grew 15% for the quarter, driven once again by strong contributions from BV CV TV, MGEN and Biotheranostics. With fiscal 2023 revenue ex COVID at $1.48 billion, our diagnostics business is over 40% larger than it was in 2019. Even more impressive, our base molecular business is now nearly 80%, 80% larger than it was pre-pandemic. Molecular has grown through a combination of more than doubling our Panther installed base, adding new menu, gaining new customers as well as acquisitions into adjacent markets.\nThis transformation and durable performance speaks to the ongoing success of our growth strategy. Rounding out the divisions, Surgical revenue at over $600 million in fiscal '23, is now nearly 40% larger than what it was in 2019. In Q4, Surgical grew 10.6%, driven primarily by MyoSure influent both growing double digits. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio also grew double digits, albeit smaller in dollars compared to MyoSure influent. More importantly, we are pleased our laparoscopic portfolio continues to gain traction.\nTo close the overview of our quarterly results and fiscal 2023 highlights, our international business continued to be accretive to overall growth rates, growing north of 28% on an organic ex COVID basis in Q4. We expect International to continue to be a key part of our growth story. Before moving on, we'd like to revisit and reinforce our capital allocation strategy. In short, our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We continue to prioritize M&A opportunities; and second, we consistently look to utilize cash towards share repurchases, and we continue to be patient. Having said that, we have recently seen the opportunity to deploy our cash balance more significantly. Taking the following 4 actions: One, in Q4 2023, we deployed $238 million of capital to buy back 3.2 million shares.\nSecond, in our current fiscal Q1 2024, we have already repurchased another 2.2 million shares for $150 million.\nThree, Today, we announced an additional $500 million accelerated share repurchase program; and four, we recently paid down $250 million of higher variable interest rate debt. Ryan will expand on both the ASR and debt repayment in his remarks.\nLooking back 4-plus years since the start of the pandemic, the biggest acquisition we have made is of ourselves. During this period, we deployed over $1.4 billion on M&A opportunities. And nearly $2.3 billion on share repurchases, including our recent repurchases in Q1 2024. And today's ASR announcement will make that $2.8 billion. As you can see, we are very confident in our position for the years ahead.\nRounding out our capital allocation discussion to ensure we are optimized for the future, we carefully evaluate our portfolio on an ongoing basis. As a result, as mentioned in our release, we have recently divested our small SSI ultrasound business. Shifting gears. As we have shared on prior calls, we have broadly transformed our business and strengthened our fundamentals, quarter-by-quarter, year-by-year, with macro hurdles ever present, we continue to prove our strength.\nToday, we are effectively a new Hologic, retooled and recapitalized with strong brands, wide moats, industry-leading margins and the strongest, deepest leadership team we've ever had. Hologic is a differentiated and more competitive company than at any time in our 38-year history. At our core, we are fundamentally guided by our purpose, passion and promise. Our purpose to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day. Our passion to champion women's health globally and our promise, the Science of Sure, to provide health care professionals with clinically differentiated high-quality products. Across each division, we have distinct advantages created by our unique focus on elevating women's health through innovative products and trailblazing social initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index.\nWe ultimately develop our leading positions by leaning into our purpose and proactively meeting our customers and patients' needs. We will highlight 3 examples today. First, we are not only leaders in women's health, but we are also sector leaders in workflow automation. Our customers continue to deal with challenges, sourcing technicians and the persistent pressure to efficiently manage costs.\nAs a result, user-friendly systems and efficient workflow solutions are at the top of our customers' expectations. From our Panther instrument to our Brevera breast biopsy and fluid systems to name only a few, each product is designed to transform manual labor-intensive cumbersome processes. In the easy-to-use dependable and efficient workflows.\nSecond, the massive footprint and sheer size of our installed bases in Diagnostics and Breast Health provide a strong foundation in today's world. With more than 3,260 Panther instruments installed worldwide, and over 10,000 mammography systems installed across the U.S.. We have the opportunity to be integral partners with the laboratories, hospitals and screening centers we support. For Panther, as customers add more menu and drive incremental volume. Our molecular diagnostics business continues to grow while also becoming more valuable to our customers and more deeply rooted in their operations. The same can be said for our Breast Health business.\nHologic is unique in our ability to support our customers and their patients at each step along the breast care continuum. We differentiate ourselves with our ecosystem of technologies that integrate across a patient's journey, creating a more comfortable patient experience, greater clinical confidence for practitioners and increased operational efficiencies for our customers.\nMoving on to our third example, our long-standing brand leadership across multiple product lines in each division, which yields strong stable margins and steady cash flow generation. We are innovators and leaders in breast and cervical cancer screening, STI testing, abnormal uterine bleeding treatment and fibroid removal. This is a significant statement given the strong competitors we face in each respective business. Our diversified leadership and scale across our business lines support industry-leading margins and cash flow. And in turn, we have the ability to further invest and grow our business.\nAltogether, we are emerging as a premier growth company, differentiated and more competitive delivering strong growth across each division and international as the new much stronger Hologic we are today, we consistently deliver and aim to continue to do so. Turning our attention to 2024. I will touch on some of the high-level growth drivers in each business, and Ryan will finish the call with further detail related to next year's guidance.\nFirst, in Breast Health, we expect 2024 to be another strong year of growth with our gantry backlog remaining elevated compared to historic levels, we have greater visibility into our pipeline, translating to higher confidence in future gantry sales, creating another exciting year for Breast Health. In Diagnostics, as in recent years, molecular will continue to drive growth for the division. We expect our large global Panther installed base to continue to add new menu while also increasing volume for existing assays.\nIn addition, our Biotheranostics business, which we acquired in 2021 is expected to continue delivering double-digit growth being accretive even to our molecular growth rate. In 2023, Biotheranostics grew over 30%, and we are still in early innings growing the Breast Cancer Index test. BCI is still the only test recognized by NCCN guidelines and the American Society of Clinical Oncology to predict which patients are likely to benefit from extended adjuvant therapy beyond 5 years, yet another example of an innovative and differentiated product. In Surgical, MyoSure, our Fluent system and our newer laparoscopic products that we acquired via Boulder and Acessa are projected to continue to drive growth. Internationally, Surgical also continues to shine. In 2023, our international surgical growth rate was more than double the U.S. growth rate. Surgical is clearly emerging as a strong and profitable growth drivers.\nTo conclude, entering 2024, we are a new and differentiated Hologic. We are bigger, stronger and more competitive than ever. Our leadership brands growth drivers across all 3 divisions: durable margin profile and strong balance sheet will continue to power us forward. As we look ahead to 2024, we are poised to continue to grow and make an even bigger impact on women's health around the world.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Ryan.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve. And again, good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will touch on our fourth quarter financial results, recap our annual performance for certain items and end with our fiscal 2024 guidance for Q1 and the full year. We are pleased to close out fiscal 2023 with yet another strong quarter of growth and profitability. In our fourth quarter, total revenue was $945.3 million. And again, we delivered double-digit organic revenue growth, growing 16.7%, excluding the impact of COVID.\nIn addition, our Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.89, growing 8.5% compared to the prior year despite significantly less COVID testing revenue. For the full year 2023, total revenue was $4.03 billion, organic ex COVID revenue grew 15.6% and non-GAAP earnings per share were $3.96. These are exceptional results in what has been an unpredictable operating environment.\nNow moving to a brief discussion of our divisional revenue. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $416.4 million declined 20.6%. However, excluding COVID assay and COVID-related revenues, the division grew 10.2% in the quarter. Performance was again led by Molecular Diagnostics growing 15% in the period ex COVID. For the year, Molecular posted very strong global growth of 18.9% ex COVID. As Steve highlighted, growth continues to be driven by increasing Panther utilization, turbocharged by a much larger installed base and strong performance from Biotheranostics.\nMoving next to our COVID results, which exceeded our previous guidance. COVID assay revenue in our fourth quarter was $21 million and COVID-related revenue, inclusive of a small amount of revenue from discontinued products and diagnostics was $24 million. Staying in Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal business increased 1.3% in our fourth quarter, a solid result following outsized growth in our preceding third quarter due to the timing of certain larger orders.\nMoving to Breast Health. Total fourth quarter Breast Health revenue of $352.8 million increased 27.4%. The division's healthy bookings and elevated backlog provides us excellent visibility to meet customer needs and financial targets in fiscal '24 and beyond. Continuing next to Surgical, Fourth quarter revenue of $148 million increased 10.6% compared to the prior year. Surgical's fourth quarter closes out a year in which the business grew a tremendous 15.8% organically, excluding the impact of Boulder in Q1.\nAnd finally, in our Skeletal business, Fourth quarter revenue of $28 million was also strong, increasing 15.9%. Now let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 60.4% was driven by strong performance in our base business. However, this result was partially depressed by certain elevated costs including higher cost inventory from previously procured semiconductor chips.\nMoving down the P&L. Fourth quarter operating expenses of $303.7 million decreased approximately 8%. This decrease was driven by lower marketing spend in the period compared to the prior year. Primarily due to the timing of expenses associated with our WTA partnership. Below operating income, other income represented a gain in our fiscal fourth quarter. We benefited from higher interest rates on our cash balance, driving elevated levels of interest income.\nIn addition, we realized gains on our interest rate hedge helping to lower interest expense for our floating rate debt. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 19.75% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 28.3%, and net margin was 23.2%. As we have previously discussed, we expect operating margin to improve from this level throughout fiscal 2024.\nFinally, non-GAAP net income finished at $219.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.89. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $258.7 million in the fourth quarter. Capping off a year in which we generated over $1 billion in operating cash flow. As Steve outlined, we were actively repurchasing our shares in Q4 '23 as well as the start of Q1 '24. For the full year 2023, we spent $500 million to repurchase 6.8 million shares. Even so, we ended the fourth quarter with $2.7 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x.\nLastly, after the end of our fiscal fourth quarter, we completed one important capital market transaction and intend to enter into another. First, we repaid $250 million of floating rate debt associated with our credit agreement. This debt paydown helps to further protect our balance sheet against the risk of rising interest rates. And second, as Steve mentioned, we continue to bet on ourselves and announced a $500 million ASR, showcasing our resolute belief in the value of our business as we look to benefit from the stock markets under appreciation of our intrinsic value.\nNow let's move on to our non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year. For our Q1, we are expecting total revenue in the range of $960 million to $985 million and EPS of $0.92 to $0.97. For the full year 2024, our guidance assumes revenue of $3.92 billion to $4.02 billion and EPS of $3.90 to $4.10. As you reconcile our guidance to your models, we would like to call out 3 specific items pertaining to full year total revenue. One, the headwind of 4 less selling days in fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23, which is about $40 million; two, the divestiture of the SSI Ultrasound business, about a $20 million headwind, and three, the impact of FX, also about a $20 million headwind.\nFirst, with respect to selling days, our fiscal '23 was a 53-week year. In fiscal '24, we have 4 less selling days compared to '23, specifically within Q1. We estimate the impact of the 4 less selling days to be a headwind of about 400 basis points to our Q1 results and more than 100 basis points for the full year.\nSecond, regarding the divestiture of the SSI Ultrasound business, in the same way we treat revenue from our divested blood screening business, we will be removing Ultrasound revenue from both the current and prior year when calculating our organic growth rates in fiscal '24. This ultrasound revenue was approximately $4.5 million in Q1 '23 and about $20 million for the full fiscal year. For fiscal '24, we expect immaterial remaining ultrasound revenue of less than $1 million per quarter.\nAnd third, in terms of foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX tailwind of approximately $3 million for Q1 and a headwind of about $20 million for the full year. We anticipate the impact of the recently stronger U.S. dollar to be more acutely felt in the back half of our fiscal 2024.\nNow turning to our divisional guidance. We expect that each base business will grow within our 5% to 7% framework for the full fiscal year at the midpoint. However, this may not be every division every quarter due to strong 2023 comps for certain businesses. Starting with core diagnostics. We expect the business to grow within our 5% to 7% long-term targets for the full fiscal year '24, but likely below this level in Q1. Our first quarter growth rates will be impacted not only by the 4 extra selling days in the prior year period, but also strong non-COVID respiratory comps. As we plan for fiscal '24, we are forecasting conservatively for menu items related to flu and RSV. At this point, we do not foresee a respiratory season in the first half of fiscal '24 that mirrors last year.\nClosing out our non-COVID diagnostics business, we expect blood revenue of about $8 million in Q1 and about $30 million for the full year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be about $15 million in the first quarter of '24. And about $40 million for the full year. COVID-related items are expected to be about $30 million in the first quarter and about $105 million for the full year.\nMoving to Breast Health. We expect fiscal '24 to showcase strong demand for our product portfolio as supply chain challenges abate. As a reminder, due to supply chain challenges in the prior year, our growth rate in fiscal Q1 will likely be above trend. Therefore, as we move throughout the year, and comps normalized growth rates may recede. However, total revenue should increase as we begin to work through our elevated backlog.\nFinally, in Surgical, we expect growth rates within our long-term target of [ 57% ] for the full year below this level for Q1. In our first quarter of fiscal '24, Surgical will be impacted by more or less selling days as well as the fact that we are lapping a pricing benefit from NovaSure V5 product line extension. Moving next to margins. We expect a cadence of improvement throughout fiscal '24 for both gross margin and operating margin as we work through higher cost during the year.\nFor gross margin, we anticipate Q1 levels at approximately 60%, exiting the fiscal year in the low 60s. Similarly, our guidance assumes Q1 operating margins in the high 20s with a Q4 '24 exit rate in the low 30s. Continuing to work down the P&L, we expect Q1 to represent our highest quarter of operating expense in fiscal '24. This is due to normal seasonal expenses associated with internal global sales meetings to kick off our fiscal year. For the balance of the year, we anticipate quarterly operating expense to be in line with the back half of our fiscal '23. Below operating income, we estimate fiscal '24 other income net to be approximately neutral in Q1 and an expense of between $40 million to $60 million for the full year.\nOur guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75%, and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $239 million for the full year. To conclude, our strong fourth quarter wrapped up a remarkable year for Hologic. As we move to our fiscal 2024, we remain focused on advancing women's health around the world while delivering on our promises and commitments to shareholders, employees, customers and patients. With that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Cynthia, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cynthia. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available on our website for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Our results were solid. Total revenue was $984 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93. Revenue exceeded our prior guidance and EPS finished at the high end of our range. These results showcase the power of our transformed business and demonstrate that Hologic is built for the long term with the broadest, strongest foundation we've ever had. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and outstanding balance sheet, we continue to operate from a position of strength, with strong operational discipline as we forge ahead. Once again, the proof is in the numbers.\nTotal company organic growth, excluding COVID, was rather remarkable at 18.4%. By division, we posted 11.8% organic diagnostics growth ex COVID and 14.5% growth in Surgical. Standing alone, these growth rates are impressive. Given a wider context, we view these performances as exceptionally strong because we delivered these results on top of 15% growth in Diagnostics and 9.7% growth in Surgical in Q3 of 2022, both very high bars from a year ago.\nAnd in Breast Health, as expected, we delivered another strong quarter of 27.5% growth as chip supply and gantry availability continue to improve and track to our expectations. For this fiscal year, we remain on pace to achieve or exceed our 2023 low double-digit organic growth targets, excluding COVID. In fact, our expected growth rate for fiscal '23 is now more than double our 5% to 7% long-term growth target. Based on our strong performance for a number of quarters now, combined with our continued confidence in our growth ahead, we've recently given serious consideration to raising our long-term target. But given the uncertain macro environment we face, 5% to 7% is still very much a solid long-term outlook. Put simply, there are 2 reasons why. First, -- as you all well know, growing 5% to 7% on top of double-digit growth is clearly more challenging than growing 5% to 7% against single-digit comps. For example, in fiscal 2024, we will lap several prior periods of double-digit growth throughout the year.\nNet, we'll be entering 2024 already much bigger and stronger than when we first set the goal.\nAnd second, there are macro business and geopolitical challenges that persist today, which did not exist back in 2021 when we first set our guide. We will expand on this aspect later in today's call. Taken together, overcoming this combination of challenges while maintaining 5% to 7% growth is, in some ways, an even walked the goal than when we first established it.\nOn that note, let's move on to our focus for today. First, we will highlight the strengths of our business that underpin our strong Q3 results. Our strengths are diverse and durable. And second, with a discussion of the unique advantages we provide our customers, we hope you'll share our confidence that Hologic is built for the long term.\nMoving forward to our Q3 growth drivers. As mentioned, excluding COVID, each division posted double-digit organic growth for the quarter. Equally impressive is the year-over-year consistency of our growth drivers, a direct result of execution against our business strategy. In Diagnostics, the division's overall 11.8% organic growth rate, excluding COVID, was again driven by strong performance in molecular. For the quarter, Molecular Diagnostics posted approximately 13% growth ex COVID, on top of growing over 20% a year ago.\nGrowth in molecular was driven by a combination of both newer assays like BV/CV/TV and contributions from MGen and HSV, each growing well into the double digits as well as strong growth from our long-standing women's health menu. Rounding out Molecular Diagnostics, our Biotheranostics acquisition continues to shine, being both accretive to our top and bottom lines.\nCytology and perinatal led by cytology, also contributed strong growth this quarter, growing nearly 10%. Cytology elevated growth for Q3 was driven by the timing of a few large orders placed in the last week of the quarter before the extended July 4 holiday. We view this as a onetime lift as opposed to a shift in the trajectory of the business. That said, co-testing, which includes the path plus HPV continues to be the preferred cervical cancer screening method for medical practitioners. These are the same practitioners who are on the front lines who know the science and who have seen the overwhelmingly positive impact of the path and co-testing firsthand.\nBy our estimates, nearly 99% of cervical cancer screening today in the United States is performed using a combination of the top alone or co-testing. Why? The reason is clear. The path test has been the most successful cancer screening test in history. Since the path was introduced over 80 years ago, the rate of cervical cancer which was the leading cause of death among women has fallen by more than 70%. As an advocate of women's health for over 35 years, we continue to support best-in-class care for women and for cervical cancer screening, the gold standard is co-testing with ThinPrep, the PAP plus HPV.\nShifting to Breast Health. As expected, we posted another exceptional quarter, growing revenue 27.5%. This strong performance was driven primarily by the ongoing return of our mammography business as well as solid contributions from service. In mammography, as we guided in May, we delivered more gantries in Q3 than Q1 and slightly less than in Q2. Demand for our clinically differentiated gantries remains high.\nIn addition, our backlog is still at historically elevated levels. We are in great shape to work down this backlog to more normal levels throughout our fiscal 2024 and and possibly beyond. In Breast service, our business continues to grow and is becoming an even larger part of the division's mix. Our strong service performance represents stable contracted recurring revenue and demonstrates deepening relationships with our customers.\nNow moving on to Surgical and our International business. The newer pillars of growth for our company that may not be fully appreciated. In Surgical, the business continues to grow stronger for longer, growing 14.5% in Q3. Revenue growth was again driven by MyoSure and the Fluent fluid Management System, with contributions from NovaSure V5 and our newer laparoscopic portfolio. Specifically, while still early days in smaller dollars, Bolder continues its strong growth as we leverage our relationships with our GYN customers and explore adjacent surgical channels.\nThe transformation of our Surgical business over recent years has been phenomenal. It underscores the value of both internal innovation plus product line additions through M&A, a winning formula across Hologic. In Surgical, the sum of both strategies has injected new life into the business and transformed it into a meaningful growth driver for the company. Our international business also continues to impress, growing 20.9% in the quarter, excluding COVID.\nIn May, our global leadership team traveled to our Brussels office as part of our annual strategic planning process, spending a week in Brussels reinforced a sense of pride within our leadership team. We are proud of the strides we've made expanding our global footprint and even more important, we are proud of the energy and culture we've built around the world. Coupled with a strong base of talent we have developed over the past few years. We firmly believe our highly engaged workforce and purpose-driven culture truly set us apart.\nAs we've said before, the revenue growth rate for our international business is accretive to our overall growth rate. We expect this trend to continue throughout our long-term horizon. Related, earlier in today's call, we referenced persistent macro challenges in the context of our long-term guide. When we first announced our 5% to 7% guide, we were expecting tailwinds in places like China and Russia, rather than the headwinds they have become.\nDespite these challenges, we remain committed to our targets and with strong performance in other geographies where we operate, our international growth remains on track. This is a testament to the commitment grit and determination of all our employees that support and drive our efforts around the world.\nNow shifting gears to discuss the advantage we provide to our customers. and how we are poised for long-term success. To fully appreciate where we're going, we must reflect on where we've been. From there, we will shed light on our unwavering patient and customer focus, which sets the stage for our bright future. Our transformation has been years in the making. It started even before COVID and as we know, accelerated during the pandemic.\nIn the early days of COVID, when fear and uncertainty led to closures and shutdowns, we delivered our highly accurate COVID molecular diagnostic tests around the globe, playing a pivotal role in helping get the world back on its feet. With COVID surges and high testing volumes now further in the rearview mirror, our ongoing performance shows that we are much more than a great pandemic story.\nWithout a doubt, we are a bigger, stronger company with more durable and diverse growth drivers and positioned well for the long haul. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we operate today from a position of strength and continue to exercise operational discipline. As we look ahead, we are laser focused on our purpose, passion and promise and never lose sight of the needs of our patients and our customers. This is the magic within our business.\nToday, our customers face the challenge of navigating this new operating environment. They seek vendors who can help them operate as efficiently as possible. For labs and hospitals, pressures from inflation and labor shortages remain despite recent improvement. With the efficiency of priority, when our customers think of Hologic, they see opportunity. The opportunity to consolidate around our portfolio of products in Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical that offer innovative solutions to dramatically improve their operational efficiency. Seconds can turn to minutes and days of time and labor savings throughout the course of a year.\nIn each of our businesses, we feature products that streamline workflows and create real advantages that our customers not only love, but need. From our sophisticated automation with Panther and advances in AI with digital cytology and diagnostics to our industry-leading gantry scan speed, and streamlined biopsy process with Brevera in Breast Health.\nAnd finally, our efficient fluid management approach with Fluent in surgical. Workflow efficiency is in the DNA of our entire portfolio. In addition, the fact that we have specialized service teams to focus on the unique needs of our customers adds to our competitive advantage. Our customers know that when they choose Hologic, they not only receive world-class products but also world-class service. Between our robust portfolio of industry-leading products and specialized service capabilities, we create a very attractive opportunity for our customers. We offer real and measurable efficiencies that improve their bottom lines. And more importantly, improve the standard of care for patients.\nThis combination sets us up well to meet our customers' needs, both today and into the future. and creates an incredible pathway for Hologic's success.\nIn closing, there are many companies that can sell products. There are fewer who can consistently deliver so many leadership brands and sector-leading margins over the long term and there are even fewer who can succeed financially while also helping the world. At Hologic, we do all the REITs. We are tremendously proud to continue our journey, delivering outstanding top line growth and profitability. Driving value for all our stakeholders and further enabling our ability to make a profound impact on patients' lives and women's health around the world.\nWith that, I will now turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, we will briefly revisit our divisional revenue results, walk down our income statement and speak to a few balance sheet and cash flow items. We will wrap up with our guidance for the full year and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve highlighted, our third quarter financial results were strong, showcasing the durability of our business and the diversified contributions to our growth.\nTotal revenue came in at $984 million, exceeding our estimates, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.93, meeting the high end of our previous guidance range.\nNow starting with our divisional revenue performance. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $439.7 million declined 21.3%. However, excluding COVID assay and related ancillary revenues, the division grew 11.8% in the quarter. We are once again thrilled by the solid performance, which reinforces the underlying strength of our Diagnostics business.\nAs Steve shared, Molecular Diagnostics grew approximately 13% during our third quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. Additionally, the cytology and perinatal business posted nearly 10% growth in our fiscal third quarter. For reasons previously discussed, when modeling, we would advise not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward to our cytology and perinatal segment.\nMoving to Breast Health. Total third quarter revenue of $360.3 million increased 27.5%. In conjunction with our Q2 performance, these results provide further evidence of strong demand for the division's portfolio of products and services. While the current care revenue growth rate was assisted by supply chain headwinds in the prior year, we are encouraged by the trajectory of the business and the increasing predictability of our semiconductor chip supply.\nMoving next to Surgical. Third quarter revenue of $157.3 million increased nearly 15% compared to the prior year. Our internal R&D efforts, international execution and recent laparoscopic acquisitions have contributed to an increasingly diverse and robust business. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $27.1 million was also very strong, increasing 25%.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 60.8% was driven by strong performance in our base business, and COVID-19 testing revenues, which came in slightly above our expectations. Total operating expenses of $313.9 million in the third quarter increased nominally by 0.9%. This increase was driven by higher sales and R&D expenses, but partially offset by lower marketing spend. Below operating income, other income once again represented a gain in our fiscal third quarter. We continue to benefit from higher interest rates as interest income from our cash balance of nearly $2.8 billion and the favorable impact of our interest rate hedge has more than offset higher interest expense on our floating rate debt.\nOur tax rate in Q3 was 21.4% higher than previously anticipated. The increase in this quarter's effective tax rate represents a cumulative catch-up in the current period to increase our annual tax rate from 19% to 19.75%. The increase in our tax rate for fiscal 2023 is driven by stronger than forecasted domestic performance and losses outside the U.S., which we cannot claim benefit from at this time. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 28.9% and net margin was 23.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $231.3 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.93.\nFinally, while up to this point, we have discussed non-GAAP financial metrics, we feel it's important to call out a noncash impairment charge related to Mobidiag, which is excluded from our non-GAAP results. To be clear, we continue to be excited about Mobidiag in its long-term potential. As we've previously shared, due to various challenges our entry to the U.S. market will be materially beyond our initial deal model expectations.\nDuring our annual strategic planning process in Q3 the need to lower the carrying value of primarily Mobidiag intangible assets became evident. As a result, we booked a GAAP write-down of $197 million in the quarter specific to Mobidiag, which primarily impacts cost, but also operating expenses.\nMoving down the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $332.7 million in our third quarter. We ended the quarter with $2.77 billion of cash on our balance sheet and a net leverage ratio of 0.1x. In addition, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of $114 million in the period. Year-to-date, we have proposed 3.6 million shares for $264 million. As it relates to our longer-term capital allocation strategy, we continue to operate from a position of strength with underlying strong organic growth in each of our businesses.\nWith the growth and margin profile we have today, our hurdle rate to achieve accretion is notably higher than in years past. In addition, we want to make clear that while we are now open to looking at transactions that could be slightly larger, these are by no means the only targets in our funnel. We are prioritizing the right deals not necessarily larger deals and continue to be active, diligent and patient.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2023. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance at midpoint and expect total revenue in the range of $3.995 billion to $4.035 billion and EPS of $3.87 to $3.94. With only one quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $910 million to $950 million and EPS of $0.80 to $0.87 for our fiscal fourth quarter.\nWith respect to foreign exchange, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly less than $40 million for the full year, a marginal improvement compared to our previous guidance.\nTurning to our Divisions. We want to reiterate that each business should grow double digits in our fiscal 2023, excluding the impact of COVID. However, it is important to remember that 2023 is a unique fiscal year. As a reminder, part of our elevated growth this year has been due to weak comps from supply chain headwinds and COVID's impact on procedural volumes in fiscal 2022. In addition, 2023 is a 53-week fiscal year. Therefore, as we move closer to our fiscal 2024, as Steve discussed, it is appropriate to model our base business revenue growth within our previously outlined 5% to 7% long-term range. Reinforce Steve's comments, this growth is even more impressive than when we introduced the target given our recent base business outperformance and headwinds from the macro environment.\nStarting with Diagnostics. We expect to close out the year with another strong quarter led by molecular. Our growth continues to be driven by improving utilization and menu expansion on Panther, coupled with increasing contribution from Biotheranostics. Closing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue approximately $35 million for the year.\nIn terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $10 million in our fourth quarter of 2023 and slightly more than $235 million for the full year. Related items are expected to be slightly more than $25 million in the fourth quarter and slightly less than $120 million for the full year. As we look forward with COVID testing revenue, demand and public concern for the disease continue to abate. Therefore, although we plan financially conservative in our COVID estimates, areas of significant upside to our COVID guidance are likely in the rearview mirror.\nIt is also key to recognize that COVID is an accretive product and therefore, as COVID testing revenue shift lower in the next several quarters, this will represent a headwind to margins.\nMoving to Breast Health. In Q4, we anticipate similar performance to Q3, delivering double-digit revenue growth aided by strong demand as weak comps in the prior period -- as well as weak comps in prior periods.\nFinally, in Surgical, we expect healthy double-digit growth for the full year, but assume growth rates will start to moderate in Q4 given the elevated comparable period revenue we generated in the prior year.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated temporary elevated cost pressures in our guidance. On this point, we remind everyone that our elevated cost profile is less related to current movements in spot prices, which have been receiving.\nFor example, one of the primary drivers of our higher assumed costs is semiconductor chips, we have previously procured at higher prices. As we work down our backlog in Breast Health, we'll see this higher cost amortized through the P&L over the next several quarters and persist into our fiscal 2024. We continue to work down the P&L. We expect operating expenses in Q4 to be relatively flat compared to Q3. Below operating income, we assume that other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $10 million in Q4.\nOur guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19.75% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $249 million for the full year.\nTo conclude, our strong third quarter results highlights a durable business that is poised to sustainably grow over the long term. Our growth in the quarter was diverse, with each business again growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. As we close out our fiscal 2023 and look to 2024, we are excited about the unique growth drivers in each of our franchises and the optionality provided by our pristine balance sheet. Our stakeholders can count on Hologic to deliver against our financial commitments while also advancing the global state of women's health.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Rachel, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Rachel. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso, during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics; finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Stryker Corp.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our exceptional results confirmed that Hologic is now a much bigger, stronger company with more diverse and durable growth than pre-pandemic. On top of this transformation, with our strong cash flow and exceptional balance sheet, we are operating from a position of strength and are poised to carry our positive momentum forward. We've also said throughout the pandemic that we've dramatically strengthened the company. We recognize that this transformation was harder to see and fully appreciate against a backdrop of COVID spikes and supply chain anomalies.\nAs these clouds continue to clear the result of our robust transformation really shines. For the quarter, total revenue was $1.03 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.06, both results were above the high end of our guidance. Before providing the highlights for the quarter, which admittedly did have 2 more selling days, and we were going against softer comps from last year due to the Omicron surge, make no mistake about it, we are very proud of these results.\nFirst and most notable, our organic revenue, excluding COVID, grew 21.9% and with 2 out of 3 divisions growing north of 25%. By division, excluding COVID, Diagnostics were 14.9%, and again, powered by molecular diagnostics, which grew nearly 24%. Surgical also continued to deliver growing 25.2%. And Breast Health returned to growth, posting a very strong performance of 25.7% growth.\nOur outstanding results are a testament to the commitment of our many colleagues around the world to our purpose, passion and promise to elevate women's health. Without the discipline and incredible execution of our teams who have shown up every day throughout the pandemic. This strong performance would not be possible.\nTurning to our themes for today. First, we'll provide insight into the growth drivers in each division to showcase and to reinforce the diversity and durability of our transformed business. Second, we'll review our strong performance against our 2023 guidance and longer-term growth targets, helping to frame the outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year and longer term. And to close, we'll reflect on where we stand with COVID today, our progress through the pandemic and our excitement as we look ahead. With that brief introduction, let's now focus on our second quarter performance and specifically, the growth drivers powering our strong results.\nAt the highest level, we continue to demonstrate and appreciate that many of you have come to realize our business is dramatically different compared to where we were pre-pandemic. We are more balanced, more diverse and more durable. Through the pandemic, we strategically added growth drivers across the company that are contributing to our top line growth today and will do so for years ahead. These innovative products and services are also accretive to our overall strength within the markets we participate in, deepening our strong relationships with the customers we serve.\nWhile the macro environment continues to present a multitude of challenges, you can count on us to deliver. In Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics continues to lead the way. Our expanded global installed base of Panthers, over 3,250 strong represents the catalyst for the division's sustained growth. The superior workflow of the Panther combined with our broad menu of nearly 20 FDA-approved assays across the Panther and Panther Fusion systems, creates tremendous value for our customers. and differentiates us from our competition.\nAs we exit the pandemic, we are placing more menu with more throughput on more Panthers and adding more Panther Fusion systems, positioning labs to unlock our full breadth of menu over time. Hologic and our Panther systems are well positioned to continue our strong performance.\nConsistent with prior quarters, the pillars of Molecular Diagnostics growth were diverse in the period. Growth was driven by our BVCVTV vaginitis panel and aided by our core STI menu, including Clemidiagonrhia, HPV and Trich. We also once again had strong contributions from Biotheranostics and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion, where we expect the latter of the 2 to be more seasonal in nature.\nIn Breast Health, after 4 quarters of decline, primarily due to semiconductor chip supply headwinds, the division emphatically returned to growth, posting 25.7% growth for the quarter. Comp considerations aside, the strong growth in Breast Health resulted from a combination of 4 positive factors.\nFirst, semiconductor chip availability continues to improve, allowing for the delivery of more gantries in the quarter than planned. This included moving a number of gantries originally allocated for the back half of the year into the second quarter. As a result, for the balance of the year, we anticipate Q3 and Q4 gantry delivery levels to each register modestly below Q2, though still well ahead of last year as our visibility and chip availability continues to strengthen.\nSecond, exceptional demand for our clinically differentiated mammography instruments remains high. And despite the duration of the chip headwind, our backlog remains strong, and we are seeing no increase in order cancellations.\nThird, in Q2, we again delivered strong service revenue service being the largest source of revenue for the division as we consistently demonstrate our value proposition and strengthen our relationships with customers.\nAnd fourth, the interventional side of the Breast Health business returned to form, growing 13.9% for the quarter, driven by our disposable portfolio such as Brevera biopsy needles and Somatex [ 2 ] Mark markers. This strong interventional result also serves as an indication of our success navigating some of the non-chip related supply chain headwinds we faced in prior quarters. To close out Breast Health, we'd like to take this opportunity to thank our chip supply partners who have aligned with our purpose and have prioritized women's health. As a result, we had the ability and confidence to deliver more gantries than projected this quarter, and our customers are better positioned to screen more women sooner rather than later. We are thankful for these strengthened partnerships, which have also undeniably influenced our innovation and design efforts, making Hologic even stronger for the future.\nWhile much attention has been given to Diagnostics and Breast Health, our surgical business has also remarkably transformed during the last few years and is emerging as a meaningful driver of growth for us globally, a completely different business than 3 to 4 years ago. It's much bigger, stronger and faster growing. In Q2, Surgical grew more than 25% and was driven by strong contributions from our hysteroscopic portfolio of MyoSure the Fluent fluid management system and NovaSure.\nOn the latter, we are encouraged by yet another strong quarter for our latest NovaSure iteration, the NovaSure V5. In addition, our laparoscopic portfolio continues to build momentum and is growing into a larger driver for the division. Now we'll move on from the division growth drivers to reflect on our performance against our guidance for the year. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that each division would deliver low double-digit organic growth for 2023, excluding COVID. As the Q2 close marks the halfway point of the fiscal year, we are pleased to share our progress towards achieving our 2023 goal.\nThrough the first half of our fiscal year, the total company has delivered organic growth of nearly 14%, excluding COVID. And by division, Diagnostics, Surgical and Health have grown 15.4%, 19.6% and 9.1%, respectively. This puts us in great shape to achieve or exceed our initial low double-digit 2023 targets. Looking ahead, Diagnostics and Surgical, we will have much tougher comps going forward. By the close of Q3 last year, both divisions were posting solid numbers, resulting in a healthier, stronger comps will now be facing. And for Breast Health going forward, due to the phasing of the chip headwind, the opposite is true. Our Breast Health comps in the back half of fiscal '23 will be softer than in Q2.\nNow focusing on our longer-term growth projections. With recent very strong results, we understand that some may question whether our 5% to 7% excluding COVID, organic revenue growth rate through 2025 is still appropriate. In short, we believe that it is because we see fiscal '23 as a unique year. Taking a step back, we view our long-term revenue goal as more impressive today due to our expectation for double-digit growth in 2023 on top of our already strong performance since we announced the target.\nShifting gears to our final topic today, COVID. In Q2, we generated $71 million in COVID assay revenue, exceeding our prior guidance of $50 million. We are excited for the opportunity to turn the corner and further concentrate our energy and resources to continue to drive our dynamic business forward. Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, we maximize the opportunities presented. We rose to the occasion, delivering high-quality, highly accurate molecular tests to meet the world's thing needs. For this, we are extremely proud. And should COVID Wave's return leaning on a massive expansion of our manufacturing capacity and operational flexibility, we are even more capable of weathering future storms.\nWe are also extremely proud of the larger and stronger business Hologic is today. We've accelerated years of Panther placements across the globe. And as a byproduct, we expanded our largely domestic business into a much more formidable global enterprise. Today, Hologic is a more recognized and respected worldwide brand which is immensely more influence to advance women's health around the world. With the benefits from our response to the pandemic. We diligently and thoughtfully invested in our business, adding growth driving products through organic R&D innovation and completing strategic acquisitions. And equally important, through it all, even during the strongest quarters of COVID revenue, we maintained expense discipline. We managed our business with precision and never got ahead of ourselves with headcount. And when the world needed it most, we made opportunistic and carefully timed to marketing investments with our Super Bowl ad and WTA sponsorship, each encouraging women to prioritize their health and to return to well woman exams that were put off during the pandemic, maintaining our operational discipline and opportunistic investment approach, affords us the ability to continue to support R&D, marketing and sales initiatives today, all while keeping expenses relatively flat versus a year ago, after adjusting for the Super Bowl and WTA initiatives.\nAll in, our Q2 results demonstrate that we are realizing the benefits of our transformed bigger, stronger business that is fueled by our purpose-driven culture. We've built our culture from the ground up over many years, and it has powered our success through the challenges of pandemic, where we maximized our opportunity. As a result, Hologic has transformed into the strong force we are today and at the same time, transformed our future. We have strengthened our durable growth path, and our future is bright.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. In my statements today, I'm going to recap our divisional revenue results, provide a walk-through of our income statement, touch on a few other key financial metrics and finish with our guidance for the full year and third quarter of fiscal 2023. As Steve said, our second quarter financial results were very strong and well ahead of our expectations for both revenue and profitability. Total revenue came in at $1.03 billion beating the midpoint of our guidance by over $70 million. And our non-GAAP earnings per share were $1.06, 25% higher than the midpoint of our guide. .\nWe also continue to repurchase our shares. In Q2, we repurchased approximately 600,000 shares for $50 million. And year-to-date, we have repurchased 2.2 million shares for $150 million. Before moving to our divisional results, we want to emphasize again that our balance sheet is a bedrock of strength in an uncertain macro landscape. With nearly $2.6 billion of cash and a leverage ratio well below our target range, we have tremendous amount of firepower should opportunities for capital deployment arise. However, while we are very active, our philosophy remains to be patient, which we will discuss in more substance shortly.\nBefore we do that, let me recap our divisional revenue results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $464.7 million declined 52.2%. However, it is important to recognize that COVID testing revenue in the prior year period was inflated because of Omicron. Specifically, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue in Q2 2022, more than 8x higher than our COVID assay revenue for Q2 2023. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the long-term health of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay and related ancillary revenues.\nBy making this adjustment, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 14.9% in the quarter. The Diagnostics division continues to be led by molecular, which grew nearly 24% in the period, excluding COVID. As Steve highlighted, Power in Q2 performance within Molecular Diagnostics was our increasingly diverse portfolio of assets as the newer assays contributed alongside our legacy women's health portfolio. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses declined 0.7% compared to the prior year.\nMoving to Breast Health. Our fiscal second quarter results were terrific. Total revenue of $385.4 million increased 25.7%, and while this performance was aided by soft comps due to supply chain headwinds in the prior year, the outcome still exceeded our estimates. Moving next to Surgical. Second quarter revenue of $144.8 million increased approximately 25% compared to the prior year. And finally, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $31.6 million increased slightly more than 53%. It is important to point out that growth rates in our Skeletal business can change based on the timing of just a few orders, therefore, we would caution when modeling not to extrapolate this level of growth going forward.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 62.1% was driven by strong performance in our base business and higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing revenues. Total operating expenses of $317 million in the second quarter decreased 6.3%. The decrease was driven by less marketing spend as our Super Bowl ad in the initial portion of the expense from our partnership with the WTA were incurred in the prior year period. When normalizing for these marketing initiatives, total operating expenses would have been relatively flat compared to the prior year, partially offsetting lower marketing spend in the quarter was higher R&D and sales expense as we continue to invest in internal programs to drive top line growth.\nBelow operating income, other expense represented a gain in our fiscal second quarter. Net, we benefited from higher interest rates in the period as interest income from our nearly $2.6 billion cash balance more than offset elevated interest expense on our floating rate debt instruments. Finally, our tax rate in Q2 was 19%, as expected.\nPutting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in at 31.3% and net margin was 25.9%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $265.7 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.06. Moving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $206.3 million in the second quarter. We had nearly $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2x. As it relates to our broader capital allocation strategy, our philosophy remains unchanged. We continue to be very active and selective in screening potential targets, while also exercising discipline and patience. We are operating from a position of strength as we explore opportunities.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2023. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million, representing another quarter of double-digit growth when you exclude COVID. For the full year fiscal 2023, we are again increasing our guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.925 billion to $4.025 billion.\nTo help with constant currency modeling, we are assuming minimal foreign exchange headwinds in the third quarter at less than $5 million. And for the full year, we are expecting approximately $40 million in foreign exchange headwinds. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the relative strength of the U.S. dollar has abated over the past several months.\nTurning to our divisions. Each business maintains its own unique growth drivers for the remainder of our fiscal 2023 and beyond. In Diagnostics, we expect continued strong performance out of molecular, aided by steady support from cytology. Within molecular, we are excited to go after additional greenfield opportunities with newer assays such as BV/CVTV and Amgen, while also reinforcing our leadership position in core women's health screening.\nClosing out non-COVID diagnostics, we expect blood revenue of slightly more than $30 million for the year. In terms of COVID revenue, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $25 million in the third quarter of 2023 and $245 million for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be slightly less than $30 million in the third quarter and approximately $120 million for the full year.\nMoving to Breast Health. As mentioned, we capitalized on improved chip availability and moved a number of gantries allocated for the back half of the year into Q2. As a result, we are assuming total Breast Health revenue above Q1 2023 levels for each quarter in the back half of this fiscal year, but below Q2. These results are still expected to deliver healthy double-digit revenue growth compared to the prior year in Q3 and Q4.\nFinally, in Surgical, we expect strong low double-digit growth in fiscal Q3 and for the full year. Starting with our legacy portfolio, we are pleased by the performance of NovaSure and MyoSure. In NovaSure, customers continue to see the benefits of our innovative V5 line extension. And with MyoSure, we continue to grow the myomectomy total addressable market. However, the beauty of our surgical business today is that the franchise is more than just NovaSure, MyoSure, and our guidance contemplates fluent, Bolder and Acessa adding accretive growth to the division's top line.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 to 250 basis points, which we expect to persist throughout fiscal 2023 and likely into fiscal 2024.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to move lower sequentially in Q3 and remain relatively flat in Q4. As Steve shared, we are proud of how we have managed expenses over the last several years. Our level of operating expense is expected to decline not because of reduction in head count but rather due to our efficient management of larger marketing initiatives coinciding with periods of elevated COVA testing revenue. Below operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of slightly more than $20 million for the full year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $250 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.83 to $0.93 in the third quarter and $3.75 to $3.95 for the year.\nTo conclude, our strong second quarter results exceeded our guidance, and we are once again raising our full year estimates despite larger macro uncertainties. Our growth in the quarter was broad-based with each business growing double digits organically, excluding COVID. Our results reinforce the fact that Hologic is a much stronger company than just a few years ago. We are larger and more durable than prior to the pandemic and balance sheet is as strong as it's ever been. As we move to the back half of our fiscal 2020 , we are excited to continue to advance women's health, while also delivering strong financial results and creating value for all of our stakeholders.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Justin, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Justin. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2023 Earnings Call.\nWith me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer. Our first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them as well as an updated corporate presentation. And a replay of this call will be available for the next 30 days.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nDuring this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and sales from discontinued products in Diagnostics.\nFinally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\nOur results highlight the strength of our 3 divisions, the power of our commercial channels and the increasing impact of our transformative growth drivers from R&D and acquisitions.\nFor the quarter, total revenue was $1.07 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.07, both above the high end of our guidance. We also repurchased 1.5 million shares of our stock for a $100 million in the quarter.\nTo recap our pre-release, while we did have the benefit of 3 extra selling days, our topline performance was strong. Diagnostics grew 15.8%, powered by Molecular Diagnostics, which grew 24.5%. Both figures are organic and exclude COVID. Surgical also delivered an impressive quarter, growing 14.7% organically. And Breast Health finished the quarter down only 5.2%, a signal that our recovery from chip-related supply chain headwinds is indeed underway. While the extra days contributed approximately 250 basis points of growth, net, even without the extra days, Diagnostics and Surgical both grew double digits and Breast Health exceeded prior guidance.\nAll in, we are well-positioned to achieve our full year guidance of low double-digit organic growth ex-COVID in all 3 of our franchises, well above our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate. Our balance sheet and cash flow are exceptionally strong, and we continue to create value for our stakeholders.\nToday, we'd like to cover 2 main topics. First, we'll build on the thesis from our JPMorgan presentation 3 weeks ago, a theme that encapsulates how we improve women's health globally, drive our commercial success and elevate Hologic's reputation at the same time.\nSecond, we'll highlight the transformation of our business and showcase the growth we are driving in each division, which we hope is now becoming much more evident in recent quarters. We are incredibly excited about today and confident about our future.\nJumping right in, purpose driven, results driven. These 4 words comprised the theme of our JPMorgan presentation this year, and these 4 words underpin the success of our entire business. At Hologic, we have an unparalleled commitment to women's health. When we speak purpose driven, results driven, nothing symbolizes these words better than our virtuous circle, which we feature in our corporate presentation. It is simple and powerful at the same time. Most importantly, it unifies and inspires our thousands of employees around the world and points our talented workforce in one singular direction, to elevate women's health, where we have leadership positions in each segment in which we operate.\nOur business starts with innovative, clinically differentiated, life-changing, life-saving technologies. Whether through R&D or by M&A, it all starts with innovation. As we bring these new innovative products to market, they grow our sales and profits.\nAnd here is the key to our success -- what we believe sets us apart and allows us to thrive. We then invest these profits into championing women's health on a global scale. We are expanding policy and access, which then allows our products to reach more women and have an even greater impact on the world. And as our business grows, the cycle continues, simple and powerful.\nTwo weeks ago, for the second straight year, we had the opportunity to engage with global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. This is an incredible platform that was not available to us just 3 years ago. We've earned our access through our leadership in women's health, our pioneering Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our outstanding response to COVID that continues today.\nAs we've grown our business, we have significantly elevated the Hologic brand around the world. With our engagement at Davos, making powerful connections and building strong relationships, combined with recognition from our global partnership with the Women's Tennis Association, Hologic and what we stand for is more recognized globally than ever before, which in turn helps us attract the best and the brightest to the Hologic team, an important advantage in today's labor market. Quite frankly, the best thing we can do for the world and also for our business is to raise awareness and opportunities for women's health globally.\nFor a sense of scale, there are approximately 170 million women in the U.S., our largest market. This is only a fraction of the nearly 4 billion women in the world. We have a long way to go. And as the importance of women's health is elevated and these markets grow, Hologic will be there at each step along the way.\nShifting gears to our second topic, understanding the growth that is driving our business. With our strong performance for the quarter, the #1 question we are asked is, how are we growing our top line? To answer this question, we will first reflect on our business transformation, a powerful mix of organic innovation and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. Second, we will discuss each division and highlight examples of our growth engines and the multitude of market strategies deployed across each division.\nReflecting on our transformation, it really started well before COVID. Three years ago, we were ready to show the world how we had diligently and thoughtfully strengthened our business for growth, then the pandemic hit. And when it did, we established 3 goals: one, take care of our employees, which we have done; two, meet the world's needs for highly accurate molecular diagnostic COVID testing, which we continue today; and three, emerge as a fundamentally stronger company, which is happening now.\nUnder the cloud of COVID, while successfully deploying Panthers and producing our COVID assays, we strengthened Hologic for the long term to a level higher than even we had imagined prior to the pandemic. We achieved this through the combination of innovative internal R&D efforts, plus a series of tuck-in acquisitions. As a result, we've had continuous new product releases that have fundamentally transformed our business and boosted our growth profile.\nNow as the COVID cloud begins to clear, it is increasingly more evident that we are geared for success, geared for growth and geared to sustained performance over the long term.\nNext, to fully appreciate our growth potential is to understand the transformation and diversification of our portfolio and growth strategies. Across all divisions, we are innovating, acquiring and building new markets, entering underdeveloped markets and penetrating existing segments, all while continuing to defend and even grow share in the markets we lead.\nOur growth in each division is grounded in strong and durable core products. These resilient core franchises are backed by long-established clinical needs and commercial relationships, which provide a rock solid foundation to leverage into our newer growth drivers. We leverage our installed bases and customer relationships to advance our newer products, which we expect to both diversify the portfolio and accelerate growth.\nMoving on to the divisions. In Diagnostics, we have leading positions in core women's health product lines such as STIs and cervical cancer. Our Women's Health molecular diagnostics and cytology base drive steady growth and supports positive relationships with top laboratories and key opinion leaders, which opens the door for additional new products.\nToday, diagnostics has grown from primarily a U.S. women's health business to a global diagnostics franchise with many more growth drivers. For example, we now have over 3,250 Panthers worldwide, a number beyond what we had even imagined, along with 19 assays and the Fusion system that enables even further menu expansion. We also have a vastly expanded footprint with 3 acquisitions: Biotheranostics, Diagenode and Mobidiag that are contributing today and will even more so in the future.\nMore specifically, driving future growth for diagnostics means leveraging our expanded Panther installed base. These customers are adopters of our newer assays, including BV CV/TV and M. Gen. We add menu, promote guidelines and drive adoption through our women's health clinical channel. Likewise, we also leverage our Panther installed base to enter established categories such as virology and respiratory testing.\nFocusing on our diagnostics acquisitions. With Biotheranostics, we are already seeing solid contributions as we build a new market that is currently minimally penetrated. And with Mobidiag, the Novodiag platform allows for significant future contributions as we prepare to enter the large and emerging syndromic panel market that is adjacent to our core molecular diagnostics franchise.\nIn Breast Health, revenue from our 3D mammography equipment and the related service represents the core revenue foundation of the division. While our fiscal '23 growth is primarily driven by the return of chip supply and gantry availability, the division is primed for future growth via further portfolio expansion.\nThe Breast Health business now spans the breast continuum of care with more recurring growth drivers than ever before. We have expanded from what was once a capital-intensive business by growing service revenue and adding more recurring disposable revenue. In doing so, we are creating new markets as with our Brevera Breast Biopsy System, while also entering existing markets where we compete with clinically differentiated products. And while we are leaders in the screening space, our R&D teams are poised to keep us ahead of the pack.\nIn surgical, the business has changed dramatically, evolving from essentially a 2-product division to one which is now much more robust and diverse. Last quarter, revenue outside of NovaSure and core MyoSure represented approximately 25% of the division's total compared to only approximately 10% in fiscal 2019. While NovaSure and core MyoSure still form a strong, durable base of the division, the business is far more dynamic than pre-pandemic. We now have meaningful growth drivers outside of these 2 core product lines from acquisitions, new in-house products and also improvements to existing products.\nGoing a level deeper, the growth in Surgical is driven by products like Fluent as well as NovaSure v5, both from our internal R&D efforts. With Fluent, we created an elegant solution to hysteroscopic fluid management that stands alone. And with our NovaSure v5 line extension, we have proven that even the best can get better and that we are never satisfied and never done innovating.\nBy acquisition, the Acessa procedure and the Bolder advanced vessel sealing portfolio also diversify and elevate the division's growth trajectory. These are both laparoscopic tools that we've moved swiftly to acquire during COVID times and have added to our prior hysteroscopic only offering.\nAcessa is a unique radio frequency fibroid removal solution where we are building a new market and improved improving payer coverage. In Bolder, we are entering an underdeveloped market by deploying our large surgical sales force to introduce our advanced sealing portfolio to the OB GYN market.\nFinally, our international business is so much stronger and poised for exceptional future growth post pandemic. Bolstering the individual product growth drivers in each division, we continue to penetrate our markets internationally. For example, in the quarter, our Diagnostics business ex-COVID and surgical businesses each grew more than 20%. As we've stated before, we expect international growth rates to be accretive to our overall growth rate for years to come.\nIn summary, our commitment to our purpose has paved the way for our success during the pandemic and is a beacon for our future. We are now a transformed, much stronger Hologic with more diverse growth drivers across each business and a much larger, more capable international presence. And through our innovative R&D and effective tuck-in acquisition strategy, we are well-positioned to continue to drive strong, sustainable growth for years to come.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe are pleased to share first quarter results that exceeded our guidance on both the topline and bottom line.\nOur strong performance was once again driven by our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, with each growing mid-teens organically in the period, excluding COVID-19 revenue. And in Breast Health, we are encouraged by results that show the chip supplies moving in the right direction and that our mammography business is recovering.\nBefore moving into our divisional results, it is important to highlight our balance sheet. Our leverage ratio of 0.2x shows a capital structure that is strong as it has ever been, providing our business a tremendous amount of flexibility for internal investments and capital deployment opportunities.\nMoving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results.\nIn the first quarter, revenue and profitability once again meaningfully surpassed our estimates, with a balanced beat split between our base business and COVID. Total revenue came in at $1.074 billion, a result more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance and non-GAAP EPS was $1.07, more than $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide.\nTurning to our business results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $559.3 million declined 41.2% compared to the prior year. It is important to remember that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal first quarter of 2022, given the surge in infections from the Omicron variant. Thus, a more accurate representation of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making this normalization, we see that organic diagnostics revenue increased 15.8% in the quarter.\nWithin Diagnostics, we continue to see momentum in molecular. For the third quarter in a row, we delivered healthy double-digit growth. Specifically, Molecular Diagnostics grew nearly 25% in our first quarter, excluding the impact of COVID. This outstanding result demonstrates strong utilization across our significantly larger Panther installed base. Performance was driven by a mix of our legacy portfolio and newer assays. For example, the collective revenue of our core STI menu was well above pre-pandemic levels in the quarter.\nIn addition, BV CV/TV had another strong quarter, more than doubling compared to the prior year. As our progress continues growing the IVD vaginitis market. Further, our non-COVID respiratory portfolio delivered revenue ahead of expectations in the period. As we saw uptake in testing for flu, and RSV, given heightened prevalence and public awareness of these pathogens. Finally, the Biotheranostics' contribution to our base molecular performance continues to increase with accretive revenue growth in the quarter.\nMoving to our COVID results. We generated $127 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our previous guidance of $75 million. In terms of the COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic sales led most of our upside and represented nearly 80% of COVID assay revenue in the period. The demand for our COVID assay remains primarily COVID only. However, we did see above-trend demand for our COVID flu multiplex test. Rounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal businesses increased 1.6% compared to the prior year.\nIn Breast Health, total revenue of $334.2 million was down 5.2%, better than expected. These results were driven by strong demand for our mammography equipment and improving semiconductor chip supply. We remain cautiously optimistic that Q1 revenue performance in our Breast Imaging segment being down only 4.5%, highlights that the worth of the chip supply headwinds are likely behind us. We would remind everyone we are still on allocation and that the macro backdrop could change quickly. As it relates to our interventional business, revenue was down 8% in the period, driven by lingering supply chain issues outside of chip availability. We expect these headwinds to subside for the balance of the year and the segment to resume a cadence of strong growth starting in fiscal Q2.\nIn Surgical, first quarter revenue of $154.1 million grew more than 17%, and excluding the Bolder acquisition, the business grew nearly 15%. These results underscore a more diverse surgical business with more growth drivers than in the past. In addition to strong performance from MyoSure and better-than-expected results from NovaSure, the quarter showcased increasing contributions from Fluent and our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder. Lastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $26.6 million increased slightly less than 1% compared to the prior year period.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 62.7% was driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing revenues and strong performance in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $339.4 million in the first quarter increased 1.6% but were up less than 1% when excluding expenses from Bolder, which closed at the end of November 2021. The increase was led by higher marketing spend given the timing of certain initiatives. We expect marketing expense to move lower starting in our fiscal second quarter of 2023.\nBelow operating income, other expense was less than anticipated primarily due to higher interest income from investing our elevated cash balances at higher interest rates. Finally, our tax rate in Q1 was 19-ish% as expected. Putting these pieces together, Operating margin for Q1 came in at 31.1%, and net margin was 24.9%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non-GAAP net income finished at $267.9 million and non-GAAP EPS was $1.07.\nMoving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operation was $253.4 million in the first quarter. We had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio remained at 0.2x. Although it may appear to the outside eye that we are letting our cash balance build, rest assured, our M&A teams in each division are incredibly active. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. Our first priority remains pursuing growth-accretive tuck-in deals that align with our divisions and leverage our core strengths and strong commercial channels.\nMore recently, given the stability of our balance sheet and the strength of our business, we have widened our aperture to consider slightly larger EBITDA of generating deals. That said, it is important to make clear that we expect any transaction we pursue will be complementary to our core strengths and not represent a completely new or unrelated vertical. Our second priority will continue to be share repurchases, and as Steve highlighted, in the first quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $100 million.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, all deals are part of our organic base starting in Q2 2023. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we again expect strong financial results, with total revenue in the range of $930 million to $980 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we are increasing our full year guidance and expect total revenue in the range of $3.85 billion to $4 billion, reflecting low double-digit organic growth ex COVID across each of our divisions.\nHelp with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign currency exchange headwind of slightly less than $20 million in the second quarter of 2023 and approximately $50 million for the full year. These headwinds have improved compared to our previous guidance as the U.S. dollar has depreciated over the past several months.\nTurning to our divisions. We are thrilled with the outlook for each business as we continue to anticipate that core diagnostics, excluding COVID, Breast Health and Surgical will organically grow low double digits for our fiscal 2023.\nIn Diagnostics, molecular should continue to lead the way. We expect our assays to drive growth as non-COVID utilization improves and customers add additional menu to their Panther systems. As a reminder, our molecular diagnostics growth is not predicated on placing more Panther instruments. We're rather helping our existing customers grow their business. As we have said consistently, even though Panther placements are likely to slow in the near term, given the huge pull forward during the pandemic, additional placements do not influence the trajectory of our molecular outlook. Building out on Diagnostics, we expect blood revenue to slightly less than $25 million for the year.\nMoving to Breast Health. We see an improving environment for chip supply and our position is unchanged from last quarter. Our expectation is that for a gradual improvement in our breast imaging business throughout 2023. We maintain our view that the business should exit fiscal 2023 at or near normal levels. However, we'd like to make clear that you should not expect an outsized revenue catch-up in any particular quarter. Instead, our plan is to incrementally work down our backlog over time as we look to efficiently manage the resources of our outstanding field service team.\nFinally, in Surgical, as evidenced by our first quarter's results, the business has quietly transformed into a dynamic franchise, moving beyond what was once a 2-product division. Low double-digit organic growth for fiscal 2023 will be driven by a combination of MyoSure, the related Fluent Fluid Management System and our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter of 2023 and $225 million for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the second quarter and $130 million for the full year.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the low 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Within this operating margin profile, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance of approximately 200 to 250 basis points, which we anticipate will persist throughout our fiscal 2023.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to step down starting in our second quarter, given the timing of marketing expenses primarily associated with our WTA partnership. Further, we foresee operating expense dollars as fairly flat sequentially from Q2 through Q4.\nBelow operating income, we expect other income net to be an expense of around $50 million for the rest of the year. Our guidance is based on an annual effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately 251 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the second quarter and $3.55 to $3.85 for the year.\nTo conclude, let me wrap up by repeating that our strong first quarter results exceeded our guidance in spite of persistent macro uncertainties. Performance was driven by tremendous growth in our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses, combined with a better-than-expected progress in breast health. As we look forward to the remainder of our fiscal 2023, we are excited to showcase our transformed business, with our updated guidance reinforcing our expectations of low double-digit growth in each division for the remainder of the year. Hologic is a much stronger company than prior to the pandemic and we believe our 2023 performance will further prove this out.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Jenny, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Jenny. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur fourth quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website.

MacMillan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. Happy Halloween. We're pleased to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and provide guidance for fiscal '23. It was another dynamic year for Hologic, delivering strong performance while navigating macro headwinds, and we closed 2022 once again posting outstanding results for the quarter.\nTotal revenue was $953.3 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.82, exceeding both our base business and COVID guidance. We also deployed $175 million of capital to buy back 2.5 million shares in the quarter. For those of you keeping score, for the full year, we utilized $542 million of our exceptional cash flow to repurchase 7.7 million shares, reflecting great confidence in our future.\nFor today's call, we'll first provide a high-level overview of our fourth quarter performance and then reflect on our full year results. In doing so, we'll also share insights into our future outlook as we look forward to 2023.\nOverall, make no mistake, our consistent strong performance in these turbulent times is no coincidence. We are a fundamentally different company today than when we entered the COVID pandemic. We also understand that some of you are still trying to ascertain the strength of our core businesses.\nAs we look ahead, each of our core franchises, listen closely here, diagnostics, breast and surgical are expected to produce low double-digit top line growth for fiscal 2023.\nAs we set out to do just over 2.5 years ago, we are emerging from the pandemic a much stronger company. We thoughtfully and strategically reinvested our upside earnings into both our business and into our passion to be champions for women's health. Our ability to step up to the plate during the pandemic and address the global demand for COVID testing was an incredible achievement. But our real home run was the transformation of Hologic that cannot be ignored.\nThrough organic and inorganic additions, we now have more growth drivers across our business in each of our divisions than ever before. These growth drivers layered on top of our market-leading core franchises form a solid foundation that anchors our business in these volatile and pivotal times.\nUnder the intense pressures of the macroeconomic landscape we live in today, all companies will face adversity. That said, because Hologic is a much stronger company today, we will thrive. As we've said before, you can count on us to deliver on our commitments even in the face of volatility and uncertainty.\nIt's equally important to recognize that our revenue is the least capital sensitive it has ever been in our 36-year history. For fiscal '22, given COVID and the impact from chip shortages, only 12% of our revenue was from capital. A percentage we expect will settle well below pre-pandemic levels. A truly astounding change from where we were just a few years ago and a transformation that makes Hologic a more durable company in the face of a potential recessionary environment.\nOur confidence and conviction in our business is underpinned by our unwavering commitment to our purpose-driven business strategy, a strategy that is centered around our purpose to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day; our passion to become global champions for women's health; and our promise the science of sure.\nWe don't see our commitment to mission and ESG as a trend or fad. Instead, we know that in order to continue to achieve our strong financial results, we must continue on our path to elevate and improve women's health and well-being around the world.\nNow let's turn to the quarter results. As expected, our strong performance was driven primarily by both our molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses. To answer the question, we're sure many of you are wondering, core Panther utilization is strong. Our Molecular Diagnostics business grew north of 17% in Q4, excluding COVID, driven primarily by more assays being run through our expanded Panther installed base. This exceptional growth was once again broad-based and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in our robust molecular portfolio.\nOur legacy STI business contributed growth dollars while our newer assays, including our vaginitis panel, Amgen and our virology portfolio lifted the growth rate. As for Panther placements, we now have nearly 3,250 Panthers placed around the world. A remarkable achievement considering we exited fiscal 2019 and slightly north of 1,700 Panthers in the field.\nIn Surgical, our business grew nearly 9% organically and over 11%, including the Bolder acquisition. As anticipated, the COVID pressure on our surgical business abated in the quarter, and we saw procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from our new business lines. Powering the strong performance in Surgical were the same growth drivers as in Q3, MyoSure Fluent and solid contributions from Bolder and Acessa.\nIn Breast Health, as expected, the business was down 16%, driven primarily by the chip shortage adversely impacting our gantry business. Having said that, we have confidence that the worst of the shortage is behind us and that the business will return and accelerate throughout 2023. We will go into more depth on Breast Health later in the call.\nShifting gears. We will now reflect on our full year results and outlook for fiscal 2023. For 2022, Diagnostics grew 10.2%, Surgical grew 6.3%, and Breast and Skeletal Health declined 7.7%, driven primarily by constrained gantry sales as a result of chip shortages.\nNet without the chip shortage, it is very clear that each of our businesses would have been solidly at or above our long-term guidance. As a reminder, each of these figures are in constant currency, exclude acquisitions until they annualize, and also exclude COVID assays as well as COVID-related and discontinued products revenue.\nWe are extremely proud of where we landed in both Diagnostics and Surgical. And we have high confidence that the concentrated impact on Breast Health will rebound strongly in 2023. Looking forward by division, as mentioned at the onset of this call, each of our businesses, including international, is expected to achieve low double-digit growth in fiscal 2023.\nIn Diagnostics, powered by our vastly expanded Panther installed base. We expect low double-digit growth from the division in 2023. Bolstering growth for the division, we expect continued strong sequential growth from Biotheranostics as well as incremental contribution from Mobi Diag internationally.\nFocusing on molecular diagnostics, our growth thesis centers on more customers running more volume and more menu on our Panther systems. While we are still in the early days of ramping utilization, we are already seeing positive signs today. With our broad menu, we are well positioned to continue double-digit growth in our core molecular Panther business in 2023.\nTo provide additional color and shed more light on non-COVID Panther utilization, pre-COVID at the end of our fiscal 2019, about 20% of U.S. customers we're running at least 4 assays on their Panther systems. Fast forward to the close of Q4, now over 33% of U.S. customers are running at least 4 assays, nice improvement and still future opportunity ahead.\nMoreover, last quarter, we spoke to the fact that over 90% of all COVID customers were running at least 1 other non-COVID assay. Many of you asked, what about new customers acquired during COVID? As of the Q4 close, over 85% of new customers worldwide are running at least 1 other assay on their Panthers in addition to COVID. More impressive is that over 55% of these new to Hologic customers are running at least 2 non-COVID assays on their Panthers, a strong signal of future utilization at new customer sites. While still early, we expect these positive utilization trends to continue in the quarters and years to come.\nNow turning to Surgical. We also expect Surgical to deliver low double-digit growth in 2023. Consistent with the last 2 quarters of 2022, we believe MyoSure and Fluent plus Acessa and Bolder will lead the way. We expect the division's revenue to accelerate as we continue to integrate our acquired laparoscopic assets into the business and into the bags of our strong surgical sales force. Increased physician access and payer coverage for our laparoscopic portfolio should continue to improve over time and be a tailwind for growth.\nLonger term, our goal is to build both Acessa and Bolder into $100 million plus surgical brands that will complement our market-leading NovaSure and MyoSure products.\nIn Breast Health, we fully expect to exit 2023, achieving low double-digit top line growth from the supply-constrained 2022 comps. We have confidence the worst of the chip shortage is behind us.\nAs chip supply normalizes, as it should over the course of 2023. We expect our gantry business to return to strength. Frankly, as we work down the backlog, we have the opportunity to perform slightly above the historical gantry replacement run rate as we exit the fiscal year.\nEven with the shortage of gantries we faced in 2022, we maintained our market-leading position in the U.S., grew our presence internationally and have no reason to believe we are giving any ground to the competition. In fact, the backlog for our best-in-class gantries continues to grow, and we continue to receive orders at a healthy rate.\nWe also understand capital budgets may face increased pressure given the macro environment. Despite this challenge, we remain confident in our ability to place gantries even if we enter a recession. The reality is that gantries tend to be at the lower price point of hospital capital spend. Gantries also represent both a value-driving opportunity for our customers and more importantly, essential capital equipment for world-class patient care.\nFinally, our international business will continue to be a tailwind and a powerful lever of growth for each division. In 2022, our international business grew just north of 6% organically, excluding COVID, posting strong growth even with the chip headwind and constrained gantry supply. International is now nearly 30% of total revenue and poised to continue its growth trajectory.\nLooking forward to 2023, we are confident our international business, excluding the impact of COVID, will return to double-digit top line growth and sustain the momentum created by our strong response to COVID and from our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index and our Global Access Initiative.\nTo conclude, at Hologic, we know we must center on our purpose to achieve our strong financial results. From our strong results, we will continue to drive patient education and access initiatives, and continue to invest in our business. From our strategic investments, we will continue to deliver innovative, life-changing technologies. These technologies will power our perpetual cycle of reaching and helping more patients, all while delivering value and strong financial results for our shareholders.\nBefore turning the call over to Karleen, let me close by saying that we are incredibly excited about where we have been and even more excited about where we're headed. And finally, from me personally and the rest of our global leadership team, we would like to thank and congratulate each and every one of our nearly 7,000 employees around the world for their dedication to our purpose and another incredible year at Hologic.\nWith that, let me hand the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our fourth quarter financial performance, capping off the end to an excellent fiscal year. These results highlight our current position of strength as well as tremendous opportunities that lie ahead.\nGrowth in the period was powered by our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses as both franchises posted strong growth to close 2022. For a second quarter in a row, these businesses each showcased multiple growth catalysts. And as we look towards our fiscal 2023, we are excited to drive this momentum forward.\nIn Breast Health, we are proud of the resilience of our teams. Although our chip allocations are still constrained, we believe that the worst of the vision supply chain problems are in the rear view. As I will highlight in more detail when discussing our guidance for next year, we should see continuous improvement in our chip supply and thus gantry revenue throughout fiscal 2023.\nFinally, before moving on to our divisional results, it is important to reiterate that our balance sheet is a key point of strength as we head into fiscal 2023. Our leverage rate remains far below our target range and our capital structure is pristine, providing our business incredible confidence and flexibility given the increasingly uncertain macro environment.\nMoving on, I will now provide more color on our financial results. In the fourth quarter, revenue and profitability once again significantly exceeded our estimates as total revenue came in at $953.3 million. This result was nearly $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance despite a greater-than-expected FX headwind approximately $27 million in the quarter. And non-GAAP EPS was $0.82, roughly $0.20 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide.\nTurning to our businesses' results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $520.9 million declined 35.6% compared to the prior year. However, it is important to note that COVID testing revenue was elevated in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2021 due to the onset of the Delta variant. Therefore, a more accurate depiction of the state of the Diagnostics business is to exclude COVID assay revenue, related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products. When making these adjustments, we see that worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 11% in the quarter, a fantastic result.\nWithin Diagnostics, our molecular business was again extremely strong, growing more than 17% in the fourth quarter when excluding the impact of COVID-19. Growth in molecular was broad-based, driven by solid performance in our legacy STI portfolio as well as continued success of both our vaginitis panel and our virology menu. These results, in conjunction with the exceptional performance of our molecular business last quarter, highlights strong traction in our base Panther business.\nAs it relates to our COVID results, we generated $151 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, well exceeding our previous guidance. In terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, Domestic demand outpaced our expectations with the U.S. COVID assay revenue representing nearly 70% of total COVID testing revenue in the period. As expected, international demand continued to moderate. Rounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses increased 1.5% compared to the prior year.\nIn Breast Health, global revenue of $271.1 million was down 16% as expected, primarily driven by chip supply shortages. For Q4, the impact to revenue from the chip supply shortage was in line with our prior guidance.\nIn Surgical, fourth quarter revenue of $133.3 million grew more than 11%. And excluding the Bolder acquisition, the business grew nearly 9%. We are very encouraged by another strong quarter from our surgical franchise as the momentum we saw in our fiscal third quarter continued into our fiscal fourth quarter. The division's results were again led by MyoSur influenced contributions from recent acquisitions.\nLastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $24 million increased approximately 4% compared to the prior year period.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 62.5% was ahead of our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base business in the period. Total operating expenses of $329.9 million in the fourth quarter decreased 6.6% compared to the prior year period. This decrease was driven by less spend within G&A and sales, partially offset by higher marketing and R&D expense.\nBelow operating income, other income was an expense of $3.1 million, less than anticipated, primarily due to gains associated with our foreign exchange hedging activities. Finally, our tax rate in Q4 was 21% as expected.\nPutting these pieces together, operating margin for Q4 came in at 27.9% and net margin was 21.8%, both ahead of our previous estimates. Non-GAAP net income finished at $207.5 million, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.82.\nMoving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $168.7 million in the fourth quarter. Based on a strong cash conversion, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance and sheet our leverage ratio was 0.2x. Our cash generation continues to be excellent, and our balance sheet remains a pillar of strength. Both positive attributes in any environment, but are especially valuable in cases of macro instability like we face today. And although we have continued to build cash, our M&A teams in each division remain active, and our funnel of potential tuck-in opportunities is robust.\nAs it relates to share repurchases, they remain an integral part of our capital deployment strategy moving forward. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for $175 million. Further, on September 22, our Board of Directors approved a new 5-year share repurchase authorization for up to $1 billion.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2023. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our first quarter guidance only excludes Bolder revenues from our organic base. Bolder becomes organic in our fiscal second quarter of 2023.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $940 million to $990 million. For all of fiscal 2023, we expect total revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $3.9 billion, significantly exceeding our pre-pandemic levels. This guidance assumes low double-digit organic revenue growth, excluding COVID in each division for the full year fiscal 2023.\nTo help with the constant currency modeling, we are assuming significant foreign exchange headwinds of slightly more than $30 million in the first quarter of 2023, and approximately $90 million for the full year. Please note that while we have taken a conservative view when considering the strength of the U.S. dollar, currency markets continue to be very unpredictable.\nIn terms of our divisions, we expect Breast Health, Surgical and Core Diagnostics, excluding the impact of COVID to grow low double digits for 2023.\nIn Diagnostics, we expect our molecular business to continue to drive growth. Our Panther continues to deliver incredible benefits for our customers through assay consolidation, scalability and automation. In this environment, where labor remains a scarce resource, our highly automated Panther is a tremendous value proposition. With nearly 20 assays on the menu, we are eager to capitalize on this great opportunity to increase utilization on our expanded installed base.\nFinally, as Steve mentioned, we now have approximately 3,250 Panters placed globally, placing more than 350 Panthers in fiscal 2022 and 49 units in Q4. Going forward, we will return to reporting Panther placements on an annual cadence.\nMoving to Breast Health. We are excited for the year ahead. Our customer base is hungry for our best-in-class thermography instrumentation. We continue to expect chip supply to gradually improve throughout 2023, and therefore, the division's revenue should increase throughout the year. And while we only have line of sight to allocations impacting revenue about 2 quarters out, we remain optimistic that the gantry business will exit fiscal 2023 at or near normalized levels.\nAs it relates to our guidance, we expect Breast Health revenue to be down low double digits in our first fiscal quarter of 2023 given that the prior year was not yet impacted by supply chain shortages. However, for the full year, our guidance assumes the Breast Health will grow low double digits, reflecting supply recovery as the year progresses.\nFinally, in Surgical, we expect more broad-based growth than ever before. We anticipate MyoSure will continue to drive growth, but also expect notable lift from our Fluent fluid management system as well as our laparoscopic portfolio of Acessa and Bolder.\nIn terms of COVID sales, consistent with prior messaging, we believe COVID could be 1 of our largest molecular assays over the long term. Having said that, given how quickly we've seen the pandemic change course, we believe it is still too early to accurately forecast an endemic state. As a result, we expect COVID assay sales to be $75 million in the first quarter of 2023 and $150 million for the full year. COVID related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the first quarter and $130 million for the full year.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage in the low 60s, and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be approximately 30%. Please note that we anticipate or COVID revenue, which is margin accretive, will be front-end loaded to the first half of 2023 to coincide with the fall and winter seasons in the U.S. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated inflationary pressures into our guidance as it relates to input costs. We foresee these higher costs persisting throughout 2023.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down compared to the prior year. While we will continue to invest in our business Marketing spend will be lower in fiscal '23 as our fiscal 2022 had several large onetime expense items, such as our Super Bowl commercial and higher spending for initiatives such as our WTA partnership.\nBelow operating income, we expect other expenses net to be around $20 million a quarter. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of approximately 19% and diluted shares outstanding are expected to be approximately $252 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 to $0.90 in the first quarter, and $3.30 to $3.60 for the year.\nTo conclude, let me wrap up by saying that our strong fourth quarter results once again exceeded our guidance despite the various macro headwinds. Performance was driven by exceptional growth in our Molecular Diagnostics and Surgical businesses, which we expect to continue. And while the future macro outlook remains uncertain with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties and a fortress balance sheet, we are well positioned to continue strong results in our fiscal 2023.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Cody, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded.\n(Operator Instructions)\nAnd I would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Cody. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Third Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur third quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them and a replay of this call will be available through August 26.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested Blood Screening business, and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic, CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Our results continue to showcase the strength, durability and diversity of our business. Total revenue was just over $1 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.95. Both numbers exceeded the midpoint of our guidance on the top and bottom lines. The result of both enduring COVID revenue and also strong performances in our core diagnostics and surgical businesses.\nIn this dynamic and ever-changing world, we continue to live our purpose, passion and promise to enable healthier lives everywhere, every day and be global champions for women's health. In doing so, our industry-leading products continue to reach even more patients around the world, while our business delivers strong financial performance and value for our shareholders. To put it simply, the durability and diversity of our business enables Hologic to succeed in this challenging macro environment. As we navigate a multitude of headwinds, our confidence in our business remains steady and remains high.\nLooking longer term, our message is also unchanged. We are confident despite the current turbulence, that our previously announced 5% to 7% annual organic revenue growth rate through 2025 remains an achievable target, provided the current chip headwind normalizes as we expect.\nAhead of turning the call over to Karleen to discuss our financial results in more detail, we'd like to highlight growth drivers and provide updates on each of our businesses: Diagnostics, Breast Health and Surgical. And to close, we are excited to share our experience from the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in May, an experience that reaffirms the importance of our place and our voice on the world stage advocating for women's health, especially now.\nBefore jumping into each division, it is important to revisit the impact of COVID on our business. The reality is that whether the demand for COVID testing is high or low, we are poised to succeed either way. We have a natural COVID hedge. As we have seen over the past 2 years, COVID prevalence affects each of our base businesses. As COVID cases rise, elective well-women exams, screenings and surgical procedures are often postponed. Conversely, as COVID declines, our base business strengthens. As we responded with unprecedented speed to answer the world's needs for highly reliable molecular COVID testing, we also dramatically strengthened our company for the future.\nWe also know that many of you are trying to gauge the longer-term impact and durability of our additional Panther placements as well as the impact of our various acquisitions over the last couple of years in Diagnostics and Surgical. The truth is, the various surges in COVID cases around the world through many of the last quarters have often created wide variability in the comps as some quarters reflect times of significant non-COVID-related hospital and doctor visit slowdowns, while others bounced back stronger in various varying geographies in any given quarter.\nWhen we last reported in April, for example, our core diagnostic and surgical businesses posted year-over-year growth rates of 4% and 3.5%, respectively amidst to the COVID surge at the time. But for anyone questioning these admittedly lower growth rates, we want to highlight 2 numbers from this quarter. The first number, 22.4%. That was the growth in our global molecular diagnostics business. And the second number, 9.7%, that was the growth in our Surgical business this quarter. Now we encourage 2 simple takeaways from these results: one, these businesses have strong underlying growth. And two, the true growth rate is somewhere in between last quarter's results and this quarter, underscoring the need to view how our strength evolves over time. And given the variability of COVID, that no single quarter result is going to match a linear model.\nNow shifting gears to the businesses. First, in Diagnostics. With COVID testing significantly down sequentially, our third quarter provided an opportunity for customers to validate and run more non-COVID assays on their Panther systems. As a result, our Diagnostics business grew 15%, excluding COVID, year-over-year worldwide, a truly phenomenal result and one that demonstrates the impact of women returning to their wellness exams and procedures. Even more impressive, as mentioned earlier, our Global Molecular Diagnostics business grew over 22%, excluding COVID in the period, an early yet clear sign that our expanded Panther installed base is, a, being utilized; and b, will prevail as an instrument of choice as customers consolidate their molecular testing menu to high throughput, high automation platforms.\nFor more color on the growth drivers within molecular diagnostics, performance was driven by a combination of both legacy and new assays, namely the BV/CV/TV vaginitis panel, Amgen, CT/NG and our respiratory menu on the Panther Fusion to name a few. Our vaginitis panel continues to outperform and deliver impressive growth on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. As we have previously stated, the vaginitis panel is well positioned to become a top 3 assay in our molecular diagnostic portfolio over time.\nInternational Diagnostics was also a bright spot in the quarter. The business grew 16.5%, excluding COVID, driven primarily by our virology portfolio. As expected, Panther placements slowed to 59 new systems placed in the quarter, with nearly 70% of these placed internationally. While a decline from the 119 and 123 systems placed in our first 2 quarters, annualizing Q3's placement lands within our historic run rate of about 225 to 250 placements per year.\nAs a reminder, Panther sales have minimal impact to the molecular diagnostics growth rate as assays are the primary driver of growth by far. Further, placements at lower levels going forward is consistent with our expectations, given we have increased our Panther footprint by nearly 85% since the start of the pandemic. We now have roughly 3,200 Panthers installed worldwide. To close out the diagnostics update, our Biotheranostics business, was again a highlight for the quarter, posting $18.9 million in sales, representing outstanding growth of 43%.\nMoving on to Breast Health. First and foremost, as to chip supply, we reiterate our statement from last quarter. We believe the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal 2022 will prove to be the low watermark in terms of chip availability for our gantries. Working closely with our suppliers, we observed positive trends in Q3. These positive trends include stabilizing lead times, procurement through a combination of channels and most importantly, narrowing the breadth and depth of tight supply. Although we remain optimistic these positive trends will maintain throughout the remainder of our fiscal year, this situation remains fluid.\nAs for gantries, demand remains strong. Our best-in-class technology service and customer satisfaction continues to differentiate and separate us from the competition. In addition, our sales force continues to place orders in line with quotas set prior to the chip headwind surfacing, and there has been no meaningful change to the rate of canceled orders. On the chip supply chain recovery, while we are not providing fiscal 2023 guidance on this call, we do anticipate that chip supply and thus gantry availability will be recovering throughout fiscal 2023 and continue into 2024.\nNext, in Surgical. The business returned to strong performance, posting 9.7% revenue growth in the third quarter. This growth was driven primarily by the combination of MyoSure, our Fluent fluid management system and Bolder. As a reminder, our MyoSure devices are used for fibroid and tissue removal and the Fluent system is complementary to MyoSure, assisting physicians with hysteroscopic procedures. The Fluent system simplifies and streamlines the historically complicated and cumbersome fluid management workflow used in these procedures. While MyoSure and Fluent sales represent the lion's share of surgical growth in the quarter, we are also very excited by the growth from our laparoscopic portfolio. Both the Acessa procedure and Bolder devices that we acquired to add growth and diversify the franchise performed well.\nSpecifically, we are excited by the incremental progress in sales of the Acessa procedure. Smaller numbers, but revenue growth of nearly 50% year-over-year, a meaningful step in increasing the utilization of this novel procedure. Acessa's growth was driven primarily by 2 factors: first, excellent efforts from our team to increase patient covered lives to 84% compared to 26% when we first acquired the business about 2 years ago. With this critical mass of covered lives, which is often considered table stakes by many physicians, more doors were opened. Second, growth was also driven by more physician access to conduct monitored cases. Access was both in person and also via our innovative virtual case monitoring platform. This virtual system was implemented specifically to address physician access challenges created by COVID. As the COVID pandemic moves gradually to an endemic state, and physician access improves, we are confident that Acessa will be a meaningful growth contributor going forward.\nAnd finally, as many of you know, in May, we had the opportunity to participate at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting held in Davos, Switzerland. At the forum, we met with world leaders and change makers to further our mission and champion women's health. Our message was clear; putting women's health at the forefront was long overdue. The time to elevate women's health with the help of science-backed data to guide decisions and policymaking is now. As we have said before, women's health is the cornerstone of families, communities, society and economies around the world with insights from our Hologic Global Women's Health Index, Project Healthy Equality and decades of leadership in women's health, we came to the forum to make a difference. We left the forum knowing we had. We understand change does not move in a straight line. and we are committed to supporting women every step of the way.\nBefore I turn the call over to Karleen to conclude, we want to repeat that our third quarter results give us even more confidence in the strength of our business. This confidence is rooted in our demonstrated ability to absorb and adapt to the pressures and headwinds of this dynamic macro environment. As the current pressures and headwinds subside over time, we are in a strong position to continue our durable growth trajectory for quarters and years to come.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone.\nWe are very pleased to share third quarter results that once again significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and non-GAAP EPS. Our third quarter financial performance highlights the strength of our core Diagnostics and Surgical businesses. both of which surpassed our long-term revenue target of 5% to 7% growth in the period. In our Breast Health business, although we continue to see headwinds related to semiconductor chip availability, as Steve mentioned, we remain optimistic that the supply environment will start to improve in our fiscal 2023.\nIn terms of COVID-19 testing, we continue to showcase our agility in responding to highly variable global demand. And while we continue to meet our customers' COVID testing needs, we also have delivered on robust demand for our non-COVID molecular diagnostics menu.\nFinally, cash flow generation in the third quarter was very strong, again coming in above pre-pandemic levels. As a result, our balance sheet remains an exceptional pillar of strength.\nMoving on, we will now provide more color on our financial results. In the third quarter, both top line performance and bottom-line profitability were well ahead of previous estimates. Total revenue came in just above $1 billion more than $100 million higher than the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95, $0.25 higher than the midpoint of our prior guide.\nTurning to our business results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $560.1 million declined 13.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay revenue related ancillaries and a small amount of revenue from discontinued products, worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 15%, a great result against a solid comp in the prior year. As a reminder, our organic results for fiscal Q3 2022 include Biotheranostics and Diagenode revenue as these transactions have now annualized.\nWithin Diagnostics, our molecular business was exceptionally strong in the fiscal third quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 molecular revenue grew over 22% organically in the period. Underlining this excellent result was strong utilization across our base molecular menu. As Steve highlighted, growth from our vaginitis panel led the way, while our virology portfolio also delivered strong performance. In addition, we saw stability in our core SDI menu in the period, affirming our leadership position in women's health diagnostics.\nWhile these diagnostics results include a small amount of residual demand from the adverse impact of COVID felt in the second quarter, our molecular franchise continues to be a key catalyst of our future growth. We are very encouraged to see customers transition additional menu onto our Panther system as COVID testing demand declines.\nAs it relates to our COVID results, we generated $173 million of COVID assay revenue in the quarter, exceeding our guidance of $100 million. We shipped about 8.1 million tests to customers reflecting a global ASP of approximately $21. Although ASP held steady this quarter, we still believe that pricing will eventually fall as reimbursements decline.\nIn terms of COVID assay revenue split by geography, domestic demand was strong, while international demand declined throughout the quarter. The U.S. COVID assay revenue represented approximately 60% of total COVID testing revenue in the period, a slip in geographic COVID demand versus the prior year, underscoring the variability of COVID revenue.\nRounding out Diagnostics, our cytology and perinatal businesses increased 3.5% compared to the prior year. This result is reflective of patients returning to their well-women's exams after postponing these important visits during periods of high COVID prevalence.\nIn Breast Health, global revenue of $282.8 million was down approximately 18% as expected, primarily driven by the chip supply shortages we have discussed over the past 6 months. Related to gantries, we performed slightly better than anticipated. While our acquisition of chips in the quarter met our expectations, we again delivered slight favorability through reclaiming, refurbishing and recertifying printed circuit boards from servicing our gantry installed base.\nMoving to Interventional Breast. The segment grew over 4% in our fiscal third quarter. This performance was driven by growth in Brevera disposable needles. Customers continue to see the benefit of Brevera's differentiated, efficient biopsy workflow, especially as their labor resources have become increasingly constrained.\nIn Surgical, third quarter revenue of $138.1 million, grew almost 10%. We are very pleased with the strong rebound in the business during the period as positive procedural trends exiting our second fiscal quarter continued through June.\nPowering this quarter's performance for Surgical was a nice lift for MyoSure and the related Fluent fluid management system plus Bolder.\nLastly, in our Skeletal business, as expected, revenue of $21.7 million decreased approximately 14% compared to the prior year period.\nNow let's move on to the breast of the non-GAAP P&L for the third quarter. Gross margin of 63.3% was ahead of our forecast driven by the higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volume and strong results in our base businesses in the period. Total operating expenses of $311.2 million in the third quarter increased less than 1% compared to the prior year. The increase in operating expenses was driven by spend within marketing and R&D, partially offset by less G&A and sales expense.\nHowever, when we normal the spending from Mobidiag and Bolder, operating expenses decreased 3% compared to the prior year. Finally, our tax rate in Q3 was 21% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q3 came in at 32.3% and net margin was 24.1%, both above pre-pandemic levels. Non-GAAP net income finished at $241.5 million and non-GAAP EPS was $0.95.\nMoving on from the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $330.6 million in the third quarter. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. Based on the strong operational performance, we had $2.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet and our leverage ratio was 0.2x. As we've previously stated, we are comfortable building our cash balance during this challenging macro backdrop.\nThat said, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our businesses. Finally, while there were no cash repurchases during the quarter, our share repurchase program remains an ongoing part of our capital deployment framework. So far this fiscal year, we have repurchased approximately 5.2 million shares for $367 million, a sizable outlay of funds.\nNow let's move on to our updated non-GAAP financial guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2022. As a reminder, our organic guidance excludes acquisition revenue until each deal annualizes. Therefore, our fourth quarter guidance only excludes Bolder revenues from our organic base. Given our strong third quarter performance, we are once again increasing our full year revenue and EPS guidance. For the full year, we now see total revenue in the range of $4.75 billion to $4.78 billion, an EPS of $5.79 to $5.84, representing an increase of $115 million on the top line and $0.26 on the bottom line compared to the midpoint of our previous guidance.\nWith only 1 quarter remaining in our fiscal year, this annual guidance implies revenue of $840 million to $870 million and EPS of $0.60 to $0.65 for our fiscal fourth quarter.\nWith respect to foreign exchange, given the unabated strength of the U.S. dollar, we are assuming an FX headwind of slightly more than $20 million in our fourth quarter of 2022, nearly $10 million higher than our prior guidance incorporated for the quarter. In terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $70 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $1.35 billion for the full year.\nCOVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be slightly less than $35 million in the fourth quarter and $215 million for the full year.\nAs it relates to the breast health chip shortage, although we had marginal improvement versus expectations in Q3, guidance on the gantry revenue shortfall for the fourth quarter remains unchanged from our prior messaging.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage in the high 30s to approximately 40%. Both estimates are well above pre-pandemic levels. Further, our Q4 guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall. As a reminder, gantry gross margins are accretive to the consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend to be in a position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated elevated costs into our Q4 guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. In terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be down a few million dollars sequentially. Below operating income, we expect other expenses net to be around $20 million in our fiscal fourth quarter.\nOur guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around 250 million for the full year. Finally, although we will update everyone on our fiscal 2023 guidance during our Q4 call next quarter, I would remind you that the headwinds related to higher input costs, the stronger U.S. dollar and increasing interest rates are unlikely to subside in the near term. Like many other companies, we expect these headwinds to continue into our fourth quarter and into our fiscal 2023.\nTo help offset these pressures as we do every quarter, we seek out efficiencies in our business and strategically manage pricing where we have the opportunity. Although these temporary challenges are not unique to Hologic, they are important to consider for modeling purposes.\nTo conclude, let me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong third quarter results, underpinned by exceptional growth in molecular diagnostics and a healthy rebound in our surgical business. We are also once again raising our financial guidance for the year. And although future macro outlook remains cloudy, with a natural hedge to future COVID uncertainties as well as an increasingly strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow, we are well positioned to continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Lauren, and I am your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan M. Simon\n\nVP of IR, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Lauren. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's Second Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur second quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website, along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through May 27.\nBefore we begin, we would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied. Such factors include those referenced in the safe harbor statement included in our earnings release and SEC filings.\nAlso during this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to GAAP can be found in our earnings release. Two of these non-GAAP measures are: one, organic revenue, which we define as constant currency revenue, excluding the divested blood screening business and revenue from acquired businesses owned by Hologic for less than 1 year; and two, organic revenue, excluding COVID-19, which excludes COVID-19 assay revenue, revenue related to COVID-19 and discontinued product sales in Diagnostics. Finally, any percentage changes we discuss will be on a year-over-year basis, and revenue growth rates will be in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\nNow I'd like to turn the call over to Steve MacMillan, Hologic's CEO.\n\nStephen P. MacMillan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We posted solid results overall and continued our excellent performance.\nTotal revenue was $1.44 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.07, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by over 12% on the top line and over 33% on the bottom. As we stated last quarter, we continue to deliver in an uncertain business environment. For example, in January, we saw COVID cases spike once again, putting pressure on health care utilization and certain elective procedures.\nThrough February and March, the ripple effect of the war in Ukraine added additional uncertainty to a world already facing headwinds from COVID, rising inflation and interest rates as well as ongoing global supply chain disruptions. In these challenging times, we continue to deliver.\nOur performance is a direct result of the planning and investments we made throughout the pandemic to strategically strengthen our business. We are a stronger Hologic through portfolio diversification, the addition of multiple growth drivers into our franchises and continued growth in our international businesses.\nToday, we'd like to provide additional color in 3 areas: first, we'll discuss Q2 growth in light of the macro environment, including updates on the breast health chip shortage we spoke to in Q1; second, provide progress on acquisitions turning organic in our third quarter; and third, highlight our additional efforts to lean into ESG and how our purpose, passion and promise are elevating women's health around the world.\nIn our second quarter, both our Diagnostics and Surgical divisions delivered organic growth, excluding COVID, while as expected, our Breast & Skeletal Health division declined. In Breast, as we discussed in our last call, the semiconductor chip shortage was the primary driver of the division's temporary decline. Encouragingly, underlying demand remains strong as measured by healthy orders and a growing backlog.\nAs we've seen during the last 2 years, as COVID testing rises, elective annual exams, screenings and GYN surgical procedures are often postponed. And as COVID testing declines, we see the opposite, and our base business returns. We believe what the latest rebound also makes clear is that demand for our products remains strong despite the unpredictability of COVID surges. We are confident in our business, confident in our people and excited about our positioning heading into the third quarter.\nFor example, in Diagnostics, we placed an additional 123 Panthers in the second quarter, surpassing first quarter placements of 119. Only halfway through the year, we have again exceeded our pre-pandemic average of roughly 225 Panther placements per year. This is a phenomenal result given the rapid global expansion of our Panther installed base during the pandemic. Our Panther installed base is now over 3,100 instruments worldwide with over 45% placed internationally.\nAlso in Diagnostics. Our vaginitis panel, BV/CV TV continues its growth trajectory. In our Q2 of 2021, this assay generated about $7 million for the quarter. 1 year later, the panel contributed almost $14 million in worldwide sales, nearly double the year before. And BV/CV TV is now on pace to become a top 3 women's health assay in our Molecular Diagnostics portfolio.\nNow let's provide an update on chip supply in Breast Health. Our supply chain service and commercial organizations have been working hard to gain greater visibility and mitigate the impact of the shortage. In Q2, the impact is slightly less than estimated driven by favorable availability and precise management of chips and circulation within our service inventory.\nWhile our teams continue to do a great job navigating the unpredictable supply challenges on chips, the ongoing volatility of supply makes it possible that up to $50 million in additional headwind could surface in the back half of the year. Despite this, we are still materially increasing guidance for the full company, which Karleen will speak to later on.\nTo finish the chip discussion on an upbeat note, we recently received notice of an increased allocation of chips for late in fiscal 2022. While this is very encouraging, given production and delivery timing, the benefit from this increase is unlikely to help revenue until early 2023. Said another way, we are optimistic the back half of our fiscal '22 will prove to be the low watermark in terms of available gantries.\nMoving on to an update on acquisitions, turning organic. In our fiscal third quarter, contributions from both Biotheranostics and Diagenode will be included in the organic growth of our Diagnostics division. We will provide an update on both today.\nFirst, Biotheranostics. As a reminder, we completed this acquisition in February of 2021. The goal of this acquisition was to enter the high-growth lab-based oncology market, an adjacent longtime area of interest and bring our resources and expertise to create an even stronger business.\nBased on Breast Cancer Index' earlier-than-anticipated inclusion in NCCN guidelines in January of 2021, the deal is off to a great start. Last year in its first full quarter post acquisition, Biotheranostics posted $13 million of revenue, which was more than 30% higher than their best quarter prior to the pandemic.\nFast forward to our most recent quarter. Biotheranostics generated $16.4 million in revenue. This early success comes as a result of outstanding engagement in a successful cross-functional cross-enterprise integration. As planned, we deployed Hologic resources and expertise and paired this with legacy Biotheranostics capabilities to refine operational efficiency and, most importantly, set a solid foundation for scalable growth.\nTo accelerate Biotheranostics already strong growth, as an example, we are streamlining the businesses ordering process, which we believe will simplify things for the customer. We expect this enhancement will greatly improve the customer experience and ultimately result in more orders. We are also excited to share that we are in the process of transferring Biotheranostics operations to our diagnostics headquarters in San Diego.\nWhile maintaining required division between CLIA and IVD activities, we believe the move will lead to an even more unified culture, stronger relationships between counterparts and more collaborative efforts. Finally, and even more encouraging, just last week, the Biotheranostics BCI test was included in the American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines, another major step towards increasing utilization and recognition of BCI as the standard of care. BCI is now the only genomic test in both NCCN and ASCO guidelines for predicting benefit of extended endocrine therapy.\nMoving on. Shortly after we closed the Biotheranostics transaction, we acquired Diagenode based in Belgium. The goal of the acquisition was to accelerate PCR-based assay development for our Panther Fusion and leverage additional R&D capabilities in Europe. So far, we have checked both boxes.\nSince the close of the acquisition, as planned, we have integrated the Diagenode organization to optimize the speed and efficiency of our global R&D organization, enabling more effective and more efficient cross-border innovation.\nTo date, teams from San Diego and Belgium have worked together closely to improve processes and clearly define a robust product development pipeline. The team is already making meaningful progress towards approval of 2 viral load assays, which will expand our virology portfolio in the transplant testing space.\nOverall, for both Biotheranostics and Diagenode, we are pleased with the integration and progress of these 2 businesses. As we look forward, we are excited by the opportunity to unlock more synergies from both and, in turn, create more value for our shareholders.\nShifting gears, I'd like to close by highlighting 2 very meaningful and opportunistic marketing efforts from our second quarter. The first being our Super Bowl commercial, which also ran during the Winter Olympics. And the second, our title sponsorship of the Women's Tennis Association Tour.\nAs many of you may have seen, our television commercial titled, Her Health is Her Wealth, featured Mary J. Blige. The commercial highlighted that despite her busy life, she makes time in her schedule for her annual health exams. The campaign came at a critical time as an alarming number of women missed annual breast and cervical cancer screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn January, the inaugural results of our Hologic Global Women's Health Index found that nearly 50% of women ages 16 to 54 had not seen a medical professional in the prior year. The purpose of our message was to encourage women to schedule their annual exams and prioritize their health. Detecting cancer early is critical and can often make the difference between a curable and noncurable prognosis.\nAfter 2 years of the pandemic, with too many women not being screened, and our unique relationship with Mary J. Blige, there was no better time and no better stage for us to encourage more win to see their doctors.\nOur second effort is our landmark title sponsorship of the WTA Tour announced in early March. This alliance was forged to make significant progress on our shared vision of greater wellness and equality for women. The partnership has global reach and will emphasize the importance of preventive care through well-woman visits. We are proud to stand with the WTA as we work together to jointly raise the profile of women and share the importance of early detection and treatment.\nBefore turning the call over to Karleen, let me conclude by saying that the results of this quarter demonstrate our business as both durable and resilient, and the demand for our products is exceptionally strong. Despite multiple macro headwinds, we continue to deliver strong results. We are both excited and confident in our business and see great opportunity to be even stronger in the years ahead.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share our second quarter results that significantly exceeded our guidance for both revenue and EPS. Our second quarter performance once again highlights the strength of our diverse business.\nWhile the Omicron variant negatively impacted our base businesses early in the quarter, our COVID testing upside more than offset this headwind. It's also important to understand that our balance sheet is stronger than ever, providing key strategic flexibility in this uncertain macro environment. Further, we continue to generate very healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities.\nIn the second quarter, we generated significant operating cash flow and executed $200 million of share repurchase, both of which I'll touch on in more detail shortly. Before we do that, we will provide color on our consolidated and divisional results for the second quarter. As a reminder, revenue in our fiscal second quarter is typically seasonally lower compared to our first quarter, which benefits from increased patient activity before calendar year-end.\nIn the quarter, total revenue of over $1.4 billion was very strong, and came in more than $150 million higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. In addition, EPS of $2.07 in the second quarter far exceeded our guidance range of $1.50 to $1.60.\nTurning to our divisional results. In Diagnostics, global revenue of $987.1 million declined 5.6% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID, worldwide organic diagnostics revenue increased 4%. As discussed, the division's results early in Q2 were negatively impacted by the Omicron COVID-19 variant.\nOur base diagnostics business is inversely correlated to spikes in the pandemic as women tend to postpone office visits when COVID cases surge. However, we were encouraged by improving trends throughout March as COVID cases declined. This gives us great confidence in the underlying health of our base diagnostics franchise.\nMoving specifically to our Molecular Diagnostics business, we will again exclude the impact of COVID. Making these adjustments, base molecular revenue grew about 7% organically in the second quarter. This growth was driven by strong uptake in newer assays such as our vaginitis panel and menu within our virology product line. As it relates to our COVID results, we generated $584 million of COVID assay revenue, far exceeding our guidance of $400 million. We shipped about 28.5 million tests to customers as ASPs held steady around $20 per test globally. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue. However, testing demand was strong in international markets as well.\nRounding out Diagnostics, our Cytology & Perinatal businesses were essentially flat compared to the prior year as these segments were also impacted by COVID-19's influence on women's wellness visits.\nIn Breast Health, global revenue of $310.4 million was down approximately 7% as expected primarily driven by the chip shortages that we have discussed.\nIn our interventional business, incremental supply chain pressure of a few million dollars surfaced during the quarter, specific to our disposable biopsy needles. As a result, our interventional business was down slightly less than 1% in the period. While supply chain challenges persist, demand for our best-in-class Breast Health products remain strong. And as Steve commented, we expect to see improvement in 2023.\nIn Surgical, second quarter revenue of $117.3 million grew 3.5%. As we foreshadowed during our first quarter call, the Omicron variant caused a pullback in elective procedures in the first half of the quarter. But this trend improved later in the period as COVID cases declined. Furthermore, we saw a nice resilience from several of our newer products such as the Fluent Fluid Management System and solid contributions from Bolder's CoolSeal devices.\nLastly, in our Skeletal business, revenue of $20.9 million decreased 6% compared to the prior year period.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the non-GAAP P&L for the second quarter. Gross margin of 71% was well ahead of our forecast driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 testing volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of $338.2 million increased 22% in the second quarter.\nAs we have done throughout the pandemic, given the benefit from COVID-19 profitability, we took the opportunity to reinvest in our base businesses. We also allocated spend to key marketing initiatives to help drive awareness for women's health. For example, second quarter operating expenses included our Super Bowl and Olympic commercials as well as expenses associated with our WTA partnership. The combined total of these initiatives contribute slightly more than $25 million to operating expenses in the quarter. In addition, within operating expenses, recent acquisitions added slightly less than $35 million in the quarter, about $25 million higher than the prior year period.\nFinally, our tax rate in Q2 was 20.5%, marginally lower than our expectations given the higher COVID-19 revenue outside the United States. Putting these pieces together, operating margin for Q2 came in well above our forecast at 47.4% and net margin was very strong at 36.5%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $524.2 million and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.07, nearly 35% above the midpoint of our prior guidance.\nMoving on to the P&L. Cash flow from operations was $1.06 billion in the second quarter, inclusive of tax refunds totaling approximately $418 million related to the sale of our previously held Medical Aesthetics business in 2020. When normalizing for these refunds, cash generation for the quarter was still exceptional. These robust cash flows continue to provide tremendous financial and strategic flexibility.\nFor example, as referred to earlier, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our stock for $200 million in the quarter. We continue to view our ongoing share repurchase program as a lever to drive value for our shareholders. Further, we continue to diligently pursue M&A opportunities in each one of our divisions.\nBased on our strong operational performance, we had $2.3 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the second quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.3x. Our capital structure is fortified. And while we ended the quarter with an elevated cash balance, we continue to be thorough and exercise discipline as we evaluate opportunities. Given the macro environment, we have comfort with our elevated cash balance and the ability to be patient as we identify high-quality opportunities.\nNow let's move on to our updated guidance for the third quarter and full year fiscal 2022. In the third quarter, we expect to continue our track record of delivering strong financial results with total revenue in the range of $875 million to $915 million. For the full year fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $175 million at the midpoint.\nWe are raising guidance once again in the face of an uncertain macro backdrop, highlighting our confidence in our business. Given the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and to aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $20 million in the third quarter of 2022 and $65 million for the full year. This FX unfavorability to revenue is higher than our guidance from last quarter.\nIn Diagnostics, we expect molecular to continue to drive growth based on our Panther installed base of over 3,100 instruments globally, over 80% larger than the start of the pandemic. We are also seeing encouraging uptake of our newer assays like our vaginitis panel, virals and Amgen as well as the tremendous international expansion opportunities.\nIn terms of COVID sales, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $100 million in the third quarter of 2022 and approximately $1.25 billion for the full year. COVID-related items, inclusive of a small amount of discontinued product revenue are expected to be approximately $35 million in the third quarter and $215 million for the full year.\nIn Breast Health, our organic and inorganic investments continue to perform well and highlight the diversity of the division's revenue streams. For example, Brevera had another great result, growing mid-teens in the last quarter. In addition, recurring service revenue represented more than 40% of total sales in Q2.\nIn terms of the Breast Health chip shortage announced last quarter, given significant uncertainties still exist in the chip market the possibility of an incremental $50 million headwind in the back half of 2022 exists, and we have incorporated this into our guidance. While we are seeing early signs of improvement in chip supply, we are forecasting conservatively. To reemphasize, this headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand, which remains strong.\nFinally, in Surgical, we feel great about the trajectory of our business as COVID trends improve. MyoSure and related organic products such as Fluent continue to drive near-term growth, and we expect meaningful contribution from both Acessa and Bolder over the next several years.\nAs a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after a deal annualizes as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. In terms of the deal, Biotheranostics and Diagenode will become part of our organic revenue in Q3 '22. Therefore, the organic revenue adjustments for Q3 includes Mobidiag and Bolder. And for Q4, Bolder only.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our non-GAAP gross margin percentage to be in the mid- to high 60s and our non-GAAP operating margin percentage to be in the high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. Further, our second half guidance incorporates the margin impact from our Breast Health supply chain revenue shortfall.\nAs a reminder, gantry gross margin is accretive to the consolidated averages, and we have maintained operating spend in order to be in a position to move quickly once we receive chips. In addition, we have again incorporated inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite these headwinds, for the full year, we expect both gross and operating margins to be above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021, but be lower in the second half of 2022 compared to the first half. As we have continued to highlight, in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest for future growth.\nBelow operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on effective tax rate of 21% and diluted shares outstanding of around 255 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $0.67 to $0.72 in the third quarter and $5.45 to $5.65 for the full year, 10% above our prior guidance at the midpoint.\nAs you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic-related supply chain challenges and geopolitical conflicts remain high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporates both potential upsides and downsides.\nLet me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong second quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also raising our financial guidance for the year even as we are increasing anticipated supply chain headwinds, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises and benefits from COVID testing. With a strong balance sheet and best-in-class cash flow generation, we are well positioned.\nWith that, we ask the operator to open the call for questions."

My name is Ron, and I'm your operator for today's call. Today's conference is being recorded. (Operator Instructions)\nI would now like to introduce Ryan Simon, Vice President, Investor Relations, to begin the call.\n\nRyan Simon\n\nThank you, Ron. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Hologic's First Quarter Fiscal 2022 Earnings Call. With me today are Steve MacMillan, the company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karleen Oberton, our Chief Financial Officer.\nOur first quarter press release is available now on the Investors section of our website along with an updated corporate presentation. We will also post our prepared remarks to our website shortly after we deliver them. And a replay of this call will be available through March 4.\nBefore we begin, I would like to inform you that certain statements we make today will be forward-looking. These statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied.

MacMillan\n\nChairman, CEO & President, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Ryan, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to discuss our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Once again, our results are strong. We are off to a great start in all divisions with Diagnostics, Breast and Skeletal Health and Surgical each delivering more than 8% global organic growth, excluding COVID revenue.\nFor the quarter, revenue was $1.47 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share were $2.17. Both numbers significantly exceeded the high end of our guidance by 28% on the top line and 74% on the bottom.\nOver the last several quarters and most recently at the JPMorgan conference, we've been communicating 3 major themes. First, our base business is stronger with more diverse growth drivers than ever before. Second, as the COVID pandemic remains, we continue to help meet the world's testing needs and generate financial upside. And third, because of the first 2 points, we are well positioned to generate strong results regardless of how various uncertainties evolve from the pandemic to supply chain challenges to health care utilization. In other words, you can count on us to deliver in today's uncertain business environment.\nThese themes are certainly playing out as we look at our first quarter results and our dramatically improved outlook for the fiscal year. Our base businesses are performing well, and we are making a massive difference against COVID. As a result, we are raising our revenue and earnings guidance significantly as we expect upside from COVID-19 testing, along with strength in our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses to more than compensate for temporary supply chain challenges that have emerged in our Breast Health business.\nAs we shared at JPMorgan, we are a fundamentally different company than 8 years ago. Now more than ever before, Hologic has more diverse and higher-margin recurring revenue across each division in each geography around the world. Our strong performance is a result of execution against our strategic plan and has been accelerated by our financial success during the pandemic. As evidenced by our Q1 results, we are well positioned for long-term sustainable growth regardless of the direction the pandemic may turn.\nWhile we can't predict the future path of COVID, we'd like to expand today on what we do know, that Hologic is emerging from this pandemic a much stronger company. More specifically, we will focus on what we know in each division that gives us clear confidence in our ability to maintain sustained growth over the long term.\nFirst, in our Diagnostics division, we know that our huge industry-leading installed base of automated high-throughput Panther systems along with our robust menu of 19 assays across Panther and Panther Fusion will drive strong growth well into the future. Today, our Panther installed base is over 3,000 units, 75% larger than prior to the pandemic, with almost half of these placed internationally.\nOf note, demand for our Panthers is still strong globally. We placed well over 100 Panthers in the first quarter alone, more than double our pace prior to the pandemic. At this stage in the pandemic, this clearly indicates that customers expect to use these systems for non-COVID testing.\nUtilization of our Panther systems is also strong. We are seeing clear signs that customers are leveraging our menu of 19 assays on our significantly expanded Panther footprint. First and foremost, the growth of molecular diagnostic sales reflects this growing utilization. For Q1, our core molecular diagnostics franchise grew 14% worldwide, excluding COVID revenues, product discontinuations as well as recent M&A activity.\nNow we know a question on some people's minds is, will these Panthers be used post pandemic. The answer is an emphatic yes based on the following: First, nearly 90% of U.S. COVID customers are already running at least one other assay. This speaks to our customers being bonafide molecular diagnostics players who are invested in molecular testing for the long haul and who we expect will adopt more of our assays over time. And second, the incredible automation and workflow simplicity of the Panther, which dramatically minimizes labor activity and costs.\nIn a labor restricted world, our customers realize the enormous advantage of our Panther system.\nExtending and broadening the adoption of our portfolio of assays is a fundamental element of the diagnostic growth strategy. Our sales teams have done a tremendous job winning strategic accounts, strengthening our relationship with customers and fueling our razor-razorblade business model with both legacy women's health tests and new assays.\nAs an example, leveraging our leadership in women's health, our vaginitis panel is off to a great start with $13 million of revenue in the first quarter, roughly 2.5x the first quarter of 2021. We are extremely proud of the panel success and believe this will be our most successful diagnostic launch ever, COVID aside.\nIn Q1, we also once again responded to our customers' COVID testing needs and generated significant financial upside. We posted $523 million in COVID assay sales, over $300 million more than our outlook and consensus.\nClearly, COVID is sticking around longer than anyone would like. And just as clearly, highly accurate molecular testing continues to play a major role in fighting the pandemic. We continue to believe COVID testing will contribute materially to our business for the foreseeable future and we remain prepared to meet ongoing demand globally.\nSecond, shifting to our Breast and Skeletal Health business. We know that broadening across the continuum of breast health care from screening and diagnosis through surgery and treatment has transformed this franchise from a once capital-dependent business to a division with more diverse higher growth recurring revenue.\nIn the first quarter, the Breast Health business grew 8.4% as we've maintained our high market share and continue to grow our installed base of Genius 3D Mammography systems. The attachment rate of service on this gantry base continues to remain strong at more than 80%, making service one of our largest top line contributors company-wide. And we continue to upgrade our installed base with high-margin software and AI.\nThe mammography capital business is and will continue to be a meaningful and foundational part of our breast business going forward. In addition, we've built a solid adjacent portfolio of more recurring interventional breast surgery products that is driving the growth of the division. These interventional products include markers, needles, including those used in our Brevera biopsy system, and handheld devices.\nSales are more recurring in nature with higher projected growth compared to the legacy Capital business. As a point of reference, today, the gantry business is only 23% of Breast Health revenue compared to 29% in 2014, and interventional sales have grown to roughly the same size as gantry revenue. We expect the interventional business to continue its growth and further transform our Breast and Skeletal division going forward.\nThe increasing diversity of our breast business will help us offset supply chain challenges that have emerged recently, specifically shortages of computer chips in our mammography and other imaging systems. Our updated guidance incorporates a temporary but meaningful revenue headwind for the balance of our fiscal year.\nDespite this, as Karleen will discuss, we are raising our revenue and EPS guidance significantly based on outperformance in COVID, core molecular and Surgical.\nNow shifting gears to Surgical. We know that the diversification of the business will drive growth. Despite pandemic headwinds, the division grew 8.2% in the first quarter, and we continued to solidify our market-leading positions for NovaSure and MyoSure. With the addition of the Acessa procedure and the close of the Bolder acquisition in late November, our Surgical business has a very different profile today with more growth engines than ever. Acessa revenue in Q1 was nearly 3x a year ago, and the Bolder integration is off to a great start as we are already seeing Bolder sales through the Hologic Surgical sales team.\nThe recent launch of NovaSure Version 5 developed in-house is also seeing good traction. It's early days, but we are seeing a lot of excitement in the field around this product. We are committed to maintaining our leadership position in this space with best-in-class products.\nFurther, the Fluent Fluid Management System also developed in-house is used to streamline the complexities of fluid management in hysteroscopic procedures. Fluent is another great example of organic innovation driving future growth.\nFourth and finally, we know that our international business will be a consistent contributor of growth for years to come. We are no longer the export business of prior years. Through organic growth and M&A, we are direct in more regions than ever before, especially in Breast Health, with our feet firmly on the street and engaged with customers.\nIn Q1, the international business achieved nearly 13% organic growth, excluding COVID, and we expect strong growth to continue. With the leaders we have in place today, we are confident the foundation we've laid and the progress we've made will yield strong results for many years to come.\nTo add additional perspective, there are over 3.9 billion women in the world with only about 170 million of them in the United States, which is our largest market today. Clearly, we have an opportunity to impact more lives and more women around the world. Through our groundbreaking initiatives like the Hologic Global Women's Health Index, in conjunction with the opportunity we've earned as leaders in the fight against COVID, we are connecting with world leaders and change makers to elevate women's health around the world.\nIn summary, our first quarter results and improved outlook demonstrate that Hologic is much different and much stronger business than ever before, stronger through diversification and stronger from our leadership in COVID molecular testing. These factors are generating exceptional cash flows and a pristine balance sheet that are especially valuable in the midst of uncertain market conditions.\nAs we've done for the duration of this pandemic, we are confident in our ability to manage our business through various uncertainties and continue to deliver strong growth regardless of how external conditions evolve. What is clear to us at Hologic is that we are poised to continue our strong growth. Whether COVID wanes or continues, we have fundamentally changed our business into one with more growth drivers and more recurring revenue across all geographies. This gives us the clear confidence that we can navigate change and continue to generate exceptional financial results.\nWith that, let me turn the call over to Karleen.\n\nKarleen M. Oberton\n\nCFO, Hologic, Inc.\n\nThank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to share first quarter results that have significantly exceeded our guidance on both the top line and bottom line. Our first quarter highlights an improving base business that grew 9% organically, excluding COVID-19 revenues.\nAs Steve mentioned, our diversified business model is paying off. Each of our franchises, excluding COVID, grew more than 8% in the quarter, broadly exceeding our long-term revenue growth target of 5% to 7%. It is also important to note that our base business strength occurred in a quarter that started with the Delta wave and ended with COVID cases surging due to Omicron.\nTotal revenues for the quarter of $1.47 billion showcased strength in every business and was significantly ahead of our previous guidance. EPS of $2.17 in the first quarter far surpassed our initial guidance range of $1.15 to $1.25.\nWe also continue to generate healthy free cash flow, funding our capital deployment priorities of tuck-in M&A and share repurchases. We believe our balance sheet is a significant advantage in times of market uncertainty, which I'll touch on shortly.\nBefore I do that, let me provide some detail on our divisional revenue results, provide clarity on our performance. I will exclude the impact of COVID-19 where applicable.\nIn Diagnostics, global revenue of $950.4 million declined 15.2% compared to the prior year. However, excluding COVID assay sales, related ancillary items and a small level of discontinued products, worldwide Diagnostics revenue increased just over 10%.\nTo better understand the underlying performance of our non-COVID molecular business, I will again exclude COVID-19 benefits. By doing this, base molecular revenue grew about 14% organically in the first quarter. The growth was driven by strong execution across our global portfolio as our largest non-COVID assay, chlamydia and gonorrhea was above prepandemic levels. Our newer vaginitis panel contributed well ahead of last year's run rate. And internationally, we continue to see strong demand for our Panther instrumentation.\nFor perspective, our annual molecular business, excluding COVID, is now more than $100 million larger than before the pandemic. As it relates to our COVID-19 results, we continue to forecast conservatively but act aggressively behind the scenes to meet demand for our customers.\nIn the quarter, we generated $523 million of COVID assay revenue and shipped about 26 million tests to our customers. The United States represented about 60% of total COVID assay revenue although demand was high around the world.\nRounding out Diagnostics, cytology and perinatal grew 5% compared to the prior year, a nice result that was also above 2019 levels.\nIn Breast Health, global revenue of $359.3 million grew more than 8%. This growth was driven by our Interventional business as Steve highlighted, which was up nearly 20% in the quarter. Breast Imaging and Service also increased mid-single digits in the period, underscoring resilience in the face of COVID headwinds.\nOur strategy to diversify and increase recurring revenue continues to pay off. In Surgical, first quarter revenue of $134.3 million grew 8%. This solid performance was driven by a nice rebound in NovaSure from the launch of our next-generation B5 system as well as momentum from new products such as Fluent and Acessa. While our surgical business was impacted by pullbacks in electric procedures, the impact was minimal in the quarter. We continue to stay close to our customers, monitoring the Omicron surge in related staffing issues, which we do expect to be a headwind in Q2.\nLastly, our Skeletal business had revenue of $27.1 million, increased 10% compared to the prior year period.\nNow let's move on to the rest of the P&L for the first quarter. Gross margin of 72.1% significantly beat our forecast, driven by higher-than-expected COVID-19 test volumes in the period. Total operating expenses of $333.9 million increased 22% in the first quarter but were down 5% sequentially compared to Q4.\nWe continue to reinvest for future growth with incremental spending in R&D and marketing, pulling forward initiatives given the benefit from COVID-19. Further, within our operating expenses, the inclusion of recent acquisitions accounted for a spend of approximately $30 million in Q1, and we also made additional charitable donations in the quarter.\nFinally, our non-GAAP tax rate in Q1 was 21.5% as expected. Putting these pieces together, operating margin came in well above our forecast at 49.4% and net margin was a very strong 37.7%. Non-GAAP net income finished at $554.7 million, and non-GAAP earnings per share was $2.17, nearly 75% above the top end of our prior guidance.\nMoving on, cash flow from operations was $564 million in the first quarter, a very strong result which was more than 100% of non-GAAP net income. These robust cash flows continue to give us tremendous financial and strategic flexibility. For example, in the quarter, we repurchased 2.3 million shares of our stock for $167 million and closed the acquisition of Bolder Surgical for $160 million.\nWe continue to evaluate M&A that strategically fits well within our existing sales channels or the near adjacency. Based on our strong operational performance, we had $1.4 billion of cash on our balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, and our leverage ratio was 0.6x. Our capital structure is as strong as it has ever been. And we intend to deploy our excess cash on division-led acquisitions as well as share repurchases that improve our top and bottom line growth rates. For example, we have been buying shares under our 10b5-1 plan within our second fiscal quarter to take advantages of market volatility. Finally, ROIC was 29.4% on a trailing 12-month basis, an increase of 270 basis points compared to the prior year.\nBefore we discuss our increased guidance for the second quarter and full year fiscal 2022, I want to mention a few key points. Although the pandemic remains highly uncertain, we believe we are well positioned either way it may turn. Should there be future outbreaks, we will meet our customers' need and generate additional COVID testing revenue, or should the pandemic subside, we expect strong performance in our base businesses. We believe we are nicely hedged against macro and market volatility.\nAs it relates to supply chain headwinds, these challenges have become more specific in recent weeks. Due to the lack of available chips, we expect a temporary shortage of supply that will lengthen delivery time lines for Mammography Capital in our Breast Health division.\nWhile we hope to mitigate these effects, for conservatism, we are estimating around $200 million of revenue will be pushed out of fiscal 2022. This includes up to $50 million headwind in our second quarter as we are proactively beginning to extend lead times of new units to preserve inventory and maintain service continuity for gantries already in the field. This headwind is purely a supply issue and not one of underlying demand, which remains strong.\nDespite the supply shortage, we are significantly increasing our full year revenue outlook. Underscoring the evolution of our diversified business model, we expect our Diagnostics and Surgical businesses along with COVID contributions to more than offset remarkable headwinds.\nNow let me move on to our specific guidance. In the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect very strong financial results again with total revenue in the range of $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion. As a reminder, our Q2 revenue is usually seasonally lower than Q1. For all of fiscal 2022, we expect total revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.55 billion, significantly exceeding our prior full year guidance by $600 million at the midpoint.\nGiven the recent strength of the U.S. dollar and to aid with constant currency modeling, we are assuming foreign exchange headwinds of approximately $23 million in the second quarter of 2022 and $56 million for the full year.\nIn Diagnostics, molecular continues to be the growth engine based on our larger Panther installed base of over 3,000 instruments globally. Further, we are seeing encouraging uptake of new assays like our vaginitis panel as well as tremendous international expansion opportunities and a rebound in our core STI assays. As a result, for fiscal 2022, we expect our base diagnostics franchise inclusive of cytology and perinatal to grow high single digits.\nIn Breast Health, our organic and inorganic investments continue to perform well. For example, Brevera is off to a great start in 2022, growing in the high-teens for the quarter. Further, recurring service revenue represents approximately 40% of total sales in Q1.\nFinally, in Surgical, we expect MyoSure to continue to drive growth with help from better NovaSure performance. In addition, we expect new products and the recent acquisitions of Acessa and Bolder to add momentum to an already fast-growing franchise. Like base Diagnostics, we expect Surgical to grow our long-term organic guidance -- grow above, I'm sorry, our long-term organic guidance for fiscal 2022.\nIn terms of COVID assay sales, the only certainty is that no one really knows how demand will progress for the rest of the year. Therefore, as we have done for the past several quarters, we are forecasting conservatively and will act aggressively. With that in mind, we expect COVID assay sales to be at least $400 million in the second quarter of 2022 and at least $1 billion for the full year.\nCOVID-related items, including revenue from discontinued products in Diagnostics, are expected to be approximately $50 million in the second quarter and $190 million for the full year.\nAs a reminder, our organic guidance backs out of revenue from acquisitions until the first full quarter after the deals annualize as well as revenue from our divested blood screening business. We expect blood screening revenue of $5 million to $6 million in Q2 and $20 million to $25 million for the full year. In total, we are backing out roughly $110 million of inorganic revenue for the year.\nTo appreciate the underlying growth of our business, it is important to back out of organic revenue COVID assay sales related ancillary items and a small amount of discontinued product revenue in diagnostics. On this measure, and excluding the previously mentioned supply chain headwinds in Breast Health, we expect the rest of Hologic to grow at least at the high end of our 5% to 7% long-term guidance.\nMoving down the P&L. For the full year, we forecast our gross margin percentages in the mid-60s and our operating margin percentage to be in the mid- to high 30s. Both estimates are higher than our guidance last quarter. We expect both percentages to decline sequentially throughout the year, consistent with our conservative planning that most COVID demand will occur in the first half.\nIn addition, we have incorporated additional inflationary supply chain costs into our guidance as it relates to electronics, plastics and logistics. Despite this, for the full year, both gross and operating margins should be well above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn terms of operating expenses, we expect spending to be up compared to 2021 but declined sequentially in the back half of the year. As we've continued to highlight in quarters with higher COVID testing revenue, we will take the opportunity to invest more for future growth.\nBelow operating income, we expect other expenses net to be a little less than $25 million a quarter for the remainder of the year. Our guidance is based on an effective tax rate of 21.5% and diluted shares outstanding of around 256 million for the full year. All this nets out to expected EPS of $1.50 to $1.60 in the second quarter, well above current consensus estimates and $4.90 to $5.20 for the full year, 36% above our prior guidance at the midpoint.\nAs you update your forecast, let me remind you that macro uncertainty due to the pandemic and related supply chain challenge is still high. We would therefore encourage you to model at the middle of our ranges, which incorporate both potential upsides and downsides.\nLet me wrap up by saying that Hologic posted very strong first quarter results that far exceeded expectations and guidance. We are also significantly raising our financial guidance for the year, highlighting the multiple growth drivers we have added to each of our franchises and the upside to our business from capturing demand for COVID testing. With organic investments, multiple acquisitions and additional financial flexibility for capital deployment, we are a much stronger company than 2 years ago and well positioned to prosper in the face of various uncertainties.\nWith that, I will ask the operator to open the call for questions.
